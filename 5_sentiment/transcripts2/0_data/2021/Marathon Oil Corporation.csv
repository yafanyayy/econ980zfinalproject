I want to start by once again thanking our employees and contractors for their resilience and dedication as we continue to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic as critical essential infrastructure providers. The safety and health of our people remains front and center to everything we do. 
Just this past week, many of our team, particularly here in Texas, also navigated multiple days without power or running water amidst a generational winter storm and did so without incident. I'm truly proud of our people and their perseverance. They have risen to the challenge again and again. The execution excellence I have the privilege of discussing today is the product of their outstanding work. 
While 2020 was a challenging and unprecedented year for our industry, we focused on those elements of our business within our control and delivered results that speak for themselves. But for Marathon, it not just about results, but how we achieve those results. First and foremost, I'm especially proud of our second consecutive year of record safety performance as measured by total recordable incident rate despite the challenges associated with the pandemic and the dramatic shifts in our activity levels throughout the year in response to commodity price volatility. The safety of our people will always be my top priority. 
During 2020, the company also made significant progress in improving environmental performance, achieving an estimated 20% reduction to its GHG emissions intensity relative to 2019 and improving total gas capture to approximately 98.5% for the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Beyond maintaining safe and environmentally sound operations, our primary focus in 2020 was threefold: reduce and optimize our capital program in response to commodity price volatility, continue to lower our cost structure, and protect our investment-grade balance sheet and generate free cash flow. Today, I'm pleased to highlight comprehensive success across all elements of our 2020 playbook. 
First, we reduced and optimized our capital program to navigate unprecedented commodity price volatility. Our 2020 capital expenditures totaled $1.16 billion, below our most recent guidance of $1.2 billion on tremendous execution and at more than 50% below our original capital budget for the year. 
We dramatically reduced our well costs during 2020, the continuation of a long-standing trend due to a combination of optimized well design, execution efficiency, supply chain optimization and commercial leverage. Average completed well cost per lateral foot was down 20% year-on-year in 2020 with fourth quarter down approximately 35% from the 2019 average. We expect the vast majority of these well cost reductions to prove durable. 
Second, we continued our multiyear trend of successful lowering our cost structure. Early in 2020, we took aggressive and decisive action in response to the challenging environment. The end result was a year-on-year reduction of over 20% to both our production costs and our general and administrative costs, exceeding the initial cost reduction targets we set last year. Both our U.S. and international segments achieved record low unit cost in 2020. 
Finally, we protected our investment-grade balance sheet and maintained our focus on free cash flow. Our collective actions in 2020 culminated in just under $280 million of free cash flow generation for the full year, including about $160 million during the fourth quarter with oil production flat sequentially and with WTI average only $42 per barrel. 
Funded entirely by free cash flow, we returned around $250 million back to our investors in 2020, consistent with our multiyear return of capital track record. This included $150 million of share buybacks and dividends, including our reinstated base dividend during fourth quarter as well as $100 million of gross debt reduction, consistent with our objective to continue improving our balance sheet. We also proactively reduced our November 2022 debt maturity by half or $500 million. 
Ultimately, we successfully responded to the supply/demand crisis in 2020 and further optimized and enhanced our business model. In addition to pulling all the necessary levers to manage through the crisis, we dramatically improved our resilience and our ability to generate robust financial outcomes in a lower and more volatile commodity price environment in the future. 
We have, therefore, entered 2021 on firm footing. And while commodity prices have surprised to the upside to start this year, we have no doubt that oil and gas prices will remain volatile. We fully understand that this is a cyclical business, that we are price takers and not price predictors and that the range of potential outcomes for supply/demand balances remains wide. The market remains well supplied with nascent demand overjust emerging from the pandemic crisis. 
As I often remind our team, we can't control the macro, and we certainly can't predict the oil price. Regardless of these external forces, we must remain focused on our core priorities: corporate returns and free cash flow, returning capital to our investors, strengthening our balance sheet and ESG excellence. 
Additionally, we will stay focused on executing on our transparent framework for capital allocation. More specifically, we will continue to optimize our cost structure and reduce our corporate free cash flow breakeven, further improving our downside resilience and enabling us to generate free cash flow across the widest possible range of commodity prices. 
We will stick to our disciplined reinvestment rate capital allocation frame to provide clear visibility to free cash flow generation and the use of a meaningful percentage of our operating cash flow for investor-friendly purposes, prioritizing balance sheet enhancement and return of capital to shareholders. As a reminder, assuming $45 per barrel WTR or higher, our reinvestment rate will be 70% or less, and we will make at least 30% of our cash flow from operations available for investor-friendly purposes. 
Finally, if commodity prices surprise to the upside, we will remain disciplined and won't chase growth. Even if the recent commodity price strength persist, we will not raise our capital spending. Our $1 billion maintenance capital budget will remain our budget. With higher pricing, we will simply generate even more free cash flow. We will accelerate our balance sheet improvement and the realization of our targeted leverage metrics, and we will evaluate incremental return of capital to our investors beyond our base dividend and a minimum $500 million gross debt reduction target for 2021. 
With this brief overview of our capital allocation framework, I will now turn it over to Mike Henderson, who will walk us through the highlights of our 2021 capital program."
314842,701773202,2219538,"Marathon Oil Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2021",2021-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Oil Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lee. As Lee mentioned, our 2021 $1 billion maintenance capital program is fully consistent with our capital allocation framework, prioritizing the financial and operational results that matter most. A few of the highlights, I summarized on Page",487,"Thanks, Lee. As Lee mentioned, our 2021 $1 billion maintenance capital program is fully consistent with our capital allocation framework, prioritizing the financial and operational results that matter most. 
A few of the highlights, I summarized on Page 6 of our earnings deck. Our $1 billion maintenance program is expected to deliver $1 billion of free cash flow at $50 WTI with a reinvestment rate of just 50%. You'll note this is an improvement of about $100 million relative to the maintenance scenario, free cash flow outlook we provided last quarter at the same price deck due to a combination of further capital efficiency improvements and ongoing cash cost reductions. Our 2021 corporate free cash flow breakeven is comfortably below $35 WTI, underscoring the resilience of our program. We are targeting $500 million of gross debt reduction this year, consistent with our objective to continue improving our balance sheet. We will drive further GHG emissions intensity improvement, targeting a 30% reduction relative to our 2019 baseline. And we expect to deliver flat total company oil production relative to fourth quarter 2020 exit rate. 
Regarding the operational details, approximately 90% of our capital will be dedicated to the Bakken and Eagle Ford, the industry's most capital-efficient basins. We will operate around 5 to 6 rigs and will average about 2 frackers for the year. Additionally, I'd like to address 2 other topics of interest regarding our 2021 outlook. First, last week was obviously a challenging one from a weather perspective, equally impacting all of our primary basins. Each of our asset teams has demonstrated an ability to respond successfully to significant weather events, be it hurricane, floods or extreme winter weather. However, the broad nature of this extreme winter storm tested all of our asset teams simultaneously. I would like to recognize all of the efforts of our field teams across the U.S. who have gone above and beyond over the past week, getting much needed volumes back into the market in an effective and safe manner. 
Like many operators, our volumes have been impacted by the extreme freeze. We therefore expect first quarter company oil production to be down slightly relative to the fourth quarter. However, these challenges are fully reflected in our annual production guidance, and we have no concerns about delivering on our full year commitment. 
Second, while I have highlighted the free cash flow potential of our program at $50 WTI, clearly, the current forward curve is much stronger than that. As we mentioned, should stronger prices hold, we will maintain our discipline and prioritize our free cash flow generation. Assuming just $55 WTI, a price that's still below the current strip, we would expect our free cash flow generation in 2021 to increase to over $1.3 billion with a reinvestment rate below 45%. 
With that, I will turnover to Dane Whitehead, who will cover our ongoing efforts to continue optimizing our cost structure."

On Slide 7 of our earnings deck shows we've successfully established a multiyear track record, cost structure optimization that's been critical to reducing our free cash flow breakeven, improving our free cash flow generation potential and positioning our company for success in a lower, more volatile commodity price environment. 
During 2020, in the early innings of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took decisive action to materially reduce our cost base. This action was comprehensive, including temporary base salary reductions for our executive officers and Board of Directors, meaningful reduction in both our U.S. employee and contractor base and a dramatic reduction in project expenses, among other initiatives. The end result was a year-over-year reduction to both our production costs and general and administrative costs over 20%, outperforming the initial targets we set last year. G&A alone was down 23%. And we also consistently outperformed on unit production expense throughout the year, establishing new record lows for both U.S. and international segments in 2020. 
We're building on this momentum and have already taken significant action again in 2021 to continue our cost reduction trend. These latest actions are again broad-based, including: a 25% reduction to CEO and Board of Director compensation; 10% to 20% compensation reduction for other corporate officers; a further employee and contractor workforce reduction to better align our organizational capacity with our expected future activity levels; and a reduction to aviation, real estate, projects and various other costs. 
While our first quarter 2021 earnings will include an uptick in our reported G&A, largely reflecting onetime costs associated with the recently implemented workforce reduction, we expect to realize the majority of projected cost savings across both G&A and production expense categories by the end of this year on a run rate basis. Ultimately, we're driving toward a cumulative production costs in G&A cost reduction of approximately 30% relative to 2019 and 40% relative to 2018. 
I'll now turn it over to Pat to cover our newly disclosed 5-year benchmark maintenance case. Pat?"

Slide 8 of our covers the highlights of our new disclosure around a 5-year benchmark maintenance capital scenario. First, I want to be clear that this is not 5-year guidance, nor is it a 5-year business plan. Rather, this is simply a benchmark scenario designed to hold our fourth quarter 2020 total company oil production flat through 2025. It is supported by a bottoms-up, well-by-well execution model. 
It should be evident that our '21 capital program is among the most capital efficient of any E&P company. $1 billion of all-in capital to deliver $1 billion of free cash flow at $50 WTI, with a 50% reinvestment rate and over 170,000 barrels of oil per day of production is impressive by any measure. The intent of this 5-year benchmark maintenance scenario is to showcase the sustainability of our capital efficiency advantage and outsized free cash flow potential over a longer-time horizon that is still underpinned by defensible execution assumptions. But one might argue for an even longer-term scenario. Such forecast ultimately lack the line of sight of a bottoms-up execution model and the accountability that a 5-year scenario provides. So even though we consume well below half of our high-quality inventory in this maintenance scenario, we felt the 5-year view is the most relevant and credible. 
The financial outcomes of our maintenance scenario are clearly compelling. Assuming flat $50 per barrel WTI, we can deliver approximately $5 billion of free cash flow over the next 5 years with an average reinvestment rate of around 50%. Our corporate free cash flow breakeven remains below $35 per barrel WTI throughout the period, evidence of the strength of our capital efficiency and high-quality inventory. 
To hold our fourth quarter 2020 total company oil production flat over the 5-year period, we would spend between $1 billion and $1.1 billion annually of all-in maintenance capital. Importantly, this all-in capital spending estimate fully contemplates our previously disclosed greenhouse intensity reduction initiatives, including approximately $100 million of cumulative funding for the 5-year period. 
Finally, it's worth noting that our 5-year benchmark maintenance scenario includes capital allocation across our multi-basin portfolio. While we leaned heavily on the Bakken and Eagle Ford in 2020 and will do so again in 2021, under this scenario, we begin to introduce a measured and disciplined level of activity back into the Permian and Oklahoma beginning in 2022. The Permian and Oklahoma comprise between 20% and 30% of resource play capital each year from 2022 to 2025 in this scenario. Both assets are expected to deliver accretive corporate returns and contribute to corporate free cash flow from a high-graded opportunity set. 
Now I'll turn it back to Lee, who will wrap up by highlighting our ESG excellence initiatives."
314842,701773202,2219538,"Marathon Oil Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2021",2021-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Oil Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Pat. It's our belief that continuously improving all ESG performance is essential to successfully execute our long-term strategy. And we recently issued a comprehensive press release on January 27 outlining both executive compensation changes a",1386,"Thank you, Pat. It's our belief that continuously improving all ESG performance is essential to successfully execute our long-term strategy. And we recently issued a comprehensive press release on January 27 outlining both executive compensation changes as well as GHG intensity reduction initiatives. Corporate governance is foundational. And with this in mind, we have modified our executive and Board compensation frameworks to enhance our alignment with investors, to incentivize the achievement of our core strategic objectives and to encourage the behaviors we believe are most likely to maximize long-term shareholder value. We believe these changes are appropriate and progressive and deliver much needed leadership when it comes to corporate government in our peer space. 
For our sector to compete for investor capital and against the broader market, it will take more than just strong financial outcomes. Companies must improve all elements of their ESG performance, and it starts with corporate governance how management teams are compensated. 
As highlighted on Slide 10 of our deck, the first step we took was to reduce our overall compensation. Compensation for our Board of Directors has been reduced by 25% with our compensation mix shifted more toward equity. My total direct compensation has similarly been reduced by 25%, including a 35% reduction to long-term incentive awards, reflecting both improved alignment with broader industry as well as the current business environment. Other senior officers will also participate through 10% to 20% total direct compensation reductions. 
Secondly, we restructured our short-term incentive annual cash bonus scorecard to better reflect our financial and ESG framework and to simplify our scorecard to the 5 factors most important to long-term value creation: safety, as measured by TRIR; environmental performance, as measured by GHG emissions intensity; capital efficiency, as measured by corporate free cash flow breakeven; capital discipline and free cash flow, as measured by our reinvestment rate; and financial and balance sheet strength, as measured by cash flow per debt adjusted share. Note that all production and growth metrics have been completely eliminated from our compensation scorecard. 
Finally, we have also meaningfully revised our long-term incentive compensation framework. Most notably, we have diversified LTI to 3 vehicles, all of which are denominated in shares. Our revised framework will mitigate overall reliance on relative total shareholder return against our direct E&P peer group, adding the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Energy Indices as peer comparators. This should also encourage improved performance versus the broader market. Additionally, we have introduced free cash flow performance stock units into the LTI mix, underscoring our commitment to sustainable free cash flow throughout the commodity price cycle. 
Turning to Slide 11 and our efforts to continue to raise the bar on safety and environmental performance. We view safety as a core value and a key component of our ESG performance. Keeping our workforce safe, both employees and contractors, is and always will be a top priority. We have already highlighted that during 2020, we successfully managed through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic with record-setting safety performance. This was our second consecutive year of record TRIR performance. Peer-leading safety performance will remain a component of our executive compensation scorecard. 
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity is central to our strategic goals of minimizing our environmental foot impact, addressing the risk of climate change and delivering strong, long-term financial performance.  Some perspective is useful here. Our industry has done more to power human progress than any other, and that mandate will not change. Though it is all too easy to get caught up in the many headwinds that we face, oil and gas will be part of any future energy transition, and our products will be required to support the world's economy and to elevate the standard of living for many decades to come. We absolutely acknowledge the part we play in progressing the dual challenge of meeting the world's growing energy demand while also addressing global climate goals. And we believe our role requires a strategic and a pragmatic commitment to innovative the solutions for environmental progress. 
During 2020, we made tremendous strides, leveraging the reset in our capital program and activity, combined with targeted reduction efforts, to drive a step-change improvement in our GHG intensity and gas capture. As a result, we expect that we reduce our GHG intensity by approximately 20% in 2020 relative to 2019, and we also achieved 98.5% gas capture for the total company during the fourth quarter. 
We have established quantitative objectives, highlighting our commitment to significant ongoing improvement. We have announced the GHG intensity reduction target for 2021 of approximately 30% relative to the 2019 baseline. This target has been incorporated into our annual compensation scorecard. We have also disclosed a new medium-term goal. By 2025, we expect to reduce our GHG intensity by at least 50% relative to 2019. we have already identified concrete actions to assist in achieving our goal and have incorporated approximately $100 million of cumulative funding within our 5-year benchmark scenario to ensure our progress. 
Specific initiatives include continued replacement of natural gas pneumatic equipment with lower emitting technologies, connecting additional sites to utility power, tankless facilities and investing in sole carbon sequestration to offset emissions. I wholeheartedly believe that the oil and gas industry is instrumental in creating and maintaining the enhanced quality of life we have all come to expect and enjoy, and I'm confident that our products will continue to make up a significant portion of the energy mix even as we transition to a lower carbon future. 
We believe our combined actions will position Marathon Oil to be one of the elite companies that will continue to deliver the energy the world needs while also addressing the risk of climate change. These stated emissions intensity reduction goals and specific GHG-reducing activities signify our commitment to provide sustainable energy to the world on a long-term basis. 
I know that we have covered a lot of material in our slide deck and in our prepared comments today, so let me briefly summarize today's key messages. While 2020 was a challenging year in many respects, it was also another year of differentiated execution for our company. We were successful across all elements of our 2020 playbook, ultimately generating about $280 million of free cash flow. As a result, we are a stronger and a more resilient company today than we were just a year ago. 
We announced a 2021 capital program fully consistent with our capital allocation framework that prioritizes free cash flow generation, balance sheet strength and return of capital. Our program is competitive against not only our E&P peer group, but against the broader S&P 500 as well: $1 billion of free cash flow for $1 billion of capital at $50 WTI, significant free cash flow upside if commodity price outperformance persist, at least $500 million of gross debt reduction to continue improving our balance sheet and further reductions to our GHG emissions intensity. 
We have already taken specific action this year to continue our multiyear cost reduction track record. More specifically, the company has taken additional action in 2021 to achieve an approximate 30% reduction to its combined production and general and administrative costs relative to 2019. The company expects to realize the majority of these savings on a run-rate basis by the end of 2021. 
We have disclosed a 5-year benchmark maintenance scenario that underscores the sustainability of the peer-leading capital efficiency and free cash flow we are already delivering. At flat $50 WTI, we could deliver $5 billion of free cash flow through 2025. 
And last, but certainly not the least, we have taken a leadership position in driving reductions and design changes in executive compensation and GHG emissions intensity reduction initiatives our sector needs to pursue more broadly. Our industry was in transition well before the global pandemic, and our company was among the first to recognize the need to move to a business model that prioritizes returns and sustainable free cash flow as opposed to growth. In this more disciplined model, capital and operating efficiency are paramount and, in fact, represent our competitive differentiators. We must deliver financial outcomes and ESG excellence that are competitive not only with our direct E&P peers, but with the broader market as well. 
With that, I will turn it over to the operator to begin our Q&A session."

There's quite a bit in there, Jeanine. Let me go ahead and take a cut. This is Dane. We tried to be really clear about our intentions around the balance sheet and other return of capital to shareholders. There's sort of a gross debt discussion and a net debt discussion in there, so let me talk about those first. 
As Lee and Mike noted, we have a 2021 target of $500 million gross debt reduction. I would consider that a minimum. But that's our near-term goal and probably happened early in the year. So that's gross debt reduction. And in my view, that's kind of the most durable structural form of deleveraging. It also carries the added benefits of reducing cash, interest costs and derisking future maturities. We've done about $2 billion worth of that over the past few years, and it's helped our cash cost structure mildly. And we'll continue to do that. 
We've also, as you referenced, been clear that we're looking to reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA number, commonly used leverage term to a 1 to 1.5x range. And the math we think about there is to get to 1.5x in, say, a $50 mid-cycle oil market, that's a reduction of net debt by about $1.3 billion. 
So with commodity prices where we are today, we're probably going to get to that point much more quickly than we had anticipated coming into the year. But we certainly are focused on getting there. And as we -- as net debt comes down, and you can do that just by accumulating cash on the balance sheet, we'll probably go ahead and take out further gross debt, but also look in tandem to look at other ways to return cash to shareholders. We have a good, pretty strong track record of doing these things in parallel, both paying down debt and returning cash to shareholders. And we know that's very important to people. We happen to be in an environment where we are going to be generating quite a bit of cash when commodity prices hold, and we're going to pay close attention to our options there."

My second question, maybe shifting gears is just on the 5-year maintenance scenario and just general capital efficiency. So I guess in terms of general capital efficiency by operating areas and how you kind of see that evolving over time. You mentioned in the slides and in your prepared remarks, the 5-year maintenance scenario has 20% to 30% CapEx for the Permian and Oklahoma. And the total CapEx is $1 billion to $1.5 billion versus the 2021 plan only has 10% in those areas, and it's $1 billion in CapEx. So I guess my question is, is the $100 range on the 5-year scenario, is that related to folding in the Permian and Oklahoma and that reflects kind of lower capital efficiency in those areas because there hasn't been a ton of activity in those areas recently. And so what's kind of driving the Permian and Oklahoma retiring more CapEx, both this year and is it purely returns related?

And maybe it's worth just kind of restating a few of the things I pointed out in my opening comments. When when we talk about this 5-year benchmark case, it really is all about demonstrating sustainability. And as we continue to develop both the Eagle Ford and Bakken, obviously, that's the focus this year. We see this opportunity to blend in a high-graded opportunity set from both Oklahoma and Permian while also offsetting things like base decline in Equatorial Guinea. But even across that 5-year period, I want to point out that we're still only consuming less than half of our high-return inventory. And all this is supported, as was described, by a very much a bottoms-up, well-by-well execution model that's very defensible. So the short answer to your question is it's allocating capital on a returns basis. And via the high-graded opportunities in both the Permian and Oklahoma, we believe those can be very accretive across the 5-year plan."

If we see that upside potential, we'll look to support our base dividend first. We'll look to accelerate the improvement in our balance sheet and our debt reduction. Then we're going to look at incremental means to get capital back to shareholders. And then at that point, depending upon where market fundamentals sit, you can have a discussion about whether or not growth into the market really makes sense. 
Clearly, as we sit here today and what I believe is still a well-supplied market, even though we're seeing more consistent drawdowns now, we've got, like I said, a very nascent recovery in demand that's occurring. I still believe that a disciplined approach is going to win the day.

Many of these deals have been very bespoke, very specific deals. I don't intend to comment on any of them specifically. But certainly, given our size and presence across all 4 of the key basins, we're well aware of the deals or the transactions that are available in the marketplace. We're going to apply a very well-defined criteria for any consolidation, whether it's small, medium or large, and we're not going to budge off that criteria. It's going to have to be something that is accretive to our financial returns, accretive to free cash flow. It certainly can do no harm to our balance sheet, and it's going to need to be something that has clear synergies and industrial logic and then also, ultimately, adds to our longer-term sustainability.

We do expect that those portfolio declines will moderate as we see a shift in mix where we have more of that base production and less of, say, that year 1 and year 2 decline that typically represents those wells that you're bringing onstream.

So that's not a time where we want to concentrate necessarily our completion activity. And so that -- you're seeing that effect. 
But from a CapEx as well as a wells to sales standpoint, it is going to be generally ratable. On the volume side, as Mike mentioned in the opening remarks, we do expect to see some impact from the winter weather. But from a wealth to sales standpoint, that's not a driver of first quarter volumes. We had strong carry in performance, and we still expect to kind of be in that low end of our annual guidance range even with the winter weather conditions that persisted across our play.

You were asking about inflation. What I'd say there, if we look at it from a macro perspective, capital activity has not returned to a level that we would expect to drive a substantial uptick in current costs. And it's capital activity that drives inflation. So what I'd say there, so long as there's discipline in the E&P space, inflation feels very manageable. Specifically to Morrison, we do have our frac crews and 50% of our rig fleet secured through the middle of this year. We are seeing some inflationary pressure in the casing and shipping space. But that's really due to non-E&P demand on raw material and mill space, which we project that flatten out in the year. So I'd probably characterize it as we're seeing some mild inflation. But if there's discipline within the industry, we think that inflation is manageable."

I want to start by once again thanking our employees and contractors for their resilience and dedication as we continue to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic as critical essential infrastructure providers. The safety and health of our people remains front and center to everything we do.
Just this past week, many of our team, particularly here in Texas, also navigated multiple days without power or running water amidst a generational winter storm and did so without incident. I'm truly proud of our people and their perseverance. They have risen to the challenge again and again. The execution excellence I have the privilege of discussing today is the product of their outstanding work.
While 2020 was a challenging and unprecedented year for our industry, we focused on those elements of our business within our control and delivered results that speak for themselves. But for Marathon, it is not just about results, but how we achieve those results. First and foremost, I'm especially proud of our second consecutive year of record safety performance as measured by total recordable incident rate despite the challenges associated with the pandemic and the dramatic shifts in our activity levels throughout the year in response to commodity price volatility. The safety of our people will always be my top priority.
During 2020, the company also made significant progress in improving its environmental performance, achieving an estimated 20% reduction to its GHG emissions intensity relative to 2019 and improving total company gas capture to approximately 98.5% for the fourth quarter of 2020.
Beyond maintaining safe and environmentally sound operations, our primary focus in 2020 was threefold: reduce and optimize our capital program in response to commodity price volatility, continue to lower our cost structure, and protect our investment-grade balance sheet and generate free cash flow. Today, I'm pleased to highlight comprehensive success across all elements of our 2020 playbook. 
First, we reduced and optimized our capital program to navigate unprecedented commodity price volatility. Our 2020 capital expenditures totaled $1.16 billion, below our most recent guidance of $1.2 billion on tremendous execution and more than 50% below our original capital budget for the year. 
We dramatically reduced our well costs during 2020, the continuation of a long-standing trend due to a combination of optimized well design, execution efficiency, supply chain optimization and commercial leverage. Average completed well cost per lateral foot was down 20% year-on-year in 2020 with fourth quarter down approximately 35% from the 2019 average. We expect the vast majority of these well cost reductions to prove durable.
Second, we continued our multiyear trend of successful lowering our cost structure. Early in 2020, we took aggressive and decisive action in response to the challenging environment. The end result was a year-on-year reduction of over 20% to both our production costs and our general and administrative costs, exceeding the initial cost reduction targets we set last year. Both our U.S. and international segments achieved record low unit production cost in 2020.
Finally, we protected our investment-grade balance sheet and maintained our focus on free cash flow. Our collective actions in 2020 culminated in just under $280 million of free cash flow generation for the full year, including about $160 million during the fourth quarter with oil production flat sequentially and with WTI averaging only $42 per barrel.
Funded entirely by free cash flow, we returned around $250 million back to our investors in 2020, consistent with our multiyear return of capital track record. This included $150 million of share buybacks and dividends, including our reinstated base dividend during fourth quarter as well as $100 million of gross debt reduction, consistent with our objective to continue improving our balance sheet. We also proactively reduced our November 2022 debt maturity by half or $500 million.
Ultimately, we successfully responded to the supply/demand crisis in 2020 and further optimized and enhanced our business model. In addition to pulling all the necessary levers to manage through the crisis, we dramatically improved our resilience and our ability to generate robust financial outcomes in a lower and more volatile commodity price environment in the future.
We have, therefore, entered 2021 on firm footing. And while commodity prices have surprised to the upside to start this year, we have no doubt that oil and gas prices will remain volatile. We fully understand that this is a cyclical business, that we are price takers and not price predictors and that the range of potential outcomes for supply/demand balances remains wide. The market remains well supplied with nascent demand recovery just emerging from the pandemic crisis.
As I often remind our team, we can't control the macro, and we certainly can't predict the oil price. Regardless of these external forces, we must remain focused on our core priorities: corporate returns and free cash flow, returning capital to our investors, strengthening our balance sheet and ESG excellence.
Additionally, we will stay focused on executing on our transparent framework for capital allocation. More specifically, we will continue to optimize our cost structure and reduce our corporate free cash flow breakeven, further improving our downside resilience and enabling us to generate free cash flow across the widest possible range of commodity prices.
We will stick to our disciplined reinvestment rate capital allocation framework to provide clear visibility to free cash flow generation and the use of a meaningful percentage of our operating cash flow for investor-friendly purposes, prioritizing balance sheet enhancement and return of capital to shareholders. As a reminder, assuming $45 per barrel WTI or higher, our reinvestment rate will be 70% or less, and we will make at least 30% of our cash flow from operations available for investor-friendly purposes.
Finally, if commodity prices surprise to the upside, we will remain disciplined and won't chase growth. Even if the recent commodity price strength persist, we will not raise our capital spending. Our $1 billion maintenance capital budget will remain our budget. With higher pricing, we will simply generate even more free cash flow. We will accelerate our balance sheet improvement and the realization of our targeted leverage metrics, and we will evaluate incremental return of capital to our investors beyond our base dividend and a minimum $500 million gross debt reduction target for 2021.
With this brief overview of our capital allocation framework, I will now turn it over to Mike Henderson, who will walk us through the highlights of our 2021 capital program."
314842,701773202,2219578,"Marathon Oil Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2021",2021-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Oil Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lee. As Lee mentioned, our 2021 $1 billion maintenance capital program is fully consistent with our capital allocation framework, prioritizing the financial and operational results that matter most. A few of the highlights I summarized on Page 6",489,"Thanks, Lee. As Lee mentioned, our 2021 $1 billion maintenance capital program is fully consistent with our capital allocation framework, prioritizing the financial and operational results that matter most. 
A few of the highlights I summarized on Page 6 of our earnings deck. Our $1 billion maintenance program is expected to deliver $1 billion of free cash flow at $50 WTI with a reinvestment rate of just 50%. You'll note this is an improvement of about $100 million relative to the maintenance scenario free cash flow outlook we provided last quarter at the same price deck due to a combination of further capital efficiency improvements and ongoing cash cost reductions. Our 2021 corporate free cash flow breakeven is comfortably below $35 WTI, underscoring the resilience of our program. We are targeting $500 million of gross debt reduction this year, consistent with our objective to continue improving our balance sheet. We will drive further GHG emissions intensity improvement, targeting a 30% reduction relative to our 2019 baseline. And we expect to deliver flat total company oil production relative to fourth quarter 2020 exit rate.
Regarding the operational details, approximately 90% of our capital will be dedicated to the Bakken and Eagle Ford, the industry's most capital-efficient basins. We will operate around 5 to 6 rigs and will average about 2 frac crews for the year. 
Additionally, I'd like to address 2 other topics of interest regarding our 2021 outlook. First, last week was obviously a challenging one from a weather perspective, uniquely impacting all of our primary basins. Each of our asset teams has demonstrated an ability to respond successfully to significant weather events, be it hurricane, floods or extreme winter weather. However, the broad nature of this extreme winter storm tested all of our asset teams simultaneously. I would like to recognize all of the efforts of our field teams across the U.S. who have gone above and beyond over the past week, getting much needed volumes back into the market in an effective and safe manner.
Like many operators, our volumes have been impacted by the extreme freeze. We therefore expect first quarter total company oil production to be down slightly relative to the fourth quarter. However, these challenges are fully reflected in our annual production guidance, and we have no concerns about delivering on our full year commitment. 
Second, while I have highlighted the free cash flow potential of our program at $50 WTI, clearly, the current forward curve is much stronger than that. As we mentioned, should stronger prices hold, we will maintain our discipline and prioritize our free cash flow generation. Assuming just $55 WTI, a price still below the current strip, we would expect our free cash flow generation in 2021 to increase to over $1.3 billion with a reinvestment rate below 45%.
With that, I will turn over to Dane Whitehead, who will cover our ongoing efforts to continue optimizing our cost structure."

On Slide 7 of our earnings deck shows we've successfully established a multiyear track record, cost structure optimization that's been critical to reducing our free cash flow breakeven, improving our free cash flow generation potential and positioning our company for success in a lower, more volatile commodity price environment.
During 2020, in the early innings of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took decisive action to materially reduce our cost base. This action was comprehensive, including temporary base salary reductions for our executive officers and Board of Directors, a meaningful reduction in both our U.S. employee and contractor base and a dramatic reduction in project expenses, among other initiatives. The end result was year-over-year reduction to both our production costs and general and administrative costs of over 20%, outperforming the initial targets we set last year. G&A alone was down 23%. And we also consistently outperformed on unit production expense throughout the year, establishing new record lows for both our U.S. and international segments in 2020.
We're building on this momentum and have already taken significant action again in 2021 to continue our cost reduction trend. These latest actions are again broad-based, including a 25% reduction to CEO and Board of Director compensation; 10% to 20% compensation reduction for other corporate officers; a further employee and contractor workforce reduction to better align our organizational capacity with our expected future activity levels; and a reduction to aviation, real estate, project and various other costs.
While our first quarter 2021 earnings will include an uptick in our reported G&A, largely reflecting onetime costs associated with our recently implemented workforce reduction, we expect to realize the majority of projected cost savings across both G&A and production expense categories by the end of this year on a run rate basis. Ultimately, we're driving toward a cumulative production cost and G&A cost reduction of approximately 30% relative to 2019 and 40% relative to 2018.
I'll now turn it over to Pat to cover our newly disclosed 5-year benchmark maintenance case. Pat?"

First, I want to be clear that this is not 5-year guidance, nor is it a 5-year business plan. Rather, this is simply a",459,"Thanks, Dane. Slide 8 of our deck covers the highlights of our new disclosure around the 5-year benchmark maintenance capital scenario. First, I want to be clear that this is not 5-year guidance, nor is it a 5-year business plan. Rather, this is simply a benchmark scenario designed to hold our fourth quarter 2020 total company oil production flat through 2025. And it is supported by a bottoms-up, well-by-well execution model.
It should be evident that our '21 capital program is among the most capital efficient of any E&P company. $1 billion of all-in capital to deliver $1 billion of free cash flow at $50 WTI, with a 50% reinvestment rate and over 170,000 barrels of oil per day of production is impressive by any measure. The intent of this 5-year benchmark maintenance scenario is to showcase the sustainability of our capital efficiency advantage and outsized free cash flow potential over a longer-time horizon that is still underpinned by defensible execution assumptions. Though one might argue for an even longer-term scenario, such forecast ultimately lack the line of sight of a bottoms-up execution model and the accountability that a 5-year scenario provides. So even though we consume well below half of our high-quality inventory in this maintenance scenario, we felt the 5-year view is the most relevant and credible.
The financial outcomes of our maintenance scenario are clearly compelling. Assuming flat $50 per barrel WTI, we can deliver approximately $5 billion of free cash flow over the next 5 years with an average reinvestment rate of around 50%. Our corporate free cash flow breakeven remains below $35 per barrel WTI throughout the period, evidence of the strength of our capital efficiency and high-quality inventory. 
To hold our fourth quarter 2020 total company oil production flat over the 5-year period, we would spend between $1 billion and $1.1 billion annually of all-in maintenance capital. Importantly, this all-in capital spending estimate fully contemplates our previously disclosed greenhouse gas intensity reduction initiatives, including approximately $100 million of cumulative funding for the 5-year period. 
Finally, it's worth noting that our 5-year benchmark maintenance scenario includes capital allocation across our multi-basin portfolio. While we leaned heavily on the Bakken and Eagle Ford in 2020 and will do so again in 2021, under this scenario, we begin to introduce a measured and disciplined level of activity back into the Permian and Oklahoma beginning in 2022. The Permian and Oklahoma comprise between 20% and 30% of resource play capital each year from 2022 to 2025 in this scenario. Both assets are expected to deliver accretive corporate returns and contribute to corporate free cash flow from a high-graded opportunity set. 
Now I'll turn it back to Lee, who will wrap up by highlighting our ESG excellence initiatives."
314842,701773202,2219578,"Marathon Oil Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2021",2021-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Oil Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Pat. It's our belief that continuously improving all ESG performance is essential to successfully executing our long-term strategy. And we recently issued a comprehensive press release on January 27 outlining both executive compensation changes",1386,"Thank you, Pat. It's our belief that continuously improving all ESG performance is essential to successfully executing our long-term strategy. And we recently issued a comprehensive press release on January 27 outlining both executive compensation changes as well as GHG intensity reduction initiatives. Corporate governance is foundational. And with this in mind, we have modified our executive and Board compensation frameworks to enhance our alignment with investors, to incentivize the achievement of our core strategic objectives and to encourage the behaviors we believe are most likely to maximize long-term shareholder value. We believe these changes are appropriate and progressive and deliver much needed leadership when it comes to corporate government in our peer space. 
For our sector to compete for investor capital and against the broader market, it will take more than just strong financial outcomes. Companies must improve all elements of their ESG performance, and it starts with corporate governance and how management teams are compensated.
As highlighted on Slide 10 of our deck, the first step we took was to reduce our overall compensation. Compensation for our Board of Directors has been reduced by 25% with our compensation mix shifted more toward equity. My total direct compensation has similarly been reduced by 25%, including a 35% reduction to long-term incentive awards, reflecting both improved alignment with broader industry as well as the current business environment. Other senior officers will also participate through 10% to 20% total direct compensation reductions.
Secondly, we restructured our short-term incentive annual cash bonus scorecard to better reflect our financial and ESG framework and to simplify our scorecard to the 5 factors most important to long-term value creation: safety, as measured by TRIR; environmental performance, as measured by GHG emissions intensity; capital efficiency, as measured by corporate free cash flow breakeven; capital discipline and free cash flow, as measured by our reinvestment rate; and financial and balance sheet strength, as measured by cash flow per debt adjusted share. Note that all production and growth metrics have been completely eliminated from our compensation scorecard.
Finally, we have also meaningfully revised our long-term incentive compensation framework. Most notably, we have diversified LTI to 3 vehicles, all of which are denominated in shares. Our revised framework will mitigate overreliance on relative total shareholder return against our direct E&P peer group, adding the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Energy Indices as peer comparators. This should also encourage improved performance versus the broader market. Additionally, we have introduced free cash flow performance stock units into the LTI mix, underscoring our commitment to sustainable free cash flow throughout the commodity price cycle.
Turning to Slide 11 and our efforts to continue to raise the bar on safety and environmental performance. We view safety as a core value and a key component of our ESG performance. Keeping our workforce safe, both employees and contractors, is and always will be a top priority. We have already highlighted that during 2020, we successfully managed through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic with record-setting safety performance. This was our second consecutive year of record TRIR performance. Peer-leading safety performance will remain a component of our executive compensation scorecard.  
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity is central to our strategic goals of minimizing our environmental foot -- impact, addressing the risk of climate change and delivering strong, long-term financial performance. Some perspective is useful here. Our industry has done more to power human progress than any other, and that mandate will not change. Though it is all too easy to get caught up in the many headwinds that we face, oil and gas will be part of any future energy transition, and our products will be required to support the world's economy and to elevate the standard of living for many decades to come. We absolutely acknowledge the part we play in progressing the dual challenge of meeting the world's growing energy demand while also addressing global climate goals. And we believe our role requires a strategic and a pragmatic commitment to innovative solutions for environmental progress.
During 2020, we made tremendous strides, leveraging the reset in our capital program and activity combined with targeted reduction efforts, to drive a step-change improvement in our GHG intensity and gas capture. As a result, we expect that we'll reduce our GHG intensity by approximately 20% in 2020 relative to 2019, and we also achieved 98.5% gas capture for the total company during the fourth quarter.
We have established quantitative objectives, highlighting our commitment to significant ongoing improvement. We have announced the GHG intensity reduction target for 2021 of approximately 30% relative to the 2019 baseline. This target has been incorporated into our annual compensation scorecard. We have also disclosed a new medium-term goal. By 2025, we expect to reduce our GHG intensity by at least 50% relative to 2019. We have already identified concrete actions to assist in achieving our goal and have incorporated approximately $100 million of cumulative funding within our 5-year benchmark scenario to ensure our progress.
Specific initiatives include continued replacement of natural gas pneumatic equipment with lower emitting technologies, connecting additional sites to utility power, tankless facilities and investing in soil carbon sequestration to offset emissions. I wholeheartedly believe that the oil and gas industry is instrumental in creating and maintaining the enhanced quality of life we have all come to expect and enjoy, and I'm confident that our products will continue to make up a significant portion of the energy mix even as we transition to a lower carbon future.
We believe our combined actions will position Marathon Oil to be one of the elite companies that will continue to deliver the energy the world needs while also addressing the risk of climate change. These stated emissions intensity reduction goals and specific GHG-reducing activities signify our commitment to provide sustainable energy to the world on a long-term basis.
I know that we have covered a lot of material in our slide deck and in our prepared comments today, so let me briefly summarize today's key messages. While 2020 was a challenging year in many respects, it was also another year of differentiated execution for our company. We were successful across all elements of our 2020 playbook, ultimately generating about $280 million of free cash flow. As a result, we are a stronger and a more resilient company today than we were just a year ago. 
We announced a 2021 capital program fully consistent with our capital allocation framework that prioritizes free cash flow generation, balance sheet strength and return of capital. Our program is competitive against not only our E&P peer group, but against the broader S&P 500 as well. $1 billion of free cash flow for $1 billion of capital at $50 WTI, significant free cash flow upside if commodity price outperformance persist, at least $500 million of gross debt reduction to continue improving our balance sheet and further reductions to our GHG emissions intensity. We have already taken specific action this year to continue our multiyear cost reduction track record. More specifically, the company has taken additional action in 2021 to achieve an approximate 30% reduction to its combined production and general and administrative costs relative to 2019. The company expects to realize the majority of these savings on a run-rate basis by the end of 2021.
We have disclosed a 5-year benchmark maintenance scenario that underscores the sustainability of the peer-leading capital efficiency and free cash flow we are already delivering. At flat $50 WTI, we could deliver $5 billion of free cash flow through 2025.  
And last, but certainly not the least, we have taken a leadership position in driving reductions and design changes in executive compensation and GHG emissions intensity reduction initiatives our sector needs to pursue more broadly. Our industry was in transition well before the global pandemic, and our company was among the first to recognize the need to move to a business model that prioritizes returns and sustainable free cash flow as opposed to growth. In this more disciplined model, capital and operating efficiency are paramount and, in fact, represent our competitive differentiators. We must deliver financial outcomes and ESG excellence that are competitive not only with our direct E&P peers, but with the broader market as well.

On the amount of free cash flow set aside for investor-friendly purposes, is getting to the top end of your 1 to 1.5x leverage target, is that good enough such that you'll start allocating some free cash flow towards buyback or variable dividend? I know some of it depends on your cash balances that you're targeting as a minimum. Some of it depends on the macro. But is that 1.5x enough?"

We tried to be really clear about our intentions around the balance sheet and other return of capital to shareholders. There's sort of a gross debt discuss",361,"Yes. There's quite a bit in there, Jeanine, but let me go ahead and take a cut at it. This is Dane. We tried to be really clear about our intentions around the balance sheet and other return of capital to shareholders. There's sort of a gross debt discussion and a net debt discussion in there, so let me talk about those first.
As Lee and Mike noted, we have a 2021 target of $500 million gross debt reduction. I would consider that a minimum. But that's our near-term goal and probably happened early in the year. So that's gross debt reduction. And in my view, that's kind of the most durable structural form of deleveraging. It also carries the added benefits of reducing cash, interest costs and derisking future maturities. We've done about $2 billion worth of that over the past few years, and it's helped our cash cost structure mildly. And we'll continue to do that.
We've also, as you referenced, been clear that we're looking to reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA number, commonly used leverage term to a 1 to 1.5x range. And the math we think about there is to get to 1.5x in, say, a $50 mid-cycle oil market, that's a reduction of net debt by about $1.3 billion.
So with commodity prices where we are today, we're probably going to get to that point much more quickly than we had anticipated coming into the year. But we certainly are focused on getting there. And as we -- as net debt comes down, and you can do that just by accumulating cash on the balance sheet, we'll probably go ahead and take out further gross debt, but also look in tandem to look at other ways to return cash to shareholders. We have a good -- pretty strong track record of doing these things in parallel, both paying down debt and returning cash to shareholders. And we know that's very important to people. We happen to be in an environment where we are going to be generating quite a bit of cash when commodity prices hold, and we're going to pay close attention to our options there."

My second question, maybe shifting gears is just on the 5-year maintenance scenario and just general capital efficiency. So I guess in terms of general capital efficiency by operating areas and how you kind of see that evolving over time, you mentioned in the slides and in your prepared remarks, the 5-year maintenance scenario has 20% to 30% CapEx for the Permian and Oklahoma. And the total CapEx is $1 billion to $1.5 billion versus the 2021 plan only has 10% in those areas, and it's $1 billion in CapEx. 
So I guess my question is, is the $100 range on the 5-year scenario, is that related to folding in the Permian and Oklahoma, and that reflects kind of lower capital efficiency in those areas because there hasn't been a ton of activity in those areas recently. And so what's kind of driving the Permian and Oklahoma to garnering more CapEx, both this year? And is it purely returns related? Or are there kind of other factors such as wanting to maintain operational capability in all of your basins?"

But even across that 5-year period, I want to point out that we're still only consuming less than half of our high-return inventory. And all this is supported, as was described, by a very much a bottoms-up, well-by-well execution model that's very defensible. 
So the short answer to your question is it's allocating capital on a returns basis. And via the high-graded opportunities in both the Permian and Oklahoma, we believe those can be very accretive across the 5-year plan."

Then we're going to look at incremental means to get capital back to shareholders. And then at that point, depending upon where market fundamentals sit, you can have a discussion about whether or not growth into the market really makes sense.
Clearly, as we sit here today and what I believe is still a well-supplied market, even though we're seeing more consistent drawdowns now, we've got, like I said, a very nascent recovery in demand that's occurring. I still believe that a disciplined approach is going to win the day.

But from a CapEx as well as a wells to sales standpoint, it is going to be generally ratable. 
On the volume side, as Mike mentioned in the opening remarks, we do expect to see some impact from the winter weather. But from a wells to sales standpoint, that's not a driver of first quarter volumes. We had strong carry-in performance, and we still expect to kind of be in that low end of our annual guidance range even with the winter weather conditions that persisted across our play.

As we think about cost, specifically well cost, we are assuming some level of savings over that 5 year, albeit, I think Pat mentioned, we are -- we did look at it from a risk bottoms-up perspective and maybe putting those cost savings into a little bit of perspective. If you take the Eagle Ford and Bakken, for example, our pacesetter wells, so wells that we already have in the ground, we drilled and completed those wells for less than what we're assuming in the 5-year maintenance case. So on the capital side, we are assuming some improvement, but nothing that we haven't delivered on already.
From an inflation perspective, I think you may have asked that. We are assuming some modest inflation in that 5-year plan, which I think is reasonable.

And it's capital activity that drives inflation. So what I'd say there, so long as there's discipline in the E&P space, inflation feels very manageable. Specifically to Marathon, we do have our frac crews and 50% of our rig fleet secured through the middle of this year. We are seeing some inflationary pressure in the casing and shipping space. But that's really due to non-E&P demand on raw material and mill space, we project that to flatten out in the year. So I'd probably characterize it as we're seeing some mild inflation.

I want to start by once again thanking our employees and contractors for their resilience and dedication as we continue to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic as critical essential infrastructure providers. The safety and health of our people remains front and center to everything we do.
Just this past week, many of our team, particularly here in Texas, also navigated multiple days without power or running water amidst a generational winter storm and did so without incident. I'm truly proud of our people and their perseverance. They have risen to the challenge again and again. The execution excellence I have the privilege of discussing today is the product of their outstanding work.
While 2020 was a challenging and unprecedented year for our industry, we focused on those elements of our business within our control and delivered results that speak for themselves. But for Marathon, it is not just about results, but how we achieve those results. First and foremost, I'm especially proud of our second consecutive year of record safety performance as measured by total recordable incident rate despite the challenges associated with the pandemic and the dramatic shifts in our activity levels throughout the year in response to commodity price volatility. The safety of our people will always be my top priority.
During 2020, the company also made significant progress in improving its environmental performance, achieving an estimated 20% reduction to its GHG emissions intensity relative to 2019 and improving total company gas capture to approximately 98.5% for the fourth quarter of 2020.
Beyond maintaining safe and environmentally sound operations, our primary focus in 2020 was threefold: reduce and optimize our capital program in response to commodity price volatility, continue to lower our cost structure, and protect our investment-grade balance sheet and generate free cash flow. Today, I'm pleased to highlight comprehensive success across all elements of our 2020 playbook. 
First, we reduced and optimized our capital program to navigate unprecedented commodity price volatility. Our 2020 capital expenditures totaled $1.16 billion, below our most recent guidance of $1.2 billion on tremendous execution and more than 50% below our original capital budget for the year. 
We dramatically reduced our well costs during 2020, the continuation of a long-standing trend due to a combination of optimized well design, execution efficiency, supply chain optimization and commercial leverage. Average completed well cost per lateral foot was down 20% year-on-year in 2020 with fourth quarter down approximately 35% from the 2019 average. We expect the vast majority of these well cost reductions to prove durable.
Second, we continued our multiyear trend of successful lowering our cost structure. Early in 2020, we took aggressive and decisive action in response to the challenging environment. The end result was a year-on-year reduction of over 20% to both our production costs and our general and administrative costs, exceeding the initial cost reduction targets we set last year. Both our U.S. and international segments achieved record low unit production cost in 2020.
Finally, we protected our investment-grade balance sheet and maintained our focus on free cash flow. Our collective actions in 2020 culminated in just under $280 million of free cash flow generation for the full year, including about $160 million during the fourth quarter with oil production flat sequentially and with WTI averaging only $42 per barrel.
Funded entirely by free cash flow, we returned around $250 million back to our investors in 2020, consistent with our multiyear return of capital track record. This included $150 million of share buybacks and dividends, including our reinstated base dividend during fourth quarter as well as $100 million of gross debt reduction, consistent with our objective to continue improving our balance sheet. We also proactively reduced our November 2022 debt maturity by half or $500 million.
Ultimately, we successfully responded to the supply/demand crisis in 2020 and further optimized and enhanced our business model. In addition to pulling all the necessary levers to manage through the crisis, we dramatically improved our resilience and our ability to generate robust financial outcomes in a lower and more volatile commodity price environment in the future.
We have, therefore, entered 2021 on firm footing. And while commodity prices have surprised to the upside to start this year, we have no doubt that oil and gas prices will remain volatile. We fully understand that this is a cyclical business, that we are price takers and not price predictors and that the range of potential outcomes for supply/demand balances remains wide. The market remains well supplied with nascent demand recovery just emerging from the pandemic crisis.
As I often remind our team, we can't control the macro, and we certainly can't predict the oil price. Regardless of these external forces, we must remain focused on our core priorities: corporate returns and free cash flow, returning capital to our investors, strengthening our balance sheet and ESG excellence.
Additionally, we will stay focused on executing on our transparent framework for capital allocation. More specifically, we will continue to optimize our cost structure and reduce our corporate free cash flow breakeven, further improving our downside resilience and enabling us to generate free cash flow across the widest possible range of commodity prices.
We will stick to our disciplined reinvestment rate capital allocation framework to provide clear visibility to free cash flow generation and the use of a meaningful percentage of our operating cash flow for investor-friendly purposes, prioritizing balance sheet enhancement and return of capital to shareholders. As a reminder, assuming $45 per barrel WTI or higher, our reinvestment rate will be 70% or less, and we will make at least 30% of our cash flow from operations available for investor-friendly purposes.
Finally, if commodity prices surprise to the upside, we will remain disciplined and won't chase growth. Even if the recent commodity price strength persist, we will not raise our capital spending. Our $1 billion maintenance capital budget will remain our budget. With higher pricing, we will simply generate even more free cash flow. We will accelerate our balance sheet improvement and the realization of our targeted leverage metrics, and we will evaluate incremental return of capital to our investors beyond our base dividend and a minimum $500 million gross debt reduction target for 2021.
With this brief overview of our capital allocation framework, I will now turn it over to Mike Henderson, who will walk us through the highlights of our 2021 capital program."
314842,701773202,2223435,"Marathon Oil Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2021",2021-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Oil Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Lee. As Lee mentioned, our 2021 $1 billion maintenance capital program is fully consistent with our capital allocation framework, prioritizing the financial and operational results that matter most. A few of the highlights I summarized on Page 6",489,"Thanks, Lee. As Lee mentioned, our 2021 $1 billion maintenance capital program is fully consistent with our capital allocation framework, prioritizing the financial and operational results that matter most. 
A few of the highlights I summarized on Page 6 of our earnings deck. Our $1 billion maintenance program is expected to deliver $1 billion of free cash flow at $50 WTI with a reinvestment rate of just 50%. You'll note this is an improvement of about $100 million relative to the maintenance scenario free cash flow outlook we provided last quarter at the same price deck due to a combination of further capital efficiency improvements and ongoing cash cost reductions. Our 2021 corporate free cash flow breakeven is comfortably below $35 WTI, underscoring the resilience of our program. We are targeting $500 million of gross debt reduction this year, consistent with our objective to continue improving our balance sheet. We will drive further GHG emissions intensity improvement, targeting a 30% reduction relative to our 2019 baseline. And we expect to deliver flat total company oil production relative to fourth quarter 2020 exit rate.
Regarding the operational details, approximately 90% of our capital will be dedicated to the Bakken and Eagle Ford, the industry's most capital-efficient basins. We will operate around 5 to 6 rigs and will average about 2 frac crews for the year. 
Additionally, I'd like to address 2 other topics of interest regarding our 2021 outlook. First, last week was obviously a challenging one from a weather perspective, uniquely impacting all of our primary basins. Each of our asset teams has demonstrated an ability to respond successfully to significant weather events, be it hurricane, floods or extreme winter weather. However, the broad nature of this extreme winter storm tested all of our asset teams simultaneously. I would like to recognize all of the efforts of our field teams across the U.S. who have gone above and beyond over the past week, getting much needed volumes back into the market in an effective and safe manner.
Like many operators, our volumes have been impacted by the extreme freeze. We therefore expect first quarter total company oil production to be down slightly relative to the fourth quarter. However, these challenges are fully reflected in our annual production guidance, and we have no concerns about delivering on our full year commitment. 
Second, while I have highlighted the free cash flow potential of our program at $50 WTI, clearly, the current forward curve is much stronger than that. As we mentioned, should stronger prices hold, we will maintain our discipline and prioritize our free cash flow generation. Assuming just $55 WTI, a price still below the current strip, we would expect our free cash flow generation in 2021 to increase to over $1.3 billion with a reinvestment rate below 45%.
With that, I will turn over to Dane Whitehead, who will cover our ongoing efforts to continue optimizing our cost structure."

On Slide 7 of our earnings deck shows we've successfully established a multiyear track record, cost structure optimization that's been critical to reducing our free cash flow breakeven, improving our free cash flow generation potential and positioning our company for success in a lower, more volatile commodity price environment.
During 2020, in the early innings of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took decisive action to materially reduce our cost base. This action was comprehensive, including temporary base salary reductions for our executive officers and Board of Directors, a meaningful reduction in both our U.S. employee and contractor base and a dramatic reduction in project expenses, among other initiatives. The end result was year-over-year reduction to both our production costs and general and administrative costs of over 20%, outperforming the initial targets we set last year. G&A alone was down 23%. And we also consistently outperformed on unit production expense throughout the year, establishing new record lows for both our U.S. and international segments in 2020.
We're building on this momentum and have already taken significant action again in 2021 to continue our cost reduction trend. These latest actions are again broad-based, including a 25% reduction to CEO and Board of Director compensation; 10% to 20% compensation reduction for other corporate officers; a further employee and contractor workforce reduction to better align our organizational capacity with our expected future activity levels; and a reduction to aviation, real estate, project and various other costs.
While our first quarter 2021 earnings will include an uptick in our reported G&A, largely reflecting onetime costs associated with our recently implemented workforce reduction, we expect to realize the majority of projected cost savings across both G&A and production expense categories by the end of this year on a run rate basis. Ultimately, we're driving toward a cumulative production cost and G&A cost reduction of approximately 30% relative to 2019 and 40% relative to 2018.
I'll now turn it over to Pat to cover our newly disclosed 5-year benchmark maintenance case. Pat?"

Slide 8 of our deck covers the highlights of our new disclosure around the 5-year benchmark maintenance capital scenario. First, I want to be clear that this is not 5-year guidance, nor is it a 5-year business plan. Rather, this is simply a benchmark scenario designed to hold our fourth quarter 2020 total company oil production flat through 2025. And it is supported by a bottoms-up, well-by-well execution model.
It should be evident that our '21 capital program is among the most capital efficient of any E&P company. $1 billion of all-in capital to deliver $1 billion of free cash flow at $50 WTI, with a 50% reinvestment rate and over 170,000 barrels of oil per day of production is impressive by any measure. The intent of this 5-year benchmark maintenance scenario is to showcase the sustainability of our capital efficiency advantage and outsized free cash flow potential over a longer-time horizon that is still underpinned by defensible execution assumptions. Though one might argue for an even longer-term scenario, such forecast ultimately lack the line of sight of a bottoms-up execution model and the accountability that a 5-year scenario provides. So even though we consume well below half of our high-quality inventory in this maintenance scenario, we felt the 5-year view is the most relevant and credible.
The financial outcomes of our maintenance scenario are clearly compelling. Assuming flat $50 per barrel WTI, we can deliver approximately $5 billion of free cash flow over the next 5 years with an average reinvestment rate of around 50%. Our corporate free cash flow breakeven remains below $35 per barrel WTI throughout the period, evidence of the strength of our capital efficiency and high-quality inventory. 
To hold our fourth quarter 2020 total company oil production flat over the 5-year period, we would spend between $1 billion and $1.1 billion annually of all-in maintenance capital. Importantly, this all-in capital spending estimate fully contemplates our previously disclosed greenhouse gas intensity reduction initiatives, including approximately $100 million of cumulative funding for the 5-year period. 
Finally, it's worth noting that our 5-year benchmark maintenance scenario includes capital allocation across our multi-basin portfolio. While we leaned heavily on the Bakken and Eagle Ford in 2020 and will do so again in 2021, under this scenario, we begin to introduce a measured and disciplined level of activity back into the Permian and Oklahoma beginning in 2022. The Permian and Oklahoma comprise between 20% and 30% of resource play capital each year from 2022 to 2025 in this scenario. Both assets are expected to deliver accretive corporate returns and contribute to corporate free cash flow from a high-graded opportunity set. 
Now I'll turn it back to Lee, who will wrap up by highlighting our ESG excellence initiatives."

It's our belief that continuously improving all ESG performance is essential to successfully executing our long-term strategy. And we recently issued a comprehensive press release on January 27 outlining both executive compensation changes as well as GHG intensity reduction initiatives. Corporate governance is foundational. And with this in mind, we have modified our executive and Board compensation frameworks to enhance our alignment with investors, to incentivize the achievement of our core strategic objectives and to encourage the behaviors we believe are most likely to maximize long-term shareholder value. We believe these changes are appropriate and progressive and deliver much needed leadership when it comes to corporate government in our peer space. 
For our sector to compete for investor capital and against the broader market, it will take more than just strong financial outcomes. Companies must improve all elements of their ESG performance, and it starts with corporate governance and how management teams are compensated.
As highlighted on Slide 10 of our deck, the first step we took was to reduce our overall compensation. Compensation for our Board of Directors has been reduced by 25% with our compensation mix shifted more toward equity. My total direct compensation has similarly been reduced by 25%, including a 35% reduction to long-term incentive awards, reflecting both improved alignment with broader industry as well as the current business environment. Other senior officers will also participate through 10% to 20% total direct compensation reductions.
Secondly, we restructured our short-term incentive annual cash bonus scorecard to better reflect our financial and ESG framework and to simplify our scorecard to the 5 factors most important to long-term value creation: safety, as measured by TRIR; environmental performance, as measured by GHG emissions intensity; capital efficiency, as measured by corporate free cash flow breakeven; capital discipline and free cash flow, as measured by our reinvestment rate; and financial and balance sheet strength, as measured by cash flow per debt adjusted share. Note that all production and growth metrics have been completely eliminated from our compensation scorecard.
Finally, we have also meaningfully revised our long-term incentive compensation framework. Most notably, we have diversified LTI to 3 vehicles, all of which are denominated in shares. Our revised framework will mitigate overreliance on relative total shareholder return against our direct E&P peer group, adding the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Energy Indices as peer comparators. This should also encourage improved performance versus the broader market. Additionally, we have introduced free cash flow performance stock units into the LTI mix, underscoring our commitment to sustainable free cash flow throughout the commodity price cycle.
Turning to Slide 11 and our efforts to continue to raise the bar on safety and environmental performance. We view safety as a core value and a key component of our ESG performance. Keeping our workforce safe, both employees and contractors, is and always will be a top priority. We have already highlighted that during 2020, we successfully managed through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic with record-setting safety performance. This was our second consecutive year of record TRIR performance. Peer-leading safety performance will remain a component of our executive compensation scorecard.  
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity is central to our strategic goals of minimizing our environmental foot -- impact, addressing the risk of climate change and delivering strong, long-term financial performance. Some perspective is useful here. Our industry has done more to power human progress than any other, and that mandate will not change. Though it is all too easy to get caught up in the many headwinds that we face, oil and gas will be part of any future energy transition, and our products will be required to support the world's economy and to elevate the standard of living for many decades to come. We absolutely acknowledge the part we play in progressing the dual challenge of meeting the world's growing energy demand while also addressing global climate goals. And we believe our role requires a strategic and a pragmatic commitment to innovative solutions for environmental progress.
During 2020, we made tremendous strides, leveraging the reset in our capital program and activity combined with targeted reduction efforts, to drive a step-change improvement in our GHG intensity and gas capture. As a result, we expect that we'll reduce our GHG intensity by approximately 20% in 2020 relative to 2019, and we also achieved 98.5% gas capture for the total company during the fourth quarter.
We have established quantitative objectives, highlighting our commitment to significant ongoing improvement. We have announced the GHG intensity reduction target for 2021 of approximately 30% relative to the 2019 baseline. This target has been incorporated into our annual compensation scorecard. We have also disclosed a new medium-term goal. By 2025, we expect to reduce our GHG intensity by at least 50% relative to 2019. We have already identified concrete actions to assist in achieving our goal and have incorporated approximately $100 million of cumulative funding within our 5-year benchmark scenario to ensure our progress.
Specific initiatives include continued replacement of natural gas pneumatic equipment with lower emitting technologies, connecting additional sites to utility power, tankless facilities and investing in soil carbon sequestration to offset emissions. I wholeheartedly believe that the oil and gas industry is instrumental in creating and maintaining the enhanced quality of life we have all come to expect and enjoy, and I'm confident that our products will continue to make up a significant portion of the energy mix even as we transition to a lower carbon future.
We believe our combined actions will position Marathon Oil to be one of the elite companies that will continue to deliver the energy the world needs while also addressing the risk of climate change. These stated emissions intensity reduction goals and specific GHG-reducing activities signify our commitment to provide sustainable energy to the world on a long-term basis.
I know that we have covered a lot of material in our slide deck and in our prepared comments today, so let me briefly summarize today's key messages. While 2020 was a challenging year in many respects, it was also another year of differentiated execution for our company. We were successful across all elements of our 2020 playbook, ultimately generating about $280 million of free cash flow. As a result, we are a stronger and a more resilient company today than we were just a year ago. 
We announced a 2021 capital program fully consistent with our capital allocation framework that prioritizes free cash flow generation, balance sheet strength and return of capital. Our program is competitive against not only our E&P peer group, but against the broader S&P 500 as well. $1 billion of free cash flow for $1 billion of capital at $50 WTI, significant free cash flow upside if commodity price outperformance persist, at least $500 million of gross debt reduction to continue improving our balance sheet and further reductions to our GHG emissions intensity. We have already taken specific action this year to continue our multiyear cost reduction track record. More specifically, the company has taken additional action in 2021 to achieve an approximate 30% reduction to its combined production and general and administrative costs relative to 2019. The company expects to realize the majority of these savings on a run-rate basis by the end of 2021.
We have disclosed a 5-year benchmark maintenance scenario that underscores the sustainability of the peer-leading capital efficiency and free cash flow we are already delivering. At flat $50 WTI, we could deliver $5 billion of free cash flow through 2025.  
And last, but certainly not the least, we have taken a leadership position in driving reductions and design changes in executive compensation and GHG emissions intensity reduction initiatives our sector needs to pursue more broadly. Our industry was in transition well before the global pandemic, and our company was among the first to recognize the need to move to a business model that prioritizes returns and sustainable free cash flow as opposed to growth. In this more disciplined model, capital and operating efficiency are paramount and, in fact, represent our competitive differentiators. We must deliver financial outcomes and ESG excellence that are competitive not only with our direct E&P peers, but with the broader market as well.  
With that, I will turn it over to the operator to begin our Q&A session."

On the amount of free cash flow set aside for investor-friendly purposes, is getting to the top end of your 1 to 1.5x leverage target, is that good enough such that you'll start allocating some free cash flow towards buyback or variable dividend? I know some of it depends on your cash balances that you're targeting as a minimum. Some of it depends on the macro. But is that 1.5x enough?"

There's quite a bit in there, Jeanine, but let me go ahead and take a cut at it. This is Dane. We tried to be really clear about our intentions around the balance sheet and other return of capital to shareholders. There's sort of a gross debt discussion and a net debt discussion in there, so let me talk about those first.
As Lee and Mike noted, we have a 2021 target of $500 million gross debt reduction. I would consider that a minimum. But that's our near-term goal and probably happened early in the year. So that's gross debt reduction. And in my view, that's kind of the most durable structural form of deleveraging. It also carries the added benefits of reducing cash, interest costs and derisking future maturities. We've done about $2 billion worth of that over the past few years, and it's helped our cash cost structure mildly. And we'll continue to do that.
We've also, as you referenced, been clear that we're looking to reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA number, commonly used leverage term to a 1 to 1.5x range. And the math we think about there is to get to 1.5x in, say, a $50 mid-cycle oil market, that's a reduction of net debt by about $1.3 billion.
So with commodity prices where we are today, we're probably going to get to that point much more quickly than we had anticipated coming into the year. But we certainly are focused on getting there. And as we -- as net debt comes down, and you can do that just by accumulating cash on the balance sheet, we'll probably go ahead and take out further gross debt, but also look in tandem to look at other ways to return cash to shareholders. We have a good -- pretty strong track record of doing these things in parallel, both paying down debt and returning cash to shareholders. And we know that's very important to people. We happen to be in an environment where we are going to be generating quite a bit of cash when commodity prices hold, and we're going to pay close attention to our options there."

My second question, maybe shifting gears is just on the 5-year maintenance scenario and just general capital efficiency. So I guess in terms of general capital efficiency by operating areas and how you kind of see that evolving over time, you mentioned in the slides and in your prepared remarks, the 5-year maintenance scenario has 20% to 30% CapEx for the Permian and Oklahoma. And the total CapEx is $1 billion to $1.5 billion versus the 2021 plan only has 10% in those areas, and it's $1 billion in CapEx. 
So I guess my question is, is the $100 range on the 5-year scenario, is that related to folding in the Permian and Oklahoma, and that reflects kind of lower capital efficiency in those areas because there hasn't been a ton of activity in those areas recently. And so what's kind of driving the Permian and Oklahoma to garnering more CapEx, both this year? And is it purely returns related? Or are there kind of other factors such as wanting to maintain operational capability in all of your basins?"

And as we continue to develop both the Eagle Ford and Bakken, obviously, that's the focus this year, we see this opportunity to blend in a high-graded opportunity set from both the Oklahoma and Permian, while also offsetting things like base decline in Equatorial Guinea. But even across that 5-year period, I want to point out that we're still only consuming less than half of our high-return inventory. And all this is supported, as was described, by a very much a bottoms-up, well-by-well execution model that's very defensible. 
So the short answer to your question is it's allocating capital on a returns basis. And via the high-graded opportunities in both the Permian and Oklahoma, we believe those can be very accretive across the 5-year plan."

We will continue to be opportunistic in the market as well as internally on our organic enhancement opportunities to continue to add to and enhance our resource base.

And that will include everything from continued investment in our REx program to say smaller bolt-on opportunities that might present themselves as well as organic enhancement like some of the redevelopment activities that we have going on in the Eagle Ford currently.

Then we're going to look at incremental means to get capital back to shareholders.

Clearly, as we sit here today and what I believe is still a well-supplied market, even though we're seeing more consistent drawdowns now, we've got, like I said, a very nascent recovery in demand that's occurring.

So I would just say it's in there.
We do expect that those portfolio declines will moderate as we see a shift in mix where we have more of that base production and less of, say, that year 1 and year 2 decline that typically represents those wells that you're bringing onstream. So there will be a moderation to that decline over time. But again, all of that is fully baked in to not only our '21 plan, but the 5-year benchmark case as well."

I assume that's also contributing to the slightly down oil volumes in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. But for the rest of the year, would you expect sort of mild ratable growth from that first quarter low to sort of achieve the 172 full year average? Or is there some lumpiness there?
And then just on the CapEx side, would you expect first quarter to be a little bit lower than the rest of the year due to that lower TIL count for Q1?"

So that's not a time where we want to concentrate necessarily our completion activity. And so that -- you're seeing that effect. But from a CapEx as well as a wells to sales standpoint, it is going to be generally ratable. 
On the volume side, as Mike mentioned in the opening remarks, we do expect to see some impact from the winter weather. But from a wells to sales standpoint, that's not a driver of first quarter volumes. We had strong carry-in performance, and we still expect to kind of be in that low end of our annual guidance range even with the winter weather conditions that persisted across our play. So notionally -- yes, in first quarter, notionally, in that kind of 170 range. And as Mike already stated, that winter impact is already fully baked into our full year guidance range."

If you take the Eagle Ford and Bakken, for example, our pacesetter wells, so wells that we already have in the ground, we drilled and completed those wells for less than what we're assuming in the 5-year maintenance case.

And it's capital activity that drives inflation. So what I'd say there, so long as there's discipline in the E&P space, inflation feels very manageable. Specifically to Marathon, we do have our frac crews and 50% of our rig fleet secured through the middle of this year. We are seeing some inflationary pressure in the casing and shipping space. But that's really due to non-E&P demand on raw material and mill space, we project that to flatten out in the year. So I'd probably characterize it as we're seeing some mild inflation.

I want to begin by once again thanking our employees and contractors for their dedication and hard work and putting together another quarter of outstanding execution. 
Not only have our teams continue to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic as critical essential infrastructure providers. They also successfully overcame the challenges of winter storm Uri during first quarter maintaining their focus on safety, while still delivering on all of our core operational and financial objectives. 
Though 2020 was a challenging year for our industry, it also brought with it opportunity. And Marathon Oil chose to leverage the supply/demand crisis to further optimize and enhance our business model. We high-graded and focused our capital program. We lowered our cost structure and we further improved our financial strength and flexibility. 
As a result, we have dramatically enhanced the resilience of our company, driving our free cash flow breakevens consistently below $35 per barrel WTI and building on a multiyear trend of sustainable free cash flow and getting that cash back in the hands of our investors. 
And we have dramatically enhanced our ability to sustainably deliver robust financial outcomes. Financial outcomes that can compete with any sector in the S&P 500 and do so across a much broader and lower range of commodity prices. We recognize that given the inherent volatility of our commodity business that we must offer outsized free cash flow generation, coupled with investor-friendly actions to make a compelling investment case. To that end, first quarter '21 results are a testament to the strength of our business model and how we have positioned our company for success. 
During first quarter, we generated over $440 million of free cash flow. Despite the challenges associated with winter storm Uri, production volumes were in line with the midpoint of our full year 2021 guidance, and we are fully on track to meet the annual production, CapEx and cost guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. And we are on track to exceed our free cash flow objectives. For $1 billion of capital spending, we now expect to generate $1.6 billion of free cash flow at $60 per barrel WTI, up from the prior guidance of around $1.5 billion. 
This corresponds to a free cash flow yield approaching 20% and a sub 40% reinvestment rate. All at an assumed oil price that is below the current forward curve. We remain committed to our $1 billion capital program. There will be no change to our capital budget, even if oil prices continue to strengthen. 
We will simply generate more free cash flow and further solidify our standing as an industry leader when it comes to capital discipline, a hard-earned reputation we have established over multiple years. We have accelerated our balance sheet and return of capital objectives, the specifics of which Dane will cover in just a few minutes. 
Importantly, everything that we are doing is sustainable. Our peer-leading capital efficiency, our outsized free cash flow generation, our competitive cost structure, our investment-grade balance sheet and our rising return of capital profile. The proof point for this sustainability is our 5-year benchmark maintenance scenario that can deliver around $5 billion of free cash flow from 2021 to 2025 and a flat $50 per barrel WTI price environment or closer to $7 billion of free cash flow at the current forward curve, along with a corporate free cash flow breakeven of less than $35 per barrel throughout the period. 
And the foundation for these differentiated financial outcomes is our multi-basin U.S. portfolio with well over a decade of high-return inventory, complemented by our integrated gas position in EG. Finally, we are leading the way in our approach to ESG excellence and are committed to continually enhancing all elements of our company's ESG performance. 
Safety remains our top priority, we are building on the record safety performance we delivered last year with a very strong start to 2021, as measured by total recordable incident rate. Best-in-class governance remains at the forefront of everything we do. We have appointed 2 new directors to the Board this year and remain committed to ongoing refreshment, independence and diversity. 
We also reduced and redesigned executive and Board compensation for improved alignment with investors as I highlighted early this year. And last but not least, we remain committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions intensity. We made tremendous strides during 2020, reducing our overall GHG intensity by approximately 25%. We are hard at work to achieve our GHG intensity reduction target of 30% in 2021, a metric hardwired into our compensation scorecard as well as our goal for a 50% reduction by 2025, both relative to our 2019 baseline. And we have included $100 million of investment over the 5 years of the benchmark scenario to support this goal. 
With that brief summary of how we have positioned our company for success, I would like to turn it over to our CFO, Dane Whitehead, to share the notable acceleration of our balance sheet and return of capital objectives."

At the center of our capital allocation and reinvestment rate framework is our objective to return at least 30% of our cash flow from operations back to our investors. Our capital return strategy prioritizes balance sheet enhancement through gross debt reduction and direct return of capital to equity holders through our base dividend and over time, likely through other return vehicles as well. 
We have a strong track record of generating free cash flow and directing that cash back to our investors, are fully committed to this model and are well positioned to meaningfully beat our objectives in 2021. When considering our updated debt reduction target on season-based dividend increase, we're actually on track to return well over 40% of our cash flow back to investors this year. 
First, we accelerated our 2021 gross debt reduction objective of $500 million, fully retiring our next significant maturity and we're now targeting at least another $500 million of gross debt reduction, bringing our total 2021 debt reduction target to $1 billion. Reducing our gross debt is entirely consistent with our goal to further enhance our balance sheet, our investment-grade credit rating. 
More specifically, our goal has been to reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA to below 1.5x, assuming more of a mid-cycle  $45 to $50 per barrel WTI environment. We're making rapid progress toward achieving this milestone by the end of the year. And in parallel, our aim is to significantly reduce our gross debt moving toward a $4 billion gross debt level. 
Beyond the obvious benefit to our financial flexibility, the interest expense reductions associated with the structural gross debt reduction have the added potential to fund future dividend increases at no incremental cost to the company, thereby preserving our very competitive post-dividend corporate free cash flow breakeven. 
Along with reducing our gross debt, we also raised our quarterly base dividend by 33%. Our objective is to pay a base dividend that is both competitive relative to our peer group in the S&P 500 and sustainable throughout commodity price cycles. Our decision to raise our dividend is a sign of our confidence in the strength and sustainability of our financial performance, and we see potential for disciplined, sustainable and competitive base dividend growth over time. 
We're targeting up to 10% of our cash flow from operations toward the base dividend, assuming $45 to $50 price environment, and we currently have ample headroom to progress under this framework. And to ensure sustainability through the price cycle, we're focused on maintaining our post-dividend breakeven well below $40 a barrel WTI. In fact, even with the recent dividend increase, our post-dividend free cash flow breakeven currently sits around $35 per barrel of TI. 
In summary, we are well positioned this year to return over 40% of our cash flow to investors through gross debt reduction and our base dividend, our top near-term priorities. As we make significant progress toward our $4 billion gross debt objective, we will likely take the balance of 2021 to accomplish. And as we continue to advance further base dividend growth in line with our framework. We'll look to transition towards simply retiring debt as it matures and focusing more on alternative shareholder return mechanisms, including share buybacks or variable dividends. 
All funded through sustainable free cash flow generation. Before I turn the call over to Mike Henderson, who will provide an update on our 2021 operational performance and capital program. I'd like to address an issue that has been topical recently, and that is cash taxes. We are not a cash taxpayer in the U.S. this year. And at prevailing commodity prices, we don't expect to be paying U.S. cash federal income taxes until the latter part of this decade. This holds true even if the tax rules for intangible drilling costs or IDCs are changed or if the corporate tax rate has increased. 
We have significant tax attributes in the form of net operating losses, approximately $8.4 billion on a gross basis, in addition to foreign tax credits of over $600 million. These attributes will be used to offset future taxes. Neither of these items is energy sector specific, so we don't expect any new tax legislation to threaten them. The bottom line is we don't expect to be a U.S. cash taxpayer until the latter part of this decade. Now I'll turn it over to Mike Henderson, our EVP of Operations."

Our strong performance is due to tremendous execution from our asset teams during first quarter, despite the significant challenges associated with winter storm Uri. Flat quarter-on-quarter, total oil production of 172,000 barrels per day was quite an accomplishment in light of the operational challenges we experienced and the impact to production you've seen reported by peer companies. 
Our teams did an exceptional job keeping our volumes online and delivering much needed production at a time when utilities and households were in critical. Our success began with extensive preplanning efforts and continued with a hands-on approach to managing our operations throughout the storm. We did not proactively shut in our volumes as a preventative measure rather, we fully leveraged our digital infrastructure to prioritize protecting our highest volume, highest rate wells, intelligently routing operators to our highest priority locations. 
All the while, we kept the safety of our people as our top priority. Our hands-on approach clearly paid off, and our operational and financial results speak for themselves. Our capital spending during 1Q came in slightly below expectations, reflecting solid well cost execution, but also the shift in timing of some capital from first to second quarter. Largely due to storm-driven delays. Looking ahead to 2Q, we expect a slight sequential decline in our oil production, the result of fewer wells to sales in the first quarter, particularly in the Bakken. 
This is simply a function of the timing of our wells to sales, reflecting a natural level of quarter-to-quarter variability. We will continue to prioritize maximizing our capital efficiency and free cash flow generation sustainably over time, not the production output of any individual quarter. We do expect the significant increase in our second quarter wells to sales to translate to an improving production trend as we move into third quarter. With the increase in wells to sales and shifting capital from 1Q to 2Q, we expect 2Q CapEx to rise to the $300 million range likely representing the peak CapEx quarter for the year. 
Still, our capital program is fairly well balanced and ratable, split almost 50-50 between the first half and second half of the year. More importantly, our full year capital spending and production guidance remain unchanged. As the most capital-efficient basins across the Lower 48, the Bakken and Eagle Ford will still receive approximately 90% of our capital this year. However, both our Oklahoma and Permian assets have high-return opportunities that can effectively compete for capital today. Both assets provide capital allocation optionality, commodity diversification and incremental high-quality inventory. 
Consistent with what we previously disclosed in our 5-year maintenance case and our plan entering the year our objective is to reintroduce a disciplined level of steady-state activity back into Oklahoma and the Permian by 2022, at 20% to 30% of the total capital budget. 
When we do our expectation is that both assets will support accretive corporate returns and incremental free cash flow to the enterprise. I will now pass it back to Lee, who will provide a few more comments before we move to Q&A."

I would like to briefly put the 2021 capital program Mike just discussed into context by comparing our capital efficiency, our cost structure and our free cash flow generation to peer disclosures from the fourth quarter earnings season. As",732,"Thanks, Mike. I would like to briefly put the 2021 capital program Mike just discussed into context by comparing our capital efficiency, our cost structure and our free cash flow generation to peer disclosures from the fourth quarter earnings season. 
As highlighted by Slide 10 in our earnings deck, our 2021 capital program is among the most capital-efficient and free cash flow generative of any company in our peer space. The top 2 graphics summarized peer reinvestment rate normalized to a $50 and $60 WTI price environment. As you can see, our reinvestment rate, which is a reasonable proxy for both operating and capital efficiency in a maintenance or flat production scenario is among the lowest in our peer group. For capital we are spending, we are delivering more cash flow than virtually any of our peers. 
Similarly, our 2021 CapEx per barrel of production on either an oil or oil equivalent basis is among the lowest in our space. 
In the current more disciplined environment, operating and capital efficiency are paramount and, in fact, represent our competitive differentiators. Most importantly, as shown by the bottom right graphic, our free cash flow generation relative to our current valuation remains compelling and outsized against our peers and the broader market with a free cash flow yield approaching 20%. 
We continue to believe that we must deliver outsized free cash flow generation relative to the S&P 500 to effectively compete for investor capital. This is why we remain so focused on sustainably reducing our corporate free cash flow breakeven, now an integral part of our compensation scorecard and continuing to optimize our cost structure. 
With a free cash flow breakeven comfortably below $35 per barrel, we can generate free cash flow yield competitive with the S&P 500, assuming an annual oil price down to approximately $40 per barrel WTI. 
We never rest when it comes to our structure. In a commodity business, the low-cost producer wins, and Slide 11 provides additional details around our ongoing efforts and reinforces our multiyear track record of cash cost reductions. We have opted to use an all-in cost basis that normalizes peer reported data and avoids the challenges of how each operator categorizes their respective cost. 
As you can see from the data, our all-in 2020 unit cash costs are well below the peer average. On a more apples-to-apples comparison basis, our all-in unit cost are top quartile among our direct multi-basin peers. Specific cost reduction actions already taken this year are broad-based, including a 25% reduction to CEO and Board compensation, a 10% to 20% reduction to other corporate officer compensation, a workforce reduction to more appropriately align our headcount with a lower level of future activity, a full exit from corporate-owned and leased aircraft and various other cost reduction initiatives. 
Finally, I would like to again underscore the sustainability of all that we are doing. The sustainability of our sector-leading capital efficiency and free cash flow generation is underscored by the financial strength of our previously disclosed 5-year benchmark maintenance capital scenario. And our maintenance scenario is underpinned by well over a decade of high-quality inventory that competes very favorably in the peer group as validated by credible third-party independent analysis shown on Slide 13. 
The quality and depth of our inventory, in combination with our reinvestment rate capital allocation approach, provides us with visibility to continued strong financial performance. Further, we have a demonstrated track record of ongoing organic enhancement and inventory replenishment even in our maintenance scenario, we continue to direct capital toward resource play exploration and targeted organic enhancement initiatives, including our redevelopment program in the Eagle Ford. 
In conclusion, I truly believe our combined actions have positioned Marathon Oil for success not only relative to our E&P peer group, but relative to the broader S&P 500 as well. And our long-term incentives now reflect that conviction explicitly. Our company was among the first to recognize the need to move to a business model that prioritizes returns, sustainable free cash flow, balance sheet improvement and return of capital. We also led the way in better aligning executive compensation to this new model and with investor expectations. 
We are positioned to deliver both financial outcomes and ESG excellence that are competitive, not just with our direct E&P peers, but also the broader market. With that, we can now open up the line for Q&A."

So the new target is at least $500 million more for the year. Ultimately, you want to get to $4 billion gross versus the $5 billion that you're at now. 
And so what actually determines how much of that or what determines how much above the new $500 million target that you're doing specifically for this year. Does the at least part of the $500 million target, does that reflect that you need to do this opportunistically in the open market because you have to go after 2025 or is it more that you're just going to see whatever you can get done with free cash flow this year? 
And I guess, what we're really trying to back into is figuring out whether getting to that $4 billion growth is mutually exclusive to maybe pulling the trigger on the variable distribution to equity holders because, I guess, based on our free cash flow forecast, we think you could get to $4 billion growth by the end of the year, still have good operating cash balance, et cetera, et cetera."

I think at current commodity prices, Jeanine Wai, we are well positioned to meet all the financial objectives I laid out and get to sort of the next leg visibility to variable returns. Just if I can just back up a second and kind of frame up where we are. I went through it relatively quickly in my prepared comments. To our goal, 30% of cash flow from operations to investors in a combination of debt reduction and base dividend near term and then variable vehicles maybe longer term. On track from 40%, $1 billion debt reduction this year based on our new goal, plus $120 million of dividends. 
And paying down debt and looking at the base dividend and make sure it remains competitive or not mutually exclusive. We'll continue to look at that. Our goal has been to reduce net debt-to-EBITDA to sub 1.5x in a $45 to $50 world. Clearly, in the current market price world, where they're already but we're looking at a more conservative longer-term price deck than we're trying to manage to. 
In parallel with that, we laid out a $4 billion gross debt target. And so hence, your question, is it $500 million? Or is it more? And how are you going to accomplish it? We definitely will need to tender the 2022 $500 million maturity that we took out earlier this year was pretty near-term maturity. So we could just do make whole redemption on that. We'll be going to a tender process for the next tranche of debt. And it's more art and science for sure. You're really trying to balance the quantum of debt, the premium you're willing to pay and the ultimate interest rate -- interest expense reduction, which is a real benefit of the process as well. 
So market conditions matter a lot when you go. We'll certainly want to make sure we've got the cash to fund whatever we do. And so probably in the second half of the year will go. And the answer to your question is, will we stick to $500 million or will we upsize, it's really going to depend on market conditions at the time. We'll have to make a market judgment then. But it's certainly not off the table. The 1 other thing I'll leave you with, just a reminder that we have forward starting interest rate swaps with the notional value of $850 million. They have a mark-to-market value. Today's pricing of roughly $85 million. And it's very levered to 10-year treasury rates. So treasury rates go up, that those swaps will continue to go up. 
And that's a nice vehicle to help us pay premiums in a tender transaction."

It's kind of a philosophical 1 little nuance, not sure if it matters that it kind of does. But given good efficiencies and good well performance this year and you're already at the midpoint of the full year oil guide at 172 and you've been at that level for 3 quarters now. Is the preference for 2021? Is it to really hit the full year production guide on the lease amount of CapEx? And I guess I'm just asking because we see inflation on the horizon, we see activity picking up maybe more on the private side of things. And companies seem to be in 2 camps. And some say that they -- if they can produce more oil in the same CapEx this year, that's great. And others are just adamant that there's going to be no growth period this year. So we're just wondering what camp you're in?"

So that's where our focus is going to be is we're going to be really focused on meeting that objective that Dane put out there, which is a minimum of that 30% return of cash back to our investors. We're already trending well above that, above 40%, even with just the new debt targets and the base dividend increases. And I think we still will have -- again, if prices remain constructive, we still have additional headroom moving through the year. But that's really our perspective is to maintain that capital and operating efficiency and deliver on that more from a financial lens as opposed to a production lens."

I'll maybe offer a few comments, then I can certainly let Dane jump in. First, I would just say, Arun, everything is on the table. Our near-term priorities, I think, as Dane very clearly laid out, are achieving our gross and net debt reduction targets. The net debt reduction targets really calibrated to more of a mid-cycle pricing environment. Essentially, we're already there in the current environment, but we're not going to lean on just the EBITDA performance. We want to structurally improve our balance sheet. 
Hence, both the combination of both net debt and gross debt targets. Beyond that, as Dane mentioned in his opening remarks, is we still believe that we have room to grow within our base dividend structure. We've made 1 change. We bumped the dividend by a bit over 30% this quarter or at the -- subsequent to this quarter. And we still believe using that kind of 10% of cash from operations as a metric in a mid-cycle environment, that there is still room to maneuver there. 
So we believe in the near term, we have our priorities set correctly. As we transition from that, I think the other opportunities that you've highlighted become more in play. And again, we're not presupposing an answer today. We're going to look to get the capital back to our investors in the most efficient manner possible. We're continuing to look at how variable dividends are received in the marketplace. We also, of course, have the lever of still having an outstanding authorization on share repurchases as well. 
So that's a future decision. But clearly, it's 1 that is getting discussed today with the Board and internally. And we're also watching market response as well. But we think the starting point of structural gross debt reduction coupled with a competitive and sustainable base dividend is really the starting point to even have that discussion."

Doug, I guess, first of all, Doug, all opportunities in M&A, we're going to view through the lens of our very strong organic case.

In fact, yields approaching 20% on current equity valuation and all that's supported by well over a decade of very high-quality inventory with extremely low breakeven. 
So I say all that and couple that with the 5-year benchmark scenario because that really does, in many ways, set the bar that we have to clear for any M&A, large or small. And we have been very disciplined. We have a very clear criteria around any inorganic opportunities. We're not going to move away from that criteria. We operate in 4 of the key basins in the U.S. and not surprisingly, we're engaged in the evaluation and assessment that really anything that comes available. 
But what we're not going to do is we're not going to indulge in expensive M&A. That is something that is just not required in our model. Our model is very strong organically. And great rock is necessary but not sufficient for M&A. You must also capture value, you must also generate returns.

We actually provided a 5-year view of EG, which showed that even on a $50, $3 gas kind of view of the world across those 5 years, it generates about $1 billion of free cash flow, a couple of hundred million dollars a year. 
We continue to see opportunities there in the form of gas, like the a LEAN project that just came online earlier this year. We think there are other opportunities like that. Particularly as we look further afield to cross-border opportunities. In fact, EG and Nigeria just signed an HOA for cross-border cooperation. 
We have this extremely unique integrated gas infrastructure, as you mentioned, with an LNG plant, methanol plant, gas plant storage and offloading. And we're sitting in one of the most gas prone areas of West Africa. 
So we believe the value proposition for EG remains exceptionally strong. And certainly, when we look at it in the balance of our 5-year benchmark case, it remains a very strong contributor."

You obviously must have the financial performance. You have to be able to, in a commodity business with high volatility to generate free cash flow yields and that are going to be outsized relative to the S&P 500. 
And I believe certainly, Marathon is delivering on that commitment. On the nonfinancial performance side, which really, to me, is wrapped around our license to operate. I think you have to address all dimensions of performance there from safety to emissions, to good governance. And I believe there, we have placed ourselves in a very leadership position, whether you want to talk about executive comp, Board composition and refreshment and diversity. All of those things we have driven, specifically to the E and ESG, which generally means emissions. We have set very aggressive, but in our view, practical targets to achieve reductions in our emissions intensity footprint. 
We've set a single-year target that is integrated in with our compensation structure, which is a 30% improvement relative to the 2019 baseline. And then we've also set more of a midterm goal. And a goal that's not so aspirational and out in time that the current management doesn't feel the accountability for it. And for that one, it's a 50% reduction. 
And when you look at achieving that ultimate goal that places us, I believe, in a very competitive position relative to other sources of oil and gas post here in the U.S. and internationally. So I believe those green credentials are, in fact, improving in time. There's still much to do. I believe there is still a lot of opportunity. We believe that we're still in the phase of elimination and reduction first as opposed to offsets -- I mean, offsets and things like CCS will certainly play a role in the future, but the industry has a great opportunity just around flaring and gas pneumatics and moving to line power, all of these things that will help us move our emissions intensity footprint in the right direction. 
So I believe that the answer is that we have to deliver the financial performance. We also have to protect our license to operate through our nonfinancial performance and the way you do that is by setting aggressive but pragmatic goals that are really within the purview of the current leadership team."

I'll take our first cut at that, and certainly, any other guys want to chime in, they can. What I'd say is, overall, our costs were experienced, they're aligned with what we had in the budget, both in the capital and the expense space. 
We are seeing a bit of pressure in the OCTG area and to a lesser extent, in chemicals and fuels. OCTG, the driver there simply down to raw material availability and then some capacity constraints in the mills. Obviously, diesel, things like diesel fuel, chemicals, just tied into the rise that we've seen in WTI. 
In terms of what we're doing to mitigate that, we are seeing some success through some competitive tendering exercises and managed competition in other areas of the business. I'll provide a little bit of color in the 2 largest areas of our spend. So if I look at the rig space, for example, at the moment, we've got a mix of term contracts and pad-to-pad commitments. That provides us with a bit of flexibility, but also some insight into the prevailing market conditions. 
And that certainly allows us to be opportunistic, particularly maybe as we think about getting ready for next year. In the pressure pumping space, we've recently tendered our Bakken scope. We had no commercial surprises there. A crew is now on contract through the end of the year and operating well. In the Eagle Ford, the main crew that we've got there, they're on contract through into the beginning of the fourth quarter. So all of those costs are tied down. 
Interestingly, we've also gone out with some tenders for some spot crews. We're seeing very competitive rates there, again, all in line with the forecast that we had for the year. So I'd probably wrap it up by saying that we are on track to deliver certainly our completed well cost per footage targets that we laid out in the Eagle Ford and Bakken. And as I mentioned earlier, our full year capital budget of $1 billion."

Well, obviously, it's a complex case that we're following very closely. There's a lot of motions pending now, but there's 1 pending with the district court to enjoin the continued operation of DAPL and DAPL is preparing to file an appeal of the DC circuit course decision with the Supreme Court. So we'll just continue to monitor that. 
We won't speculate on the outcome. We do believe that if DAPL is ordered to shut down, there's a variety of stakeholders in the communities where we do business, which include the state of North Dakota itself and the 3 affiliated tribes, the MHA nation, which will be significantly impacted. In fact, MHA nation has recently disclosed that estimates losses of more than $160 million over a 1-year period and more than $250 million over a 2-year period, which is why they've come out in support of DAPL's continued operation. 
In terms of our impact, we've talked about that we really only have direct exposure to DAPL of about 10,000 barrels a day net. We have no flow assurance concerns. We made that disclosure to try to give some clarity on what the overall impact could be for us on cash flow, that $50 million to $60 million that we disclosed last quarter would assume a June 1 shutdown. Obviously, as this plays out, that's probably a conservative estimate. It probably would flow a little longer than that. 
On a full year, we'd expect an initial sort of blowout in the in-basin diffs, but then we think things would settle down to the marginal cost to transport barrels. And there's plenty of capacity from a rail standpoint to clear the basin. So from a full year perspective, we think it'd just be slightly above the $50 million to $60 million if it lingered for a long period of time."

I want to begin by once again thanking our employees and contractors for their dedication and hard work and putting together another quarter of outstanding execution.  
Not only have our teams continue to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic as critical essential infrastructure providers. They also successfully overcame the challenges of Winter Storm Uri during first quarter, maintaining their focus on safety, while still delivering on all of our core operational and financial objectives.  
Though 2020 was a challenging year for our industry, it also brought with it opportunity. And Marathon Oil chose to leverage the supply/demand crisis to further optimize and enhance our business model. We high-graded and focused our capital program. We lowered our cost structure and we further improved our financial strength and flexibility. As a result, we have dramatically enhanced the resilience of our company, driving our free cash flow breakevens consistently below $35 per barrel WTI and building on a multiyear trend of sustainable free cash flow and getting that cash back in the hands of our investors.  
And we have dramatically enhanced our ability to sustainably deliver robust financial outcomes. Financial outcomes that can compete with any sector in the S&P 500 and do so across a much broader and lower range of commodity prices. We recognize that given the inherent volatility of our commodity business that we must offer outsized free cash flow generation, coupled with investor-friendly actions to make a compelling investment case. To that end, first quarter '21 results are a testament to the strength of our business model and how we have positioned our company for success.  
During first quarter, we generated over $440 million of free cash flow. Despite the challenges associated with Winter Storm Uri, production volumes were in line with the midpoint of our full year 2021 guidance, and we are fully on track to meet the annual production, CapEx and cost guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. And we are on track to exceed our free cash flow objectives. 
For $1 billion of capital spending, we now expect to generate $1.6 billion of free cash flow at $60 per barrel WTI, up from the prior guidance of around $1.5 billion. This corresponds to a free cash flow yield approaching 20% and a sub 40% reinvestment rate. All at an assumed oil price that is below the current forward curve. We remain committed to our $1 billion capital program. There will be no change to our capital budget even if oil prices continue to strengthen. We will simply generate more free cash flow and further solidify our standing as an industry leader when it comes to capital discipline, a hard-earned reputation we have established over multiple years. We have accelerated our balance sheet and return of capital objectives, the specifics of which Dane will cover in just a few minutes.  
Importantly, everything that we are doing is sustainable. Our peer-leading capital efficiency, our outsized free cash flow generation, our competitive cost structure, our investment-grade balance sheet and our rising return of capital profile. The proof point for this sustainability is our 5-year benchmark maintenance scenario that can deliver around $5 billion of free cash flow from 2021 to 2025 and a flat $50 per barrel WTI price environment or closer to $7 billion of free cash flow at the current forward curve, along with a corporate free cash flow breakeven of less than $35 per barrel throughout the period. And the foundation for these differentiated financial outcomes is our multi-basin U.S. portfolio with well over a decade of high-return inventory, complemented by our integrated gas position in EG. 
Finally, we are leading the way in our approach to ESG excellence and are committed to continually enhancing all elements of our company's ESG performance. Safety remains our top priority, we are building on the record safety performance we delivered last year with a very strong start to 2021, as measured by total recordable incident rate. Best-in-class governance remains at the forefront of everything we do. We have appointed 2 new directors to the Board this year and remain committed to ongoing refreshment, independence and diversity. We also reduced and redesigned executive and Board compensation for improved alignment with investors as I highlighted early this year. 
And last but not least, we remain committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions intensity. We made tremendous strides during 2020, reducing our overall GHG intensity by approximately 25%. We are hard at work to achieve our GHG intensity reduction target of 30% in 2021, a metric hardwired into our compensation scorecard as well as our goal for a 50% reduction by 2025, both relative to our 2019 baseline. And we have included $100 million of investment over the 5 years of the benchmark scenario to support this goal.  
With that brief summary of how we have positioned our company for success, I would like to turn it over to our CFO, Dane Whitehead, to share the notable acceleration of our balance sheet and return of capital objectives."

At the center of our capital allocation and reinvestment rate framework is our objective to return at least 30% of our cash flow from operations back to our investors. Our capital return strategy prioritizes ba",740,"Thank you, Lee, and good morning, everybody. At the center of our capital allocation and reinvestment rate framework is our objective to return at least 30% of our cash flow from operations back to our investors. Our capital return strategy prioritizes balance sheet enhancement through gross debt reduction and direct return of capital to equity holders through our base dividend and over time, likely through other return vehicles as well.  
We have a strong track record of generating free cash flow and directing that cash back to our investors, are fully committed to this model and are well positioned to meaningfully beat our objectives in 2021. When considering our updated debt reduction target on recent base dividend increase, we're actually on track to return well over 40% of our cash flow back to investors this year. 
First, we accelerated our 2021 gross debt reduction objective of $500 million, fully retiring our next significant maturity and we're now targeting at least another $500 million of gross debt reduction, bringing our total 2021 debt reduction target to $1 billion. Reducing our gross debt is entirely consistent with our goal to further enhance our balance sheet, our investment-grade credit rating.  
More specifically, our goal has been to reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA to below 1.5x, assuming more of a mid-cycle $45 to $50 per barrel WTI environment. We're making rapid progress toward achieving this milestone by the end of the year. And in parallel, our aim is to significantly reduce our gross debt moving toward a $4 billion gross debt level.  
Beyond the obvious benefit to our financial flexibility, the interest expense reductions associated with the structural gross debt reduction have the added potential to fund future dividend increases at no incremental cost to the company, thereby preserving our very competitive post-dividend corporate free cash flow breakeven.  
Along with reducing our gross debt, we also raised our quarterly base dividend by 33%. Our objective is to pay a base dividend that is both competitive relative to our peer group in the S&P 500 and sustainable throughout commodity price cycles. Our decision to raise our dividend is a sign of our confidence in the strength and sustainability of our financial performance, and we see potential for disciplined, sustainable and competitive base dividend growth over time. 
We're targeting up to 10% of our cash flow from operations toward the base dividend, assuming $45 to $50 price environment, and we currently have ample headroom to progress under this framework. And to ensure sustainability through the price cycle, we're focused on maintaining our post-dividend breakeven well below $40 a barrel WTI. In fact, even with the recent dividend increase, our post-dividend free cash flow breakeven currently sits around $35 per barrel of WTI.  
In summary, we are well positioned this year to return over 40% of our cash flow to investors through gross debt reduction and our base dividend, our top near-term priorities. As we make significant progress toward our $4 billion gross debt objective, we will likely take the balance of 2021 to accomplish. And as we continue to advance further base dividend growth in line with our framework, we'll look to transition towards simply retiring debt as it matures and focusing more on alternative shareholder return mechanisms, including share buybacks or variable dividends, all funded through sustainable free cash flow generation. 
Before I turn the call over to Mike Henderson, who will provide an update on our 2021 operational performance and capital program, I'd like to address an issue that has been topical recently, and that is cash taxes. We are not a cash taxpayer in the U.S. this year. And at prevailing commodity prices, we don't expect to be paying U.S. cash federal income taxes until the latter part of this decade. This holds true even if the tax rules for intangible drilling costs or IDCs are changed or if the corporate tax rate has increased.  
We have significant tax attributes in the form of net operating losses, approximately $8.4 billion on a gross basis, in addition to foreign tax credits of over $600 million. These attributes will be used to offset future taxes. Neither of these items is energy sector specific, so we don't expect any new tax legislation to threaten them. The bottom line is we don't expect to be a U.S. cash taxpayer until the latter part of this decade. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mike Henderson, our EVP of Operations."

Our strong performance is due to tremendous execution from our asset teams during first quarter, despite the significant challenges associated with Winter Storm Uri. Flat quarter-on-quarter, total oil production of 172,000 barrels per day was quite an accomplishment in light of the operational challenges we experienced and the impact to production you've seen reported by peer companies.  
Our teams did an exceptional job keeping our volumes online and delivering much needed production at a time when utilities and households were in critical need. Our success began with extensive preplanning efforts and continued with a hands-on approach to managing our operations throughout the storm. We did not proactively shut in our volumes as a preventative measure, rather we fully leveraged our digital infrastructure to prioritize protecting our highest volume, highest rate wells, intelligently routing operators to our highest priority locations. All the while, we kept the safety of our people as our top priority. 
Our hands-on approach clearly paid off, and our operational and financial results speak for themselves. Our capital spending during 1Q came in slightly below expectations, reflecting solid well cost execution, but also the shift in timing of some capital from first to second quarter, largely due to storm-driven delays. 
Looking ahead to 2Q, we expect a slight sequential decline in our oil production, the result of fewer wells to sales in the first quarter, particularly in the Bakken. This is simply a function of the timing of our wells to sales, reflecting a natural level of quarter-to-quarter variability. We will continue to prioritize maximizing our capital efficiency and free cash flow generation sustainably over time, not the production output of any individual quarter. 
We do expect the significant increase in our second quarter wells to sales to translate to an improving production trend as we move into third quarter. With the increase in wells to sales and shifting capital from 1Q to 2Q, we expect 2Q CapEx to rise to the $300 million range, likely representing the peak CapEx quarter for the year. Still, our capital program is fairly well balanced and ratable, split almost 50-50 between the first half and second half of the year. 
More importantly, our full year capital spending and production guidance remain unchanged. As the most capital-efficient basins across the Lower 48, the Bakken and Eagle Ford will still receive approximately 90% of our capital this year. However, both our Oklahoma and Permian assets have high-return opportunities that can effectively compete for capital today. Both assets provide capital allocation optionality, commodity diversification and incremental high-quality inventory. 
Consistent with what we previously disclosed in our 5-year maintenance case and our plan entering the year, our objective is to reintroduce a disciplined level of steady-state activity back into Oklahoma and the Permian by 2022 at 20% to 30% of the total capital budget. When we do, our expectation is that both assets will support accretive corporate returns and incremental free cash flow to the enterprise.
I will now pass it back to Lee, who will provide a few more comments before we move to Q&A."

I would like to briefly put the 2021 capital program, Mike just discussed, into context by comparing our capital efficiency, our cost structure and our free cash flow generation to peer disclosures from the fourth quarter earnings season.",734,"Thanks, Mike. I would like to briefly put the 2021 capital program, Mike just discussed, into context by comparing our capital efficiency, our cost structure and our free cash flow generation to peer disclosures from the fourth quarter earnings season.  
As highlighted by Slide 10 in our earnings deck, our 2021 capital program is among the most capital-efficient and free cash flow generative of any company in our peer space. The top 2 graphics summarize peer reinvestment rate normalized to a $50 and $60 WTI price environment. As you can see, our reinvestment rate, which is a reasonable proxy for both operating and capital efficiency in a maintenance or flat production scenario is among the lowest in our peer group. For every dollar of capital we are spending, we are delivering more cash flow than virtually any of our peers. Similarly, our 2021 CapEx per barrel of production on either an oil or oil equivalent basis is among the lowest in our space.  
In the current more disciplined environment, operating and capital efficiency are paramount and, in fact, represent our competitive differentiators. Most importantly, as shown by the bottom right graphic, our free cash flow generation relative to our current valuation remains compelling and outsized against our peers and the broader market with a free cash flow yield approaching 20%.  
We continue to believe that we must deliver outsized free cash flow generation relative to the S&P 500 to effectively compete for investor capital. This is why we remain so focused on sustainably reducing our corporate free cash flow breakeven, now an integral part of our compensation scorecard, and continuing to optimize our cost structure.  
With a free cash flow breakeven comfortably below $35 per barrel, we can generate free cash flow yield competitive with the S&P 500, assuming an annual oil price down to approximately $40 per barrel WTI.  
We never rest when it comes to our structure. In a commodity business, the low-cost producer wins, and Slide 11 provides additional details around our ongoing efforts and reinforces our multiyear track record of cash cost reductions. We have opted to use an all-in cost basis that normalizes peer-reported data and avoids the challenges of how each operator categorizes their respective cost.  
As you can see from the data, our all-in 2020 unit cash costs are well below the peer average. On a more apples-to-apples comparison basis, our all-in unit cost are top quartile among our direct multi-basin peers. Specific cost reduction actions already taken this year are broad-based, including a 25% reduction to CEO and Board compensation, a 10% to 20% reduction to other corporate officer compensation, a workforce reduction to more appropriately align our headcount with a lower level of future activity, a full exit from corporate-owned and leased aircraft and various other cost reduction initiatives.  
Finally, I would like to again underscore the sustainability of all that we are doing. The sustainability of our sector-leading capital efficiency and free cash flow generation is underscored by the financial strength of our previously disclosed 5-year benchmark maintenance capital scenario. And our maintenance scenario is underpinned by well over a decade of high-quality inventory that competes very favorably in the peer group as validated by credible third-party independent analysis shown on Slide 13. The quality and depth of our inventory, in combination with our reinvestment rate capital allocation approach, provides us with visibility to continued strong financial performance. 
Further, we have a demonstrated track record of ongoing organic enhancement and inventory replenishment. Even in our maintenance scenario, we continue to direct capital toward resource play exploration and targeted organic enhancement initiatives, including our redevelopment program in the Eagle Ford.  
In conclusion, I truly believe our combined actions have positioned Marathon Oil for success not only relative to our E&P peer group, but relative to the broader S&P 500 as well. And our long-term incentives now reflect that conviction explicitly. Our company was among the first to recognize the need to move to a business model that prioritizes returns, sustainable free cash flow, balance sheet improvement and return of capital. We also led the way in better aligning executive compensation to this new model and with investor expectations. We are positioned to deliver both financial outcomes and ESG excellence that are competitive, not just with our direct E&P peers, but also the broader market. 
With that, we can now open up the line for Q&A."

So the new target is at least $500 million more for the year. Ultimately, you want to get to $4 billion gross versus the $5 billion that you're at now. And -- so what actually determines how much of that -- or what determines how much above the new $500 million target that you're doing specifically for this year? Does the at least part of the $500 million target, does that reflect that you need to do this opportunistically in the open market because you have to go after 2025 or is it more that you're just going to see whatever you can get done with free cash flow this year?  
And I guess, what we're really trying to back into is figuring out whether getting to that $4 billion growth is mutually exclusive to maybe pulling the trigger on the variable distribution to equity holders because, I guess, based on our free cash flow forecast, we think you could get to $4 billion growth by the end of the year, still have good operating cash balance, et cetera, et cetera."

I think at current commodity prices, Jeanine, we are well positioned to meet all the financial objectives I laid out and get to sort of the next leg of visibility to variable returns. Just kind of -- if I can just back up a second and kind of frame up where we are. I went through it relatively quickly in my prepared comments. To our goal, 30% of cash flow from operations to investors in a combination of debt reduction and base dividend near term and then variable vehicles maybe longer term. On track from 40%, $1 billion debt reduction this year based on our new goal, plus $120 million of dividends. And paying down debt and looking at the base dividend and make sure it remains competitive or not mutually exclusive, we'll continue to look at that. 
Our goal has been to reduce net debt-to-EBITDA to sub 1.5x in a $45 to $50 world. Clearly, in the current market price world, where they're already, but we're looking at a more conservative longer-term price deck and we're trying to manage, too. In parallel with that, we laid out a $4 billion gross debt target. And so hence, your question, is it $500 million? Or is it more? And how are you going to accomplish it? We definitely will need to tender the 2022 $500 million maturity that we took out earlier this year was pretty near-term maturity. So we could just do -- make whole redemption on that. We'll be going to a tender process for the next tranche of debt. And it's more art and science for sure. You're really trying to balance the quantum of debt, the premium you're willing to pay and the ultimate interest rate -- interest expense reduction, which is a real benefit of the process as well.  
So market conditions matter a lot when you go. We'll certainly want to make sure we've got the cash to fund whatever we do. And so probably in the second half of the year, we'll go -- and the answer to your question is, will we stick to $500 million or will we upsize, it's really going to depend on market conditions at the time. We'll have to make a market judgment then. But it's certainly not off the table. 
The 1 other thing I'll leave you with, just a reminder that we have forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional value of $850 million. They have a mark-to-market value. Today's pricing of roughly $85 million. And it's very levered to 10-year treasury rates. So if treasury rates go up, that -- those swaps will continue to go up. And that's a nice vehicle to help us pay premiums in a tender transaction."

But given good efficiencies and good well performance this year and you're already at the midpoint of the full year oil guide at 172 and you've been at that level for 3 quarters now. Is the preference for 2021, is it to really hit the full year production guide on the least amount of CapEx? And I guess I'm just asking because we see inflation on the horizon, we see activity picking up maybe more on the private side of things. And companies seem to be in 2 camps. And some say that they -- if they can produce more oil in the same CapEx this year, that's great. And others are just adamant that there's going to be no growth period this year. So we're just wondering what camp you're in."

So that's where our focus is going to be as we're going to be really focused on meeting that objective that Dane put out there, which is a minimum of that 30% return of cash back to our investors. We're already trending well above that, above 40%, even with just the new debt targets and the base dividend increases. And I think we still will have -- again, if prices remain constructive, we still have additional headroom moving through the year. But that's really our perspective is to maintain that capital and operating efficiency and deliver on that more from a financial lens as opposed to a production lens."

I'll maybe offer a few comments, then I can certainly let Dane jump in. First, I would just say, Arun, everything is on the table. Our near-term priorities, I think, as Dane very clearly laid out, are achieving our gross and net debt reduction targets. The net debt reduction targets really calibrated to more of a mid-cycle pricing environment. Essentially, we're already there in the current environment, but we're not going to lean on just the EBITDA performance. We want to structurally improve our balance sheet. Hence, both the combination of both net debt and gross debt targets. 
Beyond that, as Dane mentioned in his opening remarks, is we still believe that we have room to grow within our base dividend structure. We've made 1 change. We bumped the dividend by a bit over 30% this quarter or at -- subsequent to this quarter. And we still believe using that kind of 10% of cash from operations as a metric in a mid-cycle environment, that there is still room to maneuver there.  
So we believe in the near term, we have our priorities set correctly. As we transition from that, I think the other opportunities that you've highlighted become more in play. And again, we're not presupposing an answer today. We're going to look to get the capital back to our investors in the most efficient manner possible. We're continuing to look at how variable dividends are received in the marketplace. We also, of course, have the lever of still having an outstanding authorization on share repurchases as well.  
So that's a future decision. But clearly, it's one that is getting discussed today with the Board and internally. And we're also watching market response as well. But we think the starting point of structural gross debt reduction coupled with a competitive and sustainable base dividend is really the starting point to even have that discussion."

I guess, first of all, Doug, all opportunities in M&A, we're going to view through the lens of our very strong organic case. And we've already talked about that industry-leading capital efficiency, strong free cash flow yields. In fact, yields approaching 20% on current equity valuation and all that's supported by well over a decade of very high-quality inventory with extremely low breakeven.  
So I say all that and couple that with the 5-year benchmark scenario because that really does, in many ways, set the bar that we have to clear for any M&A, large or small. And we have been very disciplined. We have a very clear criteria around any inorganic opportunities. We're not going to move away from that criteria. We operate in 4 of the key basins in the U.S. and not surprisingly, we're engaged in the evaluation and assessment that really anything that comes available. But what we're not going to do is we're not going to indulge in expensive M&A. That is something that is just not required in our model. Our model is very strong organically. 
And great rock is necessary but not sufficient for M&A. You must also capture value. You must also generate returns. And so the same discipline that we exert in our organic business is the discipline that you're going to see on the inorganic side as well. We're engaged in the market.

We actually provided a 5-year view of EG, which showed that even on a $50, $3 gas kind of view of the world across those 5 years, it generates about $1 billion of free cash flow, a couple of hundred million dollars a year.  
We continue to see opportunities there in the form of gas, like the Alen project that just came online earlier this year. We think there are other opportunities like that, particularly as we look further afield to cross-border opportunities. In fact, EG and Nigeria just signed an HOA for cross-border cooperation. We have this extremely unique integrated gas infrastructure, as you mentioned, with an LNG plant, methanol plant, gas plant storage and offloading. And we're sitting in one of the most gas-prone areas of West Africa.  
So we believe the value proposition for EG remains exceptionally strong. And certainly, when we look at it in the balance of our 5-year benchmark case, it remains a very strong contributor."

Well, first of all, I think when we talk about the investment case, for E&P or for Marathon specifically, you have financial performance and you have nonfinancial performance. You obviously must have the financial performance. You have to be able to in a commodity business with high volatility to generate free cash flow yields that are going to be outsized relative to the S&P 500.  
And I believe certainly, Marathon is delivering on that commitment. On the nonfinancial performance side, which really, to me, is wrapped around our license to operate. I think you have to address all dimensions of performance there from safety to emissions, to good governance. And I believe there, we have placed ourselves in a very leadership position, whether you want to talk about executive comp, Board composition and refreshment and diversity, all of those things we have driven. 
Specifically to the E in ESG, which generally means emissions, we have set very aggressive, but in our view, practical targets to achieve reductions in our emissions intensity footprint. We've set a single-year target that is integrated in with our compensation structure, which is a 30% improvement relative to the 2019 baseline. And then we've also set more of a midterm goal. And a goal that's not so aspirational and out in time that the current management doesn't feel the accountability for it. And for that one, it's a 50% reduction.  
And when you look at achieving that ultimate goal, that places us, I believe, in a very competitive position relative to other sources of oil and gas both here in the U.S. and internationally. So I believe those green credentials are, in fact, improving in time. There's still much to do. I believe there is still a lot of opportunity. We believe that we're still in the phase of elimination and reduction first as opposed to offsets -- I mean, offsets and things like CCS will certainly play a role in the future, but the industry has a great opportunity just around flaring and gas pneumatics and moving to line power, all of these things that will help us move our emissions intensity footprint in the right direction.  
So I believe that the answer is that we have to deliver the financial performance. We also have to protect our license to operate through our nonfinancial performance and the way you do that is by setting aggressive but pragmatic goals that are really within the purview of the current leadership team."

I'll take first cut at that, and certainly, any other guys want to chime in, they can. What I'd say is, overall, our costs we experienced, they're aligned with what we had in the budget, both in the capital and the expense space. We are seeing a bit of pressure in the OCTG area and to a lesser extent, in chemicals and fuels. OCTG, the driver there, simply down to raw material availability and then some capacity constraints in the mills. Obviously, diesel -- things like diesel fuel, chemicals, just tied into the rise that we've seen in WTI.  
In terms of what we're doing to mitigate that, we are seeing some success through some competitive tendering exercises and managed competition in other areas of the business. I'll provide a little bit of color in the 2 largest areas of our spend. So if I look at the rig space, for example, at the moment, we've got a mix of term contracts and pad-to-pad commitments. That provides us with a bit of flexibility, but also some insight into the prevailing market conditions. And that certainly allows us to be opportunistic, particularly maybe as we think about getting ready for next year. 
In the pressure pumping space, we've recently tendered our Bakken scope. We had no commercial surprises there. A crew is now on contract through the end of the year and operating well. In the Eagle Ford, the main crew that we've got there, they're on contract through into the beginning of the fourth quarter. So all of those costs are tied down.  
Interestingly, we've also gone out with some tenders for some spot crews. We're seeing very competitive rates there. Again, all in line with the forecast that we had for the year. So I'd probably wrap it up by saying that we are on track to deliver, certainly our completed well cost per footage targets that we laid out in the Eagle Ford and Bakken. And as I mentioned earlier, our full year capital budget of $1 billion."

There's supply chain optimization and vertical integration, how we actually secure our services. And then finally, there's that commercial leverage side, which obviously is still 1 that we try to pull, just given our size and scale. But 3 of those 4 are very durable. They're not cyclical.

Well, obviously, it's a complex case that we're following very closely. There's a lot of motions pending now, but there's 1 pending with the district court to enjoin the continued operation of DAPL, and DAPL is preparing to file an appeal of the DC circuit court's decision with the Supreme Court. So we'll just continue to monitor that.  
We won't speculate on the outcome. We do believe that if DAPL is ordered to shut down, there's a variety of stakeholders in the communities where we do business, which include the state of North Dakota itself and the 3 affiliated tribes, the MHA Nation, which will be significantly impacted. In fact, MHA Nation has recently disclosed that estimates losses of more than $160 million over a 1-year period and more than $250 million over a 2-year period, which is why they've come out in support of DAPL's continued operation.  
In terms of our impact, we've talked about that we really only have direct exposure to DAPL of about 10,000 barrels a day net. We have no flow assurance concerns. We made that disclosure to try to give some clarity on what the overall impact could be for us on cash flow, that $50 million to $60 million that we disclosed last quarter would assume a June 1 shutdown. Obviously, as this plays out, that's probably a conservative estimate. It probably would flow a little longer than that.  
On a full year, we'd expect an initial sort of blowout in the in-basin diffs, but then we think things would settle down to the marginal cost to transport barrels. And there's plenty of capacity from a rail standpoint to clear the basin. So from a full year perspective, we think it'd just be slightly above the $50 million to $60 million if it lingered for a long period of time."

So and as Pat mentioned, we have very strong support within North Dakota, both the state government there as well as the 3 affiliated tribes. So -- anyway, so we want to be prepared, and I believe we are. But certainly, our view today is that DAPL will continue to operate safely just as it is today."

I want to begin by once again thanking our employees and contractors for their continued dedication and hard work in putting together another quarter of outstanding execution. It is their hard work that makes all of the accomplishments that we will discuss today possible. 
The combination of our high-quality multi-basin portfolio our differentiated execution and our commitment to capital discipline are driving truly exceptional results for our company. During second quarter, we generated $420 million of free cash flow, bringing free cash flow generation through the first half of the year to over $860 million. For our $1 billion full year 2021 capital budget, assuming $65 WTI and $3 Henry Hub, we now expect to generate $1.9 billion of free cash flow this year. This corresponds to a free cash flow yield north of 20% at a reinvestment rate of just 35% and and the corporate free cash flow breakeven well below $35 per barrel WTI. A powerful combination of results that we believe differentiates us against any company in our sector as well as the broader market. We are successfully delivering on all of our financial, operational and ESG-related objectives. We remain fully committed to capital discipline and our $1 billion capital program. As I've said many times, our budget is our budget and we won't raise our spending levels with stronger commodity prices, but will simply generate more free cash flow. 
Supported by such strong performance, we have just raised our quarterly base dividend by 25%. This is the second quarter in a row that we have increased our base dividend. We are also accelerating our balance sheet objectives, pulling forward achievement of our gross debt target, which will drive a shift in our return of capital focus toward equity holders. Further, we are enhancing our return of capital framework, now targeting at least 40% of our annual cash flow from operations to equity holders and a $60 per barrel WTI or higher price environment, while still retiring future debt at maturity. This is one of the most significant return of capital commitments to shareholders in our sector. Perhaps most importantly, everything that we are doing is sustainable. The proof point for the sustainability is our 5-year benchmark maintenance scenario. We previously highlighted that this scenario can deliver around $5 billion of free cash flow from 2021 to 2025 and a flat $50 WTI price environment with corporate free cash flow breakeven below $35 per barrel throughout the period. Updating our scenario for a flat $60 per barrel WTI price deck, highlights the power of our balanced but oil-weighted portfolio and the significant leverage we have to even modest commodity price support. At $60 flat WTI and an average reinvestment rate of 40%, we can deliver around $8 billion of cumulative free cash flow through 2025 or more than 90% of our company's current market capitalization. 
Integrating our updated capital allocation framework with this maintenance capital scenario provides clear visibility to a leading return of capital profile. Over $1 billion of capital return to equity holders per year in a $60 per barrel environment. And this consistent financial delivery is underpinned by well over a decade of high return inventory across 4 of the most competitive U.S. resource plays, complemented by our free cash flow generative EG integrated gas business. 
Finally, the ongoing pursuit of ESG excellence remains foundational to our strategy. Safety remains our top priority. Our first half 2021 safety performance as measured by total recordable incident rate stands at 0.29 and follows on from 2 consecutive years of record setting company safety performance. We have taken a leadership role in governance, particularly when it comes to reshaping executive compensation. We have reduced compensation for executives and the Board while also optimizing our framework for better alignment with shareholders and the financial metrics that matter. This includes the elimination of all production growth targets as well as the introduction of a cumulative free cash flow target in our long-term incentive program. 
And last but not least, we remain hard at work to reduce our GHG emissions. We continue to make progress towards achieving our GHG intensity reduction target of 30% in 2021. A metric hardwired into our compensation scorecard as well as our goal for a 50% reduction by 2025, both of these relative to our 2019 baseline. 
With that brief overview, I would like to turn it over to Mike Henderson, our Executive Vice President of Operations, who will provide an update on our 2021 performance."

Second quarter operational results were outstanding, demonstrating that we remain firmly on track to achieve or outperform all of the key 2021 financial and operational objectives that we established at the beginning of the year. First and fo",510,"Thanks, Lee. Second quarter operational results were outstanding, demonstrating that we remain firmly on track to achieve or outperform all of the key 2021 financial and operational objectives that we established at the beginning of the year. First and foremost, our consistent operational execution is translating to strong financial outcomes, $1.9 billion of free cash flow generation, assuming $65 WTI and $3 Henry Hub. A reinvestment rate of approximately 35% and a corporate free cash flow breakeven well below $35 per barrel WTI. Operationally, we remain disciplined and focused on delivering on all of our commitments. As Lee mentioned, there is no change to our $1 billion full year 2021 capital budget. Raising our spending levels is simply not a consideration. We are, however, raising our full year U.S. oil equivalent production guidance by 5,000 barrels per day or approximately 2%. Our full year oil production guidance remains unchanged. 
While full year guidance for CapEx and for oil production remains unchanged, I would like to address the production profile for the second half of the year. We now expect third quarter oil production to be relatively flat with the second quarter oil production of 170,000 barrels per day before an increase during fourth quarter towards the high end of our annual guidance range. The flat trend in third quarter is largely the result of deferred Bakken production. As a result, we are taking advantage of our multi-basin model and moving up a few Oklahoma and Permian wells in our schedule. This action is returns and free cash flow accretive, especially in the current price environment will be accomplished within our $1 billion capital budget and contributes to the 5,000 barrel a day increase to our annual oil equivalent production guidance. Our second half capital spending will be heavily weighted to third quarter. As schedule shifts now make this quarter our peak quarter for completion activity including a REx multi-well pad in the Texas Delaware oil play. More specifically, we expect third quarter CapEx to account for approximately 65% of our second half spending or around $340 million. Relative to peers, our 2021 capital program remains well positioned to continue delivering industry-leading results. As the top left graphic on Slide 9 shows, for every dollar of capital we are spending this year, we are delivering more cash flow than any other company in our peer group, a testament to our peer-leading capital and operating efficiency. We are also delivering top-tier free cash flow, as highlighted by a free cash flow yield of more than 20%. Our 2021 CapEx per barrel of production on either an oil or oil equivalent basis remains among the lowest in the sector, another indication of our capital efficiency advantage. Finally, the strength of our results is driving rapid improvement to our investment-grade balance sheet, which is already one of the strongest in our peer space. 
I will now turn it over to our Executive VP and CFO, Dane Whitehead, who will talk more about our balance sheet as well as our enhanced return of capital framework."

My key message today is that we're clearly delivering on our top financial priorities. We're generating significant free cash flow, bulletproofing our already investment-grade balance sheet and returning significant capital to our shareholders. 
Starting with our balance sheet. Strong operational and financial performance were enabling us to accelerate all the objectives we previously highlighted. This includes our $4 billion gross debt target, which will now be achieved in early September, when we close the full $900 million make-whole redemption of the 2025 maturity. With this balance sheet improvement, we're shifting our return on capital focus toward equity holders. To be clear, we've already made strong progress this year in returning capital to shareholders while simultaneously reducing our gross debt, it really has not been an either/or proposition. We've increased our base dividend in each of the past 2 quarters or by 67% over this period. The annualized cash interest expense savings from this year's $1.4 billion gross debt reduction will largely fund our last 2 base dividend increases, allowing us to keep our low corporate free cash flow breakeven on a post-dividend basis, effectively unchanged at $35 a barrel. Importantly, we're now at a key inflection point where we can accelerate the return of additional capital to equity holders above and beyond our sustainable and competitive base dividend. Our commitment is underscored by our enhanced return of capital framework, which now features a target to return at least 40% of our cash flow from operations to equity holders, assuming a $60 per barrel WTI or higher price environment, while also retiring future debt as it matures. To put this commitment into perspective, at a $60 price and with a maintenance level capital program, this equates to a return of over $1 billion to equity holders per year, an equity return equivalent of more than 11% of our current market cap. Though it's premature to discuss the 2022 capital program, at consensus -- consensus operating cash flow for Marathon in '22, our target return of capital to equity holders would be over $1.2 billion. This equates to a 13% return of capital yield, a leading return of capital profile among E&Ps and indeed across the energy sector at large. 
I'd like to emphasize that 40% of cash flow from operations is a minimum equity return target, and so there's upside potential. At $60 a barrel on a maintenance scenario, we'd still be building cash on our balance sheet, given our low projected reinvestment rate. And importantly, we don't necessarily have to wait until 2022 to get started. With the progress we made on our balance sheet and assuming continued strong free cash flow generation, it's reasonable to expect that we can begin making incremental returns of capital to our equity holders during the second half of this year in 2021. While we want to be clear and transparent regarding our commitment to deliver a peer-leading percentage of cash flow from operations back to shareholders, we will retain flexibility regarding the exact mechanism. Market dynamics change over time, and this flexibility will ensure that we're returning capital in the most efficient and most valuable way possible for our shareholders. The specific return of cash mechanism is something we'll continue to discuss with our Board and with our shareholders. While both buybacks and variable dividends are on the table, we certainly believe that with the free cash flow yield north of 20% and equity valuations disconnected from commodity prices, buybacks look like a very accretive option with the potential to significantly improve our per share metrics. As a reminder, we have $1.3 billion of share repurchase authorization currently outstanding. 
I'll now turn it back to Lee, who will provide his closing remarks."

To close, I would like to briefly reiterate a few of the key takeaways from our second quarter and year-to-date results. It should be clear that we have successfully positioned our company to deliver strong financial performance, not only relative to our E&P peers, but relative to the broader S&P 500 as well. And we can now deliver the strong performance at a wide range of commodity prices. We are price takers, not price predictors and must be prepared to not only survive but to thrive in a volatile commodity environment. We are proving this year, we can deliver outsized financial performance versus the broader market when we experienced commodity price support, highlighted by an expected $1.9 billion of free cash flow generation this year. Yet perhaps more importantly, we are positioned to deliver a competitive free cash flow yield with the S&P 500 at much lower prices than we see today, all the way down to $40 per barrel WTI oil price. Such is the power of our sustainable cost structure reductions, our capital and operating efficiency improvements, which combined to generate our sub-$35 per barrel breakeven. To use Dane's term, we have further bullet-proofed our investment-grade balance sheet, accelerating both our gross debt and net debt leverage objectives. And with this balance sheet improvement, we are now at an inflection point for capital return to equity holders, supported by an enhanced framework that provides clear visibility to a peer-leading return of capital profile. And all of this is sustainable, highlighted by $8 billion of free cash flow through 2025 and our $60 per barrel maintenance scenario with the majority of that free cash flow going back to our equity investors, consistent with our capital allocation priorities. 
To close, our company was among the first to recognize the need to move to a business model that prioritizes returns, sustainable free cash flow, balance sheet improvement and return of capital. We have also led the way in better aligning executive compensation to this new model and with investor expectations. We are positioned to deliver both financial outcomes and ESG excellence that are competitive not just with our direct E&P peers, but also the broader market. 
With that, we can open up the line for Q&A."

So the short answer to the question, I said in my opening comments, is we feel like we can begin this enhanced return to equity holders in 2021. But let me give you a little more context than that. So you understand kind of where -- what I'm looking at as to when we start doing that, and then I'll get on to your question about how do we execute it. 
So financial priorities are clear. We haven't changed those, generate corporate returns with significant sustainable free cash flow, bullet-proof already investment-grade balance sheet and return a significant amount of capital to shareholders. Well ahead of schedule on our balance sheet plan and assuming continued commodity price support and associated free cash flow, we think we can start to make incremental returns above our base dividend to equity holders in the second half of this year. On the base dividend, let me touch on that for a second. We've increased that twice now this year. The cumulative impact of that is a 67% increase year-to-date. At the same time, we've accelerated gross debt reduction by $1.4 billion. And there's a synergy there. The annualized interest savings from the gross debt reduction will essentially pay for the dividend increases. So our post-dividend enterprise breakeven, it's really holding flat at $35 a barrel as a result of that synergy. So getting the returns to equity holders and improving the balance sheet, I'd say, walking and chewing gum, mission accomplished but more to come. So strong operational and financial performance year-to-date and commodity prices allowed us to really accelerate the balance sheet to get to what I laid out in our last quarterly call as my bogey, which is a $4 billion gross debt target. We gave notice to the trustee on those 2025 bonds and $900 million maturity yesterday that we intend to exercise the make-whole on the entire amount. It will close on September 3. And so after we do that make-whole redemption on September 3, I would say it will take a bit of time to rebuild cash to a level where we can manage intra-month sort of working capital swings without having to lean too heavily on our credit facility. But given the commodity price support we're getting right now, that should happen pretty quickly. And so with our balance sheet of goals, goals achieved and continued supportive commodity prices, we're right there at the inflection point where we can start moving ahead. And like I said, once -- once we get reasonable cash level, I think of like $400 million is probably a reasonable amount, and then we can move forward. 
In terms of how do we execute on this thing, we've done share repurchases historically and have really approached it on sort of a ratable basis, thinking about it maybe a quarter at a time, set aside an amount of cash flow that generally that we've already generated that we want to use to purchase -- repurchase shares over that period was at 60 or 90 days. And then just execute it ratably sort of dollar cost averaging into it. And you can do that seamlessly. It allows you to manage your repurchase -- share repurchase limits more easily -- daily limits more easily when you do it that way as opposed to try and outsmart the market and buy in bulk on big -- in big chunks."

And I was just kind of just like how do you determine like this is a -- we're now looking at a 40% payout versus a 30% payout because, obviously, commodity prices right now really point to more of a 40%, but obviously, things can fluctuate. So is it on the quarter that was just accrued or the year that was accrued or just the dynamics that are kind of currently in the market? And I think you all have a high-class problem. And sort of my second question is that when you look over each year, you've got $1 billion of cash that could come back to equity holders. Your buyback is $1.3 billion, your dividend base -- dividends is $150 million. So like you've guided you a lot more in terms of like giving money back to shareholders. And so obviously, there's a lot of different mechanisms you can look at. But like how do you think about what the best way to incrementally give back? And I know it's probably a little premature for that, but if you can give us some structurally on how you think about that high-class problem of like giving money back?"

And then we can come back to are we targeting 40% or 30% based on fluctuations in commodity price. So buybacks versus variable dividends, it's obviously something we we have discussed frequently with our Board. We engage with shareholders about that on a regular basis. The bottom line is our clear commitment is to be delivering peer-leading returns back to shareholders regardless of the vehicle. Both options are on the table and there are pros and cons to each. And here's how we think about them. In the case of buybacks, with energy equity valuations so disconnected from commodity prices and our free cash flow yield at north of 20%, buybacks certainly looked like a very accretive option for shareholders in the current environment. In fact executed consistently over time, they have the potential to significantly reduce share count and meaningfully improve all our per share metrics. And we're kind of in a new paradigm, which I think makes share repurchases feel a little different maybe than they have historically. In the new E&P model where capital discipline through commodity cycles provides a platform for ratable repurchases over time, whereas previously in a price -- improving price environment, the call for growth would have sent the capital to the drill bit or to acquisitions as opposed to back to shareholders. And the other point is our corporate breakeven has been driven so low that we could continue to generate free cash flow and execute buybacks at much lower prices and be more countercyclical than we were in the past. And of course, buybacks are more tax efficient from an investor's perspective compared to dividends. We do -- I noted in my comments, have a $1.3 billion share repurchase authorization outstanding currently. So that's readily available to us. 
In the case of variable dividends, they're interesting. They make conceptual sense in a cyclical industry, kind of new, unproven concepts in the, I guess, you'd say, across the U.S. and certainly within our sector. The juries out in our minds on whether the stock price will adjust reflect a higher implied yield, variable dividend structure. But we do have a couple of pure examples to watch, and we are watching that to see how that works. So we have flexibility to employ either or both models over time. And I would say there certainly is the potential for that to change depending on market conditions and what looks like the best value for for our investors. I think the share repurchase in the near term seems like a clear winner from a value perspective. And then we also have the flexibility within the base dividend, Scott, to increase that. That's -- our target there is to have sort of a 10% of operating cash flow in a pro forma $45 to $50 oil price environment in our base dividend. And today, we're probably more like 7% to 8%. So we have some upside on that as well, and we'll continue to -- we'll continue to think about that. 
The -- is it a $60 world and returning 40%? Or is it a $50 world and returning 30% question? Obviously, we're going to have to take a view. We will have quarters behind us when we've generated cash flow in a certain commodity price environment, and then we'll have a view forward. We'll have a forward curve and also our outlook. And I think all of that will inform the levels at which we're planning to distribute cash flow. And in 1 quarter, we decide we're going to dial it back a tad. We can always catch that up later. This year, we've been well above our target distribution levels, a combination of debt reduction and base dividend and I did want to emphasize that point in my opening comments. What we're talking about here are minimum targets, not maximum."

Obviously, if we have that excess free cash flow, we can re-up obviously our share repurchase authorization with approval from our Board, and we've obviously done that in the past. Additionally, as Dane mentioned, there still is that headroom that resides within our base dividend. And on the 40% versus 30% question, that's something that's going to be naturally governed by the free cash flow generation in a given month or a given quarter. And we're going to drive that free cash flow back to our shareholders. And that -- the 30%, 40% is kind of a natural outcome from that. And as Dane stated, that's a minimum objective. And if you look at the combination of our gross debt reduction of $1.4 billion and $100 million or so in base dividend this year, we're obviously well beyond that 40%. So anyway, it's a framework. It's one that we're committed to. I think what we're trying to, I think, give investors is a strong commitment on the quantum we're going to get back to our equity holders, a good transparency on timing around that, while also preserving flexibility to get that back in the most efficient manner possible, which, as Dane said, today, when we look at the facts and the market certainly, that would appear to be a leaning toward share repurchase."

Maybe looking a little bit further afield, when we think about '22, I'd say it's fair to say we still got a lot of work to do before we prepare to talk about it. Maybe coming back to '21, I think it is a similar message to what we've conveyed in the past. We're seeing kind of low single-digit inflation this year, and it has been driven primarily by OCTG. So steel, the raw material availability and even capacity constraints are kicking in. I think the positive from our perspective is we have pretty much pre-committed to the majority of our requirements for the remainder of this year. So not really anticipating any further significant pressure in that area. We have seen a little bit of pressure in other areas like fuels, chemicals, transportation-related services tied to WTI. We're seeing some labor challenges were its head from time to time. What I would say is we are managing to manage all of those, and we're doing that through probably a couple of areas, just increased competitiveness in tendering. So kind of leveraging more competitive tendering and just manage competition. I'd also say we're delivering offsetting efficiency improvements in other areas of the business that's helping us in. I think ultimately, it's showing up in our metrics. So for example, our completed well cost per foot performance. We're on track to deliver our targets in Eagle Ford and Bakken this year.

And certainly, that would look like the case to beat right now. Variable dividend, as Dane stated, is something that's relatively new. It -- conceptually yes, may make sense for a cyclical industry. But as we focus on financial metrics, particularly per share metrics, there is a natural synergy there, obviously, by going after share repurchase, particularly when those shares are fundamentally undervalued, whether that be on an internal NAV basis or just on macro indicators from the market side. And so that's what we're really focused on is in a more maintenance type world, how do we continue to improve our free cash flow yield and our per cash -- our per share cash flow.

More broadly speaking, prior full year guidance, as you probably recall, we were given $165 million to $215 million was the range of wells to sales that we were looking at. So midpoint of $190 million. We do expect that now to be a little bit closer to the $200 million range. We're expecting 50 wells of sales in both the Eagle Ford and Bakken over the second half of the year. As I alluded to in my prepared remarks, that is going to be weighted to the third quarter for both assets. And with Bakken probably weighted a little bit more to the third quarter. And then with the production deferment that we're seeing in Bakken, that is creating an opportunity in Oklahoma and Northern Delaware.

And even within, for instance, our $1 billion capital program this year, embedded in that, of course, is the Texas Delaware oil play activity that Mike just highlighted, but also within basin, we continue to do -- to chase opportunities that we refer to as organic enhancement opportunities that have the ability to either add incremental sticks and/or enhance the economics of existing inventory that we have in play. And generally speaking, we try to allocate something on the order of about 10% of our capital program towards those type of resource capture, inventory life type activities. And that's also even embedded in our kind of 5-year maintenance type scenario, that same type of approach. And again, as you say, the balance sheet gives us the platform to take some of that incremental risk on some of those resource capture opportunities. 
On the last one, just around the JV structure, JVs have typically -- particularly large-scale JVs, particularly in U.S. onshore. We have -- don't have a lot of really strong positive benchmarks there. They tend to really escalate the complexity. We tend to look at JVs or drill codes as a maybe a smaller scope opportunity to look at acreage that likely is much longer dated for us and that we likely won't get to from a value perspective in the near term. Large scale, I think we want to make sure that we're doing just what you asked, which is we want to protect the operational excellence that we generate in places like the Bakken and the Eagle Ford and certainly would not want to see that diluted somehow in a JV structure where some of that control maybe rest away from us. So not saying that all JVs are bad. It's just that we just can't point to a lot of large-scale JVs in the onshore U.S. that have made a lot of sense for both partners. So anyway, something that obviously, we'll always consider all options, anything that allows us to continue to leverage our operational expertise, we certainly want to consider that. But today, I would say that's pretty far down our list."

I want to begin by once again thanking our employees and contractors for their continued dedication and hard work in putting together another quarter of outstanding execution. It is",763,"Thank you, Guy, and good morning to everyone listening to our call today. I want to begin by once again thanking our employees and contractors for their continued dedication and hard work in putting together another quarter of outstanding execution. It is their hard work that makes all of the accomplishments that we will discuss today possible.  
The combination of our high-quality multi-basin portfolio, our differentiated execution and our commitment to capital discipline are driving truly exceptional results for our company. During second quarter, we generated $420 million of free cash flow, bringing free cash flow generation through the first half of the year to over $860 million. For our $1 billion full year 2021 capital budget, assuming $65 WTI and $3 Henry Hub, we now expect to generate $1.9 billion of free cash flow this year. This corresponds to a free cash flow yield north of 20% at a reinvestment rate of just 35% and a corporate free cash flow breakeven well below $35 per barrel WTI. A powerful combination of results that we believe differentiates us against any company in our sector as well as the broader market. We are successfully delivering on all of our financial, operational and ESG-related objectives. We remain fully committed to capital discipline and our $1 billion capital program. As I've said many times, our budget is our budget and we won't raise our spending levels with stronger commodity prices, but will simply generate more free cash flow.  
Supported by such strong performance, we have just raised our quarterly base dividend by 25%. This is the second quarter in a row that we have increased our base dividend. We are also accelerating our balance sheet objectives, pulling forward achievement of our gross debt target, which will drive a shift in our return of capital focus toward equity holders. Further, we are enhancing our return of capital framework, now targeting at least 40% of our annual cash flow from operations to equity holders and a $60 per barrel WTI or higher price environment, while still retiring future debt at maturity. This is one of the most significant return of capital commitments to shareholders in our sector. Perhaps most importantly, everything that we are doing is sustainable. The proof point for the sustainability is our 5-year benchmark maintenance scenario. We previously highlighted that this scenario can deliver around $5 billion of free cash flow from 2021 to 2025 and a flat $50 WTI price environment. With corporate free cash flow breakeven below $35 per barrel throughout the period. Updating our scenario for a flat $60 per barrel WTI price deck, highlights the power of our balanced but oil-weighted portfolio and the significant leverage we have to even modest commodity price support. At $60 flat WTI and an average reinvestment rate of 40%, we can deliver around $8 billion of cumulative free cash flow through 2025 or more than 90% of our company's current market capitalization. 
Integrating our updated capital allocation framework with this maintenance capital scenario, provides clear visibility to a leading return of capital profile. Over $1 billion of capital return to equity holders per year in a $60 per barrel environment. And this consistent financial delivery is underpinned by well over a decade of high return inventory across 4 of the most competitive U.S. resource plays, complemented by our free cash flow generative EG Integrated Gas business.  
Finally, the ongoing pursuit of ESG excellence remains foundational to our strategy. Safety remains our top priority. Our first half 2021 safety performance as measured by total recordable incident rate stands at 0.29 and follows on from 2 consecutive years of record setting company safety performance. We have taken a leadership role in governance, particularly when it comes to reshaping executive compensation. We have reduced compensation for executives and the Board while also optimizing our framework for better alignment with shareholders and the financial metrics that matter. This includes the elimination of all production growth targets as well as the introduction of a cumulative free cash flow target in our long-term incentive program.  
And last but not least, we remain hard at work to reduce our GHG emissions. We continue to make progress towards achieving our GHG intensity reduction target of 30% in 2021, A metric hardwired into our compensation scorecard as well as our goal for a 50% reduction by 2025, both of these relative to our 2019 baseline.  
With that brief overview, I would like to turn it over to Mike Henderson, our Executive Vice President of Operations, who will provide an update on our 2021 performance."

Second quarter operational results were outstanding, demonstrating that we remain firmly on track to achieve or outperform all of the key 2021 financial and operational objectives that we established at the beginning of the year. First and fo",510,"Thanks, Lee. Second quarter operational results were outstanding, demonstrating that we remain firmly on track to achieve or outperform all of the key 2021 financial and operational objectives that we established at the beginning of the year. First and foremost, our consistent operational execution is translating to strong financial outcomes, $1.9 billion of free cash flow generation, assuming $65 WTI and $3 Henry Hub. A reinvestment rate of approximately 35% and a corporate free cash flow breakeven well below $35 per barrel WTI. Operationally, we remain disciplined and focused on delivering on all of our commitments. As Lee mentioned, there is no change to our $1 billion full year 2021 capital budget. Raising our spending levels is simply not a consideration. We are, however, raising our full year U.S. oil equivalent production guidance by 5,000 barrels per day or approximately 2%. Our full year oil production guidance remains unchanged. While full year guidance for CapEx and for oil production remains unchanged, I would like to address the production profile for the second half of the year. 
We now expect third quarter oil production to be relatively flat with the second quarter oil production of 170,000 barrels per day before an increase during fourth quarter towards the high end of our annual guidance range. The flat trend in third quarter is largely the result of deferred Bakken production. As a result, we are taking advantage of our multi-basin model and moving up a few Oklahoma and Permian wells in our schedule. This action is returns and free cash flow accretive, especially in the current price environment will be accomplished within our $1 billion capital budget and contributes to the 5,000 barrel a day increase to our annual oil equivalent production guidance. Our second half capital spending will be heavily weighted to third quarter. As schedule shifts now make this quarter our peak quarter for completion activity including a REx multi-well pad in the Texas Delaware oil play. More specifically, we expect third quarter CapEx to account for approximately 65% of our second half spending or around $340 million. Relative to peers, our 2021 capital program remains well positioned to continue delivering industry-leading results. As the top left graphic on Slide 9 shows, for every dollar of capital we are spending this year, we are delivering more cash flow than any other company in our peer group, a testament to our peer-leading capital and operating efficiency. We are also delivering top-tier free cash flow, as highlighted by a free cash flow yield of more than 20%. Our 2021 CapEx per barrel of production on either an oil or oil equivalent basis remains among the lowest in the sector, another indication of our capital efficiency advantage.  
Finally, the strength of our results is driving rapid improvement to our investment-grade balance sheet, which is already one of the strongest in our peer space.  
I will now turn it over to our Executive VP and CFO, Dane Whitehead, who will talk more about our balance sheet as well as our enhanced return of capital framework."
314842,711859569,2364547,"Marathon Oil Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Oil Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everybody.

My key message today is that we're clearly delivering on our top financial priorities. We're generating significant free cash flow, bulletproofing our already investment-grade balance sheet and returning significant capital to our shareholders.  
Starting with our balance sheet. Strong operational and financial performance were enabling us to accelerate all the objectives we previously highlighted. This includes our $4 billion gross debt target, which will now be achieved in early September, when we close the full $900 million make-whole redemption of the 2025 maturity. With this balance sheet improvement, we're shifting our return on capital focus toward equity holders. To be clear, we've already made strong progress this year in returning capital to shareholders while simultaneously reducing our gross debt, it really has not been an either/or proposition. We've increased our base dividend in each of the past 2 quarters or by 67% over this period. The annualized cash interest expense savings from this year's $1.4 billion gross debt reduction will largely fund our last 2 base dividend increases, allowing us to keep our low corporate free cash flow breakeven on a post-dividend basis, effectively unchanged at $35 a barrel. Importantly, we're now at a key inflection point where we can accelerate the return of additional capital to equity holders above and beyond our sustainable and competitive base dividend. 
Our commitment is underscored by our enhanced return of capital framework, which now features a target to return at least 40% of our cash flow from operations to equity holders, assuming a $60 per barrel WTI or higher price environment, while also retiring future debt as it matures. To put this commitment into perspective, at a $60 price and with a maintenance level capital program, this equates to a return of over $1 billion to equity holders per year, an equity return equivalent of more than 11% of our current market cap. Though it's premature to discuss the 2022 capital program, at consensus -- a consensus operating cash flow for Marathon in '22, our target return of capital to equity holders would be over $1.2 billion. This equates to a 13% return of capital yield, a leading return of capital profile among E&Ps and indeed across the energy sector at large.  
I'd like to emphasize that 40% of cash flow from operations is a minimum equity return target, and so there's upside potential. At $60 a barrel on a maintenance scenario, we'd still be building cash on our balance sheet, given our low projected reinvestment rate. And importantly, we don't necessarily have to wait until 2022 to get started. With the progress we made on our balance sheet and assuming continued strong free cash flow generation, it's reasonable to expect that we can begin making incremental returns of capital to our equity holders during the second half of this year in 2021. While we want to be clear and transparent regarding our commitment to deliver a peer-leading percentage of cash flow from operations back to shareholders, we will retain flexibility regarding the exact mechanism. Market dynamics change over time, and this flexibility will ensure that we're returning capital in the most efficient and most valuable way possible for our shareholders. The specific return of cash mechanism is something we'll continue to discuss with our Board and with our shareholders, while both buybacks and variable dividends are on the table, we certainly believe that with the free cash flow yield north of 20% and equity valuations disconnected from commodity prices, buybacks look like a very accretive option with the potential to significantly improve our per share metrics. As a reminder, we have $1.3 billion of share repurchase authorization currently outstanding.  
I'll now turn it back to Lee, who will provide his closing remarks."

To close, I would like to briefly reiterate a few of the key takeaways from our second quarter and year-to-date results. It should be clear that we have successfully positioned our company to deliver strong financial performance, not only relative to our E&P peers, but relative to the broader S&P 500 as well. And we can now deliver the strong performance at a wide range of commodity prices. We are price takers, not price predictors and must be prepared to not only survive but to thrive in a volatile commodity environment. We are proving this year, we can deliver outsized financial performance versus the broader market when we experienced commodity price support, highlighted by an expected $1.9 billion of free cash flow generation this year. 
Yet perhaps more importantly, we are positioned to deliver a competitive free cash flow yield with the S&P 500 at much lower prices than we see today, all the way down to $40 per barrel WTI oil price. Such is the power of our sustainable cost structure reductions, our capital and operating efficiency improvements, which combined to generate our sub-$35 per barrel breakeven. To use Dane's term, we have further bullet-proofed our investment-grade balance sheet, accelerating both our gross debt and net debt leverage objectives. And with this balance sheet improvement, we are now at an inflection point for capital return to equity holders, supported by an enhanced framework that provides clear visibility to a peer-leading return of capital profile. And all of this is sustainable, highlighted by $8 billion of free cash flow through 2025 and our $60 per barrel maintenance scenario with the majority of that free cash flow going back to our equity investors, consistent with our capital allocation priorities.  
To close, our company was among the first to recognize the need to move to a business model that prioritizes returns, sustainable free cash flow, balance sheet improvement and return of capital. We have also led the way in better aligning executive compensation to this new model and with investor expectations. We are positioned to deliver both financial outcomes and ESG excellence that are competitive not just with our direct E&P peers, but also the broader market.  
With that, we can open up the line for Q&A."

So you understand kind of where -- wh",576,"Yes. Thanks, Scott. So the short answer to the question, I said in my opening comments, is we feel like we can begin this enhanced return to equity holders in 2021. But let me give you a little more context than that. So you understand kind of where -- what I'm looking at as to when we start doing that, and then I'll get on to your question about how do we execute it.  
So financial priorities are clear. We haven't changed those, generate corporate returns with significant sustainable free cash flow, bullet-proof already investment-grade balance sheet and return a significant amount of capital to shareholders well ahead of schedule on our balance sheet plan. And assuming continued commodity price support and associated free cash flow, we think we can start to make incremental returns above our base dividend to equity holders in the second half of this year. On the base dividend, let me touch on that for a second. We've increased that twice now this year. The cumulative impact of that is a 67% increase year-to-date. At the same time, we've accelerated gross debt reduction by $1.4 billion. And there's a synergy there. The annualized interest savings from the gross debt reduction will essentially pay for the dividend increases. So our post-dividend enterprise breakeven, it's really holding flat at $35 a barrel as a result of that synergy. So getting the returns to equity holders and improving the balance sheet, I'd say, walking and chewing gum, mission accomplished but more to come. 
So strong operational and financial performance year-to-date and commodity prices allowed us to really accelerate the balance sheet to get to what I laid out in our last quarterly call as my bogey, which is a $4 billion gross debt target. We gave notice to the trustee on those 2025 bonds, a $900 million maturity yesterday that we intend to exercise the make-whole on the entire amount. It'll close on September 3. And so after we do that make-whole redemption on September 3, I would say it will take a bit of time to rebuild cash to a level where we can manage intra-month sort of working capital swings without having to lean too heavily on our credit facility. But given the commodity price support we're getting right now, that should happen pretty quickly. And so with our balance sheet of goals, and goals achieved and continued supportive commodity prices, we're right there at the inflection point where we can start moving ahead. And like I said, once -- once we get reasonable cash level, I think of like $400 million is probably a reasonable amount, and then we can move forward.  
In terms of how do we execute on this thing, we've done share repurchases historically and have really approached it on sort of a ratable basis, thinking about it maybe a quarter at a time, set aside an amount of cash flow that generally that we've already generated that we want to use to purchase -- repurchase shares over that period -- it was at 60 or 90 days. And then just execute it ratably sort of dollar cost averaging into it. And you can do that seamlessly. It allows you to manage your repurchase -- share repurchase limits more easily -- daily limits more easily when you do it that way as opposed to try and outsmart the market and buy in bulk on big -- in big chunks."

And I was just kind of just like how do you determine like this is a -- we're now looking at a 40% payout versus a 30% payout because, obviously, commodity prices right now really point to more of a 40%, but obviously, things can fluctuate. So is it on the quarter that was just accrued or the year that was accrued or just the dynamics that are kind of currently in the market? And I think you all have a high-class problem. And sort of my second question is that when you look over each year, you've got $1 billion of cash that could come back to equity holders. Your buyback is $1.3 billion, your dividend -- base dividends is $150 million. So like you've guided you a lot more in terms of like giving money back to shareholders. And so obviously, there's a lot of different mechanisms you can look at. But like how do you think about what the best way to incrementally give back? And I know it's probably a little premature for that, but if you can give us some structurally on how you think about that high-class problem of like giving money back?"

So buybacks versus variable dividends, it's obviously something we have discussed frequently with our Board.",656,"Yes. Okay. Well, let me talk about that first. And then we can come back to are we targeting 40% or 30% based on fluctuations in commodity price. So buybacks versus variable dividends, it's obviously something we have discussed frequently with our Board. We engage with shareholders about that on a regular basis. The bottom line is our clear commitment is to be delivering peer-leading returns back to shareholders regardless of the vehicle. Both options are on the table and there are pros and cons to each. And here's how we think about them. In the case of buybacks, with energy equity valuations so disconnected from commodity prices and our free cash flow yield at north of 20%, buybacks certainly looked like a very accretive option for shareholders in the current environment. 
In fact executed consistently over time, they have the potential to significantly reduce share count and meaningfully improve all our per share metrics. And we're kind of in a new paradigm, which I think makes share repurchases feel a little different maybe than they have historically. In the new E&P model where capital discipline through commodity cycles provides a platform for ratable repurchases over time, whereas previously in a price -- improving price environment, the call for growth would have sent the capital to the drill bit or to acquisitions as opposed to back to shareholders. And the other point is our corporate breakeven has been driven so low that we could continue to generate free cash flow and execute buybacks at much lower prices and be more countercyclical than we were in the past. And of course, buybacks are more tax efficient from an investor's perspective compared to dividends. We do -- I noted in my comments, have a $1.3 billion share repurchase authorization outstanding currently. So that's readily available to us.
In the case of variable dividends, they're interesting, they make conceptual sense in a cyclical industry, kind of new, unproven concepts in the, I guess, you'd say, across the U.S. and certainly within our sector. The juries out in our minds on whether the stock price will adjust reflect a higher implied yield, in variable dividend structure. But we do have a couple of peer examples to watch, and we are watching that to see how that works. So we have flexibility to employ either or both models over time. And I would say there certainly is the potential for that to change depending on market conditions and what looks like the big -- best value for our investors. I think the share repurchase in the near term seems like a clear winner from a value perspective. And then we also have the flexibility within the base dividend, Scott, to increase that. That's -- our target there is to have sort of a 10% of operating cash flow in a pro forma $45 to $50 oil price environment in our base dividend. And today, we're probably more like 7% to 8%. So we have some upside on that as well, and we'll continue to think about that.  
The -- is it a $60 world and returning 40%? Or is it a $50 world and returning 30% question. I be -- obviously, we're going to have to take a view. We will have quarters behind us when we've generated cash flow in a certain commodity price environment, and then we'll have a view forward. We'll have a forward curve and also our outlook. And I think all of that will inform the levels at which we're planning to distribute cash flow. And in 1 quarter, we decide we're going to dial it back a tad. We can always catch that up later. This year, we've been well above our target distribution levels, a combination of debt reduction and base dividend. And I did want to emphasize that point in my opening comments. What we're talking about here are minimum targets, not maximum."

Obviously, if we have that excess free cash flow, we can re-up obviously our share repurchase authorization with approval from our Board, and we've obviously done that in the past. Additionally, as Dane mentioned, there still is that headroom that resides within our base dividend. And on the 40% versus 30% question, that's something that's going to be naturally governed by the free cash flow generation in a given month or a given quarter. And we're going to drive that free cash flow back to our shareholders. And that -- the 30%, 40% is kind of a natural outcome from that. And as Dane stated, that's a minimum objective. And if you look at the combination of our gross debt reduction of $1.4 billion and $100 million or so in base dividend this year, we're obviously well beyond that 40%. So anyway, it's a framework. It's one that we're committed to. I think what we're trying to, I think, give investors is a strong commitment on the quantum we're going to get back to our equity holders, a good transparency on timing around that, while also preserving flexibility to get that back in the most efficient manner possible, which, as Dane said, today, when we look at the facts and the market certainly, that would appear to be a leaning toward share repurchase."

So that is the essence of our framework.

Maybe looking a little bit further afield, when we think about '22, I'd say it's fair to say we still got a lot of work to do before we prepare to talk about it. Maybe coming back to '21, I think it is a similar message to what we've conveyed in the past. We're seeing kind of low single-digit inflation this year, and it has been driven primarily by OCTG. So steel, the raw material availability and even capacity constraints are kicking in. I think the positive from our perspective is we have pretty much pre-committed to the majority of our requirements for the remainder of this year. So not really anticipating any further significant pressure in that area. We have seen a little bit of pressure in other areas like fuels, chemicals, transportation-related services tied to WTI. 
We're seeing some labor challenges were its head from time to time. What I would say is we are managing to manage all of those, and we're doing that through probably a couple of areas, just increased competitiveness in tendering. So kind of leveraging more competitive tendering and just manage competition. I'd also say we're delivering offsetting efficiency improvements in other areas of the business that's helping us in -- I think ultimately, it's showing up in our metrics. So for example, our completed well cost per foot performance. We're on track to deliver our targets in Eagle Ford and Bakken this year.

And certainly, that would look like the case to beat right now. Variable dividend, as Dane stated, is something that's relatively new. It -- conceptually yes, it may make sense for a cyclical industry. But as we focus on financial metrics, particularly per share metrics, there is a natural synergy there, obviously, by going after share repurchase, particularly when those shares are fundamentally undervalued, whether that be on an internal NAV basis or just on macro indicators from the market side. And so that's what we're really focused on is -- in a more maintenance type world, how do we continue to improve our free cash flow yield and our per cash -- our per share cash flow.

More broadly speaking, prior full year guidance, as you probably recall, we were given $165 million to $215 million was the range of wells to sales that we were looking at. So midpoint of $190 million. We do expect that now to be a little bit closer to the $200 million range. We're expecting 50 wells for sales in both the Eagle Ford and Bakken over the second half of the year. As I alluded to in my prepared remarks, that is going to be weighted to the third quarter for both assets. And with Bakken probably weighted a little bit more to the third quarter. And then with the production deferment that we're seeing in Bakken, that is creating an opportunity in Oklahoma and Northern Delaware. So we're bringing a few wells online there as well in the second half of the year. Hopefully, that answers the question."

And even within, for instance, our $1 billion capital program this year, embedded in that, of course, is the Texas Delaware oil play activity that Mike just highlighted, but also within basin, we continue to do -- to chase opportunities that we refer to as organic enhancement opportunities that have the ability to either add incremental sticks and/or enhance the economics of existing inventory that we have in play. And generally speaking, we try to allocate something on the order of about 10% of our capital program towards those type of resource capture, inventory life type activities. And that's also even embedded in our kind of 5-year maintenance type scenario, that same type of approach. And again, as you say, the balance sheet gives us the platform to take some of that incremental risk on some of those resource capture opportunities. 
On the last one, just around the JV structure, JVs have typically -- particularly large-scale JVs, particularly in U.S. onshore. We have -- don't have a lot of really strong positive benchmarks there. They tend to really escalate the complexity. We tend to look at JVs or drill-Cos as a maybe a smaller scope opportunity to look at acreage that likely is much longer dated for us and that we likely won't get to from a value perspective in the near term. Large scale, I think we want to make sure that we're doing just what you asked, which is we want to protect the operational excellence that we generate in places like the Bakken and the Eagle Ford. And certainly, would not want to see that diluted somehow in a JV structure where some of that control maybe rest away from us. So not saying that all JVs are bad. It's just that we just can't point to a lot of large-scale JVs in the onshore U.S. that have made a lot of sense for both partners. So anyway, something that obviously, we'll always consider all options, anything that allows us to continue to leverage our operational expertise, we certainly want to consider that. But today, I would say that's pretty far down our list."

I want to start by once again thanking our employees and contractors for their continued dedication and hard work for their commitment to safety and environmental excellence and for their contributions to another quarter of outstanding execution and financial delivery. While I get the privilege of talking about our company's impressive results and outlook today, it is their hard work that may follow this possible. 
Through our commitment to capital discipline and our differentiated execution, we are successfully delivering outsized financial inc outcomes for our shareholders, highlighted by more than $1.3 billion of free cash flow year-to-date. For our $1 billion full year 2021 capital budget, at forward curve commodity pricing, we now expect to generate well over $2 billion of free cash flow this year, at a reinvestment rate below 35% and a free cash flow breakeven below $35 per barrel WTI. 
We are successfully delivering on all of our financial and operational objectives,; and achieving bottom line results that we will put head-to-head against any other energy company and against any other sector in the S&P 500. This strong financial performance has enabled us to pull forward our balance sheet targets. And this further improvement to our already investment-grade balance sheet has given us the confidence to dramatically accelerate the return of capital to equity holders. Under our unique return of capital framework, our shareholders get the first call on cash flow, a minimum of 40% of our total cash flow from operations in the current price environment. Consistent with our commitment to shareholder returns and our objective to pay a competitive and sustainable base dividend, we have raised our base dividend by 20% this quarter. 
This is the third quarter in a row that we have increased our base dividend, representing a cumulative 100% increase since the end of 2020, a sign of the increased confidence we have in our business. We are also targeting approximately $500 million of share repurchases during the fourth quarter with $200 million already executed. At a free cash flow yield north of 20%, we believe our equity offers tremendous value. Additionally, there remains a dislocation between our equity and strengthening commodity prices coupled with a more mature business model that underwrites repurchases through the cycle. Further, buying back our stock for good value provides the added potential of significantly reducing our share count, meaningfully improving all of our per-share metrics even under a maintenance scenario and increasing our longer-term capacity for continued per share base dividend increase. 
Looking ahead to fourth quarter, including our base dividend and planned share repurchases, we expect to return approximately 50% of our total cash flow from operations to equity holders, fully consistent with our return of capital framework that prioritizes the shareholder first. Our financial flexibility and the power of our portfolio in the current commodity price environment provided the confidence for our Board to also increase our total share repurchase authorization to $2.5 billion, to ensure we can continue executing on our return of capital plans as we progress through 2022. 
And perhaps most importantly, everything that we are doing is sustainable, backed by our 5-year benchmark maintenance scenario and our ongoing pursuit of ESG excellence through top quartile safety performance, significant reductions to our GHG intensity and best-in-class corporate governance. 
With that brief overview, I will turn it over to Mike Henderson, our Executive VP of Operations, who will provide an update on our execution relative to our 2021 business plan."

First and foremo",409,"Thanks, Lee. Third quarter operations were again solid, demonstrating that we remain on track to achieve or outperform all of the key 2021 financial, operational and ESG-related objectives that we established at the beginning of the year. First and foremost, our consistent execution is translating to outsized financial outcomes, highlighted by over $2 billion of expected free cash flow, with a material sequential increase expected in the fourth quarter, a full year 2021, reinvestment rate below 35% and and full year corporate free cash flow breakeven $35 per barrel WTI. 
Our gas capture during third quarter also exceeded 99%, as we continue to reduce our GHG emissions intensity. There is no change to our $1 billion full year 2021 capital budget. Raising our spending levels this year has never been a consideration, consistent with our commitment to capital discipline. There is also no change to the midpoint of our full year total company oil or total company oil equivalent production guidance. We're also raising our full year 2021 EG equity method income guidance for the second consecutive quarter to a new range of $235 million to $255 million due to stronger commodity prices. This is a 30% increase from the guidance we provided last quarter and a 120% increase relative to our initial guidance at the beginning of the year. 
Our full year production and EG equity method income guidance truly contemplate an unplanned outage we experienced in EG late in the third quarter. 
Looking ahead to fourth quarter, we expect to finish the year strong with our total company oil production increasing to between 176,000 and 180,000 barrels of oil per day in comparison to 168,000 barrels of oil per day during the third quarter. Our quarterly production volumes are all subject to some normal variability associated with well timing. But this more significant sequential increase is due largely to deferred production associated with third-party midstream outages, strongly well performance and solid base production management. We also expect our fourth quarter total company oil equivalent production to be similar to the third quarter at 345,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with a sequential increase in the U.S. offsetting a sequential decrease in Equatorial Guinea associated with the previously referenced outage. 
I will now turn it over to Dane Whitehead, EVP and CFO, and who will discuss how our strong operations are contributing to an improved balance sheet and an acceleration in return of capital to equity holders."

As I noted last quarter, our financial priorities are clear and unchanged, generate strong corporate returns with significant sustainable free cash flow, all prove our already investment-grade balance sheet and return significant capital to shareholders. Early in the third quarter, we retired $900 million in debt, bringing total 2021 gross debt reduction to $1.4 billion and achieving our targeted $4 billion gross debt level. With this milestone, we no longer feel the need to accelerate additional debt reduction. And going forward, we plan to simply retire debt as it matures. And please note that we have no significant maturities in 2022. This balance sheet repositioning was achieved well ahead of our original schedule, which opened the door to begin returning a significant amount of capital to equity holders. 
To be clear, these are returns beyond our base dividend which we just increased for the third consecutive quarter. Our base dividend is actually up 100% over that time period, now at $0.06 a share per quarter, and the $50 million of annual interest savings were realized due to lower gross debt will help fund a significant portion of this base dividend increase. Our equity return framework calls for delivering a minimum of 40% of cash from operations to shareholders when WTI is at or above $60 a barrel. This is a peer-leading return of capital commitment. It is also competitive with any sector in the S&P 500. Our fourth quarter is shaping up to be an exceptionally strong free cash flow quarter due to a combination of higher commodity prices and oil volumes quite a bit stronger than the third quarter. 
At recent strip pricing could take our operating cash flow to approximately $1.1 billion or about a 25% sequential increase versus the third quarter. Add to that an expected increase in dividend distributions from EG and lower CapEx relative to the third quarter peak and fourth quarter free cash flow could almost double to north of $850 million. So in Q4, we expect to have lots of flexibility to exceed our 40% of operating cash flow, a minimum threshold for equity returns. In fact, through our base dividend and approximately $500 million of share repurchases, we expect to return approximately 50% of our operating cash flow to investors during the fourth quarter while further improving our cash balance and net debt position. 
As we also mentioned, we believe that buying back our stock in a disciplined fashion makes tremendous sense. There are many opportunities in the market right now that provide a sustainable free cash flow yield north of 20%. Stepping back, the full year 2021 financial delivery is exceptional, $140 million in base dividends, $1.4 billion in debt reduction and $500 million of share repurchases representing a total return to investors combined debt and equity of over $2 billion or over 60% of our expected full year operating cash flow at strip commodity prices. Our actions in 2021 have successfully repositioned the balance sheet and kicked off a strong track record of equity returns. 
Going forward, we're going to stay laser-focused on our financial priorities and our return of capital framework, taking into account our cash flow outlook when making return decisions. Because our framework is based on a minimum percentage of cash flow from operations and not free cash flow, the equity investor will have the first call on cash, not to drill a bit. 
I'll now turn the call over to Pat Wagner, EVP of Corporate Development Strategy for an update on the resource play exploration program."

We recently completed our 2021 REx program program, which was focused on the continued delineation of our contiguous 50,000 net acre position in our Texas Delaware oil plant. As a reminder, this is a new play concept for both the Woodford and Meramec that was secured through grassroots leasing at a very low cost of entry and with 100% working interest. This is essentially an exploration bolt-on that is complementary to our already established position in the Northern Delaware. We brought online our first multi-well pad during the third quarter. And while it is still very early, initial production rates in both Woodford and Meramec are exceeding our predrill expectations. 
More specifically, one of the Woodford wells achieved an IP30 of almost 2,100 barrels of oil per day at an oil cut of 66%. This appears to be the strongest Woodford oil well ever drilled in any basin. And while we don't yet have 30-day rates for the other 2 wells, early indicators, including IP 24s are all very positive. A primary objective of this 3-well pad was to execute our first spacing test in the playing. To date, we are seeing no evidence of interference between the Woodford and Meramec, consistent with our expectations due to over 700 feet of vertical separation between the 2 zones. As I stated, it's still early, and we need more production history to draw stronger conclusions, but we are certainly encouraged by the initial results from this first spacing test, including the record Woodford productivity. 
The second objective was to continue to progress our learnings and cost improvements and completed well costs. We expect to ultimately deliver well costs comparable to those achieved in the SCOOP and are aggressively leveraging our substantial experience at Oklhoma much at that end. In total, we have now brought online 9 wells since play entry that have successfully delineated our position. The 6 wells with longer dated production have collectively demonstrated strong long-term oil productivity. Oil cuts greater than 60%, low oracle ratio below 1 and shallow declines. 
Looking ahead to 2022, you should expect us to continue to integrate our learnings and progress our understanding of this promising play. However, we will do so in a disciplined manner and within our strict reinvestment rate capital allocation framework. 
I will now turn the call over to Lee, who will wrap this up."

I will close with a quick summary of how we have positioned our company for success and a preview of what to expect from us in 2022. Spoiler alert, there will be no surprises in 2022 and no compromise with respect to our capital return framework. If we focus on the financial benchmarks that matter, we are delivering top-tier capital efficiency, free cash flow yield and balance sheet strength. Our 2021 capital rate of sub-35% and capital intensity as measured by CapEx per barrel of production are both the lowest in our independent E&P peer group, a strong validation of our leading capital and operating efficiency. 
We are also one of the few E&Ps expecting to deliver a 2021 reinvestment rate at or below the S&P 500 average. We're also delivering top quartile free cash flow yield this year among our peer group and well above the S&P 500 average. And we are doing all of this with an investment-grade balance sheet at sub-onetime net debt to EBITDA, a 2021 leverage profile also well below both our peer group and the S&P 500 average. 
In short, we are successfully delivering outsized financial performance versus our peer group and the broader market with the commodity price support we are experiencing this year. Yet perhaps more importantly, we are well positioned to deliver competitive free cash flow and financial performance versus the broader market at much lower prices than we see today, all the way down to the $40 per barrel WTI range. This is the power of our sustainable cost structure reductions, our capital and operating efficiency improvements and our commitment to capital discipline, all contributing to a sub-$35 per barrel breakeven. 
Looking ahead to 2022, our differentiated capital allocation framework that prioritizes the shareholder at the first call on cash flow generation will not change. Our commitment to capital discipline will not waver with maintenance oil production, the case to beat, as we finalize our 2022 budget. We believe the right business model for a mature industry prioritizes sustainable free cash flow, a low reinvestment rate and meaningful returns to equity investors, not growth capital. 
Recall that we introduced a unique 5-year maintenance scenario earlier this year that featured $1 billion to $1.1 billion of annual spending, $1 billion of annual free cash flow at $50 WTI and a 50% reinvestment rate. Given we are no longer living in a $50 per barrel environment and that prices are currently north of $80 per barrel, it is both prudent and reasonable to consider some level of limited inflation up to about 10% that would yield modest pressure on the maintenance scenario capital range. 
Yet importantly, this modest level of inflation pales in comparison to the uplift to our financial performance in the current environment, with a 2022 maintenance scenario free cash flow potentially on the order of $3 billion at recent strip pricing or nominally 3x the $50 benchmark outcome. And under such a maintenance scenario, we are positioned to lead the peers once again with a 2022 free cash flow yield above 20%, far in excess of the S&P 500 free cash flow yield of approximately 4%. Our minimum 40% of cash flow target translates to about $1.6 billion of equity holder returns next year. But that is a minimum, and we see significant headroom to drive that number higher. 
At the expected 4Q run rate of 50% of CFO, 2022 equity holder returns would increase to approximately $2 billion, while still improving our cash balance and net debt position. Even at a more conservative $60 per barrel oil price environment, our minimum 40% of cash flow targets still translates to about $1.1 billion of equity holder returns in 2022. And applying 2022 consensus estimates to the return frameworks disclosed by our peers, only confirms our leading return of capital profile, with a double-digit cash distribution yield to our equity investors in 2022. 
The confidence in this outsized delivery is further supported by recent Board action to increase our share repurchase authorization to $2.5 billion to ensure we have sufficient runway to continue delivering on our return of capital commitment next year. 
To close, our company was among the first to recognize the need to move to a business model that prioritizes returns, sustainable free cash flow, balance sheet improvement and return of capital. We have also led the way in better aligning executive compensation to this new model and with investor expectations. We are successfully executing on our model today, delivering both financial outcomes and ESG excellence that are competitive not just with our direct E&P peers but also the broader market. 
With that, we can open up the line for Q&A."

One is a little more tactical about how we execute the share repurchase. So briefly on that, we execute under short sort of 30- to 60-day 10b5-1 program. So we've kind of set those in motion and execute them over a short period of time. And because of that short duration, it allows us to really calibrate return percentages more on a real-time basis, based on what we're seeing in the business, whether it's capital spend levels, commodity prices, other aspects of what's going on. It also gives you the advantage in the 10b51 writing through blackout periods. And so we do that, sort of, stepping back a little more context for the decision process about when do you exceed the minimum. 
Our decisions are always grounded in our financial priorities, which we talked about on a regular basis, generate corporate returns, significant sustainable free cash flow, bulletproof balance sheet and then return significant capital to shareholders. We just talked about what we've done, year-to-date generated significant operating and free cash flow. Q4 looks like by far the best quarter yet from a financial perspective. The balance sheet is really strong, and we've retired $900 million of debt in September, $1.4 billion year-to-date. So we're at our $4 billion gross debt target ahead of schedule. And that really opens the door for much more substantial returns to equity holders to get the conditions warrant. 
We also bumped the base dividend for the third time this year. It's up 100% over that period. And it feels competitively positioned right now and also very sustainable through cycles at the current level. So we turn to the capital return framework that calls for returning a minimum of 40% of operating cash flow to shareholders when WTI is above $60. When we look at Q4, not only is WTI well above $60, all the commodity complexes are high. Oil volumes should be quite a bit stronger than they were in Q3. We expect an uptick in dividend distributions from EG and lower CapEx versus Q3, which was sort of the high point of our burn rate for the year on the capital side. 
So We expect to have lots of flexibility to exceed 40%. We also have a desire to continue to add some level of cash to the balance sheet, as we go through the year. Ultimately, our plans are to pay off debt, future debt maturities as they mature. And they aren't significant in the future, but it's nice to have that level of flexibility and in the process reduce our net debt. So all of this, I think it's a great example of our shareholder return framework in action. It's based on a minimum percentage of operating cash flow, but we have the ability and latitude to make real-time decisions to exceed those minimums when conditions are right, they sure appear to be in Q4. So just a little bit of judgment involved. Is it 50%, 55% or whatever that is, but we just need to make a call. And over time, we'll have the ability to modulate that, accordingly."

The well cost per foot, it decreased quarter-over-quarter in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. And would you characterize those decreases as sustainable for '22? And any color just on current inflation and your outlook for '22 would be helpful. For example, one of your peers mentioned earlier this week that they would adjust 22 activity if inflation warranted it. And I believe we said just now in his prepared remarks that 10% cost inflation would put pressure on the maintenance scenario. And I didn't catch whether that meant on the $1.1 billion CapEx or if that meant on activity."

And obviously, as we noted, the macro environment is pretty dynamic at the moment. We kind of highlighted third quarter being the lowest quarter of the year in terms of CWC per foot costs in both the Eagle Ford and Bakken were actually year-to-date, down 12% from where we were in the 2020 average. So what I'd say is while that's probably going to be our starting point for '22. And similar to what you've seen in '21, we'll continue to progress opportunities to improve our cost structure. I think as we noted, we could and we should start to see some inflation in '22. 
On the inflation question, maybe a little bit more color there. Let me start with '21. I would characterize that inflation is very much in check for '21. It's been largely confined to steel and OCTG. And we have fully accounted for that and our capital -- our $1 billion capital budget. As noted, we're working through '22 at the moment and seems reasonable to assume modest inflation. I think I would highlight that we are looking to take some actions. So for example, we've secured some of our reg frac sand and OCTG requirements for next year. I think maybe the area where there's quite a bit of uncertainty on labor, but that's probably a broader issue economy-wide. So as we noted, could see up to 10% inflation. I think that will depend on activity levels. But again, similar to '21, we're going to be working hard to mitigate and offset any of those cost pressures."

Clearly, all of the commodity prices are moving in a very constructive direction, which really has the net effect of really lifting all boats, even in our black oil plays of the Bakken and the Eagle Ford. And I think where we're really seeing the benefit of having that strength across the commodity complex is the fact that we have this very balanced portfolio already with about a 50% exposure to oil and a 50% exposure to natural gas and NGLs. 
So there's no -- our thinking hasn't changed. We believe there are extremely strong and competitive opportunities in both Permian and Oklahoma the strengthening in NGL and gas has only served to elevate those further, but oil has also elevated the returns in our other basins as well. So we feel the strength of the balanced portfolio gives us that great exposure across the commodity complete."

First of all, I would just start off by saying any transaction, any M&A, whether it be large or small, we're always going to view that through the lens of our very compelling organic case, our peer-leading financial delivery and really a strict criteria that's predicated on financial accretion. And so that's really the filter that we're going to view any type of opportunity. The same discipline that we apply to our organic opportunities, we certainly are going to apply in the inorganic space. We believe, obviously, that the Bakken continues to offer exceptional returns. If you look at some of the material within our earnings deck, you will see that certainly in some of the appendix slides just how competitive Bakken is relative to the other plays here in the U.S. 
But for us, it's really -- anything that we would look at inorganically but have to offer significant value. It would have to come in and move our full cycle returns in the right direction. And that, quite frankly, is a very high bar today. You could argue that the M&A market has become a little bit more of a seller's market today with the commodity prices that we're experiencing. And with over 10 years of extremely strong inventory, we simply don't see the need to do anything dramatic in the market, certainly, not do anything that would be dilutive to our exceptional financial delivery. But however, having said that on portfolio renewal, what we have talked about in the past is that embedded in that capital budget that we talk about each and every year, we have kind of up to about 10% of that dedicated to what we consider to be organic enhancement opportunities that could be things like redevelopment opportunities and the Eagle in the market. It could be things like the Texas Delaware oil play that Pat addressed in the opening remarks. And we want to make sure that we continue those programs on a consistent and sustainable basis. 
As we look out in the out years and make best attempts to continue to replace and replenish our inventory. I think the Texas Delaware oil play is a great example something that we were able to get into for a very low entry cost. And now it -- certainly, we see today a very clear path for that to compete for capital allocation. And we still have some work to do in terms of getting some longer-dated production information from the spacing test, and we want to drive some learnings into the D&C program, but there's definitely a path there for that asset now to compete, head-to-head, with some of the best in our current portfolio.

Well, I think stepping back from the inventory, when we had talked about the greater than a decade of capital-efficient, high-return inventory, Doug, it's really been based on kind of nominally or $50 WTI kind of mid-cycle view. As actual prices move around that planning basis, clearly, that has an impact on the tiering of those opportunities and may, in fact, even bring additional opportunities into the economic window. So it is a very dynamic thing. But we set that planning basis on conservatively so we could give a very conservative and strong view of just how our inventory can deliver in a more modest pricing environment. 
To your question around how does the commodity strengthening, particularly in the secondary products of gas and NGL alter our investment decision, look, we're a return-driven company. As we look at individual opportunities, we're going to be driven by economics. I won't say we're completely agnostic to the product mix. But at the end of the day, it's not about barrels, it's about dollars. And we're going to be driven by selecting the most economic opportunities across all of our core plays and then putting those into our business plan and executing efficiently against them. 
So it's strictly an economic decision. And although I'm I'm thrilled that gas and NGL has recovered, I'm equally thrilled that oil was sitting at above the $80 mark as well because that tends to uplift really all of our portfolio. Because although we have an oil-weighted portfolio, it is a very balanced portfolio. And so we are, in essence, taking advantage of those secondary product pricing at a portfolio level, but our individual capital allocation decisions are going to be driven by economics."

To the extent that we see that some moderate growth would fit into that financial framework, it would become a consideration. But it still remains more of an output of our financial model as opposed to an input. And I think given, I think, the past history of the sector, it's very important for us to demonstrate clearly that in a very constructive oil price environment, that we can deliver outsized financial outcomes relative to alternative investments because the reality is that we know there will be future volatility and we have to be able to, within that volatility, offer competitive returns when prices are lower. So it was really just set there to really put it in the framework, acknowledge it. I think today, we would say the need to drive to a number even in that 5% range, we just don't see that today.

I want to start by once again thanking our employees and contractors for their continued dedication and hard work for their commitment to safety and environmental excellence and for their contributions to another quarter of outstanding execution and financial delivery. While I get the privilege of talking about our company's impressive results and outlook today, it is their hard work that makes all of this possible.  
Through our commitment to capital discipline and our differentiated execution, we are successfully delivering outsized financial outcomes for our shareholders, highlighted by more than $1.3 billion of free cash flow year-to-date. 
For our $1 billion full year 2021 capital budget, at forward curve commodity pricing, we now expect to generate well over $2 billion of free cash flow this year, at a reinvestment rate below 35% and a free cash flow breakeven below $35 per barrel WTI.  
We are successfully delivering on all of our financial and operational objectives and achieving bottom line results that we will put head-to-head against any other energy company and against any other sector in the S&P 500. This strong financial performance has enabled us to pull forward our balance sheet targets. And this further improvement to our already investment-grade balance sheet has given us the confidence to dramatically accelerate the return of capital to equity holders. 
Under our unique return of capital framework, our shareholders get the first call on cash flow, a minimum of 40% of our total cash flow from operations in the current price environment. Consistent with our commitment to shareholder returns and our objective to pay a competitive and sustainable base dividend, we have raised our base dividend by 20% this quarter. 
This is the third quarter in a row that we have increased our base dividend, representing a cumulative 100% increase since the end of 2020, a sign of the increased confidence we have in our business. We are also targeting approximately $500 million of share repurchases during the fourth quarter with $200 million already executed. At a free cash flow yield north of 20%, we believe our equity offers tremendous value. Additionally, there remains a dislocation between our equity and strengthening commodity prices coupled with a more mature business model that underwrites repurchases through the cycle. 
Further, buying back our stock for good value provides the added potential of significantly reducing our share count, meaningfully improving all of our per-share metrics even under a maintenance scenario and increasing our longer-term capacity for continued per share base dividend increase.  
Looking ahead to fourth quarter, including our base dividend and planned share repurchases, we expect to return approximately 50% of our total cash flow from operations to equity holders, fully consistent with our return of capital framework that prioritizes the shareholder first. 
Our financial flexibility and the power of our portfolio in the current commodity price environment provided the confidence for our Board to also increase our total share repurchase authorization to $2.5 billion, to ensure we can continue executing on our return of capital plans as we progress through 2022.  
And perhaps most importantly, everything that we are doing is sustainable, backed by our 5-year benchmark maintenance scenario and our ongoing pursuit of ESG excellence through top quartile safety performance, significant reductions to our GHG intensity and best-in-class corporate governance.  
With that brief overview, I will turn it over to Mike Henderson, our Executive VP of Operations, who will provide an update on our execution relative to our 2021 business plan."

First and fore",409,"Thanks, Lee. Third quarter operations were again solid, demonstrating that we remain on track to achieve or outperform all of the key 2021 financial, operational and ESG-related objectives that we established at the beginning of the year. 
First and foremost, our consistent execution is translating to outsized financial outcomes, highlighted by over $2 billion of expected free cash flow, with a material sequential increase expected in the fourth quarter, a full year 2021, reinvestment rate below 35% and full year corporate free cash flow breakeven $35 per barrel WTI.  
Our gas capture during third quarter also exceeded 99%, as we continue to reduce our GHG emissions intensity. There is no change to our $1 billion full year 2021 capital budget. Raising our spending levels this year has never been a consideration, consistent with our commitment to capital discipline. 
There is also no change to the midpoint of our full year total company oil or total company oil equivalent production guidance. We're also raising our full year 2021 EG equity method income guidance for the second consecutive quarter to a new range of $235 million to $255 million due to stronger commodity prices. This is a 30% increase from the guidance we provided last quarter and a 120% increase relative to our initial guidance at the beginning of the year.  
Our full year production and EG equity method income guidance truly contemplate an unplanned outage we experienced in EG late in the third quarter.  
Looking ahead to fourth quarter, we expect to finish the year strong with our total company oil production increasing to between 176,000 and 180,000 barrels of oil per day in comparison to 168,000 barrels of oil per day during the third quarter. Our quarterly production volumes are all subject to some normal variability associated with well timing. But this more significant sequential increase is due largely to deferred Bakken production associated with third-party midstream outages, strongly well performance and solid base production management. 
We also expect our fourth quarter total company oil equivalent production to be similar to the third quarter at 345,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with a sequential increase in the U.S. offsetting a sequential decrease in Equatorial Guinea associated with the previously referenced outage.  
I will now turn it over to Dane Whitehead, EVP and CFO, and who will discuss how our strong operations are contributing to an improved balance sheet and an acceleration in return of capital to equity holders."
314842,711859580,2425150,"Marathon Oil Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Oil Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. As I noted last quarter, our financial priorities are clear and unchanged, generate strong corporate returns with significant sustainable free cash flow, all prove our already investment-grade balance sheet and return significant capital",594,"Thank you, Mike. As I noted last quarter, our financial priorities are clear and unchanged, generate strong corporate returns with significant sustainable free cash flow, all prove our already investment-grade balance sheet and return significant capital to shareholders. 
Early in the third quarter, we retired $900 million in debt, bringing total 2021 gross debt reduction to $1.4 billion and achieving our targeted $4 billion gross debt level. With this milestone, we no longer feel the need to accelerate additional debt reduction. And going forward, we plan to simply retire debt as it matures. And please note that we have no significant maturities in 2022. This balance sheet repositioning was achieved well ahead of our original schedule, which opened the door to begin returning a significant amount of capital to equity holders.  
To be clear, these are returns beyond our base dividend which we just increased for the third consecutive quarter. Our base dividend is actually up 100% over that time period, now at $0.06 a share per quarter, and the $50 million of annual interest savings were realized due to lower gross debt will help fund a significant portion of this base dividend increase. 
Our equity return framework calls for delivering a minimum of 40% of cash from operations to shareholders when WTI is at or above $60 a barrel. This is a peer-leading return of capital commitment. It is also competitive with any sector in the S&P 500. Our fourth quarter is shaping up to be an exceptionally strong free cash flow quarter due to a combination of higher commodity prices and oil volumes quite a bit stronger than the third quarter.  
At recent strip pricing, this could take our operating cash flow to approximately $1.1 billion or about a 25% sequential increase versus the third quarter. Add to that an expected increase in dividend distributions from EG and lower CapEx relative to the third quarter peak and fourth quarter free cash flow could almost double to north of $850 million. 
So in Q4, we expect to have lots of flexibility to exceed our 40% of operating cash flow, a minimum threshold for equity returns. In fact, through our base dividend and approximately $500 million of share repurchases, we expect to return approximately 50% of our operating cash flow to investors during the fourth quarter while further improving our cash balance and net debt position.  
As we also mentioned, we believe that buying back our stock in a disciplined fashion makes tremendous sense. There are many opportunities in the market right now that provide a sustainable free cash flow yield north of 20%. 
Stepping back, the full year 2021 financial delivery is exceptional, $140 million in base dividends, $1.4 billion in debt reduction and $500 million of share repurchases representing a total return to investors combined debt and equity of over $2 billion or over 60% of our expected full year operating cash flow at strip commodity prices. Our actions in 2021 have successfully repositioned the balance sheet and kicked off a strong track record of equity returns.  
Going forward, we're going to stay laser-focused on our financial priorities and our return of capital framework, taking into account our cash flow outlook when making return decisions. Because our framework is based on a minimum percentage of cash flow from operations and not free cash flow, the equity investor will have the first call on cash, not to drill a bit.  
I'll now turn the call over to Pat Wagner, EVP of Corporate Development Strategy for an update on the resource play exploration program."

We recently completed our 2021 REx drilling program, which was focused on the continued delineation of our contiguous 50,000 net acre position in our Texas Delaware oil plant. 
As a reminder, this is a new play concept for both the Woodford and Meramec that was secured through grassroots leasing at a very low cost of entry and with 100% working interest. This is essentially an exploration bolt-on that is complementary to our already established position in the Northern Delaware. 
We brought online our first multi-well pad during the third quarter. And while it is still very early, initial production rates in both Woodford and Meramec are exceeding our predrill expectations.  
More specifically, one of the Woodford wells achieved an IP30 of almost 2,100 barrels of oil per day at an oil cut of 66%. This appears to be the strongest Woodford oil well ever drilled in any basin. And while we don't yet have 30-day rates for the other 2 wells, early indicators, including IP24s are all very positive. 
A primary objective of this 3-well pad was to execute our first spacing test in the playing. To date, we are seeing no evidence of interference between the Woodford and Meramec, consistent with our expectations due to over 700 feet of vertical separation between the 2 zones. As I stated, it's still early, and we need more production history to draw stronger conclusions, but we are certainly encouraged by the initial results from this first spacing test, including the record Woodford productivity.  
The second objective was to continue to progress our learnings and cost improvements and completed well costs. We expect to ultimately deliver well costs comparable to those achieved in the SCOOP and are aggressively leveraging our substantial experience in Oklahoma to that end. 
In total, we have now brought online 9 wells since play entry that have successfully delineated our position. The 6 wells with longer dated production have collectively demonstrated strong long-term oil productivity. Oil cuts greater than 60%, low oil ratios below 1 and shallow declines.  
Looking ahead to 2022, you should expect us to continue to integrate our learnings and progress our understanding of this promising play. However, we will do so in a disciplined manner and within our strict reinvestment rate capital allocation framework.  
I will now turn the call over to Lee, who will wrap this up."

I will close with a quick summary of how we have positioned our company for success and a preview of what to expect from us in 2022. Spoiler alert, there will be no surprises in 2022 and no compromise with respect to our capital return framework. If we focus on the financial benchmarks that matter, we are delivering top-tier capital efficiency, free cash flow yield and balance sheet strength. Our 2021 capital rate of sub-35% and capital intensity as measured by CapEx per barrel of production are both the lowest in our independent E&P peer group, a strong validation of our leading capital and operating efficiency.  
We are also one of the few E&Ps expecting to deliver a 2021 reinvestment rate at or below the S&P 500 average. We're also delivering top quartile free cash flow yield this year among our peer group and well above the S&P 500 average. And we are doing all of this with an investment-grade balance sheet at sub-onetime net debt to EBITDA, a 2021 leverage profile also well below both our peer group and the S&P 500 average.  
In short, we are successfully delivering outsized financial performance versus our peer group and the broader market with the commodity price support we are experiencing this year. Yet perhaps more importantly, we are well positioned to deliver competitive free cash flow and financial performance versus the broader market at much lower prices than we see today, all the way down to the $40 per barrel WTI range. This is the power of our sustainable cost structure reductions, our capital and operating efficiency improvements and our commitment to capital discipline, all contributing to a sub-$35 per barrel breakeven.  
Looking ahead to 2022, our differentiated capital allocation framework that prioritizes the shareholder at the first call on cash flow generation will not change. Our commitment to capital discipline will not waver with maintenance oil production, the case to beat, as we finalize our 2022 budget. We believe the right business model for a mature industry prioritizes sustainable free cash flow, a low reinvestment rate and meaningful returns to equity investors, not growth capital.  
Recall that we introduced a unique 5-year maintenance scenario earlier this year that featured $1 billion to $1.1 billion of annual spending, $1 billion of annual free cash flow at $50 WTI and a 50% reinvestment rate. Given we are no longer living in a $50 per barrel environment and that prices are currently north of $80 per barrel, it is both prudent and reasonable to consider some level of limited inflation up to about 10% that would yield modest pressure on the maintenance scenario capital range.  
Yet importantly, this modest level of inflation pales in comparison to the uplift to our financial performance in the current environment, with a 2022 maintenance scenario free cash flow potentially on the order of $3 billion at recent strip pricing or nominally 3x the $50 benchmark outcome. And under such a maintenance scenario, we are positioned to lead the peers once again with a 2022 free cash flow yield above 20%, far in excess of the S&P 500 free cash flow yield of approximately 4%. 
Our minimum 40% of cash flow target translates to about $1.6 billion of equity holder returns next year. But that is a minimum, and we see significant headroom to drive that number higher.  
At the expected 4Q run rate of 50% of CFO, 2022 equity holder returns would increase to approximately $2 billion, while still improving our cash balance and net debt position. Even at a more conservative $60 per barrel oil price environment, our minimum 40% of cash flow targets still translates to about $1.1 billion of equity holder returns in 2022. And applying 2022 consensus estimates to the return frameworks disclosed by our peers, only confirms our leading return of capital profile, with a double-digit cash distribution yield to our equity investors in 2022.  
The confidence in this outsized delivery is further supported by recent Board action to increase our share repurchase authorization to $2.5 billion to ensure we have sufficient runway to continue delivering on our return of capital commitment next year.  
To close, our company was among the first to recognize the need to move to a business model that prioritizes returns, sustainable free cash flow, balance sheet improvement and return of capital. We have also led the way in better aligning executive compensation to this new model and with investor expectations. We are successfully executing on our model today, delivering both financial outcomes and ESG excellence that are competitive not just with our direct E&P peers but also the broader market.  
With that, we can open up the line for Q&A."

314842,711859580,2425150,"Marathon Oil Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Oil Corporation","Executives","Yes. Great question, Jeanine. I think there's kind of a couple of different aspects to it. One is a little more tactical about how we execute the share repurchase. So briefly on that, we execute under short sort of 30- to 60-day 10b51 program. So we've ki",534,"Yes. Great question, Jeanine. I think there's kind of a couple of different aspects to it. One is a little more tactical about how we execute the share repurchase. So briefly on that, we execute under short sort of 30- to 60-day 10b51 program. So we've kind of set those in motion and execute them over a short period of time. 
And because of that short duration, it allows us to really calibrate return percentages more on a real-time basis, based on what we're seeing in the business, whether it's capital spend levels, commodity prices, other aspects of what's going on. It also gives you the advantage in the 10b51 writing through blackout periods. And so we do that, sort of, stepping back a little more context for the decision process about when do you exceed the minimum. 
Our decisions are always grounded in our financial priorities, which we talked about on a regular basis, generate corporate returns, significant sustainable free cash flow, bulletproof balance sheet and then return significant capital to shareholders. We just talked about what we've done, year-to-date generated significant operating and free cash flow. 
Q4 looks like by far the best quarter yet from a financial perspective. The balance sheet is really strong, and we've retired $900 million of debt in September, $1.4 billion year-to-date. So we're at our $4 billion gross debt target ahead of schedule. And that really opens the door for much more substantial returns to equity holders if the conditions warrant. 
We also bumped the base dividend for the third time this year. It's up 100% over that period. And it feels competitively positioned right now and also very sustainable through cycles at the current level. So we turn to the capital return framework that calls for returning a minimum of 40% of operating cash flow to shareholders when WTI is above $60. 
When we look at Q4, not only is WTI well above $60, all the commodity complexes are high. Oil volumes should be quite a bit stronger than they were in Q3. We expect an uptick in dividend distributions from EG and lower CapEx versus Q3, which was sort of the high point of our burn rate for the year on the capital side. 
So we expect to have lots of flexibility to exceed 40%. We also have a desire to continue to add some level of cash to the balance sheet, as we go through the year. Ultimately, our plans are to pay off debt, future debt maturities as they mature. And they aren't significant in the future, but it's nice to have that level of flexibility and in the process reduce our net debt. 
So all of this, I think it's a great example of our shareholder return framework in action. It's based on a minimum percentage of operating cash flow, but we have the ability and latitude to make real-time decisions to exceed those minimums when conditions are right, they sure appear to be in Q4. So there's a little bit of judgment involved. Is it 50%, 55% or whatever that is, but we just need to make a call. And over time, we'll have the ability to modulate that accordingly."

The well cost per foot, it decreased quarter-over-quarter in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. And would you characterize those decreases as sustainable for '22? And any color just on current inflation and your outlook for '22 would be helpful. For example, one of your peers mentioned earlier this week that they would adjust 22 activity if inflation warranted it. And I believe we said just now in his prepared remarks that 10% cost inflation would put pressure on the maintenance scenario. And I didn't catch whether that meant on the $1.1 billion CapEx or if that meant on activity."

And obviously, as we noted, the macro environment is pretty dynamic at the moment. We kind of highlighted third quarter being the lowest quarter of the year in terms of CWC per foot costs in both the Eagle Ford and Bakken were actually year-to-date, down 12% from where we were in the 2020 average. 
So what I'd say is while that's probably going to be our starting point for '22. And similar to what you've seen in '21, we'll continue to progress opportunities to improve our cost structure. I think as we noted, we could and we should start to see some inflation in '22. 
On the inflation question, maybe a little bit more color there. Let me start with '21. I would characterize that inflation is very much in check for '21. It's been largely confined to steel and OCTG. And we have fully accounted for that and our capital -- our $1 billion capital budget. As noted, we're working through '22 at the moment and seems reasonable to assume modest inflation. I think I would highlight that we are looking to take some actions. 
So for example, we've secured some of our rig, frac and frac sand and OCTG requirements for next year. I think maybe the area where there's quite a bit of uncertainty of labor, but that's probably a broader issue economy-wide. So as we noted, could see up to 10% inflation. I think that will depend on activity levels. But again, similar to '21, we're going to be working hard to mitigate and offset any of those cost pressures."

Clearly, all of the commodity prices are moving in a very constructive direction, which really has the net effect of really lifting all boats, even in our black oil plays of the Bakken and the Eagle Ford. And I think where we're really seeing the benefit of having that strength across the commodity complex is the fact that we have this very balanced portfolio already with about a 50% exposure to oil and a 50% exposure to natural gas and NGLs. 
So there's no -- our thinking hasn't changed. We believe there are extremely strong and competitive opportunities in both Permian and Oklahoma the strengthening in NGL and gas has only served to elevate those further, but oil has also elevated the returns in our other basins as well. So we feel the strength of the balanced portfolio gives us that great exposure across the commodity complex."

Yes, Arun. First of all, I would just start off by saying any transaction, any M&A, whether it be large or small, we're always going to view that through the lens of our very compelling organic case, our peer-leading financial delivery and really a strict criteria that's predicated on financial accretion. 
And so that's really the filter that we're going to view any type of opportunity. The same discipline that we apply to our organic opportunities, we certainly are going to apply in the inorganic space. We believe, obviously, that the Bakken continues to offer exceptional returns. If you look at some of the material within our earnings deck, you will see that certainly in some of the appendix slides just how competitive Bakken is relative to the other plays here in the U.S. 
But for us, it's really -- anything that we would look at inorganically would have to offer significant value. It would have to come in and move our full cycle returns in the right direction. And that, quite frankly, is a very high bar today. You could argue that the M&A market has become a little bit more of a seller's market today with the commodity prices that we're experiencing. 
And with over 10 years of extremely strong inventory, we simply don't see the need to do anything dramatic in the market, certainly, not do anything that would be dilutive to our exceptional financial delivery. 
But however, having said that on portfolio renewal, what we have talked about in the past is that embedded in that capital budget that we talk about each and every year, we have kind of up to about 10% of that dedicated to what we consider to be organic enhancement opportunities that could be things like redevelopment opportunities in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. It could be things like the Texas Delaware oil play that Pat addressed in the opening remarks. And we want to make sure that we continue those programs on a consistent and sustainable basis. 
As we look out in the out years and make best attempts to continue to replace and replenish our inventory. I think the Texas Delaware oil play is a great example of something that we were able to get into for a very low entry cost. And now it -- certainly, we see today a very clear path for that to compete for capital allocation. 
And we still have some work to do in terms of getting some longer-dated production information from the spacing test, and we want to drive some learnings into the D&C program, but there's definitely a path there for that asset now to compete, head-to-head, with some of the best in our current portfolio.

Well, I think stepping back from the inventory, when we had talked about the greater than a decade of capital-efficient, high-return inventory, Doug, it's really been based on kind of nominally our $50 WTI kind of mid-cycle view. 
As actual prices move around that planning basis, clearly, that has an impact on the tiering of those opportunities and may, in fact, even bring additional opportunities into the economic window. So it is a very dynamic thing. But we set that planning basis on conservatively so we could give a very conservative and strong view of just how our inventory can deliver in a more modest pricing environment. 
To your question around how does the commodity strengthening, particularly in the secondary products of gas and NGL alter our investment decision, look, we're a return-driven company. As we look at individual opportunities, we're going to be driven by economics. I won't say we're completely agnostic to the product mix. But at the end of the day, it's not about barrels, it's about dollars. And we're going to be driven by selecting the most economic opportunities across all of our core plays and then putting those into our business plan and executing efficiently against them. 
So it's strictly an economic decision. And although I'm thrilled that gas and NGL has recovered, I'm equally thrilled that oil was sitting at above the $80 mark as well because that tends to uplift really all of our portfolio. Because although we have an oil-weighted portfolio, it is a very balanced portfolio. And so we are, in essence, taking advantage of those secondary product pricing at a portfolio level, but our individual capital allocation decisions are going to be driven by economics."

But it still remains more of an output of our financial model as opposed to an input. And I think given, I think, the past history of the sector, it's very important for us to demonstrate clearly that in a very constructive oil price environment, that we can deliver outsized financial outcomes relative to alternative investments because the reality is that we know there will be future volatility and we have to be able to, within that volatility, offer competitive returns when prices are lower. 
So it was really just set there to really put it in the framework, acknowledge it. I think today, we would say the need to drive to a number even in that 5% range, we just don't see that today. And it's hard to see it even in the near future."

I know you've kind of run those 2 consistent here for the last few quarters, and I'm wondering if that's still kind of the plans for next year."

I mean we're kind of still speaking in hypothetical terms around a maintenance budget. But when you consider the fact that we will have incremental capital flowing to Oklahoma and Permian, we would expect, obviously, that some of that capital would be coming out of Eagle Ford and the Bakken to make room for that. But I would just say stay tuned. We'll get into a lot more detail at an asset level of allocation when we get out to the budget release in February."

So we're going to get some more longer-term production on this pad and see how these wells perform. And if so, then we'll [indiscernible] probably be the development scenario. However, I think we have some opportunities to test that even further. 
We've obviously drilled 9 wells now. So we've had a lot of learnings on the drilling and completion side. We will try to give any details on that, but we continue to refine our approach to that. I think we'll continue to drive our cost down, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks. So as we go into '22, we'll continue to progress our learning more and see what else we need to do to take this thing hopefully..."

I think over time, it's fair to expect that cash dividends match equity income. Quarter-to-quarter, they don't always match that timing can vary, especially in periods where you have significant changes like a big run-up in prices that we saw in Q3. 
And so in this case, dividends lagged earnings fairly significantly in Q3. We expect that to catch up in the reasonable near future. So I think when you're modeling it, it's probably just -- they're going to be equal -- pretty much equal over time, but you can expect to see some variability quarter-to-quarter."

Our outlook, even if forward pricing doesn't have us paying federal income taxes until the latter part of the decade, and that really hasn't changed. The outlook is durable. We tested against commodity prices, higher corporate tax rates, changes to the IDC tax treatment really don't have a meaningful impact on accelerating cash taxability. So I think that answer hasn't changed over the past few quarters."
