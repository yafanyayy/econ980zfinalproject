We're extremely pleased with our fourth quarter and our full year 2020 results. In many ways, our fourth quarter was a continuation of our strong third quarter performance. Once again, despite the impact from the pandemic, our team delivered strong and consistent operating EBITDA in the fourth quarter that exceeded the fourth quarter of 2019. 
If you set aside the $38 million of operating EBITDA contribution from ADS and the $60 million fuel tax credit benefit in the fourth quarter of '19 versus 2020, our legacy WM operating EBITDA grew 4% versus Q4 of 2019. This was our seventh consecutive quarter to generate operating EBITDA of more than $1 billion, showcasing the strength and consistency of our business. In the fourth quarter, we kept our eye on the ball working together to provide reliable, high-quality service to our customers even as we welcomed a substantial number of new customers and team members following the acquisition of Advanced Disposal. 
As with the third quarter, our fourth quarter operating EBITDA margin was impressively strong at 28.1% when you consider that it included 50 basis points of dilution from ADS. For the full year, 2020 matched our highest annual operating EBITDA margin of 28.4%. And excluding ADS, we set a new record with 2020 operating EBITDA margin of more than 28.5%. 
So in a year where many companies have suffered significant financial impacts from the pandemic and resulting economic crisis, at Waste Management, the resilience of our people and our business model delivered full year 2020 results within 1.5% of our record-high 2019 operating EBITDA. 
As we look to 2021, in addition to the strong continuous improvement measures we're taking in our collection and disposal business, WM is in a perfect position to leverage our focus on ESG and our accelerated investments in technology to benefit all of our constituents, employees, customers, shareholders, communities and the environment. WM made the decision in March to accelerate technology spending, and we're more confident than ever that our investments in customer service digitalization, or CSD, are the right approach to propel us forward in the post-COVID world. We've made considerable progress towards transforming our business model by seamlessly connecting the front-end customer experience to our back-end processes. 
Our online sales channel is growing at a triple-digit rate. Most importantly, we're receiving positive feedback from our customers. In 2021, the value creation of CSD will step up as we further differentiate our service to our customers, automate manual processes and drive further efficiencies and reliability in our operations. 
On the ESG front, WM has emerged as a true leader in sustainability and we're doing so in a manner that will benefit both shareholders and the environment. Possibly like no other year, this year's WM Phoenix open pointed to our ability to demonstrate our expertise and leverage our brand recognition for sustainability. This was highlighted during our sustainability form panel discussion with 2 other ESG-focused CEOs, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Dougley Mellon of Walmart. Following our discussion, I received a note from Doug saying thanks for your leadership, Jim. His note was flattering personally to me, but it was also an important statement about where WM stands reputationally with large companies like Walmart with regard to sustainability and where we can help them and our other customers to achieve their sustainability goals. As corporations build road maps to address their own climate impacts, WM is well positioned to assist through an array of service offerings, including recycling and other beneficial uses such as composting and renewable energy generation. 
Looking at the potential impact on our financials. So far in 2021, commodities are on a strong upward trajectory, and many experts believe this to be the start of a long-term trend. And as North America's largest recycler and one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas for landfill gas, WM should benefit disproportionately from that long-term trend. We're able to close the loop by using that renewable gas to power our natural gas fleet, redefine the processing business with our next-gen recycling technology enhancements and our fee-based pricing strategy, make new investments in innovative solutions for low-value commodities and expand our portfolio of renewable natural gas plants, all of which position us perfectly to benefit our shareholders over the next 3 to 5 years. 
In addition to the E in ESG, we're taking the S, our social responsibility very seriously, too. Whether it's our long-established focus on inclusion and diversity, our commitment to our employees to enhance benefits and guaranteed hours during COVID or our efforts to help the underserved and unemployed through our work with organizations like Aspire and [Concordance] Academy, we believe in these causes, and we're very confident in the long-term value add for our shareholders. 
It's rewarding to see that our focus on ESG as a strategic value creator for our shareholders as well as being the right thing to do is getting recognition. At the beginning of February, we were named to Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies list for the third year in a row, claiming the top spot in our industry category. During the fourth quarter, we were named to CDP's prestigious A list for tackling climate change. The global environmental nonprofit recognized Waste Management for the fifth consecutive year for our actions to cut emissions, mitigate climate risks and help develop the low-carbon economy. We were also named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for North America and the world. For the third year in a row, we are in the title of sector leader for commercial services and supplies. Our view is that our strategic approach to ESG will complement our investments in technology and our core business process improvements as the key ingredients of our future success. 
Last year, we laid the foundation for lowering our operating cost model and for offering greater choice to how our customers interact with us, and we completed the sizable acquisition of ADS. All of this positions us well for growth in 2021. In the year ahead, we expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 4% to 4.5% as we continue to execute on our disciplined pricing programs and expect volume growth to improve in 2021 as the impact from the pandemic lessens. 
From an operating cost perspective, we've learned how to operate our business with a lower cost structure, and we remain -- we expect to retain that lower cost structure in 2021 and beyond. As a result, we anticipate overall operating EBITDA growth between 10% and 13.5% in 2021. We expect this substantial growth as we realize the value of synergies from continuing to integrate ADS and improve the profitability of its business, all while we increase our investment in CSD. The benefits from these technology investments and the full integration of ADS will provide runway for further margin expansion in the future. 
In closing, we performed exceptionally well in 2020 despite the difficulties presented with COVID-19, and we're poised for another strong year in 2021. For that, I'm internally grateful to our teammates who have made it happen this year in the face of difficult circumstances. 
I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter."
190694,700854494,2215459,"Waste Management, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2021",2021-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our strong finish to 2020, both the performance of the legacy Waste Management business and our progress in integrating the ADS operations. As Jim said, our quarterly and full year results r",927,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our strong finish to 2020, both the performance of the legacy Waste Management business and our progress in integrating the ADS operations. As Jim said, our quarterly and full year results really underscore the strength and resiliency of our business model. Improving volumes, healthy pricing and better recycling performance produced organic revenue growth for the first time since the pandemic began. 
As expected, legacy Waste Management collection and disposal volumes improved sequentially in the fourth quarter from a decline of 5.5% in the third quarter to a decline of 2.7% in the fourth. Fourth quarter MSW volume grew 1.2% and C&D volume, excluding hurricane cleanup, grew 1.8%, both strong indicators of continued economic recovery. 
While the rate of volume recovery did moderate during the quarter, we did not see a backslide when COVID cases increased in the fall. In fact, as we look at volumes in January, we're encouraged to see improvement from the lull in late November and December. Collection and disposal yield was 2.3% in the fourth quarter, and core price was 3.2%. Adjusted for the impact of lower volume, core price would have been 3.8%. In the collection business, we continue to make progress improving the residential line of business. Our residential yield improved 60 basis points to 3.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2019 and was up again sequentially from 3.5% in the third quarter. 
Residential volumes declined 1.4% as we shed business that does not meet our return requirements. Overall, our actions to improve the residential line of business in 2020 resulted in $40 million of operating EBITDA benefit, and we expect this to carry forward into 2021. 
In the post-collection business, fourth quarter landfill core price was 3.3% and transfer station core price was 3.1%, demonstrating our continued pricing discipline in these key lines of business. 
Moving to costs. Operating costs were 61.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter compared to 60.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019. There were some noise in the fourth quarter results. Let me walk you through the difference. In the quarter, as expected, the ADS acquisition increased operating expense as a percentage of revenue by 40 basis points. Additionally, the timing of government approvals for fuel tax credits, which benefited the fourth quarter of 2019 with 2 years' worth of credits, resulted in a 150 basis point headwind to operating expense as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020. Aside from these impacts, operating costs as a percentage of revenue improved to 60 basis points, demonstrating that we are laser-focused on cost control and continue to benefit from a lower cost structure. As an example, commercial yards and industrial halls declined between 5% and 6% during the fourth quarter, yet over time decreased in the range of 15% to 18% and we see additional opportunities. We also have plenty of opportunity to improve operating costs as a percentage of revenue in the ADS business as we further integrate operations and work to exceed our planned synergies. 
Devina will cover our 2021 financial guidance in more detail, but I want to spend a minute on some key components of growth as we look at the year ahead. We are extremely confident in the aspects of our outlook that we can control, and we based our guidance on a stabilizing economy, moderate volume growth and disciplined pricing. We expect organic revenue growth from yield and volume in the collection and disposal business of between 4% and 4.5% and overall revenue growth between 10.75% and 11.25% during 2021. 
We hit the ground running on the ADS integration on October 30, and it's progressing very well. We expect to achieve between $50 million and $60 million in synergies during 2021. Combined with the $10 million to $15 million of annualized synergies already achieved in the fourth quarter, our run rate synergies exiting 2021 is expected to be between $60 million and $75 million.  We are extremely confident in achieving these synergies and that we'll be able to capture the remaining synergies in the first half of 2022. About 1/3 of the 2021 synergies will come from route optimization, which will begin early in the second quarter. We estimate that our onetime cost to achieve these synergies will be $50 million in 2021. And as we've mentioned, we plan to adjust the majority of these costs from our results. 
As Jim discussed, our recycling and renewal energy businesses are central to our strategy, and we're anticipating strong growth from these businesses in the year ahead. We expect continued improvement in recycling from our fee-for-service model, improved operating cost structure at new MERs and stable demand for recycled materials, which together provide a tailwind of between $40 million and $50 million to 2021 operating EBITDA. We also expect an incremental $10 million of year-over-year contribution from our renewable energy business from the sale of RINs as pricing for those credits has increased over the last several months. Devina will talk more about our plans to invest in these key businesses in 2021. 
In closing, I want to thank the entire Waste Management team, including our new team members from ADS, for their focus in what continues to be difficult and distracting times. The team has done an exceptional job managing our operations, and I know this will continue in the year ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our 2020 financial results and 2021 financial outlook for further detail."
190694,700854494,2215459,"Waste Management, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2021",2021-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning.

Our 2020 results demonstrate strong execution from our frontline teams across North America, serving our customers throughout the pandemic and doing so in an increasingly cost-effective way. The same focused execution and cost discipline extended to our team members in sales and back-office functions, which delivered strong SG&A results for the year. Excluding $25 million of SG&A for the ADS business, SG&A improved by $56 million in 2020 to 10.2% of revenue, a 10 basis point improvement over 2019. We achieved these results while accelerating our technology investments and despite the revenue decline from the pandemic. I'm proud of our team for this cost discipline in a difficult economic environment. 
Fourth quarter capital spending was $394 million, and that included $29 million of capital to support the [end] of ADS and about $30 million of capital that we intentionally pulled forward given the strong recovery in our operations during the third and fourth quarters. 2020 capital spending was $1.632 billion. Our team showed tremendous discipline throughout 2020 as we focused on reducing capital spending in a targeted manner given the volume declines from the pandemic. 
Waste Management generated free cash flow of $2.656 billion in 2020. Given the significant impact of the ADS transaction on this result, let me provide detail on some of the moving pieces. After-tax proceeds from the divestitures of ADS and Waste Management businesses to GFL were $691 million. These proceeds were partially offset by after-tax transaction and advisory costs to support the acquisition of $117 million. Normalizing for these 2 items, 2020 free cash flow was $2.082 billion. This result demonstrates the resilient nature of our business and the strength of capital discipline as we nearly achieved our original 2020 free cash flow guidance of $2.15 billion despite the impact of COVID-19. Given the strong result, at the end of 2020, we were positioned to forgo relief provided by the CARES Act, and we elected to pay approximately $120 million of payroll taxes that we had planned to defer. As we repaid that amount in 2021 and 2022, as anticipated, 2020 free cash flow, excluding the ADS impact I mentioned, would have been about $2.2 billion for the year, which is better than we expected at the end of the third quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, we used our free cash flow to pay $231 million in dividend. For the full year, we returned $1.33 billion to shareholders, comprised of $927 million in dividends and $402 million in share repurchases. In November, we issued $2.5 billion of senior notes at an extremely attractive pretax weighted average cost of less than 1.5%. This allowed us to repay short-term borrowings used to fund the ADS acquisition at close. 2021 cash interest savings are expected to be more than $90 million. 
Fourth quarter total debt-to-EBITDA of 3.19x and forecasted leverage ratios are both well within the financial covenants of our revolving credit facilities. We are committed to returning to our long-term targeted range of 2.5 to 3x total debt-to-EBITDA during 2021. Our balance sheet and liquidity remains strong, and we are well positioned to continue our practices of sound investment and strong shareholder returns. 
Moving to our 2021 outlook. As John mentioned, we anticipate 10.75% to 11.25% revenue growth in the year ahead with solid organic growth in the collection and disposal business of between 4% and 4.5%. This underpins our 2021 operating EBITDA guidance of $4.75 million and $4.9 million. We expect this strong earnings growth to drive free cash flow of between $2.25 billion and $2.35 billion. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $1.78 billion and $1.88 billion in 2021. Excluding about $90 million of capital planned to support the ADS integration, this expectation is in line with our long-term capital spend as a percentage of revenue target of 9.5% to 10.5% even while we step up our investments in CSD. 
As Jim mentioned, we also see potential incremental investment opportunities in our recycling and renewable energy businesses, both of which aid in our sustainability efforts and generate strong returns. As we've now seen improved returns in our state-of-the-art MRFs, we are taking plans to deploy the latest technology and additional MRFs in our network and moving those forward. We're also planning to invest in more renewable energy plants at our landfills. This investment extends our ability to close the loop between our renewable energy plant and our CNG fleet and does so with very strong economic returns for the company. 
We remain committed to a capital allocation plan that maximizes long-term value and total shareholder returns. As announced in December, we are pleased to be increasing our planned quarterly dividend for the 18th consecutive year. We expect our dividend payments to be about $975 million in 2021. Given our focus on the ADS integration, we expect tuck-in acquisitions to be on the lower end of our typical range of $100 million to $200 million. With more than $1 billion remaining from our free cash flow guidance, we plan to allocate that to a combination of debt repayment, share repurchases and the high-return, sustainability-focused, capital investment opportunities I described earlier. 
In closing, I want to thank the Waste Management team for their dedication and adaptability to overcome the unique challenges of 2020. We are stronger than we were a year ago, and we're looking forward to a better 2021. 
With that, Lara, let's open the line for questions."

And then as we think about volume overall, I think what we -- most macroeconomists are saying that the economy recovers as the vaccine rolls out. And so volume is the one that is hardest for us to predict. Normally, it's fairly predictable for us, but it's hardest to predict this go around because we don't know how quickly the vaccine rolls out. But we are starting to see some encouraging signs from states that we talked about previously that were lagging. States like Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania are starting to show some signs of recovery there are some states like California, New York and then also provinces like, I would say, Ontario and Québec that are still way behind. But -- and then, of course, the states that have been -- that opened first, like Texas, like Arizona, Tennessee, Florida, those states have been doing actually reasonably well. So our expectation is that those states that are starting to reopen and even the states that haven't started will start to perk up here. And we think that we'll be back to some sense of normalcy on the volume front in the back half of 2021."

Not really related to what we're seeing coming out of the EPA. First of all, it's very early in this new administration. So those investments are really related to the fact that we believe from an ESG standpoint that they're the right thing to do, but we also believe that they provide great shareholder returns. So -- and we've -- this is not something that came to us in the last 3 months. I mean we've been investing in these renewable plants and doing it diligently over the last probably 3 to 4 years. And then, of course, the recycling business is also related. But we do think that there is a nice uptrend starting, and it will continue. And we believe that it's not your normal ebb and flow in terms of commodity prices. It's why I said in my script I think we're disproportionately affected by this in a good way. 
So your first question really relates to what our expectations are coming out of the new administration. And in an odd sort of way, Hamzah, we feel like more, I guess, greater regulation is actually a good thing for us because we hold ourselves to a higher standard than the baseline regulations. Whether it's from EPA or whether it's from state DEPs, we hold ourselves to a higher standard. And so therefore, greater regulation actually ends up being a differentiator for us. And what we don't know exactly what will come out of EPA in the form of regulation around things like PVOS or coal combustion residuals, things like that, we do look at this as being an opportunity. So we're not displeased with what the future holds for us from that standpoint."

So -- and you are absolutely right, there are puts and takes, but we still see good strong margin expansion on that path toward 30% that I know that we consistently talk about. The organic revenue and EBITDA growth of our core solid waste business we wee improving 30 to 50 basis points in the year ahead. That is going to be partially offset by some known cost headwinds and then also a very intentional increased technology spend level. The increase in technology spending specifically has about a 30 basis point impact on the margin measure and about a $50 million impact on EBITDA dollars. 
In terms of the other puts and takes, I would say recycling from a margin perspective isn't actually one of the things that's contributing to the margin either expansion or detraction. And that's because for us, we have the recycling brokerage business, which tends to offset the margin expansion that we see in the traditional MRF business. So as we see the operations improve, on the MRF side, we tend to see a little bit of dilution from growth in our brokerage business, which is a very good return on invested capital business for us, it dilutes margin. 
On the renewable energy side, there will be some margin expansion, and that was strong in the fourth quarter and something that we are basically, including in our 2021 guidance based on how we finished the fourth quarter of 2020. So potentially some upside there if we see RINs prices continue to escalate from where we ended the fourth quarter. 
And then with regard to the ADS acquisition, I want to pause on that one for a moment. Fourth quarter EBITDA margin was 18.5% for the ADS business. That's below their run rate of 24.5% on a measurement basis. As a reminder, ADS' EBITDA margin included some adjustments for both share-based compensation and accretion that Waste Management doesn't take in its own EBITDA measure. So on an apples-to-apples basis, ADS' margin was 24.5%. And we have strong confidence that we'll get them up to about 28% in 2021 and then continue the match to WM levels from that point on."

But because we've chosen to accelerate it, then you would expect that the impact would happen sooner for us. And we're touching really. I mean -- but this is a huge transformation for us. I mean we are literally digitalizing the entire relationship from the very front end, which is where we set a customer up all the way through the routing and dispatch and collection functions and all the way through billing and the back end of the process. So it's a massive effort for us, but it don't like it was the right thing to do to accelerate it. And so when we talked about that on an Investor Day, I would tell you that that's that it would makes sense that by accelerating the spend, we would also accelerate the benefit. I don't know whether the benefit is necessarily bigger because some of that is dependent on how much differentiation we create, and that is maybe less dependent on us and more dependent on whether competitors choose to do the same thing. But we do believe that having an end-to-end customer experience that's digitalized is something that's almost becoming just the ante to get into the game anymore. It seems as if every company that did well in Q2 when this thing hits where we're digitalized in some way, shape or form. And so we felt like this was absolutely the right thing to do for our customers. And we do believe that it gives us an opportunity to grab a bigger slice of the overall pie, particularly with those away from competitors that don't choose to make those investments.

And it's also impacted by hospitality. It's impacted by schools, in addition to small businesses. It's why we like the industry, honestly. As you think about an investment thesis, it's why we like -- we're more of a reopen play, this industry is, than we might have been in the past. Because we haven't gone through something like this where everything is shut down and, in many cases, are still shut down. So whether it's WM or whether it's any other waste provider, this is a -- this industry is a reopen play, and that shows up on the pricing line as well as the volume line. We have some of the price that might be perceived as being somewhat soft in the commercial line of business is really because it's volume-related price. I mean it doesn't feel morally right to to use our fee-based approach, which is a new approach for us, but it's -- and it's a sophisticated approach. But you can't go and hit small businesses that are sitting across the street from from Wrigley field and who are typically customers that have a bursting business during the baseball season and now they have nothing because there's no fans. You can't hit those customers with fees or with price increases. And they understand that, and we understand that. They also understand that when their business reopens, that we will increase prices as we normally do, normal course of business. So there are some volume-related price increases that we simply haven't taken, and that specifically impacts that commercial line of business. Other lines, as John talked about, are doing quite well, our landfill and transfer. Residential, obviously, has gotten a lot of focus. So we feel very good about pricing. And there's been absolutely no loss of discipline that's hard coded here. It's just that there's -- we're waiting for some of this volume to return before we feel like it's the proper time to really reapply."

And it's really about sort of how pricing and yield cadence might trend over the course of the year. One might think that just because first half of 2020 yield comps are a little bit easier relative to the second half and you have the CPI headwind in the back half of the year that you would see better pricing in the front half and ease off in the back half. But it sounds from your comments like there may be just more open market pricing power even envisioned later in the year, and so perhaps pricing will be more ratable. Is that a fair way to think about it? Or can you steer me properly?"

So landfill and transfer, honestly, had not gotten the focus that commercial has gotten until probably 2 years ago. So we've been very focused on landfill transfer pricing. And so similarly, we've been very focused recently on residential. And John has talked about that probably for the last 4 quarters. 
I think commercial is, as I said, it's we've really established a more sophisticated-based approach to commercial pricing, but we do have a significant percentage of those commercial customers that are small businesses. And one that we didn't mention necessarily this morning, but it is schools. I mean schools are, I think, make up 12% of our commercial business. And in some states, and I hate to even think about this, but in some states, schools haven't returned. So -- and that's grade schools, that's high schools and that's universities. That's a big part of our commercial business. It's a part of our industrial business as well. But when it's 12% of your commercial business, it makes a difference. And you're simply not able to price increase customers who either haven't returned or have returned sparingly. So we think schools are a huge focus at the state level and the federal level and that they -- so the kids need to get back into school, and so I think you'll see the schools reopen fully as we get through the vaccine, and we see that at the back half of the year."

Cash taxes will increase with those 2 items going in the opposite direction, and we estimate that to be about $125 million to $150 million. There will be a benefit from the fact that the company paid the transaction cost that is in your $2.2 billion base. So I want to be sure to point that out because the ADS transaction costs are something that we adjusted for and coming to that $2.2 billion. We will have a slight increase in the money spent on the enterprise resource planning that we've discussed. We expect that to go up $15 million on a year-over-year basis.

I'll go first, and then I'll just pick up the pieces after I pull this up. But I think -- look, I think it depends a little bit on -- to your first question, it depends on how we choose to grow this business. I mean you could make a case that you grow this business outside of our own, outside of our own balance sheet. And so we have not gone down that path, but if you wanted to really kind of blow out this business in a good way and take advantage of what we think is going to be a long-term trend for RIN pricing, you could do that, or we can grow it within our own business, within our own balance sheet. And so we haven't made a decision there. Obviously, to date, everything has been grown out of our own capital expenditures. So -- and anything that we're contemplating probably at least for the first half of '21 would -- and maybe for the entire year would be grown capital expenditures as Devina mentioned in her prepared remarks. But we do think that this is a, as I said, there's a long-term uptrend here for commodities. And so that's why I believe it benefits us disproportionately regardless of where you look in our earnings stream, whether you look at renewable energy with $2.50 RIN pricing or whether you look at our recycling business where we're the biggest recycler out there. We feel like this is a more of a 3- to 5-year trend. There's a number of reasons for why we see that. I mean commodities obviously have been a pretty heavy ebb, if you will. And so -- but if we look just at our own business, we see that there is increased demand for cardboard, for example, that's driven by what we've discovered in the pandemic that everybody is taking delivery of Amazon boxes at their houses. So we feel like all of these businesses that have commodity price exposure looks to -- they look to have a fairly long uptrend coming. And that's why we are excited about the prospects of whether it's our recycling business or our renewable energy business. And that renewable energy business, by the way, is made possible by the fact that we have 60% to 70% of our fleet is natural gas. And that also is something that can't be matched in the industry percentage-wise. I hope that helps answer some of that. John?"

And I think if they stabilize both of those, we're going to see some more stability in RIN pricing, whether it stays at $2.50 or whatever.

We're extremely pleased with our fourth quarter and our full year 2020 results.

We're extremely pleased with our fourth quarter and our full year 2020 results. In many ways, our fourth quarter was a continuation of our strong third quarter performance. Once again, despite the impacts from the pandemic, our team delivered strong and consistent operating EBITDA in the fourth quarter that exceeded the fourth quarter of 2019.
If you set aside the $38 million of operating EBITDA contribution from ADS and the $60 million fuel tax credit benefit in the fourth quarter of '19 versus 2020, our legacy WM operating EBITDA grew 4% versus Q4 of 2019. This was our seventh consecutive quarter to generate operating EBITDA of more than $1 billion, showcasing the strength and consistency of our business. In the fourth quarter, we kept our eye on the ball working together to provide reliable, high-quality service to our customers even as we welcomed a substantial number of new customers and team members following the acquisition of Advanced Disposal.
As with the third quarter, our fourth quarter operating EBITDA margin was impressively strong at 28.1% when you consider that it included 50 basis points of dilution from ADS. For the full year, 2020 matched our highest annual operating EBITDA margin of 28.4%. And excluding ADS, we set a new record with 2020 operating EBITDA margin of more than 28.5%.
So in a year where many companies have suffered significant financial impacts from the pandemic and resulting economic crisis, at Waste Management, the resilience of our people and our business model delivered full year 2020 results within 1.5% of our record-high 2019 operating EBITDA.
As we look to 2021, in addition to the strong, continuous improvement measures we're taking in our collection and disposal business, WM is in a perfect position to leverage our focus on ESG and our accelerated investments in technology to benefit all of our constituents, employees, customers, shareholders, communities and the environment. WM made the decision in March to accelerate technology spending, and we're more confident than ever that our investments in customer service digitalization, or CSD, are the right approach to propel us forward in the post-COVID world. We've made considerable progress towards transforming our business model by seamlessly connecting the front-end customer experience to our back-end processes.
Our online sales channel is growing at a triple-digit rate. Most importantly, we're receiving positive feedback from our customers. In 2021, the value creation of CSD will step up as we further differentiate our service to our customers, automated -- automate manual processes and drive further efficiencies and reliability in our operations.
On the ESG front, WM has emerged as a true leader in sustainability, and we're doing so in a manner that will benefit both shareholders and the environment. Possibly like no other year, this year's WM Phoenix Open pointed to our ability to demonstrate our expertise and leverage our brand recognition for sustainability. This was highlighted during our Sustainability Forum panel discussion with 2 other ESG-focused CEOs, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Doug McMillon of Walmart. Following our discussion, I received a note from Doug saying, ""Thanks for your leadership, Jim."" His note was flattering personally to me, but it was also an important statement about where WM stands reputationally with large companies like Walmart with regard to sustainability and where we can help them and our other customers to achieve their sustainability goals. As corporations build road maps to address their own climate impacts, WM is well positioned to assist through an array of service offerings, including recycling and other beneficial uses such as composting and renewable energy generation.
Looking at the potential impact on our financials. So far in 2021, commodities are on a strong upward trajectory, and many experts believe this to be the start of a long-term trend. And as North America's largest recycler and one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas for landfill gas, WM should benefit disproportionately from that long-term trend. We're able to close the loop by using that renewable gas to power our natural gas fleet, redefine the processing business with our next-gen recycling technology enhancements and our fee-based pricing strategy, make new investments in innovative solutions for low-value commodities and expand our portfolio of renewable natural gas plants, all of which position us perfectly to benefit our shareholders over the next 3 to 5 years.
In addition to the E in ESG, we're taking the S, our social responsibility, very seriously, too. Whether it's our long-established focus on inclusion and diversity, our commitment to our employees to enhance benefits and guaranteed hours during COVID or our efforts to help the underserved and unemployed through our work with organizations like UpSpire and Concordance Academy, we believe in these causes, and we're very confident in the long-term value add for our shareholders.
It's rewarding to see that our focus on ESG as a strategic value creator for our shareholders as well as being the right thing to do is getting recognition. At the beginning of February, we were named to Fortune magazine's World's Most Admired Companies List for the third year in a row, claiming the top spot in our industry category. During the fourth quarter, we were named to CDP's prestigious A List for tackling climate change. The global environmental nonprofit recognized Waste Management for the fifth consecutive year for our actions to cut emissions, mitigate climate risks and help develop the low-carbon economy. We were also named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for North America and the World. For the third year in a row, we are in the title of Sector Leader for Commercial Services & Supplies. Our view is that our strategic approach to ESG will complement our investments in technology and our core business process improvements as the key ingredients of our future success.
Last year, we laid the foundation for lowering our operating cost model and for offering greater choice to how our customers interact with us, and we completed the sizable acquisition of ADS. All of this positions us well for growth in 2021. In the year ahead, we expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 4% to 4.5% as we continue to execute on our disciplined pricing programs and expect volume growth to improve in 2021 as the impact from the pandemic lessens.
From an operating cost perspective, we've learned how to operate our business with a lower cost structure, and we remain -- we expect to retain that lower cost structure in 2021 and beyond. As a result, we anticipate overall operating EBITDA growth between 10% and 13.5% in 2021. We expect this substantial growth as we realize the value of synergies from continuing to integrate ADS and improve the profitability of its business, all while we increase our investment in CSD. The benefits from these technology investments and the full integration of ADS will provide runway for further margin expansion in the future.
In closing, we performed exceptionally well in 2020 despite the difficulties presented with COVID-19, and we're poised for another strong year in 2021. For that, I'm eternally grateful to our teammates who have made it happen this year in the face of difficult circumstances.
I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter."

We're very pleased with our strong finish to 2020, both the performance of the legacy Waste Management business and our progress in integrating the ADS operations. As Jim said, our quarterly and full year results r",923,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our strong finish to 2020, both the performance of the legacy Waste Management business and our progress in integrating the ADS operations. As Jim said, our quarterly and full year results really underscore the strength and resiliency of our business model. Improving volumes, healthy pricing and better recycling performance produced organic revenue growth for the first time since the pandemic began. As expected, legacy Waste Management collection and disposal volumes improved sequentially in the fourth quarter from a decline of 5.5% in the third quarter to a decline of 2.7% in the fourth. Fourth quarter MSW volume grew 1.2% and C&D volume, excluding hurricane cleanup, grew 1.8%, both strong indicators of continued economic recovery.
While the rate of volume recovery did moderate during the quarter, we did not see a backslide when COVID cases increased in the fall. In fact, as we look at volumes in January, we're encouraged to see improvement from the lull in late November and December.
Collection and disposal yield was 2.3% in the fourth quarter, and core price was 3.2%. Adjusted for the impact of lower volume, core price would have been 3.8%. In the collection business, we continue to make progress improving the residential line of business. Our residential yield improved 60 basis points to 3.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2019 and was up again sequentially from 3.5% in the third quarter.
Residential volumes declined 1.4% as we shed business that does not meet our return requirements. Overall, our actions to improve the residential line of business in 2020 resulted in $40 million of operating EBITDA benefit, and we expect this to carry forward into 2021.
In the post-collection business, fourth quarter landfill core price was 3.3% and transfer station core price was 3.1%, demonstrating our continued pricing discipline in these key lines of business.
Moving to costs. Operating costs were 61.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter compared to 60.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019. There were some noise in the fourth quarter results. Let me walk you through the difference. In the quarter, as expected, the ADS acquisition increased operating expense as a percentage of revenue by 40 basis points. Additionally, the timing of government approvals for fuel tax credits, which benefited the fourth quarter of 2019 with 2 years' worth of credits, resulted in a 150-basis-point headwind to operating expense as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020. Aside from these impacts, operating costs as a percentage of revenue improved 60 basis points, demonstrating that we are laser-focused on cost control and continue to benefit from a lower cost structure. As an example, commercial yards and industrial halls declined between 5% and 6% during the fourth quarter, yet overtime decreased in the range of 15% to 18%, and we see additional opportunities. We also have plenty of opportunity to improve operating costs as a percentage of revenue in the ADS business as we further integrate operations and work to exceed our planned synergies.
Devina will cover our 2021 financial guidance in more detail, but I want to spend a minute on some key components of growth as we look at the year ahead. We are extremely confident in the aspects of our outlook that we can control, and we based our guidance on a stabilizing economy, moderate volume growth and disciplined pricing. We expect organic revenue growth from yield and volume in the collection and disposal business of between 4% and 4.5% and overall revenue growth between 10.75% and 11.25% during 2021.
We hit the ground running on the ADS integration on October 30, and it's progressing very well. We expect to achieve between $50 million and $60 million in synergies during 2021. Combined with the $10 million to $15 million of annualized synergies already achieved in the fourth quarter, our run rate synergies exiting 2021 is expected to be between $60 million and $75 million. We are extremely confident in achieving these synergies and that we'll be able to capture the remaining synergies in the first half of 2022. About 1/3 of the 2021 synergies will come from route optimization, which will begin early in the second quarter. We estimate that our onetime cost to achieve these synergies will be $50 million in 2021. And as we've mentioned, we plan to adjust the majority of these costs from our results.
As Jim discussed, our recycling and renewal energy businesses are central to our strategy, and we're anticipating strong growth from these businesses in the year ahead. We expect continued improvement in recycling from our fee-for-service model, improved operating cost structure at new MRFs and stable demand for recycled materials, which, together, provide a tailwind of between $40 million and $50 million to 2021 operating EBITDA. We also expect an incremental $10 million of year-over-year contribution from our renewable energy business from the sale of RINs as pricing for those credits has increased over the last several months. Devina will talk more about our plans to invest in these key businesses in 2021.
In closing, I want to thank the entire Waste Management team, including our new team members from ADS, for their focus in what continues to be difficult and distracting times. The team has done an exceptional job managing our operations, and I know this will continue in the year ahead.
I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our 2020 financial results and 2021 financial outlook and further detail."
190694,700854494,2215735,"Waste Management, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2021",2021-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning.

Our 2020 results demonstrate strong execution from our frontline teams across North America, serving our customers throughout the pandemic and doing so in an increasingly cost-effective way. The same focused execution and cost discipline extended to our team members in sales and back-office functions, which delivered strong SG&A results for the year. Excluding $25 million of SG&A for the ADS business, SG&A improved by $56 million in 2020 to 10.2% of revenue, a 10-basis-point improvement over 2019. We achieved these results while accelerating our technology investments and despite the revenue decline from the pandemic. I'm proud of our team for this cost discipline in a difficult economic environment.
Fourth quarter capital spending was $394 million, and that included $29 million of capital to support the [ integration ] of ADS and about $30 million of capital that we intentionally pulled forward given the strong recovery in our operations during the third and fourth quarters. 2020 capital spending was $1.632 billion. Our team showed tremendous discipline throughout 2020 as we focused on reducing capital spending in a targeted manner given the volume declines from the pandemic.
Waste Management generated free cash flow of $2.656 billion in 2020. Given the significant impact of the ADS transaction on this result, let me provide detail on some of the moving pieces. After-tax proceeds from the divestitures of ADS and Waste Management businesses to GFL were $691 million. These proceeds were partially offset by after-tax transaction and advisory costs to support the acquisition of $117 million. Normalizing for these 2 items, 2020 free cash flow was $2.082 billion. This result demonstrates the resilient nature of our business and the strength of capital discipline as we nearly achieved our original 2020 free cash flow guidance of $2.15 billion despite the impact of COVID-19.
Given the strong result, at the end of 2020, we were positioned to forgo relief provided by the CARES Act, and we elected to pay approximately $120 million of payroll taxes that we had planned to defer. As we repay that amount in 2021 and 2022, as anticipated, 2020 free cash flow, excluding the ADS impact I mentioned, would have been about $2.2 billion for the year, which is better than we expected at the end of the third quarter.
In the fourth quarter, we used our free cash flow to pay $231 million in dividend. For the full year, we returned $1.33 billion to shareholders, comprised of $927 million in dividends and $402 million in share repurchases. In November, we issued $2.5 billion of senior notes at an extremely attractive pretax weighted average cost of less than 1.5%. This allowed us to repay short-term borrowings used to fund the ADS acquisition at close. 2021 cash interest savings are expected to be more than $90 million.
Fourth quarter total debt-to-EBITDA of 3.19x and forecasted leverage ratios are both well within the financial covenants of our revolving credit facilities. We are committed to returning to our long-term targeted range of 2.5 to 3x total debt-to-EBITDA during 2021. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong, and we are well positioned to continue our practices of sound investment and strong shareholder returns.
Moving to our 2021 outlook. As John mentioned, we anticipate 10.75% to 11.25% revenue growth in the year ahead with solid organic growth in the collection and disposal business of between 4% and 4.5%. This underpins our 2021 operating EBITDA guidance of $4.75 million and $4.9 million. We expect this strong earnings growth to drive free cash flow of between $2.25 billion and $2.35 billion.
Capital expenditures are expected to be between $1.78 billion and $1.88 billion in 2021. Excluding about $90 million of capital planned to support the ADS integration, this expectation is in line with our long-term capital spend as a percentage of revenue target of 9.5% to 10.5% even while we step up our investments in CSD.
As Jim mentioned, we also see potential incremental investment opportunities in our recycling and renewable energy businesses, both of which aid in our sustainability efforts and generate strong returns. As we've now seen improved returns in our state-of-the-art MRFs, we are taking plans to deploy the latest technology and additional MRFs in our network and moving those forward. We're also planning to invest in more renewable energy plants at our landfills. This investment extends our ability to close the loop between our renewable energy plant and our CNG fleet and does so with very strong economic returns for the company.
We remain committed to a capital allocation plan that maximizes long-term value and total shareholder returns. As announced in December, we are pleased to be increasing our planned quarterly dividend for the 18th consecutive year. We expect our dividend payments to be about $975 million in 2021. Given our focus on the ADS integration, we expect tuck-in acquisitions to be on the lower end of our typical range of $100 million to $200 million. With more than $1 billion remaining from our free cash flow guidance, we plan to allocate that to a combination of debt repayment, share repurchases and the high-return, sustainability-focused, capital investment opportunities I described earlier.
In closing, I want to thank the Waste Management team for their dedication and adaptability to overcome the unique challenges of 2020. We are stronger than we were a year ago, and we're looking forward to a better 2021.
With that, Lara, let's open the line for questions."

We were negative, of course, in Q2 and negative in Q3. And so we turned positive in Q4, and that's very good news as it relates to -- particularly as it relates to small business.
And then as we think about volume overall, I think what we -- most macroeconomists are saying that the economy recovers as the vaccine rolls out. And so volume is the one that is hardest for us to predict. Normally, it's fairly predictable for us, but it's hardest to predict this go-round because we don't know how quickly the vaccine rolls out. But we are starting to see some encouraging signs from states that we talked about previously that were lagging. States like Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania are starting to show some signs of recovery. There are some states like California, New York and then also provinces like, I would say, Ontario and Québec that are still way behind. But -- and then, of course, the states that have been -- that opened first, like Texas, like Arizona, Tennessee, Florida, those states have been doing actually reasonably well. So our expectation is that those states that are starting to reopen and even the states that haven't started will start to perk up here. And we think that we'll be back to some sense of normalcy on the volume front in the back half of 2021."

So -- and we've -- this is not something that came to us in the last 3 months. I mean we've been investing in these renewable plants on a -- and doing it diligently over the last probably 4 -- 3 to 4 years. And then, of course, the recycling business is also related. But we do think that there is a nice uptrend starting, and it will continue. And we believe that it's not your normal ebb and flow in terms of commodity prices. It's why I said in my script I think we're disproportionately affected by this in a good way.
So your first question really relates to what our expectations are coming out of the new administration. And in an odd sort of way, Hamzah, we feel like more, I guess, greater regulation is actually a good thing for us because we hold ourselves to a higher standard than the baseline regulations. Whether it's from EPA or whether it's from state DEPs, we hold ourselves to a higher standard. And so therefore, greater regulation actually ends up being a differentiator for us. And while we don't know exactly what will come out of EPA in the form of regulation around things like PFAS or coal combustion residuals, things like that, we do look at this as being an opportunity. So we're not displeased with what the future holds for us from that standpoint."

So -- and you are absolutely right, there are puts and takes, but we still see good strong margin expansion on that path toward 30% that I know that we consistently talk about. The organic revenue and EBITDA growth of our core solid waste business, we see improving 30 to 50 basis points in the year ahead. That is going to be partially offset by some known cost headwinds and then also a very intentional increased technology spend level. The increase in technology spending specifically has about a 30-basis-point impact on the margin measure and about a $50 million impact on EBITDA dollars.
In terms of the other puts and takes, I would say recycling from a margin perspective isn't actually one of the things that's contributing to the margin either expansion or detraction. And that's because for us, we have the recycling brokerage business, which tends to offset the margin expansion that we see in the traditional MRF business. So as we see the operations improve on the MRF side, we tend to see a little bit of dilution from growth in our brokerage business, which is a very good return on invested capital business for us, it dilutes margin.
On the renewable energy side, there will be some margin expansion, and that was strong in the fourth quarter and something that we are basically including in our 2021 guidance based on how we finished the fourth quarter of 2020. So potentially some upside there if we see RINs prices continue to escalate from where we ended the fourth quarter.
And then with regard to the ADS acquisition, I want to pause on that one for a moment. Fourth quarter EBITDA margin was 18.5% for the ADS business. That's below their run rate of 24.5% on a WM measurement basis. As a reminder, ADS's EBITDA margin included some adjustments for both share-based compensation and accretion that Waste Management doesn't take in its own EBITDA measure. So on an apples-to-apples basis, ADS's margin was 24.5%. And we have strong confidence that we'll get them up to about 28% in 2021 and then continue the march to WM levels from that point on."

And frankly, some of the other hills we're having to climb around COVID and the weights, hopefully, that's going to moderate in the back half of the year as things -- as Jim mentioned, if vaccines get out there and things start to moderate to whatever -- to normal. In the back half of the year, we're also going to have a better view of what the residential weights are going to look like long term. What I would tell you is not lost in that mix is the fact that our price and yield in residential continues to be strong despite what's going on with CPI, and we've talked about that for the last handful of years.
And the other part that's part of that equation is while we talk about the recycling business improving a big piece of, the recycling business affects residential. So when you look at those margin improvements, we're overcoming some of those other headwinds that weren't there when we started this initiative, so to speak."

But because we've chosen to accelerate it, then you would expect that the impact would happen sooner for us. And we're touching really -- I mean, this is a huge transformation for us. I mean we are literally digitalizing the entire relationship from the very front end, which is where we set a customer up all the way through the routing and dispatch and then collection functions and all the way through billing and the back end of the process. So it's a massive effort for us, but it don't like it was the right thing to do to accelerate it.
And so when we talked about that on an Investor Day, I would tell you that that's -- that it would makes sense that by accelerating the spend, we would also accelerate the benefit. I don't know whether the benefit is necessarily bigger because some of that is dependent on how much differentiation we create. And that is maybe less dependent on us and more dependent on whether competitors choose to do the same thing. But we do believe that having an end-to-end customer experience that's digitalized is something that's almost becoming just the ante to get into the game anymore. It seems as if every company that did well in Q2 when this thing hits where digitalized in some way, shape or form. And so we felt like this was absolutely the right thing to do for our customers. And we do believe that it gives us an opportunity to grab a bigger slice of the overall pie, particularly with those away from competitors that don't choose to make those investments. We know that some competitors already are making those investments or will be. But that piece is maybe a little harder to quantify."

We continued even through the pandemic to show strength and resiliency in those 2 buckets. And I commented on residential, and that has been, even pre-pandemic, a real focal area for us.

And it's also impacted by hospitality. It's impacted by schools, in addition to small businesses. It's why we like the industry, honestly. As you think about an investment thesis, it's why we like -- we're more of a reopen play, this industry is, than we might have been in the past. Because we haven't gone through something like this where everything is shut down and, in many cases, are still shut down. So whether it's WM or whether it's any other waste provider, this is a -- this industry is a reopen play, and that shows up on the pricing line as well as the volume line.
We have some of the price that might be perceived as being somewhat soft in the commercial line of business, is really because it's volume-related price. I mean it doesn't feel morally right to use our fee-based approach, which is a new approach for us, but it's -- and it's a sophisticated approach. But you can't go and hit small businesses that are sitting across the street from Wrigley Field and who are typically customers that have a burging business during the baseball season, and now they have nothing because there's no fans. You can't hit those customers with fees or with price increases. And they understand that, and we understand that. They also understand that when their business reopens, that we will increase prices as we normally do, normal course of business.
So there are some volume-related price increases that we simply haven't taken, and that specifically impacts that commercial line of business. Other lines, as John talked about that are doing quite well are landfill and transfer. Residential, obviously, has gotten a lot of focus. So we feel very good about pricing. And there's been absolutely no loss of discipline. That's hard-coded here. It's just that there's -- that we're waiting for some of this volume to return before we feel like it's the proper time to really reapply."

I think commercial is, as I said, it's -- we've really established a more sophisticated-based approach to commercial pricing, but we do have a significant percentage of those commercial customers that are small businesses. And one that we didn't mention necessarily this morning, but it is schools. I mean schools are, I think, make up 12% of our commercial business. And in some states -- and I hate to even think about this, but in some states, schools haven't returned. So -- and that's grade schools, that's high schools and that's universities. That's a big part of our commercial business. It's a part of our industrial business as well. But when it's 12% of your commercial business, it makes a difference. And you're simply not able to price increase customers who either haven't returned or have returned sparingly.

What I would look at is where we bottomed out in Q2 and what our overtime percentages we're going into that and how we've come out of it. To me, that's really been the barometer as this volume declines have really come back more than half in commercial and industrial. As for obvious reasons, residential is a little different. But we've been able to outpace the volume increases, if you will, from an overtime perspective for us to be down mid-teens and overtime with still 5%, 6%, 7% volume declines is pretty impressive. So I don't know about 2019. David, I think the better barometer for us is how we've done in 2020 and how we progressed from the peak of volume decline to where we are now. And I think, as I mentioned, that's what gives us confidence going into 2021 and then add in the benefit of us getting into the integration of the ADS customers after we migrate the data here in Q2. All those things, I think, add up to a really positive outlook for us on the OpEx side."

I think when we think about EBITDA growth always being the biggest contributor there, certainly, have strong outlook for EBITDA in the year ahead with a 10% to 13.5% increase on a year-over-year basis. In addition to that, we expect the about $90 million benefit from lower cash interest that I mentioned. Cash taxes will increase with those 2 items going in the opposite direction, and we estimate that to be about $125 million to $150 million. There will be a benefit from the fact that the company paid the transaction cost that is in your $2.2 billion base. So I want to be sure to point that out because the ADS transaction costs are something that we adjusted for and coming to that $2.2 billion. We will have a slight increase in the money spent on the enterprise resource planning that we've discussed. We expect that to go up $15 million on a year-over-year basis.
So all in all, that's what gets you to your cash from operations increase in the ballpark of $500 million to $600 million. We've got a capital expenditure increase of around $150 million to $250 million. And then proceeds from divestitures, we're not forecasting anything significant there, have given our traditional range of $50 million to $100 million."

I'll go first, and then I'll just pick up the pieces after I pull this up. But I think -- look, I think it depends a little bit on -- to your first question, it depends on how we choose to grow this business. I mean you could make a case that you grow this business outside of our own balance sheet. And so we are -- we have not gone down that path, but if you wanted to really kind of blow out this business in a good way and take advantage of what we think is going to be a long-term trend for RINs pricing, you could do that, or we can grow it within our own business, within our own balance sheet. And so we haven't made a decision there. Obviously, to date, everything has been grown out of our own capital expenditures. So -- and anything that we're contemplating probably at least for the first half of '21 would -- and maybe for the entire year would be grown through capital expenditures, as Devina mentioned in her prepared remarks.
But we do think that this is a -- as I said, there's a long-term uptrend here for commodities. And so that's why I believe it benefits us disproportionately regardless of where you look in our earnings stream, whether you look at renewable energy with $2.50 RIN pricing or whether you look at our recycling business where we're the biggest recycler out there. We feel like this is a more of a 3- to 5-year trend. There's a number of reasons for why we see that. I mean here's -- commodities obviously have been a pretty heavy ebb, if you will. And so -- but if we look just at our own business, we see that there is increased demand for cardboard, for example, that's driven by what we've discovered in the pandemic that everybody is taking delivery of Amazon boxes at their houses.
So we feel like all of these businesses that have commodity price exposure looks to -- they look to have a fairly long uptrend coming. And that's why we are excited about the prospects of whether it's our recycling business or our renewable energy business. And that renewable energy business, by the way, is made possible by the fact that we have 60% to 70% of our fleet is natural gas. And that also is something that can't be matched in the industry percentage-wise. I hope that helps answer some of that. John?"

And I think if they stabilize both of those, we're going to see some more stability in RIN pricing, whether it stays at $2.50 or whatever. But I think we'll see more stability, and I think that's going to help inform us where we deploy our own capital."

I think it goes back to, I think, to the original premise of your question, which is if something changes environmentally through EPA as a result of the new administration and part of it might be PFAS, how does that affect us? And we think it actually has potentially a positive impact, and that's why we're looking at it as an opportunity as opposed to just a cost."

So there was a lot of complexity. There was a lot of work to be done with DOJ. And so I really don't expect that at least WM would do another large solid waste acquisition in North America. We'll do tuck-ins. And to Devina's point, about $100 million is where we think we'll come in this year. So I think we can continue to do tuck-ins.
And then as far as our strategy for M&A going out, I think what we've all chosen to do is just really focus right now on the integration of ADS. And once we feel comfortable that that's been well integrated, then start to think about what acquisitions look like in the years beyond 2021, 2022."

We're extremely pleased with our fourth quarter and our full year 2020 results. In many ways, our fourth quarter was a continuation of our strong third quarter performance. Once again, despite the impacts from the pandemic, our team delivered strong and consistent operating EBITDA in the fourth quarter that exceeded the fourth quarter of 2019.
If you set aside the $38 million of operating EBITDA contribution from ADS and the $60 million fuel tax credit benefit in the fourth quarter of '19 versus 2020, our legacy WM operating EBITDA grew 4% versus Q4 of 2019. This was our seventh consecutive quarter to generate operating EBITDA of more than $1 billion, showcasing the strength and consistency of our business. In the fourth quarter, we kept our eye on the ball working together to provide reliable, high-quality service to our customers even as we welcomed a substantial number of new customers and team members following the acquisition of Advanced Disposal.
As with the third quarter, our fourth quarter operating EBITDA margin was impressively strong at 28.1% when you consider that it included 50 basis points of dilution from ADS. For the full year, 2020 matched our highest annual operating EBITDA margin of 28.4%. And excluding ADS, we set a new record with 2020 operating EBITDA margin of more than 28.5%.
So in a year where many companies have suffered significant financial impacts from the pandemic and resulting economic crisis, at Waste Management, the resilience of our people and our business model delivered full year 2020 results within 1.5% of our record-high 2019 operating EBITDA.
As we look to 2021, in addition to the strong, continuous improvement measures we're taking in our collection and disposal business, WM is in a perfect position to leverage our focus on ESG and our accelerated investments in technology to benefit all of our constituents, employees, customers, shareholders, communities and the environment. WM made the decision in March to accelerate technology spending, and we're more confident than ever that our investments in customer service digitalization, or CSD, are the right approach to propel us forward in the post-COVID world. We've made considerable progress towards transforming our business model by seamlessly connecting the front-end customer experience to our back-end processes.
Our online sales channel is growing at a triple-digit rate. Most importantly, we're receiving positive feedback from our customers. In 2021, the value creation of CSD will step up as we further differentiate our service to our customers, automated -- automate manual processes and drive further efficiencies and reliability in our operations.
On the ESG front, WM has emerged as a true leader in sustainability, and we're doing so in a manner that will benefit both shareholders and the environment. Possibly like no other year, this year's WM Phoenix Open pointed to our ability to demonstrate our expertise and leverage our brand recognition for sustainability. This was highlighted during our Sustainability Forum panel discussion with 2 other ESG-focused CEOs, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Doug McMillon of Walmart. Following our discussion, I received a note from Doug saying, ""Thanks for your leadership, Jim."" His note was flattering personally to me, but it was also an important statement about where WM stands reputationally with large companies like Walmart with regard to sustainability and where we can help them and our other customers to achieve their sustainability goals. As corporations build road maps to address their own climate impacts, WM is well positioned to assist through an array of service offerings, including recycling and other beneficial uses such as composting and renewable energy generation.
Looking at the potential impact on our financials. So far in 2021, commodities are on a strong upward trajectory, and many experts believe this to be the start of a long-term trend. And as North America's largest recycler and one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas for landfill gas, WM should benefit disproportionately from that long-term trend. We're able to close the loop by using that renewable gas to power our natural gas fleet, redefine the processing business with our next-gen recycling technology enhancements and our fee-based pricing strategy, make new investments in innovative solutions for low-value commodities and expand our portfolio of renewable natural gas plants, all of which position us perfectly to benefit our shareholders over the next 3 to 5 years.
In addition to the E in ESG, we're taking the S, our social responsibility, very seriously, too. Whether it's our long-established focus on inclusion and diversity, our commitment to our employees to enhance benefits and guaranteed hours during COVID or our efforts to help the underserved and unemployed through our work with organizations like UpSpire and Concordance Academy, we believe in these causes, and we're very confident in the long-term value add for our shareholders.
It's rewarding to see that our focus on ESG as a strategic value creator for our shareholders as well as being the right thing to do is getting recognition. At the beginning of February, we were named to Fortune magazine's World's Most Admired Companies List for the third year in a row, claiming the top spot in our industry category. During the fourth quarter, we were named to CDP's prestigious A List for tackling climate change. The global environmental nonprofit recognized Waste Management for the fifth consecutive year for our actions to cut emissions, mitigate climate risks and help develop the low-carbon economy. We were also named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for North America and the World. For the third year in a row, we are in the title of Sector Leader for Commercial Services & Supplies. Our view is that our strategic approach to ESG will complement our investments in technology and our core business process improvements as the key ingredients of our future success.
Last year, we laid the foundation for lowering our operating cost model and for offering greater choice to how our customers interact with us, and we completed the sizable acquisition of ADS. All of this positions us well for growth in 2021. In the year ahead, we expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 4% to 4.5% as we continue to execute on our disciplined pricing programs and expect volume growth to improve in 2021 as the impact from the pandemic lessens.
From an operating cost perspective, we've learned how to operate our business with a lower cost structure, and we remain -- we expect to retain that lower cost structure in 2021 and beyond. As a result, we anticipate overall operating EBITDA growth between 10% and 13.5% in 2021. We expect this substantial growth as we realize the value of synergies from continuing to integrate ADS and improve the profitability of its business, all while we increase our investment in CSD. The benefits from these technology investments and the full integration of ADS will provide runway for further margin expansion in the future.
In closing, we performed exceptionally well in 2020 despite the difficulties presented with COVID-19, and we're poised for another strong year in 2021. For that, I'm eternally grateful to our teammates who have made it happen this year in the face of difficult circumstances.
I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter."
190694,700854494,2218419,"Waste Management, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2021",2021-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our strong finish to 2020, both the performance of the legacy Waste Management business and our progress in integrating the ADS operations. As Jim said, our quarterly and full year results r",923,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our strong finish to 2020, both the performance of the legacy Waste Management business and our progress in integrating the ADS operations. As Jim said, our quarterly and full year results really underscore the strength and resiliency of our business model. Improving volumes, healthy pricing and better recycling performance produced organic revenue growth for the first time since the pandemic began. As expected, legacy Waste Management collection and disposal volumes improved sequentially in the fourth quarter from a decline of 5.5% in the third quarter to a decline of 2.7% in the fourth. Fourth quarter MSW volume grew 1.2% and C&D volume, excluding hurricane cleanup, grew 1.8%, both strong indicators of continued economic recovery.
While the rate of volume recovery did moderate during the quarter, we did not see a backslide when COVID cases increased in the fall. In fact, as we look at volumes in January, we're encouraged to see improvement from the lull in late November and December.
Collection and disposal yield was 2.3% in the fourth quarter, and core price was 3.2%. Adjusted for the impact of lower volume, core price would have been 3.8%. In the collection business, we continue to make progress improving the residential line of business. Our residential yield improved 60 basis points to 3.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2019 and was up again sequentially from 3.5% in the third quarter.
Residential volumes declined 1.4% as we shed business that does not meet our return requirements. Overall, our actions to improve the residential line of business in 2020 resulted in $40 million of operating EBITDA benefit, and we expect this to carry forward into 2021.
In the post-collection business, fourth quarter landfill core price was 3.3% and transfer station core price was 3.1%, demonstrating our continued pricing discipline in these key lines of business.
Moving to costs. Operating costs were 61.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter compared to 60.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019. There were some noise in the fourth quarter results. Let me walk you through the difference. In the quarter, as expected, the ADS acquisition increased operating expense as a percentage of revenue by 40 basis points. Additionally, the timing of government approvals for fuel tax credits, which benefited the fourth quarter of 2019 with 2 years' worth of credits, resulted in a 150-basis-point headwind to operating expense as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020. Aside from these impacts, operating costs as a percentage of revenue improved 60 basis points, demonstrating that we are laser-focused on cost control and continue to benefit from a lower cost structure. As an example, commercial yards and industrial halls declined between 5% and 6% during the fourth quarter, yet overtime decreased in the range of 15% to 18%, and we see additional opportunities. We also have plenty of opportunity to improve operating costs as a percentage of revenue in the ADS business as we further integrate operations and work to exceed our planned synergies.
Devina will cover our 2021 financial guidance in more detail, but I want to spend a minute on some key components of growth as we look at the year ahead. We are extremely confident in the aspects of our outlook that we can control, and we based our guidance on a stabilizing economy, moderate volume growth and disciplined pricing. We expect organic revenue growth from yield and volume in the collection and disposal business of between 4% and 4.5% and overall revenue growth between 10.75% and 11.25% during 2021.
We hit the ground running on the ADS integration on October 30, and it's progressing very well. We expect to achieve between $50 million and $60 million in synergies during 2021. Combined with the $10 million to $15 million of annualized synergies already achieved in the fourth quarter, our run rate synergies exiting 2021 is expected to be between $60 million and $75 million. We are extremely confident in achieving these synergies and that we'll be able to capture the remaining synergies in the first half of 2022. About 1/3 of the 2021 synergies will come from route optimization, which will begin early in the second quarter. We estimate that our onetime cost to achieve these synergies will be $50 million in 2021. And as we've mentioned, we plan to adjust the majority of these costs from our results.
As Jim discussed, our recycling and renewal energy businesses are central to our strategy, and we're anticipating strong growth from these businesses in the year ahead. We expect continued improvement in recycling from our fee-for-service model, improved operating cost structure at new MRFs and stable demand for recycled materials, which, together, provide a tailwind of between $40 million and $50 million to 2021 operating EBITDA. We also expect an incremental $10 million of year-over-year contribution from our renewable energy business from the sale of RINs as pricing for those credits has increased over the last several months. Devina will talk more about our plans to invest in these key businesses in 2021.
In closing, I want to thank the entire Waste Management team, including our new team members from ADS, for their focus in what continues to be difficult and distracting times. The team has done an exceptional job managing our operations, and I know this will continue in the year ahead.
I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our 2020 financial results and 2021 financial outlook and further detail."

Our 2020 results demonstrate strong execution from our frontline teams across North America, serving our customers throughout the pandemic and doing so in an increasingly cost-effective way. The same focused execution and cost discipline extended to our team members in sales and back-office functions, which delivered strong SG&A results for the year. Excluding $25 million of SG&A for the ADS business, SG&A improved by $56 million in 2020 to 10.2% of revenue, a 10-basis-point improvement over 2019. We achieved these results while accelerating our technology investments and despite the revenue decline from the pandemic. I'm proud of our team for this cost discipline in a difficult economic environment.
Fourth quarter capital spending was $394 million, and that included $29 million of capital to support the [ integration ] of ADS and about $30 million of capital that we intentionally pulled forward given the strong recovery in our operations during the third and fourth quarters. 2020 capital spending was $1.632 billion. Our team showed tremendous discipline throughout 2020 as we focused on reducing capital spending in a targeted manner given the volume declines from the pandemic.
Waste Management generated free cash flow of $2.656 billion in 2020. Given the significant impact of the ADS transaction on this result, let me provide detail on some of the moving pieces. After-tax proceeds from the divestitures of ADS and Waste Management businesses to GFL were $691 million. These proceeds were partially offset by after-tax transaction and advisory costs to support the acquisition of $117 million. Normalizing for these 2 items, 2020 free cash flow was $2.082 billion. This result demonstrates the resilient nature of our business and the strength of capital discipline as we nearly achieved our original 2020 free cash flow guidance of $2.15 billion despite the impact of COVID-19.
Given the strong result, at the end of 2020, we were positioned to forgo relief provided by the CARES Act, and we elected to pay approximately $120 million of payroll taxes that we had planned to defer. As we repay that amount in 2021 and 2022, as anticipated, 2020 free cash flow, excluding the ADS impact I mentioned, would have been about $2.2 billion for the year, which is better than we expected at the end of the third quarter.
In the fourth quarter, we used our free cash flow to pay $231 million in dividend. For the full year, we returned $1.33 billion to shareholders, comprised of $927 million in dividends and $402 million in share repurchases. In November, we issued $2.5 billion of senior notes at an extremely attractive pretax weighted average cost of less than 1.5%. This allowed us to repay short-term borrowings used to fund the ADS acquisition at close. 2021 cash interest savings are expected to be more than $90 million.
Fourth quarter total debt-to-EBITDA of 3.19x and forecasted leverage ratios are both well within the financial covenants of our revolving credit facilities. We are committed to returning to our long-term targeted range of 2.5 to 3x total debt-to-EBITDA during 2021. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong, and we are well positioned to continue our practices of sound investment and strong shareholder returns.
Moving to our 2021 outlook. As John mentioned, we anticipate 10.75% to 11.25% revenue growth in the year ahead with solid organic growth in the collection and disposal business of between 4% and 4.5%. This underpins our 2021 operating EBITDA guidance of $4.75 million and $4.9 million. We expect this strong earnings growth to drive free cash flow of between $2.25 billion and $2.35 billion.
Capital expenditures are expected to be between $1.78 billion and $1.88 billion in 2021. Excluding about $90 million of capital planned to support the ADS integration, this expectation is in line with our long-term capital spend as a percentage of revenue target of 9.5% to 10.5% even while we step up our investments in CSD.
As Jim mentioned, we also see potential incremental investment opportunities in our recycling and renewable energy businesses, both of which aid in our sustainability efforts and generate strong returns. As we've now seen improved returns in our state-of-the-art MRFs, we are taking plans to deploy the latest technology and additional MRFs in our network and moving those forward. We're also planning to invest in more renewable energy plants at our landfills. This investment extends our ability to close the loop between our renewable energy plant and our CNG fleet and does so with very strong economic returns for the company.
We remain committed to a capital allocation plan that maximizes long-term value and total shareholder returns. As announced in December, we are pleased to be increasing our planned quarterly dividend for the 18th consecutive year. We expect our dividend payments to be about $975 million in 2021. Given our focus on the ADS integration, we expect tuck-in acquisitions to be on the lower end of our typical range of $100 million to $200 million. With more than $1 billion remaining from our free cash flow guidance, we plan to allocate that to a combination of debt repayment, share repurchases and the high-return, sustainability-focused, capital investment opportunities I described earlier.
In closing, I want to thank the Waste Management team for their dedication and adaptability to overcome the unique challenges of 2020. We are stronger than we were a year ago, and we're looking forward to a better 2021.
With that, Lara, let's open the line for questions."

Hamzah, first, as far as service increases go, we looked at the fourth quarter as being really good news because it's the first quarter in a while that we've seen net service increases. We were negative, of course, in Q2 and negative in Q3. And so we turned positive in Q4, and that's very good news as it relates to -- particularly as it relates to small business.
And then as we think about volume overall, I think what we -- most macroeconomists are saying that the economy recovers as the vaccine rolls out. And so volume is the one that is hardest for us to predict. Normally, it's fairly predictable for us, but it's hardest to predict this go-round because we don't know how quickly the vaccine rolls out. But we are starting to see some encouraging signs from states that we talked about previously that were lagging. States like Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania are starting to show some signs of recovery. There are some states like California, New York and then also provinces like, I would say, Ontario and Québec that are still way behind. But -- and then, of course, the states that have been -- that opened first, like Texas, like Arizona, Tennessee, Florida, those states have been doing actually reasonably well. So our expectation is that those states that are starting to reopen and even the states that haven't started will start to perk up here. And we think that we'll be back to some sense of normalcy on the volume front in the back half of 2021."

So -- and we've -- this is not something that came to us in the last 3 months. I mean we've been investing in these renewable plants on a -- and doing it diligently over the last probably 4 -- 3 to 4 years. And then, of course, the recycling business is also related. But we do think that there is a nice uptrend starting, and it will continue. And we believe that it's not your normal ebb and flow in terms of commodity prices. It's why I said in my script I think we're disproportionately affected by this in a good way.
So your first question really relates to what our expectations are coming out of the new administration. And in an odd sort of way, Hamzah, we feel like more, I guess, greater regulation is actually a good thing for us because we hold ourselves to a higher standard than the baseline regulations. Whether it's from EPA or whether it's from state DEPs, we hold ourselves to a higher standard. And so therefore, greater regulation actually ends up being a differentiator for us. And while we don't know exactly what will come out of EPA in the form of regulation around things like PFAS or coal combustion residuals, things like that, we do look at this as being an opportunity. So we're not displeased with what the future holds for us from that standpoint."

So -- and you are absolutely right, there are puts and takes, but we still see good strong margin expansion on that path toward 30% that I know that we consistently talk about.

So -- and you are absolutely right, there are puts and takes, but we still see good strong margin expansion on that path toward 30% that I know that we consistently talk about. The organic revenue and EBITDA growth of our core solid waste business, we see improving 30 to 50 basis points in the year ahead. That is going to be partially offset by some known cost headwinds and then also a very intentional increased technology spend level. The increase in technology spending specifically has about a 30-basis-point impact on the margin measure and about a $50 million impact on EBITDA dollars.
In terms of the other puts and takes, I would say recycling from a margin perspective isn't actually one of the things that's contributing to the margin either expansion or detraction. And that's because for us, we have the recycling brokerage business, which tends to offset the margin expansion that we see in the traditional MRF business. So as we see the operations improve on the MRF side, we tend to see a little bit of dilution from growth in our brokerage business, which is a very good return on invested capital business for us, it dilutes margin.
On the renewable energy side, there will be some margin expansion, and that was strong in the fourth quarter and something that we are basically including in our 2021 guidance based on how we finished the fourth quarter of 2020. So potentially some upside there if we see RINs prices continue to escalate from where we ended the fourth quarter.
And then with regard to the ADS acquisition, I want to pause on that one for a moment. Fourth quarter EBITDA margin was 18.5% for the ADS business. That's below their run rate of 24.5% on a WM measurement basis. As a reminder, ADS's EBITDA margin included some adjustments for both share-based compensation and accretion that Waste Management doesn't take in its own EBITDA measure. So on an apples-to-apples basis, ADS's margin was 24.5%. And we have strong confidence that we'll get them up to about 28% in 2021 and then continue the march to WM levels from that point on."

In the back half of the year, we're also going to have a better view of what the residential weights are going to look like long term. What I would tell you is not lost in that mix is the fact that our price and yield in residential continues to be strong despite what's going on with CPI, and we've talked about that for the last handful of years.

But because we've chosen to accelerate it, then you would expect that the impact would happen sooner for us. And we're touching really -- I mean, this is a huge transformation for us.

So it's a massive effort for us, but it don't like it was the right thing to do to accelerate it.
And so when we talked about that on an Investor Day, I would tell you that that's -- that it would makes sense that by accelerating the spend, we would also accelerate the benefit. I don't know whether the benefit is necessarily bigger because some of that is dependent on how much differentiation we create. And that is maybe less dependent on us and more dependent on whether competitors choose to do the same thing. But we do believe that having an end-to-end customer experience that's digitalized is something that's almost becoming just the ante to get into the game anymore. It seems as if every company that did well in Q2 when this thing hits where digitalized in some way, shape or form. And so we felt like this was absolutely the right thing to do for our customers. And we do believe that it gives us an opportunity to grab a bigger slice of the overall pie, particularly with those away from competitors that don't choose to make those investments.

So one area Jim commented on in his script was really around post-collection pricing, both at the landfill and transfer station. We've talked about that quarter-in and quarter-out. We continued even through the pandemic to show strength and resiliency in those 2 buckets. And I commented on residential, and that has been, even pre-pandemic, a real focal area for us. And while it did moderate a bit in the bottom of the pandemic, we've shown progress out of that. So I think we feel comfortable with at least that 4% going into 2021."

And it's also impacted by hospitality. It's impacted by schools, in addition to small businesses. It's why we like the industry, honestly. As you think about an investment thesis, it's why we like -- we're more of a reopen play, this industry is, than we might have been in the past. Because we haven't gone through something like this where everything is shut down and, in many cases, are still shut down. So whether it's WM or whether it's any other waste provider, this is a -- this industry is a reopen play, and that shows up on the pricing line as well as the volume line.
We have some of the price that might be perceived as being somewhat soft in the commercial line of business, is really because it's volume-related price. I mean it doesn't feel morally right to use our fee-based approach, which is a new approach for us, but it's -- and it's a sophisticated approach. But you can't go and hit small businesses that are sitting across the street from Wrigley Field and who are typically customers that have a [ burging ] business during the baseball season, and now they have nothing because there's no fans. You can't hit those customers with fees or with price increases. And they understand that, and we understand that. They also understand that when their business reopens, that we will increase prices as we normally do, normal course of business.
So there are some volume-related price increases that we simply haven't taken, and that specifically impacts that commercial line of business. Other lines, as John talked about that are doing quite well are landfill and transfer. Residential, obviously, has gotten a lot of focus. So we feel very good about pricing. And there's been absolutely no loss of discipline. That's hard-coded here. It's just that there's -- that we're waiting for some of this volume to return before we feel like it's the proper time to really reapply."

I think commercial is, as I said, it's -- we've really established a more sophisticated-based approach to commercial pricing, but we do have a significant percentage of those commercial customers that are small businesses. And one that we didn't mention necessarily this morning, but it is schools. I mean schools are, I think, make up 12% of our commercial business. And in some states -- and I hate to even think about this, but in some states, schools haven't returned. So -- and that's grade schools, that's high schools and that's universities. That's a big part of our commercial business. It's a part of our industrial business as well. But when it's 12% of your commercial business, it makes a difference. And you're simply not able to price increase customers who either haven't returned or have returned sparingly. So we think schools are a huge focus at the state level and the federal level and that they -- so the kids need to get back into school, and so I think you'll see the schools reopen fully as we get through the vaccine, and we see that at the back half of the year."

Cash taxes will increase with those 2 items going in the opposite direction, and we estimate that to be about $125 million to $150 million. There will be a benefit from the fact that the company paid the transaction cost that is in your $2.2 billion base. So I want to be sure to point that out because the ADS transaction costs are something that we adjusted for and coming to that $2.2 billion. We will have a slight increase in the money spent on the enterprise resource planning that we've discussed. We expect that to go up $15 million on a year-over-year basis.

But I think -- look, I think it depends a little bit on -- to your first question, it depends on how we choose to grow this business. I mean you could make a case that you grow this business outside of our own balance sheet. And so we are -- we have not gone down that path, but if you wanted to really kind of blow out this business in a good way and take advantage of what we think is going to be a long-term trend for RINs pricing, you could do that, or we can grow it within our own business, within our own balance sheet. And so we haven't made a decision there. Obviously, to date, everything has been grown out of our own capital expenditures. So -- and anything that we're contemplating probably at least for the first half of '21 would -- and maybe for the entire year would be grown through capital expenditures, as Devina mentioned in her prepared remarks.
But we do think that this is a -- as I said, there's a long-term uptrend here for commodities. And so that's why I believe it benefits us disproportionately regardless of where you look in our earnings stream, whether you look at renewable energy with $2.50 RIN pricing or whether you look at our recycling business where we're the biggest recycler out there. We feel like this is a more of a 3- to 5-year trend. There's a number of reasons for why we see that. I mean here's -- commodities obviously have been a pretty heavy ebb, if you will. And so -- but if we look just at our own business, we see that there is increased demand for cardboard, for example, that's driven by what we've discovered in the pandemic that everybody is taking delivery of Amazon boxes at their houses.
So we feel like all of these businesses that have commodity price exposure looks to -- they look to have a fairly long uptrend coming. And that's why we are excited about the prospects of whether it's our recycling business or our renewable energy business. And that renewable energy business, by the way, is made possible by the fact that we have 60% to 70% of our fleet is natural gas. And that also is something that can't be matched in the industry percentage-wise. I hope that helps answer some of that. John?"

A lot of damage to homes, including my own house, and a big, big percentage of the state without power, without water, et cetera. Not sure that it needed to be that way, honestly, but it was.
And so I guess, the positive coming out of it is that it tells me that the human spirit is alive and well. We -- and we at WM, or in our personal lives, we take care of each other during these difficult times. And so thank you to all of our 50,000 teammates that's -- for all you do each and every day. And thanks to all of you on the call for joining us this morning. We'll talk to you next quarter."

It was said many times last year that 2020 was a year like no other. For many reasons, it was an incredibly difficult and trying year. Yet our positive message internally was the great companies use tough time",866,"Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. It was said many times last year that 2020 was a year like no other. For many reasons, it was an incredibly difficult and trying year. Yet our positive message internally was the great companies use tough times to better themselves, and that's precisely what WM did. And first quarter of 2021 showed that with an exclamation point. We had an exceptionally strong start to the year as we kept our focus on those fundamentals that have always been is great. Our people first, then our customers, and then we focus on the details of our business. And that order inevitably produces the best results. In Q1, it sure did as we achieved record operating EBITDA of $1.16 billion and robust cash from operations of $1.12 billion. Typically, during our first quarter earnings call, we reaffirm our full year guidance. However, as we view these strong results, in addition to our confidence in the transformative changes we're making to our business model and the fact that we have yet to see a full recovery in our critical landfill commercial and industrial volumes, it became clear that we're on track to outperform our guidance from only 2 months ago. Combine this with the broader economic trends and all indicators show that our full year revenue, adjusted operating EBITDA and free cash flow are on track to meet or exceed the upper end of the guidance ranges we provided in February. Devina will discuss our updated guidance, but it's safe to say We're very excited about our performance for the first quarter, and we expect to show continued strength throughout the year. 
We're seeing tangible benefits from the investments that we've made in recycling and renewable energy. In our recycling line of business, we've developed a model for all new plants which with the addition of sophisticated technology produces far better returns through a combination of added efficiencies, a higher quality of saleable material and less residual material for disposal at the end of the process, all while our basket of recycled commodity prices have climbed back nicely to historical average price levels. 
Additionally, 3 years ago, we made the decision to close the loop between our natural gas fleet and the gas produced at our landfills by investing in the renewable energy business. We're now seeing those investments pay healthy dividends with approximately 2- to 3-year paybacks on our 4 plants. in tandem with greater stability and higher pricing in the renewable energy markets. 
As we discussed last quarter, WM is also well positioned to leverage our ESG leadership and particularly our focus on environmental sustainability to help our customers meet their own climate goals through recycling and other beneficial uses such as renewable energy generation. 
We're in a unique position to help key stakeholders rise to the challenge. And we can do this while growing our business at the same time, collaborating with our stakeholders to find new ways to create value together. Continuing to integrate environmental sustainability into our strategic business framework for long-term sustainable and profitable growth requires a strong focus, which is why we've taken a step to dedicate a member of our senior team to this effort. 
I'm pleased to announce that Tara Hemmer, Senior Vice President of Operations, will be taking this new role as Senior Vice President, Chief Sustainability Officer reporting directly to me effective July 1. With Tara's move, our Area Vice President leading the Greater Mid-Atlantic area, Rafa Carrasco, will be promoted to a member of the senior leadership team as Senior Vice President of Operations. 
We've also launched a new exciting education benefit for our team members this month that will provide development and upskilling opportunities for our workforce. Changes to underscore how the tenants of ESG are embedded into our broader business strategy. 
As digital transformation sweeps across nearly every industry in the way of the pandemic, we're making strides in differentiating our customers' experience through end-to-end digital transformation. Today, our customers can manage their relationship with us through online -- through our online WM -- IWM platform, which is connected operationally through our smart truck technology and supported by our customer analytics and data management tools. Our newly automated setup process streamlines customer orders and accelerates the speed at which we can deliver on our commitments while also reducing our cost to serve. These developments, combined with continued growth of our e-commerce channel, give us confidence that our decision to accelerate technology investments was the right one, and we will emerge from the pandemic a stronger, more agile company. 
In closing, I want to thank the entire Waste Management team for their hard work and dedication that has positioned us for a record setting 2021. WM is well positioned to benefit from the continued reopening as more states and provinces emerge from the pandemic, and we expect our commercial, industrial and landfill businesses, our 3 most lines of business, to benefit from further volume recovery and produce robust financial results with high incremental margins over the remainder of the year. 
I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter."
190694,709060045,2259103,"Waste Management, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Before reviewing the terrific operating results that we achieved in the first quarter, I want to provide an update on the integration of ADS. Over the last 6 months, we've made significant progress on combining the 2 busines",731,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Before reviewing the terrific operating results that we achieved in the first quarter, I want to provide an update on the integration of ADS. Over the last 6 months, we've made significant progress on combining the 2 businesses, and we've been able to accelerate some of our integration plans. The teams have worked tirelessly to make sure that this combination goes smoothly. And based on the success of the integration so far, increasing our synergy expectations to $150 million of total annual run rate synergies, $130 million coming from operating costs and SG&A savings and $20 million coming from capital savings. 
For 2021, we now expect synergies of between $75 million and $85 million, all coming from cost savings. With approximately $15 million of annualized synergies captured in 2020, we expect to exit 2021 on an annual run rate synergy level of around $100 million. The remaining $50 million is expected to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of operating costs, SG&A and capital expenditures. 
Now turning to our first quarter results. Organic revenue grew 2.1% as disciplined pricing and improved recycling results overcame modest volume declines. Pricing performance for the quarter was very solid with core price of 3.4% and collection and disposal yield of 2.8%, outpacing our expectations. 
Notably, our commercial yield rebounded sequentially from 3.1% -- to 3.1% from 1.9% in the fourth quarter. As economic reopening progressed during the first quarter, collection and disposal volumes improved again sequentially to a decline of 2.3% from 2.7% in the fourth quarter. 
In the first quarter, net new business turned positive churn improved meaningfully to 8.2% and service increases expanded. While volumes have recovered meaningfully from the second quarter of 2020, collection and disposal from the second quarter 2020 collection and disposal decline of 10.9%. As Jim pointed out, WM is positioned to benefit from further improvements in North American economies. For example, at the end of the first quarter, we have recovered about 72% of the commercial yards lost due to COVID, providing room for considerable improvement in commercial volumes as we progress through the year. 
Similarly, our other highest-margin businesses, industrial and landfill have volume upside opportunity as visibility into the economic reopening continues to improve and more event work is scheduled and completed. 
Looking at the lines of business, we're making improvements with the help of a very delivery pricing focus, residential landfill and recycling, I'm happy to report that we have had standout in each of these areas during the quarter. Residential yield doubled year-over-year to 4.2% as we make strides to improve the profitability in this line of business. This is the highest residential yield we have achieved since 2008 and it showcases our success in demonstrating the value of our service and pricing it appropriately. 
The increased yield drove operating EBITDA margins in the residential line of business to the highest level in the past 12 months despite still elevated residential container rates. 
Landfill core price was 3.2%, a strong result when you consider the impact of lower volumes related both to the pandemic and severe winter weather. 
In recycling, operating EBITDA doubled year-over-year to achieve earnings that rank in our top 5 best quarters ever. These results are truly a reflection of our work to improve the business model while creating a sustainable solution for our customers and not simply the result of an increase in recycled commodity prices. 
While our other top recycling quarters had an average commodity price of $127 per ton, we achieved our strong first quarter results with a price of $79 per ton. 
Finally, turning to costs. First quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 130 basis points to 61.1%, demonstrating that we are maintaining our cost discipline as volumes recover. 
In the first quarter, we saw a 40 basis point improvement in our labor costs as we continue to manage overtime spending. We also saw efficiency improvements in both the commercial and industrial lines of business, which we were able to identify and capture as our investments in technology help make us nimble. 
In closing, I want to thank the waste management team for the exceptional job they have done in managing our operations to position us for success in 2021. 
I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail."
190694,709060045,2259103,"Waste Management, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As you've heard from both Jim and John, we had a fantastic start to 2021 and and we forecast continued strength our business as local economies emerge from the pandemic.

As you've heard from both Jim and John, we had a fantastic start to 2021 and and we forecast continued strength our business as local economies emerge from the pandemic. These strong results and our confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year have led us to raise our full year financial guidance. Revenue growth is expected to be 12.5% to 13% with combined internal revenue growth from yield and volume in the collection and disposal business of 4.5% or greater. The increased outlook is underpinned by our disciplined pricing programs and strong outlook for continued volume recovery. 
For adjusted operating EBITDA, we now expect to generate between $4.875 billion and $4.97 billion, a $100 million increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance. improved outlook for adjusted operating EBITDA translates directly into incremental free cash flow. And we now expect that we will generate between $2.325 billion and $2.425 billion of free cash flow for the year. 
Our team members on the front line continue to deliver and the investments we are making in our people, technology and customer experience are generating strong results. 
Turning to our first quarter results. Net cash provided by operating activities grew $355 million. The contribution from operating EBITDA growth accounted for a little less than half of that increase, with the remainder coming from lower incentive compensation payments and increase in cash collections from customers, and favorable timing of some of our payables. 
While we expect some of the timing differences experienced in the first quarter to reverse for the year, the remaining contributors to our strong cash flow from operations results position us for a very strong year. 
In the first quarter, capital spending was $270 million, a $189 million decrease from the first quarter of 2020. Capital expenditures were lower in the quarter, primarily due to timing, but the timing of fleet purchases, which we had intentionally front-loaded in 2020 and and steps we took in late 2020 to accelerate some of our 2021 capital given our confidence in the pace of volume recovery. 
We continue to prioritize the investments in the long-term growth of our business, including recycling, renewable energy and technology investments that we have previously discussed. For the full year, we expect capital spending to be at the high end of our $1.78 billion to $1.88 billion guidance range as we invest in our business to support growth reduce our cost to serve and extend our environmental sustainability efforts. 
Putting it all together, our business generated free cash flow of $865 million in the first quarter. The operating EBITDA growth for lower capital expenditures and favorable working capital changes that I discussed drove the significant year-over-year free cash flow increase. This sets us up very well to achieve our increased free cash flow outlook. 
In the first quarter, we used our free cash flow to pay $247 million in dividends and allocated $250 million to share repurchases. 
Turning to SG&A costs. SG&A was 10.7% of revenue in the first quarter. That's a 20 basis point increase over 2020. We remain focused on managing our discretionary costs, optimizing our structure for the ADS acquisition and using SG&A dollars to enhance our business. Our deliberate increased level of investment in technology as well as higher incentive compensation accruals are the driver of SG&A as a percentage of revenue being above our long-term target of less than 10% of revenue. Though we are committed to ensuring we return to that optimized cost structure in the near term. 
Our first quarter leverage ratio of 3.04x has improved from the fourth quarter due to our strong operating EBITDA growth. This leverage ratio remains well within the financial covenant of our revolving credit facility and right at the top of our long-term targeted range of 2.5 to 3x. 
Our strong first quarter results and increased expectations for current year operating EBITDA and free cash flow, position us to purchase at least $1 billion of our shares in 2021, and at the same time, achieve our target leverage of 2.75x by the end of the year. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be a strong balance sheet, prudent investment in the growth of our business, and strong and consistent shareholder returns. 
With the strength of our collection and disposal business, expectations for continued recovery and improved market backdrop for recycling, effective cost control and even better-than-expected integration synergies from the ADS acquisition. Cash flow converges conversion is strong. And as a result, we expect to increase cash allocated to shareholder returns from our initial plans. 
In closing, it is imperative that we thank the men and women across the Waste Management team for their tireless efforts to serve our customers and communities each day. Our strong results are a testament to their commitment, and we're excited about what we will achieve together over the remainder of the year.

I mean there's a couple of dynamics here. One is that pretty much all U.S. companies are facing large or small is this temporary competition against the government for unemployment benefits, and that is having an impact on us. The good news for us is that we didn't lay people off from COVID. So if you did, and you're trying to rehire right now, you're having a tough time. And we -- as you may recall, we guaranteed 40 hours last year when we first hit and said, you're not going to lose your job because of COVID. So that did help us. Not sure that we expected this unemployment benefit to continue as it has, but it did help us. I think the other aspect of this is that we recognize that labor inflation is going to be around. It's been 5%-ish for our nonexempt for a couple of years now. And -- but we didn't anticipate this new competitor being the government We think that's temporary. Right now, I think it's scheduled to -- these unemployment benefits are schedules go at the end of July. They may have extended with the new package through September. But we'll use pricing from a kind of a macroeconomic standpoint to make sure that we manage volume, we don't need to take all new volume coming. We'll take the best of the new volume, and we'll manage accordingly. John and his team will through the labor line by using price to maybe tamp down some of that volume if we need to."

So what we're looking at is what you saw in the first really strong performance on the yield side, translating into strength for the remainder of the year and that really being the catalyst for the upside on the total of 4.5% or greater That being said, our initial outlook for volume was around 1.5% to 2%, and we're optimistic that we'll also be at the high end of that range.

And in particular, the second quarter had some cost headwinds for health and welfare specifically. We also expected incentive compensation to be a headwind for the full year, though that's even greater headwind now because of our strong outlook for 2021 than we would have initially expected. Our overall margin guidance for 2021 initially was as much as a 50 basis point improvement. You can see with the strong performance in the first quarter. We expect there could be some upside to that, though rather than update margins specifically at this point, we'd really like to see the seasonal results on volume because the contribution margin from that incremental volume is one of the important things for us to keep our eye on. 
That being said, I think it's really important to step back and recognize that we started with guidance that have been slightly backward at 20 basis points on a year-over-year comparison, both because of those comp headwinds and the integration of ADS. But then when we look at where we stand today, we're confident that we'll actually be at the high end of our expectations of 50 basis points. And that's certainly somewhat because of the ADS synergy capture, but it's also because of some stronger outlook on pricing that I mentioned earlier."

MSW core price was strong. for the quarter as were the other lines of business. I think an important distinction here is that several of these lines of business, specifically commercial, it also is we've talked many times about recycling. have become somewhat fee-based. And so as volume increases, you see fees increase And those fees go to the price line. So it's honestly part of why there's a number of reasons why we took the unusual step to raise guidance in Q1. But one of those is the strength that we're seeing in pricing. And of course, a second one is that when you think about volumes, and I mentioned it in my remarks, that volumes really have not recovered fully, especially in those 3 high-margin lines of business, commercial, landfill and industrial. John mentioned, they were starting to see really good green shoots in March and continuing into April on the volume front. And then lastly, on reasons why we felt really comfortable with our guidance changes was that recycling is, as John mentioned in his script, we're producing these great results recycling at average commodity prices. I mean $79 for that basket of commodities is right in the middle of our historical averages, whereas the other 4 quarters, we talked about the top 5 -- being in the top 5 best quarters of all time in recycling, And yet the other 4 when we were up at $125, $127 on an average commodity price. We're now down at 79%, at least that's where we were for the quarter. So all of those combined to give us real confidence going forward that we could raise guidance. But pricing and landfill pricing, in particular, we think are a strength for the quarter and will continue to be in the next couple of quarters."

We, at this point, are saying bottom end of the range, the historical range of $100 million to $200 million, and that's what we said when we gave guidance back in February, and we're sticking to that right now. 
It's possible though, it's always possible that something comes along and it's too good to pass up. And I think what you'll probably see is that you may see that valuations actually -- it's really just a math equation. You might see valuations come down a little bit because somebody is looking and saying, ""All right, my capital gain here is going to be pretty significant.

And then on residential, John's talked about residential now for 2 or 3 years. And we really look at residential as being one of the real strong points for the quarter. The work that his team -- John and his team have done to get to the highest yield since 2008, a 4% yield has really been a success story for the company. And that's coming as much as anything through -- maybe not as much with fee-based as it's coming through contract renegotiation, it might surprise you to know that that's not coming from some of the indexes going up. We actually saw a small amount of deterioration in that for the quarter. Now we do expect that, that -- we do expect that inflation will kick up a little bit, and so we'll get some help. And we're typically a beneficiary of higher inflation. But we didn't benefit in Q1 from that. It was really all a -- almost all of it was just renegotiation of contracts. And factoring in to those contracts, the fact that we now expect weights to be a bit higher permanently because of the pandemic and because of somewhat of a permanent shift of some portion of the economy to a work from home environment. But this was really all -- and then, by the way, there's also this ongoing move to a different index that's more reflective of our cost structure, which is a lower so a trash index away from a CPI index. And we're up to about 40% of our overall business is index driven and about 40% of that is now on a water sewer trash, which then equates to about 15% or 16% in total."

But you still have a lot of customer, Mike, I do think that Mike, we do think that there's a percentage of businesses that -- and we don't know what that is at this point, but there's a percentage of businesses that are going to be much longer in reopening. And so because this was such a unique event that we had never seen before, we don't know exactly how that -- how that reopening occurs. But we do know that there are some businesses and likely -- to Tyler's question, likely in those states that were -- that took longer to reopen. I mean Texas reopened at least partially on the 17th of May last year and then fully reopened later in the year in the third quarter, But some of the states, they closed until 2021. And if you were a small business in Texas or in Florida, or in Arizona, you probably were able to weather the storm. If you were a small business in Michigan or in Toronto, you may have -- you may still be having a tough time weathering the storm. So we don't know exactly what that -- how many of those customers actually just simply don't come back. There will be some amount there for sure. But we are, by the way, looking a bit at -- I know a lot of industries are comparing to 2019. And because comparisons are going to start to get really quirky, they already are. I mean comparing to 2020 for any metric is difficult. I'll give you one number that's very encouraging for us, and that's the EBITDA number. It's part of why we were so excited about the quarter and about actually raising guidance. When you look at 2019 EBITDA for WM Legacy and you add it to kind of ADS legacy, you get something in the neighborhood of kind of $4.8 million -- about $4.85 billion. And then you look at what we just adjusted to, and it's $100 million above that. Keep in mind, that's not really fair to do that because we divested a bunch of ADS legacies. So -- but even if you don't count that, if you just say WM Legacy '19 and ADS legacy '19, you're talking $4.85 billion, and we're $100 million above that, and we have not gotten a lot of the volume back, and we still have a lot of room to go in terms of ADS. So that's one of the many reasons why we were very encouraged with the quarter and very able to take that unusual step to raise guidance."

And I think we talked a great deal today about the biggest driver, and that's the labor cost part of the equation. We certainly think that the efforts that have been put forth by the team to manage overtime hours and get those impacts not just on the service side, but extended through on the repair and maintenance side have been a tremendous value. We want that to continue to be a lever that produces the strong operating margin for the business, and we're optimistic about that. But we also know that there are flex points or breakpoints in the equation that happened when you add an additional route. And so that's what we're watching as we move forward from here with the growing volume environment. 
Aside from labor, I think what's really important is that we can't forget that in our transfer and disposal cost and subcontractor costs, there's a lot of third-party labor costs built into those numbers as well. And so the theme that Jim has point to this to a number of times today about the labor pressure that exists across the board. That's something that we've seen in those costs and something we expect to continue into 2021. So a 45% contribution margin is what we've talked about.

So the first priority is investing in the long-term growth of the business, and that's something that we talk a great deal about organic growth through focuses in recycling and renewable energy have been places that we've said you could see some outpaced capital spending from us. So the current guide for 2021 incorporates our expectations for the full year in those programs. We just have yet to determine how much we could accelerate spend in 2022 and 2023 to cover incremental investment that could be worthwhile in those spaces. I think the rest of the allocation really comes down to shareholder returns, continuing to grow the dividend over the long term in that 45% to 50% range on a payout ratio basis, and we measure that on free cash flow. So there's direct conversion from that free cash flow measure and the long-term incentive plan to award the dividend, which I think is a really strong indicator of how we think about the growth that can happen as we revisit that in the fourth quarter. Beyond that, the statement that we made about at least $1 billion of share buyback in 2021 is an indication that when we don't see M&A being the place that we will spend that available dollar free cash flow, there is tremendous flexibility to allocate incremental dollars to the shareholders through share buyback. 
M&A, Jim touched on that. We'll continue to be sure that we're mindful of the opportunities that exist there. And if we see opportunities to provide outpaced returns relative to our other opportunities, we'll be well positioned to do that with a strong balance sheet that I mentioned."

Secondly, I think on internalization and transportation synergies is another bucket where again, once we got a look at some of that detail, we were able to drive out additional synergies. And then lastly, really, on the supply chain side, even though we're facing a couple of headwinds on some commodity-related pieces, our supply chain group, once they got to look at the whole portfolio of spend there has also been able to drive some additional benefit. So it's really efficiency in the business in the field is the internalization, the transportation and disposal internalization. And then lastly, it's really some of the corporate synergies around supply chain. Those are the 3 big buckets."

So to the extent that the bar gets raised by the new administration it actually ends up being a benefit to us. The other areas, Devina has talked about the potential for tax changes and things like that. And so we're keeping up on that.

It was said many times last year that 2020 was a year like no other. For many reasons, it was an incredibly difficult and trying year, yet our positive message internally was that great companies use tough times to better themselves, and that's precisely what WM did and the first quarter of 2021 showed that with an exclamation point. 
We had an exceptionally strong start to the year as we kept our focus on those fundamentals that have always been great. Our people first, then our customers and then we focus on the details of our business, and that order inevitably produces the best results. In Q1, it sure did as we achieved record operating EBITDA of $1.16 billion and robust cash from operations of $1.12 billion. 
Typically, during our first quarter earnings call, we reaffirm our full year guidance. However, as we view these strong results, in addition to our confidence in the transformative changes we're making to our business model and the fact that we have yet to see a full recovery in our critical landfill, commercial and industrial volumes, it became clear that we're on track to outperform our guidance from only 2 months ago. 
Combine this with the broader economic trends and all indicators show that our full year revenue, adjusted operating EBITDA and free cash flow are on track to meet or exceed the upper end of the guidance ranges we provided in February. Devina will discuss our updated guidance, but it's safe to say we're very excited about our performance for the first quarter and we expect to show continued strength throughout the year. 
We're seeing tangible benefits from the investments that we've made in recycling and renewable energy. In our recycling line of business, we've developed a model for all new plants which, with the addition of sophisticated technology, produces far better returns through a combination of added efficiencies, a higher quality of saleable material and less residual material for disposal at the end of the process, all while our basket of recycled commodity prices have climbed back nicely to historical average price levels. 
Additionally, 3 years ago, we made the decision to close the loop between our natural gas fleet and the gas produced at our landfills by investing in the renewable energy business. We're now seeing those investments pay healthy dividends with approximately 2- to 3-year paybacks on our 4 plants, in tandem with greater stability and higher pricing in the renewable energy markets. 
As we discussed last quarter, WM is also well positioned to leverage our ESG leadership, and particularly our focus on environmental sustainability to help our customers meet their own climate goals through recycling and other beneficial uses such as renewable energy generation. 
We're in a unique position to help key stakeholders rise to the challenge. And we can do this while growing our business at the same time, collaborating with our stakeholders to find new ways to create value together. Continuing to integrate environmental sustainability into our strategic business framework for long-term sustainable and profitable growth requires a strong focus, which is why we've taken a step to dedicate a member of our senior team to this effort. 
I'm pleased to announce that Tara Hemmer, Senior Vice President of Operations, will be taking this new role as Senior Vice President, Chief Sustainability Officer reporting directly to me effective July 1. With Tara's move, our Area Vice President leading the Greater Mid-Atlantic area, Rafa Carrasco, will be promoted to a member of the senior leadership team as Senior Vice President of Operations. 
We've also launched a new exciting education benefit for our team members this month that will provide development and upskilling opportunities for our workforce. These changes underscore how the tenets of ESG are embedded into our broader business strategy. 
As digital transformation sweeps across nearly every industry in the wake of the pandemic, we're making strides in differentiating our customers' experience through end-to-end digital transformation. Today, our customers can manage their relationship with us through online -- through our online WM -- My WM platform, which is connected operationally through our smart truck technology and supported by our customer analytics and data management tools. 
Our newly automated setup process streamlines customer orders and accelerates the speed at which we can deliver on our commitments, while also reducing our cost to serve. These developments, combined with the continued growth of our e-commerce channel, give us confidence that our decision to accelerate technology investments was the right one, and we will emerge from the pandemic a stronger, more agile company. 
In closing, I want to thank the entire Waste Management team for their hard work and dedication that has positioned us for a record-setting 2021. WM is well positioned to benefit from the continued reopening as more states and provinces emerge from the pandemic, and we expect our commercial, industrial and landfill businesses, our 3 most profitable lines of business, to benefit from further volume recovery and produce robust financial results with high incremental margins over the remainder of the year. 
I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter."

Before reviewing the terrific operating results that we achieved in the first quarter, I want to provide an update on the integration of ADS. Over the last 6 months, we've made significant progress on combining the 2 businesses, and we've been able to accelerate some of our integration plans. 
The teams have worked tirelessly to make sure that this combination goes smoothly. And based on the success of the integration so far, we are increasing our synergy expectations to $150 million of total annual run rate synergies, $130 million coming from operating costs and SG&A savings and $20 million coming from capital savings. 
For 2021, we now expect synergies of between $75 million and $85 million, all coming from cost savings. With approximately $15 million of annualized synergies captured in 2020, we expect to exit 2021 on an annual run rate synergy level of around $100 million. The remaining $50 million is expected to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of operating costs, SG&A and capital expenditures. 
Now turning to our first quarter results. Organic revenue grew 2.1% as disciplined pricing and improved recycling results overcame modest volume declines. Pricing performance for the quarter was very solid with both core price of 3.4% and collection and disposal yield of 2.8%, outpacing our expectations. Notably, our commercial yield rebounded sequentially from 3.1% -- to 3.1% from 1.9% in the fourth quarter. 
As economic reopening progressed during the first quarter, collection and disposal volumes improved again sequentially to a decline of 2.3% from 2.7% in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, net new business turned positive, churn improved meaningfully to 8.2% and service increases expanded. 
While volumes have recovered meaningfully from the second quarter of 2020 collection and disposal decline of 10.9%, as Jim pointed out, WM is positioned to benefit from further improvements in North American economies. For example, at the end of the first quarter, we have recovered about 72% of the commercial yards lost due to COVID, providing room for considerable improvement in commercial volumes as we progress through the year. 
Similarly, our other highest-margin businesses, industrial and landfill, have volume upside opportunity as visibility into the economic reopening continues to improve and more event work is scheduled and completed. 
Looking at the lines of business, we're making improvements with the help of a very [ deliberate ] pricing focus, residential, landfill and recycling, I'm happy to report that we have had standout in each of these areas during the quarter. Residential yield doubled year-over-year to 4.2% as we made strides to improve the profitability in this line of business. This is the highest residential yield we have achieved since 2008 and it showcases our success in demonstrating the value of our service and pricing it appropriately. 
The increased yield drove operating EBITDA margins in the residential line of business to the highest level in the past 12 months despite still elevated residential container rates. Landfill core price was 3.2%, a strong result when you consider the impact of lower volumes related both to the pandemic and severe winter weather. 
In recycling, operating EBITDA doubled year-over-year to achieve earnings that rank in our top 5 best quarters ever. These results are truly a reflection of our work to improve the business model while creating a sustainable solution for our customers and not simply the result of an increase in recycled commodity prices. While our other top recycling quarters had an average commodity price of $127 per ton, we achieved our strong first quarter results with a price of $79 per ton. 
Finally, turning to costs. First quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 130 basis points to 61.1%, demonstrating that we are maintaining our cost discipline as volumes recover. In the first quarter, we saw a 40 basis point improvement in our labor costs as we continue to manage overtime spending. We also saw efficiency improvements in both the commercial and industrial lines of business, which we were able to identify and capture as our investments in technology help make us nimble. 
In closing, I want to thank the Waste Management team for the exceptional job they have done in managing our operations to position us for success in 2021. 
I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail."

As you've heard from both Jim and John, we had a fantastic start to 2021 and we forecast continued strength our business as local economies emerge from the pandemic. These strong results and our confidence in our",828,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As you've heard from both Jim and John, we had a fantastic start to 2021 and we forecast continued strength our business as local economies emerge from the pandemic. These strong results and our confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year have led us to raise our full year financial guidance. 
Revenue growth is expected to be 12.5% to 13%, with combined internal revenue growth from yield and volume in the collection and disposal business of 4.5% or greater. The increased outlook is underpinned by our disciplined pricing programs and strong outlook for continued volume recovery. 
For adjusted operating EBITDA, we now expect to generate between $4.875 billion and $4.975 billion, a $100 million increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance. The improved outlook for adjusted operating EBITDA translates directly into incremental free cash flow, and we now expect that we will generate between $2.325 billion and $2.425 billion of free cash flow for the year. 
Our team members on the frontline continue to deliver and the investments we are making in our people, technology and customer experience are generating strong results. 
Turning to our first quarter results. Net cash provided by operating activities grew $355 million. The contribution from operating EBITDA growth accounted for a little less than half of that increase, with the remainder coming from lower incentive compensation payments and an increase in cash collections from customers, and favorable timing of some of our payables. 
While we expect some of the timing differences experienced in the first quarter to reverse for the year, the remaining contributors to our strong cash flow from operations results position us for a very strong year. 
In the first quarter, capital spending was $270 million, a $189 million decrease from the first quarter of 2020. Capital expenditures were lower in the quarter, primarily due to timing, but the timing of fleet purchases, which we had intentionally front-loaded in 2020 and steps we took in late 2020 to accelerate some of our 2021 capital given our confidence in the pace of volume recovery. 
We continue to prioritize the investments in the long-term growth of our business, including recycling, renewable energy and technology investments that we have previously discussed. For the full year, we expect capital spending to be at the high end of our $1.78 billion to $1.88 billion guidance range as we invest in our business to support growth, reduce our cost to serve and extend our environmental sustainability efforts. 
Putting it all together, our business generated free cash flow of $865 million in the first quarter. The operating EBITDA growth, lower capital expenditures and favorable working capital changes that I discussed drove the significant year-over-year free cash flow increase. This sets us up very well to achieve our increased free cash flow outlook. In the first quarter, we used our free cash flow to pay $247 million in dividends and allocated $250 million to share repurchases. 
Turning to SG&A costs. SG&A was 10.7% of revenue in the first quarter. That's a 20 basis point increase over 2020. We remain focused on managing our discretionary costs, optimizing our structure for the ADS acquisition and using SG&A dollars to enhance our business. Our deliberate increased level of investment in technology as well as higher incentive compensation accruals are the driver of SG&A as a percentage of revenue being above our long-term target of less than 10% of revenue, but we are committed to ensuring we return to that optimized cost structure in the near term. 
Our first quarter leverage ratio of 3.04x has improved from the fourth quarter due to our strong operating EBITDA growth. This leverage ratio remains well within the financial covenant of our revolving credit facility and right at the top of our long-term targeted range of 2.5 to 3x. 
Our strong first quarter results and increased expectations for current year operating EBITDA and free cash flow, position us to purchase at least $1 billion of our shares in 2021, and at the same time, achieve our target leverage of 2.75x by the end of the year. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be a strong balance sheet, prudent investment in the growth of our business and strong and consistent shareholder returns. 
With the strength of our collection and disposal business, expectations for continued recovery and improved market backdrop for recycling, effective cost control and even better-than-expected integration synergies from the ADS acquisition, cash flow converges conversion is strong. And as a result, we expect to increase cash allocated to shareholder returns from our initial plans. 
In closing, it is imperative that we thank the men and women across the Waste Management team for their tireless efforts to serve our customers and communities each day. Our strong results are a testament to their commitment, and we're excited about what we will achieve together over the remainder of the year. 
With that, Holly, let's open the line for questions."

I mean there's a couple of dynamics here. One is that pretty much all U.S. companies are facing, large or small, is this temporary competition against the government for unemployment benefits, and that is having an impact on us. The good news for us is that we didn't lay people off from COVID. So if you did and you're trying to rehire right now, you're having a tough time. And we -- as you may recall, we guaranteed 40 hours last year when COVID first hit and said you're not going to lose your job because of COVID then. So that did help us. Not sure that we expected this unemployment benefit to continue as it has, but it did help us. 
I think the other aspect of this is that we recognize that labor inflation is going to be around. It's been 5%-ish for our nonexempts for a couple of years now, and -- but we didn't anticipate this new competitor, being the government. We think that's temporary. Right now, I think it's scheduled to -- these unemployment benefits are scheduled to go at the end of July. They may have extended with the new package through September. But we'll use pricing from a kind of a macroeconomic standpoint to make sure that we manage volume. We don't need to take all new volume coming. We'll take the best of the new volume and we'll manage accordingly, John and his team will through the labor line, by using price to maybe tamp down some of that volume if we need to."

And in particular, the second quarter had some cost headwinds for health and welfare specifically. We also expected incentive compensation to be a headwind for the full year, though that's even greater headwinds now because of our strong outlook for 2021 than we would have initially expected. 
Our overall margin guidance for 2021 initially was as much as a 50 basis point improvement, you can see with the strong performance in the first quarter. We expect there could be some upside to that, though rather than update margins specifically at this point, we'd really like to see the seasonal results on volume because the contribution margin from that incremental volume is one of the important things for us to keep our eye on. 
That being said, I think it's really important to step back and recognize that we started with guidance that could have been slightly backward at 20 basis points on a year-over-year comparison, both because of those comp headwinds and the integration of ADS. But then when we look at where we stand today, we're confident that we'll actually be at the high end of our expectations of 50 basis points. And that's certainly somewhat because of the ADS synergy capture, but it's also because of some stronger outlook on pricing that I mentioned earlier."

MSW core price was strong for the quarter as were the other lines of business. I think an important distinction here is that several of these lines of business, specifically commercial, also as we've talked many times about recycling, have become somewhat fee-based. And so as volume increases, you see fees increase and those fees go to the price line. 
So it's honestly part of why -- there's a number of reasons why we took the unusual step to raise guidance in Q1. But one of those is the strength that we're seeing in pricing. And of course, a second one is that when you think about volumes, and I mentioned it in my remarks, that volumes really have not recovered fully, especially in those 3 high-margin lines of business: commercial, landfill and industrial. John mentioned, they were starting to see really good green shoots in March and continuing into April on the volume front. 
And then lastly, on reasons why we felt really comfortable with our guidance changes was that recycling is -- as John mentioned in his script, we're producing these great results recycling at average commodity prices. I mean $79 for that basket of commodities is right in the middle of our historical averages, whereas the other 4 quarters, we talked about the top 5 -- being the top 5 best quarters of all time in recycling, and yet the other 4 when we were up at $125, $127 on an average commodity price. We're now down at 79%, at least that's where we were for the quarter. 
So all of those combined to give us real confidence going forward that we could raise guidance. But pricing and landfill pricing, in particular, we think are a strength for the quarter and will continue to be in the next couple of quarters."

We, at this point, are saying bottom end of the range, the historical range of $100 million to $200 million, and that's what we said when we gave guidance back in February, and we're sticking to that right now. 
Look, it's possible though, it's always possible that something comes along and it's too good to pass up. And I think what you'll probably see is that you may see that valuations actually -- it's really just a math equation. You might see valuations come down a little bit because somebody is looking and saying, ""All right, my capital gain here is going to be pretty significant. And here's what the cost of that is at the higher capital gains rates. So I'm willing to come down a little bit in terms of my sales price.""

If you set aside recycling and just talk about commercial, industrial and resi, if we talk about really commercial, I mentioned earlier that we're moving some of that to fee-based. And so that is a component of price, and it's an important component of price. And we think that, that has -- that's going to help and that has helped and will continue to help commercial and industrial. 
And then on residential, John's talked about residential now for 2 or 3 years. And we really look at residential as being one of the real strong points for the quarter. The work that his team -- John and his team have done to get to the highest yield since 2008, a 4% yield has really been a success story for the company. And that's coming as much as anything through -- maybe not as much with fee-based as it's coming through contract renegotiation. 
It might surprise you to know that that's not coming from some of the indexes going up. We actually saw a small amount of deterioration in that for the quarter. Now we do expect that, that -- we do expect that inflation will kick up a little bit, and so we'll get some help. And we're typically a beneficiary of higher inflation. But we didn't benefit in Q1 from that, it was really all -- almost all of it was just renegotiation of contracts. And factoring in to those contracts, the fact that we now expect wages to be a bit higher permanently because of the pandemic and because of somewhat of a permanent shift of some portion of the economy to a work-from-home environment. 
But this was really all -- and then, by the way, there's also this ongoing move to a different index that's more reflective of our cost structure, which is a water, sewer, trash index away from a CPI index. And we're up to about -- about 40% of our overall business is index-driven and about 40% of that is now on a water, sewer, trash, which then equates to about 15% or 16% in total."

We're seeing some reopening in New England. We're seeing some reopening in the Upper Midwest and Illinois. 
I would say that right now, Tyler, the area that is still showing the greatest softness that has not come to the party yet, is Canada. It's mostly Eastern Canada. That -- I looked at the numbers this morning in fact, and still showing weakness in Canada. And it really has to do with the fact that they've remained shut down. We're still showing a little bit of softness also in New York and Michigan. But the number of areas that are in that latter group, the softer group is shrinking, and that's good news.

To answer your question specifically, I would say it's about 23% to 25% of that move or $23 million on $10, if you want to look at it that way. But what  I would caution you by saying that, and I've made this comment on a number of these calls, again, that math is correct. It doesn't slide up and down the same way as it used to because, again, we've put floors in place an inbound customer standpoint. We've got better and secured outlets on the outbound side. I mean we're seeing strong domestic and export markets right now, which is really helping us on the outbound pricing side, and we've got more security around some of those rates. 
So the math I gave you is right. At a point in time if commodity price went way far south, which we don't expect, we expect them to stay hanging there for the next handful of years, that math would change. But about $23 million for that $10 move is where we're at for Q1."

I mean Texas reopened at least partially on the 17th of May last year and then fully reopened later in the year in the third quarter. But some of the states stayed closed until 2021. And if you were a small business in Texas or in Florida or in Arizona, you probably were able to weather the storm. If you were a small business in Michigan or in Toronto, you may have -- you may still be having a tough time weathering the storm. So we don't know exactly what that -- how many of those customers actually just simply don't come back. There will be some amount there for sure. 
But we are, by the way, looking a bit at -- I know a lot of industries are comparing to 2019. And because comparisons are going to start to get really quirky, they already are. I mean comparing to 2020 for any metric is difficult. I'll give you one number that's very encouraging for us, and that's the EBITDA number. It's part of why we were so excited about the quarter and about actually raising guidance. 
When you look at 2019 EBITDA for WM legacy and you add it to kind of ADS legacy, you get something in the neighborhood of kind of 4.8 -- about $4.85 billion. And then you look at what we just adjusted to and it's $100 million above that. Keep in mind, that's not really fair to do that because we divested a bunch of ADS legacies. So -- but even if you don't count that, if you just say WM legacy '19 and ADS legacy '19, you're talking $4.85 billion, and we're $100 million above that and we have not gotten a lot of the volume back and we still have a lot of room to go in terms of ADS. So that's one of the many reasons why we were very encouraged with the quarter and very able to take that unusual step to raise guidance."

And I think we talked a great deal today about the biggest driver and that's the labor cost part of the equation. We certainly think that the efforts that have been put forth by the team to manage overtime hours and get those impacts not just on the service side, but extended through on the repair and maintenance side have been a tremendous value. We want that to continue to be a lever that produces the strong operating margin for the business, and we're optimistic about that. But we also know that there are flex points or breakpoints in the equation that happen when you add an additional route. And so that's what we're watching as we move forward from here with the growing volume environment. 
Aside from labor, I think what's really important is that we can't forget that in our transfer and disposal cost and subcontractor costs, there's a lot of third-party labor costs built into those numbers as well. And so the theme that Jim has pointed us to a number of times today, about the labor pressure that exists across the board, that's something that we've seen in those costs and something we expect to continue into 2021. So 45% contribution margin is what we've talked about. We're encouraged that we think that, that holds, but we think that there could be upside from it. But the labor piece of the equation is really going to be the piece we have to watch."

So the first priority is investing in the long-term growth of the business, and that's something that we talk a great deal about organic growth through focuses in recycling and renewable energy have been places that we've said you could see some outpaced capital spending from us. So the current guide for 2021 incorporates our expectations for the full year in those programs. We just have yet to determine how much we could accelerate spend in 2022 and 2023 to cover incremental investment that could be worthwhile in those spaces. 
I think the rest of the allocation really comes down to shareholder returns, continuing to grow the dividend over the long term in that 45% to 50% range on a payout ratio basis, and we measure that on free cash flow. So there's direct conversion from that free cash flow measure and the long-term incentive plan to award the dividend, which I think is a really strong indicator of how we think about the expected growth that can happen as we revisit that in the fourth quarter. 
Beyond that, the statement that we made about at least $1 billion of share buyback in 2021 is an indication that when we don't see M&A being the place that we will spend that available dollar free cash flow, there is tremendous flexibility to allocate incremental dollars to the shareholders through share buyback. M&A, Jim touched on that, we'll continue to be sure that we're mindful of the opportunities that exist there. And if we see opportunities to provide outpaced returns relative to our other opportunities, we'll be well positioned to do that with the strong balance sheet that I mentioned."

But specifically to your question, I mean, a public, public deal, we didn't -- you don't get the same look under the hood as maybe with a private deal. And once we dig under the hood, what we found is that the areas that are impacted are finding out that they can operate the business more efficiently than we even thought going into it. Secondly, I think on internalization and transportation synergies is another bucket where, again, once we got a look at some of that detail, we were able to drive out additional synergies. 
And then lastly, really, on the supply chain side, even though we're facing a couple of headwinds on some commodity-related pieces, our supply chain group, once they got to look at the whole portfolio of spend there, has also been able to drive some additional benefit. So it's really efficiency in the business in the field, it's the internalization, the transportation and disposal internalization.

But to build it in before we've seen the volume acceleration we thought would be not necessarily prudent based on where we stand. And we knew that $100 million lift in EBITDA from just 2 months ago was a really strong indication of the strength of the overall business. So is there upside? Potentially, but it would have to come from how we see the cost side of the equation flow through as we see volume returns."

Last quarter, we were feeling very good about the prospects for the year when we announced our Q1 results and raised our full year guidance.

Last quarter, we were feeling very good about the prospects for the year when we announced our Q1 results and raised our full year guidance. Now more than halfway through the year, all parts of our business have performed well above those revised expectations. 
In the second quarter, we achieved operating EBITDA of $1.31 billion, which we converted into strong cash from operations of more than $1 billion. First and foremost, this superb performance is a result of our outstanding core business model. In addition, this performance was driven by our continued focus on providing our customers with exceptional service, offering our employees a great place to work and driving sustainability through our business model. 
Our very strong results, in addition to our confidence in the transformative changes we're making to our business model, led us to increase our full year guidance once again. The size of our revisions in each of these first 2 quarters clearly demonstrates the earnings-producing potential of our strategy. In the back half of the year, we expect continued strong volume, pricing that offsets inflationary pressures and record results from our commodity-based businesses. 
With all of this powerful momentum, we now expect to generate 2021 operating -- adjusted operating EBITDA of at least $5 billion with free cash flow of at least $2.5 billion, all while continuing to make growth investments in our sustainable solutions and technology platforms. At the core of these strong results is our recycling business, which is central to our sustainability and business strategy. Our efforts to improve the recycling business, combined with robust demand for recycled commodities, led to second quarter delivering the recycling business' best ever financial performance by a considerable margin. 
We've made substantial progress in derisking our recycling business by shifting to a fee-for-service contract structure, which has lifted the floor for recycled returns and created an economically sustainable business model. We've also made significant technology investments to improve the cost structure and grow the business. At our automated facilities, labor costs were 35% lower in the second quarter compared to our other single-stream MRFs. These investments not only lower operating costs and improve plant efficiency but also allow us to adjust our equipment to respond to evolving end market demands. 
For example, we're now segregating out specific plastics that in the past were sold as a bundled lower-priced bale, reacting quickly as markets evolve for new recycled commodity types. The capability to efficiently sort these materials allows us to extract more value for these commodities as demand increases for recycled material. Overall, our investment in recycling technology -- our investments in recycling technology are generating solid returns, and we are accelerating our plans to roll out this new operating model across our MRF network. 
Sustainability has been a central part of our strategy for many years, so I want to take some time to highlight how we're advancing our sustainability journey. At the beginning of the month, Tara Hemmer transitioned into her new role as Senior Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer, bringing together our sustainable solutions and ESG efforts under 1 umbrella. We believe this strong focus is critical to continuing to integrate environmental sustainability and social responsibility into a strategic business framework. 
Our supply chain goals, which include increasing our spending, both with sustainable and diverse suppliers, are examples of how this focus is integrated in our day-to-day operations. Next month, we're hosting a supplier diversity initiative called Share the Green, which will give women-owned businesses the opportunity to become a supplier for 1 or more of the 45 companies participating in the event. This 3-day nationwide event will provide great opportunities for diverse businesses and help participating companies to secure excellent suppliers. 
And finally, we continue to make real progress on our digital transformation to differentiate our customers' experience. In the past, I've mentioned our automated setup process that streamlines customers' orders and reduces our cost to serve. Through our advanced technology, we're eliminating nearly all manual steps in setting up a customer count, allowing setup to occur almost instantaneously after an order is processed. This will save us several million dollars annually, improve setup accuracy and increase customer satisfaction. 
This more accurate setup of customers also helps us to auto-route these customers, which increases operational efficiency and will optimize routes without manual processing. We are now connecting our advanced technologies to automatically insert 90% of our new commercial customers into existing routes, reducing our cost to serve and improving our speed to service. Our customer and digital teams continue to enhance the capabilities of our digital tools to provide a unique and engaging experience for our customers while, at the same time, connecting this front-end experience to our operational systems to allow for improved efficiency and lower costs. We expect that these investments in technology will continue to benefit us for many years to come. 
In conclusion, strong performance across all of our businesses, collection and disposal, recycling and renewable energy generated outstanding results so far this year. Our focus on disciplined pricing and cost management helped to offset the inflationary cost pressures that we've seen. And we expect to continue this focus into the second half of the year to help us deliver on our newly revised outlook. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter."
190694,1671943203,2351649,"Waste Management, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with the excellent second quarter results we achieved across our business.

We're pleased with the excellent second quarter results we achieved across our business. We produced exceptional EBITDA growth of almost 24% in the collection and disposal business as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic's steepest impacts in the second quarter of 2020. Collection and disposal volume climbed 9.6% in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations. And our focus on disciplined pricing programs produced a substantive second quarter collection and disposal yield of 3.7%.
Turning more specifically to our volume results. Robust recovery in our highest-margin businesses, commercial, industrial and landfill drove our very strong performance. In the second quarter, commercial and MSW volume reached pre-pandemic levels, and industrial volumes recovered to levels just shy of those before the pandemic. While we're very pleased with the pace of volume recovery thus far, there remains opportunity for further volume improvement in the second half of the year from key areas of our business, including industrial, special waste and certain geographies such as Canada. 
Additionally, pockets of our commercial business, such as education and offices have yet to fully recover. For the full year, we now expect organic volume in the collection and disposal business to grow 2.5% or more. Pivoting to price, our second quarter results further demonstrate the focus the entire team has on overcoming our cost headwinds as well as improvements following the intentional customer-focused steps we took in the second quarter of 2020. This focus is particularly evident in our residential core price of 5.4%, landfill core price of 4.7% and transfer core price of 3.4%. We continue to be committed to pricing programs that are aligned with our cost structure, which is even more important as we see pressure on labor, transportation, supplies and capital costs. Our new full year outlook for collection and disposal yield is 3.0% or greater. 
Our strong revenue growth was also supported by great results in our customer metrics. Churn was 8.8% in the quarter, and service increases outpaced service decreases by more than twofold. Additionally, we increased our net customer growth rate, driven by optimization of our sales force and investments in technology. 
Looking at operating costs. Second quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 10 basis points to 61.1%, demonstrating that we are continuing to manage our cost as volumes recover even in the face of inflationary cost pressures. It's no surprise to anyone who follows economic indicators that most businesses are experiencing inflation in their costs throughout 2021, and our business is no exception, particularly with regard to labor. We expect to overcome these pressures by increasing operating efficiencies and executing on our disciplined pricing programs. 
There's no silver bullet when it comes to attracting and retaining talent, and we are using a multifaceted approach that includes addressing wages, offering flexible schedules and broadening benefits. Our long-term focus is on keeping our people first so that we are the employer of choice. Overall, inflation trends are something we are watching very closely and managing very proactively with our area, supply chain and revenue management teams. 
We continue to make progress on the integration of the Advanced Disposal operations. To date, we've combined around 45% of the ADS operations into our billing and operational systems, which has allowed us to capture synergies and provide additional services to those customers. We are on track to migrate virtually all the ADS customers by the end of the year. Year-to-date, we have achieved more than $30 million of annual run rate synergies, and we expect cost synergies of between $80 million and $85 million in 2021. This will bring the annual run rate synergies to around $100 million at the end of 2021, and we continue to forecast another $50 million to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of cost and capital savings. 
And finally, as Jim mentioned, our recycling team set new highs in the second quarter with record contributions to earnings and margins. We also achieved strong growth in our renewable energy business as we generated and sold more RINs and sold them at higher prices. We've made significant investments in these businesses in recent years, and we're pleased with the strong returns they're generating. 
Before I turn the call over to Devina, I want to thank the entire WM team for the remarkable job they have done in managing our operations and providing safe and reliable service to our customers. Our people really are the foundation of our success. And with that, I'll hand off to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail."
190694,1671943203,2351649,"Waste Management, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning. Our team once again delivered strong performance in the second quarter.

Our team once again delivered strong performance in the second quarter. Robust volume growth since last year's peak pandemic impact, dynamic pricing efforts, record recycling results, disciplined integration of the ADS business and our continued focus on cost management combined to deliver 28% operating EBITDA growth and 50 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion. As Jim mentioned, these outstanding results and our confidence in the continued strength of our business model have led us to raise our 2021 financial guidance yet again. 
Full year revenue growth is now expected to be 15.5% to 16%, with organic growth in the collection and disposal business of 5.5% or greater. For adjusted operating EBITDA, we expect to generate between $5 billion and $5.1 billion, an increase of $225 million at the midpoint from the original guidance we provided in February. 
Our business is exceeding the strong outlook we established at the beginning of the year on a number of fronts. Volume has recovered, particularly in the commercial collection business at a faster rate than we expected. Market values for recycled commodities and RINs have increased. Our integration of the ADS business has generated more synergy value. And certain of our technology investments focused on reducing our cost to serve have delivered more savings than planned. 
While the bridge from our initial guidance to the current guidance has a number of puts and takes, the most significant drivers are accelerated price and volume recoveries in the collection and disposal business of about $135 million; improved recycling profitability of another $135 million; renewable energy increases of about $55 million; and additional ADS synergies of around $25 million. These increases are partially offset by elevated cost inflation and incentive compensation costs that we currently estimate to be about $125 million. The increase in adjusted operating EBITDA guidance is expected to translate directly into incremental free cash flow, and we now expect that we will generate between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion of free cash flow for the year. 
Turning to our second quarter results. SG&A was 9.6% of revenue in the second quarter, a 30 basis point improvement over 2020. This result demonstrates our success-making incremental technology investments that will benefit our customer engagement and cost to serve over the long term. At the same time, we're realizing benefits from the integration of ADS and returns on certain of our new technology solutions. We also continue to focus on managing our discretionary spending to optimize our costs. 
Second quarter net cash provided by operating activities grew more than 20%. This increase was driven by our extremely strong operating EBITDA growth. There was an unfavorable working capital comparison in the second quarter, but we attribute that to timing differences in tax payments and cash received from CNG credits. We are encouraged to see continued progress on our DSO and DPO measures. 
In the second quarter, capital spending was $396 million, bringing capital expenditures in the first half of 2021 to just over $665 million. While capital spending in the first half of the year was expected to be less than prior year due to timing differences in truck delivery schedules, our 2021 pace of capital expenditures has been slower than we planned. The slower pace is due to supply chain and labor constraints impacting some of our vendors, and we've made deliberate decisions to defer spending in some categories as we observe what we expect to be temporary dislocation in certain markets. To offset these delays, we're proactively pulling forward capital investments in areas we can and also where we know the returns will be strong. 
As Jim mentioned, we're in the process of accelerating recycling investments as we have strong proof points of technology and equipment upgrades, reducing the cost structure of the business and improving delivered quality of processed materials. We continue to target full year capital spending within our $1.78 billion to $1.88 billion guidance range. 
In the first half of 2021, our business generated free cash flow of $1.5 billion, a conversion from operating EBITDA of 61%. This very strong result positions us well to achieve our new higher free cash flow outlook even as we target capital spending increases in the second half of the year. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be a strong balance sheet, prudent investment in the growth of our business and strong and consistent shareholder returns. In the second quarter, we paid $242 million in dividends and allocated $250 million to share repurchases. Our leverage ratio of 2.84x has improved even more quickly than expected due to our strong operating EBITDA growth, and it's tracking well toward our target leverage of 2.7x -- 2.75x by the end of the year. At the same time, our robust cash generation in the first half of the year positions us to increase our full year share repurchase expectation up to our full $1.35 billion authorization. With this increase, we expect our weighted average share count for the full year to be approximately 422 million shares. 
Thanks to the hard work of every member of the WM team, we delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial results. The successes of the first half of 2021 position WM to deliver on our commitments to our people, our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. With that, Holly, let's open the line for questions."

And as Devina went through the numbers and John as well, we have had to hire at a higher rate. I think Devina mentioned $125 million as kind of a combination of incentive compensation and higher costs. And so those higher costs, in large part, are due to some of these inflationary pressures that we're seeing on the labor line. 
And so if I use June as an example, I think the number is -- we hired 685 mostly drivers and technicians in the month of June. And it wasn't just churning people because we had 125 who left. So the net addition was pretty significant to replace some of these folks that have decided to sit on the sidelines because of the government programs that are out there. I would tell you those government programs are affecting not just us, they're affecting big and small businesses. And right now, at least in the United States, the federal benefits are scheduled to roll off on the sixth of September. It's not a stretch to say that there isn't a business out there that isn't looking forward to the sixth of September. 
To your first question about whether it is precluding growth or just creating some difficulties on it with existing customers, I think it's much more of the latter. I don't see it keeping us from growing and that's reflected mostly in our volume figures."

One is we think there's a permanent shift that's taken place, particularly as you think about OCC but also plastics. Just to give you 1 other data point here. When we think about OCC pricing and how much room it has to go, we're 17% above historical averages at the end of the second quarter but we're still 40% below all-time highs. So we think there still is room to go. 
And as we and other companies are kind of moving forward, this ESG movement is really gaining traction. We think that commodities like plastics will continue to increase in price. So we're encouraged by the pricing trends. And we don't think they're the same kind of ebbs and flows that were short-lived in the past. We think these are longer term."

In the renewable energy business, I would say it's been a little more peaks and valleys with regard to our investment trend historically. But when we look forward, the pipeline for continued investment is very strong. We have 1 additional project that will complete in 2021, and we're already looking at somewhere around 5 or more for the years to come. We're still in the process of considering whether or not that's something that we do ourselves or that we look to do in partnership with others because this is a place where not only is there reason for us to consider preserving our capital for high-growth opportunities in the traditional collection and disposal business, but there's also tremendous interest in this type of investment in the space at sustainability and projects like this that are so unique in terms of opportunity can create incremental value.

But most importantly, I think you saw really strong pricing in industrial and commercial collection and then also the steps that we're taking to continue to drive price in the landfill line of business. 
Our outlook for second half because of the year-over-year comp is that we'll have yield in the range of 2.75% to 3% in the back half of the year, and that's just representative of a more normalized pricing range that we had in the second half of 2020 relative to the second quarter of last year when we took those proactive steps that were really focused on customer retention and taking care of our customers in a desperate time of need.

But we're really excited about the baseline that we've established. We're making progress on the working capital front, and we've certainly also made progress in terms of the investments that we're making in capital expenditures paying strong returns. 
The place I would give a little bit of caution with respect to that being the right number is the recycling and renewable energy business is providing a lift from a flow-through perspective, and you're not having to make an incremental capital investment to get that dollar. We did have a low bonus payment in 2021 as a result of the poor performance in 2020, and that will have an opposite impact in the year ahead. 
And then there's also some uncertainty in what corporate taxes look like in 2022. But I will tell you that the returns that we're seeing on our technology investments, the reduced interest run rate that we've established, given the recent debt transaction, having ADS fully integrated in the year ahead and just the general strong performance of the collection and disposal business, those things do provide upside. And so we're optimistic that we can maintain that 50%, but there is a little bit of caution that's prudent."

I appreciate the demand side of sustainability, lifting commodity values structurally and this is the hard part of modeling. There's also a supply issue going on and disruption. So at some level, even if the next low is a much higher low, this is a tough question because it's -- what are we at risk at? And then I'm comparing it to your last peak, which is 2017. And yet the business model is different because in 2017, it was commodity-based. Today, it's 60% fee-based. So how do we, as modelers, think about managing risk around that recycling revenue line?"

And then really, it's more smoothing out the low lows than smoothing out the high highs. We'd like to take advantage of these very high prices when they get there but not taking on the chin when we have the very low prices. 
And so some of that derisking is moving to a fee-based model. Some of it has -- and that has really proven to be successful for us. Some of it is the new technology that John and I mentioned, putting that into our network so that we operate those at a lower-cost structure. I mentioned 35% difference between the kind of the next-gen plants versus current plants. And Devina mentioned an acceleration of CapEx there pulling that forward. So that's a way that I think we mitigate some of this. 
And then I do believe that it probably was -- while it didn't feel like that at the time, it was probably a good thing that we ultimately lost our biggest customer in recycling, which was China a couple of years ago because now it's all moved -- a lot of that's moved back state-side and is more predictable. And so I think the recycling business has changed a lot from when we had our last peak, which was, as you said, 2017 and it's changed for the better and I think it's changed permanently."

And I looked at July's numbers again this morning and that's still there. The encouraging part about Canada is it looks like it's going to reopen fully sometime in the next 2 to 3 weeks so that is encouraging for us. But it hasn't been great, and it has been kind of 3 to 6 months behind the United States. So July's numbers still look soft in Canada. That's really the biggest geographic difference for us. 
I think when you -- John mentioned that commercial has fully recovered when you really compare to 2019 -- 2020 comparisons, for obvious reasons, are not really meaningful. But when you start comparing to 2019, commercial has fully recovered. But it's only about 0.5% above 2019. We really haven't seen kind of the growth aspect of the economy hit that commercial line of business. 
And then maybe most encouraging of all for us individually and then also on a more macro basis for the overall economy, are our C&D and special waste streams. And when we look sequentially at how they did, I mean, those 2 waste streams took the biggest hit of anything last year during COVID. And so they have seen the biggest sequential improvement, so they are on a great upward track. And I think those 2 by themselves, which tend to be kind of the most forward-looking indicators for us, are the best barometer overall of not only our business going forward but maybe even the North American economies, a good macro sign for the comp."

But when you look sequentially at what we did in terms of collection price and in terms of landfill price, that's what gives us -- that's what makes us feel most encouraged about the potential going forward. 
And to Devina's point, that is an area of confidence for us. The team understands that pricing is critical to cost recovery but that it's also critical to margin expansion. So we're not just looking at this as a cost recovery mechanism. Part of the success for the quarter was that we did use pricing to recover some of those cost pressures that we've discussed. But it also helped us expand margins. And that really is the plan going into 2022, that we'll continue to use price to offset what we expect will be some continued inflation, not as aggressive of inflation figures we're seeing now because some of this, we believe, is temporary, as I mentioned earlier, caused by some of the current government's benefits. But there is some -- feels like some structural inflation in the system. Pricing will help us more than recover that and will be a good thing for us going forward.

As we started to get more confidence in what was coming back in terms of post-COVID recovery, we tried to get out in front of us. So we have been making steady progress really for the last 4 or 5 months. It really flipped in June and we really saw the fruits of our labor take hold. 
I would expect that going forward for the next handful of months, we're going to continue at a similar pace. Keep in mind though, to the extent we talked about volume recovery and what lines of business is coming from, coupled with, as an example, in residential, where we may shed a little bit of volume going forward to get the right margins, we have to balance all those things out. But I think Jim's commentary around what we did in June is something you can expect from us as the next handful of months."

So by the way, to your point about our balance sheet, I mean, it's a compliment to Devina and John and the whole team for really getting our balance sheet back down to where we said it would be by the end of the year, and that's -- it's pretty impressive that through this acquisition, we're already down below 3x against down, I think, 2.85x. 
Regarding M&A, Hamzah, outside of core, the -- and you mentioned specifically plastics, I think you're aware of the ownership position we have in the company called Continuous Materials, and that company does turn plastics and paper -- low-value plastics and mixed papers into a roofing material. And we have a 33-ish percent investment in them at this point. So that -- we're excited about the potential for that. And it helps us take some of that material that might otherwise find its way to a landfill, pull it out of the landfill because it doesn't do anything in terms of creating any gas or anything usable coming out of the landfill and doing something that's preferable in terms of kind of ESG but also preferable financially for us. 
So we will look for those types of investments. We're cautious about big acquisitions regardless but particularly cautious about big noncore acquisitions. I just don't want to step on a landmine here as we're walking down a pretty nice path and that could be a landmine if we were to do something like that. So we're not opposed to doing noncore acquisitions. We want to make sure that we have a lot of intelligence in those before we do anything. And I would be surprised, very surprised if you would see us do anything large in the noncore space."

So this is a new disclosure that we're making, and as the leading commentary on the table suggests, what we are attempting to do here is just provide clarity where there is a bit of inconsistency across the industry. And one of the things in particular that's really important in this business is conversation about operating EBITDA margin. And for WM in Q2 of 2021, on an apples-to-apples basis as best we can when we compare across the business, our operating EBITDA results were 31.2% for the quarter when you compare with this approach more similarly aligned with one of our competitors in particular. 
And all we're doing here, you can look at the operating expense table that's in the 10-Q and what you see there is the cost of goods sold line, and that includes rebates that we pay in the recycling line of business. That's the driver of that cost category. And what we're doing here is reflecting that if you were to net that against the associated revenues rather than grossing it up between revenue and operating expenses. The impact to our margin is 130 basis points in the quarter. 
The increase on a year-over-year basis reflects the strength of commodity prices, which we've talked about. And so naturally, with the continued strength and outlook for even better year-over-year comps in the second half of the year than we had in the first half of the year, you would expect that to expand further from the 130 basis points that we measured in the second quarter. But really, for us, this is about comparability and trying to enhance that across the space."

Similarly, we're seeing some folks that are saying, ""You know what, I don't like the labor environment right now."" And they're looking at selling for that reason.

But there is going to be a little bit of a lingering effect because I think the workforce is going to change a little bit. You're going to see some more folks work remotely or from home. But that doesn't look meaningful. We have seen a little bit, Jim commented on this earlier, we have seen a little bit of a shift in the residential recycling stream. Obviously, Amazon is doing well. We're seeing it show up in the percentage of cardboard that's coming out or fiber is coming out of a lot of our residential contracts, which is honestly a good thing, especially in this environment. 
We're seeing some improvement, although not as significant by weight, if you will, in terms of the quality and quantity of some of the higher-margin streams. We talked specifically about plastics and the kind of mixed plastic we use to make versus the specific plastic products that we're producing for customers. So we view that all as positive. I think overall in general volume in terms of units, I don't think our message has changed. We're going to continue to make sure that we move residential from a margin perspective up to where it competes with every other line of business. And we're really making good progress there. 
And if you look at our price versus volume in the last handful of quarters, it has been slightly negative. But if you look at the core price and yield compared to that, that's certainly a trade-off we're.

They just unveiled their road map to 2025. And at the same time, it really seems like there's still a pretty big infrastructure gap around recycling these materials and getting them back to those producers. You just look at the difference between the commingled and the individual grades of plastics. 
So would just love to understand kind of your road map for how this is a growth opportunity for the company, both in terms of putting in more infrastructure in terms of helping to close the loop and getting some of these materials back to the manufacturers and then being able to potentially capture organic share gains with those types of manufacturers as a result."

We've always had the supply, but we haven't, until fairly recently, had as much demand as we would like. We've had demand but maybe not as much as we would like. And I think what we're seeing is that companies are now, with this real focus on virtually every company, ESG focus, are inclined to use recycled material, recycled -- improve the recycled content percentages. So that's been a benefit for us. 
There is still, to your point, there still is opportunity, I think, to expand infrastructure, particularly here in the U.S., but we are seeing it -- we're seeing encouraging signs there. And we have outlets through our brokerage group outside of the United States, which has been one of the real benefits there. When China went away literally overnight, our brokerage team was able to move commodities pretty quickly to other spots, other places around the world. And we still have those and we'll continue to move commodities there. 
But I do like the long-term trends not only for our recycling business but as someone who's is very focused on the environment.

I think around the demand of the customer, we all mentioned that, that side of the equation is as strong now as it's ever been. And for all the comments made around ESG, we feel confident that, that's going to continue to grow. And I think plastics is 1 example. I mean, we've got the material stream either through our plants or through in other parts of the waste stream. And what you're seeing is some migration from what was in the waste stream obviously now to higher-value commodities. 
And Devina said this not today but on other calls, when you look at it from a return -- a return on invested capital standpoint, our recycle plants are at the top of the heap.

When we get often and what I said on the last call and publicly in other venues is we are working with a number of vendors to watch to see how the battery technology is advancing. As I said before, I think naturally, we're going to -- we were seeing it in the passenger vehicles and we'll probably see in light-duty vehicles. In some cases, we're seeing it already. So we've got a number of vendors we're working with to watch the way the different technologies advance. 
I would tell you in terms of our strategy on fleet, we've said before, we've pivoted from the traditional diesel fleet that we had to CNG. I wouldn't say it was seamlessly but the way our fleet plan works is we have some flexibility to be able to move from diesel to CNG, and we view it as CNG to battery electric vehicles the same way. 
I would tell you what I think will happen is, and I talked about this at the conference [indiscernible] a few weeks ago at Waste Expo, I am confident that over time, they're going to solve the weight issue, the range issue, the [indiscernible] refuse vehicle, all those things, I think, will get solved. I think the bigger question is the infrastructure piece. And we're also watching [indiscernible] to see what kind of infrastructure we would need in our distributed environment to be able to service a fleet of 20,000 vehicles."

It's something that's impacted us in the first half of the year. The total impact for the full year, we now expect to be in the ballpark of around $60 million, could be a little north of that from an EBITDA cost perspective. And so you are seeing some margin pressure from that. 
When we look at the collection and disposal business, in particular, when we disclosed in the press release that, that business was backwards 10 basis points relative to prior year, 50 basis points of that was actually incentive compensation. So when you adjust for that, that shows that the traditional solid waste business actually made really strong progress in margin expansion. 
Our cash flow impact on a year-over-year basis will show up in 2022. And so that's where I made the 2022 comment earlier because this year in 2021, when we paid last year's bonus, we had a little bit of a benefit to cash flow relative to what we would expect in the year ahead just because 2020's payout was around 70% for the total company, and we expect this year to be meaningfully higher than that."

And what I would say is the implied guide on margin is that we're basically flat to positive 50 basis points for the full year. And what that implies about the second half is that we will have a chance for a little bit of margin degradation from the year prior. The what behind that really comes down to the inflationary cost pressures that we've talked a great deal about, incentive compensation but also the conversation about the strength in hiring. We're going to have additional training hours in the back half of the year as we get those new drivers on board. 
All of those things put slight downward pressure on the margin outlook. But there are a lot of positives and we're focused on those positives and think that they could outperform what we're currently projecting, though too early to say. The first is definitely the strength of the traditional solid waste business. And we always have to lead with that. Certainly, recycling commodity price and RIN values provide additional benefit from a margin perspective. 
Then the ADS integration, the strength of that in the back half of the year and John's comments earlier about where we are year-to-date on synergies but where we expect to end the year. The ADS business, we estimate, could have provided as much as a 75 basis point headwind to our margins in the second quarter. And we expect that, that moderates in the back half of the year as we do things like moderate the level of incremental investment that's needed in the fleet to get it to WM standards, and we realize that synergy potential that we've outlined for everyone. 
So as much as there are some things that are working against us, we do think that there are some tailwinds. Just a little difficult for us to predict, particularly given the inflationary cost environment that we're all talking about."

When all this gets normalized, when we think about 2022, just to set the stage here, are we thinking like 2%-plus volumes with this economic recovery, yields shifting higher because of pricing? Is it in the 3% range? And what you're seeing on the pricing front, and Devina, like what you suggested with some of these moderating investments, I mean, are we thinking about margin expansion above 50% in 2022 with what you guys are seeing right now and the yield you guys are expecting in the second half of this year as some of these costs that kind of fade out next year?

But on kind of a bigger scale here, I do think we're feeling encouraged about the volume and the price forecast as we think about 2022 and even beyond 2022. Pricing, in particular, feels like we're  encouraged that we're able to not only cover inflationary cost increases but also add to margin. And we're very encouraged by the sequential signs we've seen both in collection and landfill pricing. So that gives us quite a bit of confidence on the price front. 
Volumes, the volumes have been good. And to your point, 2020 comparisons were not meaningful. But look, volume hasn't totally returned. I talked about Canada being soft. And we think Canada obviously will come back when we get to 2022, so that would be a tailwind for us on the volume side. Landfill volumes have not fully returned. MSW is the 1 that may be the exception there, but I mentioned special waste and C&D that have not fully returned. Those appear, though, to be very strong right now, and the pipeline appears very good with special waste. 
So we'll obviously give you more color as we get to our guidance session, but we feel encouraged about what we're doing on OpEx, what we're seeing on volume and price, and we feel encouraged about the longer-term trends for recycling. All of that would bode well for the -- at the out years."

Last quarter, we were feeling very good about the prospects for the year when we announced our Q1 results and raised our full year guidance. Now more than halfway through the year, all parts of our business ha",903,"Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Last quarter, we were feeling very good about the prospects for the year when we announced our Q1 results and raised our full year guidance. Now more than halfway through the year, all parts of our business have performed well above those revised expectations.  
In the second quarter, we achieved operating EBITDA of $1.31 billion, which we converted into strong cash from operations of more than $1 billion. First and foremost, this superb performance is a result of our outstanding core business model. In addition, this performance was driven by our continued focus on providing our customers with exceptional service, offering our employees a great place to work and driving sustainability through our business model. Our very strong results, in addition to our confidence in the transformative changes we're making to our business model, led us to increase our full year guidance once again. The size of our revisions in each of these first 2 quarters clearly demonstrates the earnings-producing potential of our strategy. In the back half of the year, we expect continued strong volume, pricing that offsets inflationary pressures and record results from our commodity-based businesses.  
With all of this powerful momentum, we now expect to generate 2021 operating -- adjusted operating EBITDA of at least $5 billion with free cash flow of at least $2.5 billion, all while continuing to make growth investments in our sustainable solutions and technology platforms. At the core of these strong results is our recycling business, which is central to our sustainability and business strategy. Our efforts to improve the recycling business, combined with robust demand for recycled commodities, led to second quarter delivering the recycling business' best ever financial performance by a considerable margin.  
We've made substantial progress in derisking our recycling business by shifting to a fee-for-service contract structure, which has lifted the floor for recycled returns and created an economically sustainable business model. We've also made significant technology investments to improve the cost structure and grow the business. At our automated facilities, labor costs were 35% lower in the second quarter compared to our other single-stream MRFs. These investments not only lower operating costs and improve plant efficiency but also allow us to adjust our equipment to respond to evolving end market demands.  
For example, we're now segregating out specific plastics that in the past were sold as a bundled lower-priced bale, reacting quickly as markets evolve for new recycled commodity types. The capability to efficiently sort these materials allows us to extract more value for these commodities as demand increases for recycled material. Overall, our investment in recycling technology -- our investments in recycling technology are generating solid returns, and we are accelerating our plans to roll out this new operating model across our MRF network.  
Sustainability has been a central part of our strategy for many years, so I want to take some time to highlight how we're advancing our sustainability journey. At the beginning of the month, Tara Hemmer transitioned into her new role as Senior Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer, bringing together our sustainable solutions and ESG efforts under one umbrella. We believe this strong focus is critical to continuing to integrate environmental sustainability and social responsibility into a strategic business framework.  
Our supply chain goals, which include increasing our spending, both with sustainable and diverse suppliers, are examples of how this focus is integrated in our day-to-day operations. Next month, we're hosting a supplier diversity initiative called Share the Green, which will give women-owned businesses the opportunity to become a supplier for 1 or more of the 45 companies participating in the event. This 3-day nationwide event will provide great opportunities for diverse businesses and help participating companies to secure excellent suppliers.  
And finally, we continue to make real progress on our digital transformation to differentiate our customers' experience. In the past, I've mentioned our automated setup process that streamlines customers' orders and reduces our cost to serve. Through our advanced technology, we're eliminating nearly all manual steps in setting up a customer account, allowing setup to occur almost instantaneously after an order is processed. This will save us several million dollars annually, improve setup accuracy and increase customer satisfaction.  
This more accurate setup of customers also helps us to auto-route these customers, which increases operational efficiency and will optimize routes without manual processing. We are now connecting our advanced technologies to automatically insert 90% of our new commercial customers into existing routes, reducing our cost to serve and improving our speed to service. Our customer and digital teams continue to enhance the capabilities of our digital tools to provide a unique and engaging experience for our customers while, at the same time, connecting this front-end experience to our operational systems to allow for improved efficiency and lower costs. We expect that these investments in technology will continue to benefit us for many years to come.  
In conclusion, strong performance across all of our businesses, collection and disposal, recycling and renewable energy generated outstanding results so far this year. Our focus on disciplined pricing and cost management helped to offset the inflationary cost pressures that we've seen. And we expect to continue this focus into the second half of the year to help us deliver on our newly revised outlook. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter."

We're pleased with the excellent second quarter results we achieved across our business.

We're pleased with the excellent second quarter results we achieved across our business. We produced exceptional EBITDA growth of almost 24% in the collection and disposal business as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic's steepest impacts in the second quarter of 2020. Collection and disposal volume climbed 9.6% in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations. And our focus on disciplined pricing programs produced a substantive second quarter collection and disposal yield of 3.7%. 
Turning more specifically to our volume results. Robust recovery in our highest-margin businesses, commercial, industrial and landfill, drove our very strong performance. In the second quarter, commercial and MSW volume reached pre-pandemic levels, and industrial volumes recovered to levels just shy of those before the pandemic. While we're very pleased with the pace of volume recovery thus far, there remains opportunity for further volume improvement in the second half of the year from key areas of our business, including industrial, special waste and certain geographies such as Canada.  
Additionally, pockets of our commercial business, such as education and offices, have yet to fully recover. For the full year, we now expect organic volume in the collection and disposal business to grow 2.5% or more. Pivoting to price, our second quarter results further demonstrate the focus the entire team has on overcoming our cost headwinds as well as improvements following the intentional customer-focused steps we took in the second quarter of 2020. This focus is particularly evident in our residential core price of 5.4%, landfill core price of 4.7% and transfer core price of 3.4%. We continue to be committed to pricing programs that are aligned with our cost structure, which is even more important as we see pressure on labor, transportation, supplies and capital costs. Our new full year outlook for collection and disposal yield is 3.7% or greater.  
Our strong revenue growth was also supported by great results in our customer metrics. Churn was 8.8% in the quarter, and service increases outpaced service decreases by more than twofold. Additionally, we increased our net customer growth rate, driven by optimization of our sales force and investments in technology.  
Looking at operating costs. Second quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 10 basis points to 61.1%, demonstrating that we are continuing to manage our cost as volumes recover even in the face of inflationary cost pressures. It's no surprise to anyone who follows economic indicators that most businesses are experiencing inflation in their costs throughout 2021, and our business is no exception, particularly with regard to labor. We expect to overcome these pressures by increasing operating efficiencies and executing on our disciplined pricing programs.  
There's no silver bullet when it comes to attracting and retaining talent, and we are using a multifaceted approach that includes addressing wages, offering flexible schedules and broadening benefits. Our long-term focus is on keeping our people first so that we are the employer of choice. Overall, inflation trends are something we are watching very closely and managing very proactively with our area, supply chain and revenue management teams.  
We continue to make progress on the integration of the Advanced Disposal operations. To date, we've combined around 45% of the ADS operations into our billing and operational systems, which has allowed us to capture synergies and provide additional services to those customers. We are on track to migrate virtually all the ADS customers by the end of the year. Year-to-date, we have achieved more than $30 million of annual run rate synergies, and we expect cost synergies of between $80 million and $85 million in 2021. This will bring the annual run rate synergies to around $100 million at the end of 2021, and we continue to forecast another $50 million to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of cost and capital savings.  
And finally, as Jim mentioned, our recycling team set new highs in the second quarter with record contributions to earnings and margins. We also achieved strong growth in our renewable energy business as we generated and sold more RINs and sold them at higher prices. We've made significant investments in these businesses in recent years, and we're pleased with the strong returns they're generating.  
Before I turn the call over to Devina, I want to thank the entire WM team for the remarkable job they have done in managing our operations and providing safe and reliable service to our customers. Our people really are the foundation of our success. And with that, I'll hand off to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail."
190694,1671943203,2351811,"Waste Management, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning. Our team once again delivered strong performance in the second quarter.

Our team once again delivered strong performance in the second quarter. Robust volume growth since last year's peak pandemic impact, dynamic pricing efforts, record recycling results, disciplined integration of the ADS business and our continued focus on cost management combined to deliver 28% operating EBITDA growth and 50 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion. As Jim mentioned, these outstanding results and our confidence in the continued strength of our business model have led us to raise our 2021 financial guidance yet again.  
Full year revenue growth is now expected to be 15.5% to 16%, with organic growth in the collection and disposal business of 5.5% or greater. For adjusted operating EBITDA, we expect to generate between $5 billion and $5.1 billion, an increase of $225 million at the midpoint from the original guidance we provided in February. Our business is exceeding the strong outlook we established at the beginning of the year on a number of fronts. Volume has recovered, particularly in the commercial collection business at a faster rate than we expected. Market values for recycled commodities and RINs have increased. Our integration of the ADS business has generated more synergy value. And certain of our technology investments focused on reducing our cost to serve have delivered more savings than planned.  
While the bridge from our initial guidance to the current guidance has a number of puts and takes, the most significant drivers are accelerated price and volume recoveries in the collection and disposal business of about $135 million; improved recycling profitability of another $135 million; renewable energy increases of about $55 million; and additional ADS synergies of around $25 million. These increases are partially offset by elevated cost inflation and incentive compensation costs that we currently estimate to be about $125 million. The increase in adjusted operating EBITDA guidance is expected to translate directly into incremental free cash flow, and we now expect that we will generate between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion of free cash flow for the year.  
Turning to our second quarter results. SG&A was 9.6% of revenue in the second quarter, a 30 basis point improvement over 2020. This result demonstrates our success-making incremental technology investments that will benefit our customer engagement and cost to serve over the long term. At the same time, we're realizing benefits from the integration of ADS and returns on certain of our new technology solutions. We also continue to focus on managing our discretionary spending to optimize our costs.  
Second quarter net cash provided by operating activities grew more than 20%. This increase was driven by our extremely strong operating EBITDA growth. There was an unfavorable working capital comparison in the second quarter, but we attribute that to timing differences in tax payments and cash received from CNG credits. We are encouraged to see continued progress on our DSO and DPO measures.  
In the second quarter, capital spending was $396 million, bringing capital expenditures in the first half of 2021 to just over $665 million. While capital spending in the first half of the year was expected to be less than prior year due to timing differences in truck delivery schedules, our 2021 pace of capital expenditures has been slower than we planned. The slower pace is due to supply chain and labor constraints impacting some of our vendors, and we've made deliberate decisions to defer spending in some categories as we observe what we expect to be temporary dislocation in certain markets. To offset these delays, we're proactively pulling forward capital investments in areas we can and also where we know the returns will be strong.  
As Jim mentioned, we're in the process of accelerating recycling investments as we have strong proof points of technology and equipment upgrades, reducing the cost structure of the business and improving delivered quality of processed materials. We continue to target full year capital spending within our $1.78 billion to $1.88 billion guidance range.  
In the first half of 2021, our business generated free cash flow of $1.5 billion, a conversion from operating EBITDA of 61%. This very strong result positions us well to achieve our new higher free cash flow outlook even as we target capital spending increases in the second half of the year. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be a strong balance sheet, prudent investment in the growth of our business and strong and consistent shareholder returns. In the second quarter, we paid $242 million in dividends and allocated $250 million to share repurchases. Our leverage ratio of 2.84x has improved even more quickly than expected due to our strong operating EBITDA growth, and it's tracking well toward our target leverage of 2.7x -- 2.75x by the end of the year. At the same time, our robust cash generation in the first half of the year positions us to increase our full year share repurchase expectation up to our full $1.35 billion authorization. With this increase, we expect our weighted average share count for the full year to be approximately 422 million shares.  
Thanks to the hard work of every member of the WM team, we delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial results. The successes of the first half of 2021 position WM to deliver on our commitments to our people, our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. With that, Holly, let's open the line for questions."

And as Devina went through the numbers and John as well, we have had to hire at a higher rate. I think Devina mentioned $125 million as kind of a combination of incentive compensation and higher costs. And so those higher costs, in large part, are due to some of these inflationary pressures that we're seeing on the labor line.  
And so if I use June as an example, I think the number is -- we hired 685 mostly drivers and technicians in the month of June. And it wasn't just churning people because we had 125 who left. So the net addition was pretty significant to replace some of these folks that have decided to sit on the sidelines because of the government programs that are out there. I would tell you those government programs are affecting not just us, they're affecting big and small businesses. And right now, at least in the United States, the federal benefits are scheduled to roll off on the sixth of September. It's not a stretch to say that there isn't a business out there that isn't looking forward to the sixth of September.  
To your first question about whether it is precluding growth or just creating some difficulties on it with existing customers, I think it's much more of the latter. I don't see it keeping us from growing and that's reflected mostly in our volume figures."

When we think about OCC pricing and how much room it has to go, we're 17% above historical averages at the end of the second quarter but we're still 40% below all-time highs. So we think there still is room to go.  
And as we and other companies are kind of moving forward, this ESG movement is really gaining traction. We think that commodities like plastics will continue to increase in price.

In the renewable energy business, I would say it's been a little more peaks and valleys with regard to our investment trend historically. But when we look forward, the pipeline for continued investment is very strong. We have one additional project that will complete in 2021, and we're already looking at somewhere around 5 or more for the years to come. We're still in the process of considering whether or not that's something that we do ourselves or that we look to do in partnership with others because this is a place where not only is there reason for us to consider preserving our capital for high-growth opportunities in the traditional collection and disposal business, but there's also tremendous interest in this type of investment in the space of sustainability and projects like this that are so unique in terms of opportunity can create incremental value.

But most importantly, I think you saw really strong pricing in industrial and commercial collection and then also the steps that we're taking to continue to drive price in the landfill line of business. 
Our outlook for second half because of the year-over-year comp is that we'll have yield in the range of 2.75% to 3% in the back half of the year, and that's just representative of a more normalized pricing range that we had in the second half of 2020 relative to the second quarter of last year when we took those proactive steps that were really focused on customer retention and taking care of our customers in a desperate time of need.

The place I would give a little bit of caution with respect to that being the right number is the recycling and renewable energy business is providing a lift from a flow-through perspective, and you're not having to make an incremental capital investment to get that dollar. We did have a low bonus payment in 2021 as a result of the poor performance in 2020, and that will have an opposite impact in the year ahead.

But I will tell you that the returns that we're seeing on our technology investments, the reduced interest run rate that we've established, given the recent debt transaction, having ADS fully integrated in the year ahead and just the general strong performance of the collection and disposal business, all of those things do provide upside. And so we're optimistic that we can maintain that 50%, but there is a little bit of caution that's prudent."

I appreciate the demand side of sustainability, lifting commodity values structurally and this is the hard part of modeling. There's also a supply issue going on and disruption. So at some level, even if the next low is a much higher low, this is a tough question because it's -- what are we at risk at? And then I'm comparing it to your last peak, which is 2017. And yet the business model is different because in 2017, it was commodity-based. Today, it's 60% fee-based. So how do we, as modelers, think about managing risk around that recycling revenue line?"

And then really, it's more smoothing out the low lows than smoothing out the high highs. We'd like to take advantage of these very high prices when they get there but not taking on the chin when we have the very low prices. 
And so some of that derisking is moving to a fee-based model. Some of it has -- and that has really proven to be successful for us. Some of it is the new technology that John and I mentioned, putting that into our network so that we operate those at a lower cost structure. I mentioned 35% difference between the kind of the next-gen plants versus current plants. And Devina mentioned an acceleration of CapEx there pulling that forward. So that's a way that I think we mitigate some of this. 
And then I do believe that it probably was -- while it didn't feel like that at the time, it was probably a good thing that we ultimately lost our biggest customer in recycling, which was China a couple of years ago because now it's all moved -- a lot of that's moved back state-side and is more predictable. And so I think the recycling business has changed a lot from when we had our last peak, which was, as you said, 2017. And it's changed for the better and I think it's changed permanently."

And I looked at July's numbers again this morning and that's still there. The encouraging part about Canada is it looks like it's going to reopen fully sometime in the next 2 to 3 weeks so that is encouraging for us. But it hasn't been great, and it has been kind of 3 to 6 months behind the United States. So July's numbers still look soft in Canada. That's really the biggest geographic difference for us. 
I think when you -- John mentioned that commercial has fully recovered when you really compare to 2019 -- 2020 comparisons, for obvious reasons, are not really meaningful. But when you start comparing to 2019, commercial has fully recovered. But it's only about 0.5% above 2019. We really haven't seen kind of the growth aspect of the economy hit that commercial line of business. 
And then maybe most encouraging of all for us individually and then also on a more macro basis for the overall economy are our C&D and special waste streams. And when we look sequentially at how they did, I mean, those 2 waste streams took the biggest hit of anything last year during COVID. And so they have seen the biggest sequential improvement, so they are on a great upward track. And I think those 2 by themselves, which tend to be kind of the most forward-looking indicators for us, are the best barometer overall of not only our business going forward but maybe even the North American economies, a good macro sign for the economy."

I'll just give you a little bit of my kind of overview on pricing. First of all, we were -- when we looked at our pricing numbers, again, another metric that's not overly meaningful year-over-year because, as you recall, last year, we really put the brakes on with respect to some of our pricing actions. But when you look sequentially at what we did in terms of collection price and in terms of landfill price, that's what gives us -- that's what makes us feel most encouraged about the potential going forward. 
And to Devina's point, that is an area of confidence for us. The team understands that pricing is critical to cost recovery but that it's also critical to margin expansion. So we're not just looking at this as a cost recovery mechanism. Part of the success for the quarter was that we did use pricing to recover some of those cost pressures that we've discussed. But it also helped us expand margins. And that really is the plan going into 2022, that we'll continue to use price to offset what we expect will be some continued inflation, not as aggressive of inflation figures we're seeing now because some of this, we believe, is temporary, as I mentioned earlier, caused by some of the current government's benefits. But there is some -- feels like some structural inflation in the system. Pricing will help us more than recover that and will be a good thing for us going forward. And John, maybe you can talk about resi pricing a bit."

I would expect that going forward for the next handful of months, we're going to continue at a similar pace.

So regarding M&A, Hamzah, outside of core, the -- and you mentioned specifically plastics, I think you're aware of the ownership position we have in the company called Continuous Materials, and that company does turn plastics and paper -- low-value plastics and mixed papers into a roofing material. And we have a 33-ish percent investment in them at this point. So that -- we're excited about the potential for that. And it helps us take some of that material that might otherwise find its way to a landfill, pull it out of the landfill because it doesn't do anything in terms of creating any gas or anything usable coming out of the landfill and doing something that's preferable in terms of kind of ESG but also preferable financially for us. 
So we will look for those types of investments. We're cautious about big acquisitions regardless but particularly cautious about big noncore acquisitions. I just don't want to step on a landmine here as we're walking down a pretty nice path and that could be a landmine if we were to do something like that. So we're not opposed to doing noncore acquisitions. We want to make sure that we have a lot of intelligence in those before we do anything.

So this is a new disclosure that we're making, and as the leading commentary on the table suggests, what we are attempting to do here is just provide clarity where there is a bit of inconsistency across the industry. And one of the things in particular that's really important in this business is conversation about operating EBITDA margin. And for WM in Q2 of 2021, on an apples-to-apples basis as best we can when we compare across the business, our operating EBITDA results were 31.2% for the quarter when you compare with this approach more similarly aligned with one of our competitors in particular. 
And all we're doing here, you can look at the operating expense table that's in the 10-Q and what you see there is the cost of goods sold line, and that includes rebates that we pay in the recycling line of business. That's the driver of that cost category. And what we're doing here is reflecting that if you were to net that against the associated revenues rather than grossing it up between revenue and operating expenses, the impact to our margin is 130 basis points in the quarter. 
The increase on a year-over-year basis reflects the strength of commodity prices, which we've talked about. And so naturally, with the continued strength and outlook for even better year-over-year comps in the second half of the year than we had in the first half of the year, you would expect that to expand further from the 130 basis points that we measured in the second quarter.

But the key question here is that is there structurally anything -- any changes that you've made during COVID-19 that would -- with your contract on the residential side, that would change what otherwise would be what we would expect with a slowdown in -- or a decline in residential volumes so that the impact would be less onerous or perhaps would be complemented here based on the mix as we see residential volumes come off on a year-over-year basis."

We are -- we have seen a little bit of moderation as folks have returned back to their place of work. But there is going to be a little bit of a lingering effect because I think the workforce is going to change a little bit. You're going to see some more folks work remotely or from home. But that doesn't look meaningful. We have seen a little bit, Jim commented on this earlier, we have seen a little bit of a shift in the residential recycling stream. Obviously, Amazon is doing well. We're seeing it show up in the percentage of cardboard that's coming out or fiber that's coming out of a lot of our residential contracts, which is honestly a good thing, especially in this environment. 
We're seeing some improvement, although not as significant by weight, if you will, in terms of the quality and quantity of some of the higher-margin streams. We talked specifically about plastics and the kind of mixed plastic we use to make versus the specific plastic products that we're producing for customers. So we view that all as positive. I think overall in general volume in terms of units, I don't think our message has changed. We're going to continue to make sure that we move residential from a margin perspective up to where it competes with every other line of business. And we're really making good progress there. 
And if you look at our price versus volume in the last handful of quarters, it has been slightly negative. But if you look at the core price and yield compared to that, that's certainly a trade-off we're willing to make. As I've said before, we don't want to -- we're not trying to push the volume out, but we're going to make sure that the investments we're making in that line of business align with our overall long-term strategy from a profit and return standpoint."

Just given the acceleration in corporate commitments to recycle and use recycled content, I think the U.S. Plastics Pact, which has 100 corporate signatories, they just unveiled their road map to 2025. And at the same time, it really seems like there's still a pretty big infrastructure gap around recycling these materials and getting them back to those producers. You just look at the difference between the co-mingled bales and the individual grades of plastics. 
So would just love to understand kind of your road map for how this is a growth opportunity for the company, both in terms of putting in more infrastructure in terms of helping to close the loop and getting some of these materials back to the manufacturers and then being able to potentially capture organic share gains with those types of manufacturers as a result."

We've always had the supply, but we haven't, until fairly recently, had as much demand as we would like. We've had demand but maybe not as much as we would like. And I think what we're seeing is that companies are now, with this real focus on virtually every company, ESG focus, are inclined to use recycled material, recycled -- improve the recycled content percentages. So that's been a benefit for us. 
There is still, to your point, there still is opportunity, I think, to expand infrastructure, particularly here in the U.S., but we are seeing it -- we're seeing encouraging signs there. And we have outlets through our brokerage group outside of the United States, which has been one of the real benefits there. When China went away literally overnight, our brokerage team was able to move commodities pretty quickly to other spots, other places around the world. And we still have those and we'll continue to move commodities there. 
But I do like the long-term trends not only for our recycling business but as someone who's very focused on the environment. I like the fact that we're moving to becoming more ESG-focused and that we're -- the companies that are using and producing materials are looking to use recycled content as opposed to just using virgin content."

And by the way, that's not just labor for labor's sake, those are positions that are certainly been and continue to be hard to fill so it's solving a few problems there. 
I think around the demand of the customer, we all mentioned that, that side of the equation is as strong now as it's ever been. And for all the comments made around ESG, we feel confident that, that's going to continue to grow. And I think plastics is one example. I mean, we've got the material stream either through our plants or through in other parts of the waste stream. And what you're seeing is some migration from what was in the waste stream obviously now to higher-value commodities. 
And Devina said this not today but on other calls, when you look at it from a return -- a return on invested capital standpoint, our recycle plants are at the top of the heap. So to the extent we keep investing more CapEx there, we're going to be very pleased with that.

I would tell you in terms of our strategy on fleet, we've said before, we've pivoted from the traditional diesel fleet that we had to CNG. I wouldn't say it was seamlessly but the way our fleet plan works is we have some flexibility to be able to move from diesel to CNG, and we view it as CNG to battery electric vehicles the same way. 
I would tell you what I think will happen is, and I talked about this at the conference Devina and I were at a few weeks ago at WasteExpo, I am confident that over time, they're going to solve the weight issue, the range issue, the parasitic load of a refuse vehicle, all those things, I think, will get solved.

It's something that's impacted us in the first half of the year. The total impact for the full year, we now expect to be in the ballpark of around $60 million, could be a little north of that from an EBITDA cost perspective. And so you are seeing some margin pressure from that. 
When we look at the collection and disposal business, in particular, when we disclosed in the press release that, that business was backwards 10 basis points relative to prior year, 50 basis points of that was actually incentive compensation. So when you adjust for that, that shows that the traditional solid waste business actually made really strong progress in margin expansion. 
Our cash flow impact on a year-over-year basis will show up in 2022. And so that's where I made the 2022 comment earlier because this year in 2021, when we paid last year's bonus, we had a little bit of a benefit to cash flow relative to what we would expect in the year ahead just because 2020's payout was around 70% for the total company, and we expect this year to be meaningfully higher than that."

And what I would say is the implied guide on margin is that we're basically flat to positive 50 basis points for the full year. And what that implies about the second half is that we will have a chance for a little bit of margin degradation from the year prior. The what behind that really comes down to the inflationary cost pressures that we've talked a great deal about, incentive compensation but also the conversation about the strength in hiring. We're going to have additional training hours in the back half of the year as we get those new drivers on board. 
All of those things put slight downward pressure on the margin outlook. But there are a lot of positives and we're focused on those positives and think that they could outperform what we're currently projecting, though too early to say. The first is definitely the strength of the traditional solid waste business. And we always have to lead with that. Certainly, recycling commodity price and RIN values provide additional benefit from a margin perspective. 
Then the ADS integration, the strength of that in the back half of the year and John's comments earlier about where we are year-to-date on synergies but where we expect to end the year. The ADS business, we estimate, could have provided as much as a 75 basis point headwind to our margins in the second quarter. And we expect that, that moderates in the back half of the year as we do things like moderate the level of incremental investment that's needed in the fleet to get it to WM standards, and we realize that synergy potential that we've outlined for everyone. 
So as much as there are some things that are working against us, we do think that there are some tailwinds. Just a little difficult for us to predict, particularly given the inflationary cost environment that we're all talking about."

Volumes, the volumes have been good. And to your point, 2020 comparisons were not meaningful. But look, volume hasn't totally returned. I talked about Canada being soft. And we think Canada obviously will come back when we get to 2022, so that would be a tailwind for us on the volume side. Landfill volumes have not fully returned. MSW is the one that may be the exception there, but I mentioned special waste and C&D that have not fully returned. Those appear, though, to be very strong right now, and the pipeline appears very good with special waste. 
So we'll obviously give you more color as we get to our guidance session, but we feel encouraged about what we're doing on OpEx, what we're seeing on volume and price, and we feel encouraged about the longer-term trends for recycling. All of that would bode well for the -- at the out years."

190694,1682812830,2412729,"Waste Management, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Our third quarter performance highlighted the exceptional cash generation capability of our business model as we generated nearly $1.2 billion of cash from operations. Our solid results put us on track to meet",925,"Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Our third quarter performance highlighted the exceptional cash generation capability of our business model as we generated nearly $1.2 billion of cash from operations. Our solid results put us on track to meet the higher full year financial outlook we provided last quarter, even as we faced some of the highest inflation that we've seen in years, along with the labor and supply chain constraints. 
Virtually no segment of the economy, including government and the private sector, has been unaffected by these historically acute inflationary and supply chain challenges. This burst of inflation accelerated through the third quarter, and during the quarter, we saw roughly $60 million of labor inflation and about $100 million of inflation in other operating cost categories. Overall, our underlying labor inflation for the third quarter was 8.7%. 
So that's the tough news. The good news is that the business continues to perform well as demonstrated by the fact that we still expect to finish the year within our previously adjusted operating EBIT raise, adjusted operating EBITDA and free cash flow guidance ranges. And we will be above our prior revenue range due to strong price execution and strengthening volumes. 
John, Devina and I will discuss what we're doing about these labor and inflationary pressures in the short term and the medium term. Not surprisingly, our disciplined price programs are the primary lever to combat cost inflation. Our pricing programs delivered core price of 4.6% and collection and disposal yield of 3.5% in the third quarter. Standout performance continues to be the residential line of business with a yield of 5%, while MSW yield improved to 3.5%. 
But keep in mind, the price escalations on about 40% of our revenue are tied to an index, often based on a look-back over the prior year, so there's a timing lag in adjusting index pricing when costs step up as quickly as they have. And it's important to understand that a portion of the remaining 60% of our business won't get the full 7% to 10% price increases we believe we need to cover rising costs until their next price increase cycle. A customer who has increased 4% in May won't get the full cost recovery price increase until next May. 
That said, we're seeing a favorable price environment across our open market businesses, evidenced by our lowest level of rollbacks in more than a decade. We're very focused on directly addressing the labor challenges. John will discuss the quarterly impact and how we're working to address this immediately. Strategically, we're looking at this acute challenge as an opportunity to expedite the automation of certain jobs. 
We said previously that we view the automation of certain high turnover positions as both a competitive advantage and a derisking mechanism in today's labor market where certain jobs simply don't attract the interest they previously did. The most recent examples of that are the customer setup role, which we just finished fully automating and the 35-plus percent reduction in labor we've seen where we've upgraded and rebuilt our single-stream recycling plants. Given the success of these rebuilds and the labor inflation challenges of late, we've accelerated the retooling of the remaining single-stream plants and expect to address 90% of single-stream volume by the 2023-2024 time frame. 
In the quarter, we saw some of the positive impacts of those new single-stream plants and our outstanding performance in our recycling business. Earnings contribution and margins for recycling were at their highest level ever, driven by strong demand for recycled material and great operating performance from the new state-of-the-art MRFs. We were equally pleased with results in our renewable energy business in the quarter, where robust growth continued, driven by more RINs sales and higher prices. 
With our long-standing expertise, continued growth in sustainability solutions and unrivaled asset network, WM is uniquely situated to support our current and prospective customers in their evolving sustainability needs. Our customers are increasingly seeking circular solutions for their materials, which is causing growing demand for recycled content. Of note, our focus on unlocking more plastic from the waste stream drove a 25% increase in plastics we recycle since 2019. 
Recycling and renewable energy are 2 of our key growth areas, highlighted in our Annual Sustainability Report published earlier this month. The report outlines the progress WM has made against our sustainability goals and details investments we've made to advance our sustainability journey. In particular, this year's report focuses on the people behind the progress WM has made in the past year and how they are doing their part to take care of our customers, neighbors and the environment and communities across North America. 
The bottom line for the quarter is this: we generated higher-than-expected volume and revenue growth in the third quarter, which positions us well for 2022. At the same time, we faced an unexpectedly acute and fast-moving challenge from the inflation, supply chain and labor shortage headwinds, and we managed our way through it well and still expect to achieve results within our 2021 guidance ranges. And this challenge presents an opportunity for us to move more decisively in those strategic areas of automation, sustainability and workforce planning to further separate ourselves in this industry. 
In conclusion, I'd like to thank the nearly 50,000 people behind WM's success. They continue to deliver, driving another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, operating EBITDA and free cash flow. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter."
190694,1682812830,2412729,"Waste Management, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning.

Our team continues to execute very well despite a challenging operating environment, producing more than 7% organic revenue growth in collection and disposal business in the third quarter. This growth, combined with continued integration of Advanced Disposal, drove operating EBITDA more than 14% higher. As Jim mentioned, we are seeing pressure on labor and other cost categories, and we are addressing these impacts through our pricing programs, controllable cost management, efficiency improvements and workforce planning. 
Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 180 basis points to 62.2% in the third quarter as we experienced pressure from inflationary costs, supply chain constraints and stronger-than-expected volume growth. In particular, costs related to the hiring and training of new employees impacted labor costs in the third quarter. We also saw overtime hours increase as the team adjusted to meet the higher-than-expected collection volumes. We anticipated a good portion of this labor pressure that is showing up in our costs as we made proactive market wage adjustments earlier in the year to get in front of labor shortages and meet growing demand. At the same time, we are working to automate a number of roles where we see longer-term challenges to attract and retain employees. 
In the residential line of business, we continue to work through the last 40% of our routes, including those from ADS that are not fully automated while continuing to be very selective in the business we are willing to take on, as evidenced by our yield and volume results in the third quarter and the last few years. While we're now incurring the costs associated with these investments, we're only in the early stages of seeing the benefits. 
The labor market supply chain constraints have accelerated in Q3, coupled with robust volume growth in the third quarter, have also added pressure in our fleet operations. Repair and maintenance costs are increasing as we hire additional technicians and incur some overtime hours to address the strong volume growth we continue to see in the collection lines of business. Similarly, we've had to temporarily place some of our higher-cost trucks back in service to address the volume demands. In addition, our third-party subcontractors at our transfer stations are facing similar pressures and are passing those increased costs on to us. 
Overall, efficiency in the collection business in the third quarter adjusting -- improved in the collection business in the third quarter, adjusting for increased training hours. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we are committed to recovering our cost increases through pricing and again, taking the most expensive truck off the road and reducing the most expensive hour of the day. 
Now I want to focus on several of the positives in the quarter. Turning to our strong revenue results, third quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 3.8%, which outpaced our expectations. We continue to see strong volume driven by economic reopening with commercial volume up 4.6% and special waste volume up by 16.6%, and we see runway for continued solid performance in the fourth quarter. 
Customer metrics were also strong in the quarter. Service increases outpaced service decreases by more than twofold for the second consecutive quarter and churn was 8.7%. Year-to-date, net new business for small and medium business customers is up more than 10%. And finally, our integration of Advanced Disposal continues to go smoothly. We've combined around 70% of the acquired operations into our billing and operational systems, and we remain on track to migrate virtually all the ADS customers by the end of the year. 
We've achieved nearly $26 million in annual run rate synergies during the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $60 million. Combined with the $15 million of annual run rate synergies realized in the fourth quarter of 2020, we're on track to reach $100 million by the end of the year. And we continue to forecast another $50 million to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of cost and capital savings. Our teams are working tirelessly to provide safe and reliable service to our customers and communities, and I want to thank them all for their efforts. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail."

As we have seen all year, robust volume growth, strong recycling commodity prices and increased collection and disposal core price continued to deliver top line growth ahead of expectations in the third quarter. A",617,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As we have seen all year, robust volume growth, strong recycling commodity prices and increased collection and disposal core price continued to deliver top line growth ahead of expectations in the third quarter. As a result, we are once again updating our revenue outlook for the year. 
Total company revenue growth is now expected to be between 17% and 17.5% with yield and volume in our collection and disposal business of about 6.5%. This guidance also includes an expectation for continued strength in recycled commodity prices and RIN values. We're confirming our most recent 2021 adjusted operating EBITDA guidance of between $5 billion and $5.1 billion, which is an increase from the prior year of about 17% at the midpoint and almost 5% higher than our initial outlook for the year. 
Third quarter SG&A was 9.7% of revenue, a 40 basis point improvement over 2020. Included in our results is about $16 million as increased digital investments as we advanced technology that will benefit customer engagement and lower our cost to serve over the long term. We remain focused on managing our controllable spending, making sure that we allocate each dollar to initiatives that will enhance our business. 
Third quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $1.18 billion, an increase of 15%. Cash from operations growth continues to be driven by our robust increase in operating EBITDA, including the contributions from the ADS acquisition and lower interest costs. While there was a modest unfavorable working capital comparison in the third quarter due in large part to the timing of cash from CNG credit and our deferral of payroll taxes in 2020, overall, improvements in working capital demonstrate the benefit of tools we are putting in place to enhance our systems and processes. 
In the third quarter, capital spending was $464 million, bringing capital expenditures in the first 9 months of the year to $1.13 billion. Our 2021 pace of capital spending has continued to be slower than we planned due to supply chain constraints and construction project work taking longer than planned. As we discussed last quarter, we are proactively pulling forward capital investment, particularly in recycling, where we know the returns will be strong. Investments in recycling technology and equipment at our MRFs are expected to be about $200 million for the year. 
While we continue to target full year capital spending at the low end of our $1.78 billion to $1.88 billion guidance range, we could see 2021 coming in below targeted levels, with some of our spending pushed into 2022, primarily due to supply chain constraints. 
We generated $773 million of free cash flow in the third quarter. And through September, our business generated free cash flow of $2.29 billion, seeing us well on our way to our full year targeted free cash flow of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. We've returned more than $1.7 billion to our shareholders through the first 9 months, paying $730 million in dividends and repurchasing $1 billion of our stock. We continue to expect to repurchase up to our full authorization of $1.35 billion in 2021. 
Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.71x as the strength of our business performance and the successful integration of the acquired ADS business drove the achievement of our targeted leverage ratio ahead of plan. As we enter the final stretch of 2021, our teams are focused on accelerating our disciplined pricing programs, managing our controllable costs, positioning WM as an employer of choice and capturing growing volumes. We know our strategy sets us up for a solid finish to 2021. 
With that, Erica, we'd be happy to address the team's questions."

Any business show you watch on TV, it talks about it. And a little bit of it was -- it was quicker than we thought. It was more acute than we thought. And the price that is our biggest lever, as I said in my remarks, to offset that is not perfectly timed with that so there is a  lag there. 
We've talked a lot about the fact that 40% of our business is tied to an index. And I mentioned that there's, in many cases, a look-back on that. About -- Tyler, about 40% of our business in that 40%, about 40% of that comes in January, so the price adjustment comes in January. About 30% comes in July, so 70% of the price increases on that index business come in the first half of 2022. And then the remaining 30%, some of it comes in October, and then there's a smattering that comes in the remainder of the year. 
So -- and then on the open market piece, I gave the example of the customer that got the 4% price increase back in May. And look, we still have a customer to keep in mind here. We don't want to go back to that customer and say, ""Hey, inflation hit us harder than we thought so we're going to go ahead and increase you by another [ 6 ] here in October."" We're going to be smart about it and wait until we get to their annual cycle in May of next year, and then we'll increase them by the amount that we need to cover costs and improve margins."

So we would say that about 60% of the impact was from inflation and about 40% was from recycling brokerage. To put a little more color around the inflationary impacts that Jim mentioned earlier, that total was $160 million during the quarter. We estimate that our normal inflationary impacts would have been about $60 million of that, so that was $100 million in excess of what we consider normal inflationary impacts. 
And then you might recall that we had projected that we were going to have about $60 million over and above our normal run rate in the back half of the year. So we think that our costs in Q3 were about $60 million to $70 million above what we would have projected. And that, you can see, is a pretty meaningful impact to the overall margin of the business. 
I think it's important to look at our cost structure and see that 35% of our operating costs are labor-driven. And then when you consider subcontractor cost, which is effectively indirect labor, that's another 15%. So 50% of our cost structure is labor-driven and we have seen that as a big driver."

I think the good news is over the last 4 or 5 months, we've actually started to make good progress in terms of our retention rates and whatnot. And I think the labor resets we talked to last quarter, which are clearly showing up in this quarter as well are having an impact there. 
The other 3/4 of it, if you will, rough numbers is related to some of the OT we're incurring. Part of that, as I mentioned, is we don't view that over the long term is a bad thing because we're seeing volume increases that are outpacing our expectations.

Maybe at a high level, what inning are you in, in terms of automation? What is there left to do? And is it just on recycling?

I think Hamzah, we're probably in the second inning. I like to use the baseball analogy since we're in Houston today. But I think we're probably in the second inning here. There's a lot that falls under that automation umbrella. It's not just -- we'v",502,"Yes. I think Hamzah, we're probably in the second inning. I like to use the baseball analogy since we're in Houston today. But I think we're probably in the second inning here. There's a lot that falls under that automation umbrella. It's not just -- we've talked a lot about customer service digitalization, which is really is kind of the digital side of that. But the automation that I refer to is, while it's technology, it's not technology as we think about it. It's not your mobile device, it's optical sorters at our plants. 
And we really have -- we have 45, I think, single-stream plants, and we've fully automated 4 of those plants at this point. So if you think about the fact that we're taking 35-ish percent of labor out, and to put that into dollars for you, it's about $1 million per plant per month in labor savings. And think about the fact that we still have, 40 of those plants, 40-ish of those plants left. Now some of those plants, we're obviously automating the big ones first, so you won't get $1 million from the very smallest plant. 
But that's a piece of the automation. But to your question, it's not just those recycled positions. I mean, we have a lot of positions that have very high turnover that feel like they lend themselves to automation and we'll be looking at those going forward. So what's the total number that would be impacted by that? I don't know. But I think it's certainly more than just customer setup, which we fully automated and recycling. 
And then Hamzah, I want to make 1 last point to your question to John on OpEx, which we haven't talked about. But if you think about the COVID effect, we had almost 900 employees out at the peak, and the peak week, I think, was the third of September. And we paid those employees. We made a conscious decision to pay them. So if you think about the impact of that 900 -- by the way, a lot of those -- over half of those were drivers. So we are paying them. And at the same time, we are picking up their routes with overtime hours. The cost of that was somewhere between $2 million and $3 million over a 2-week period. So it's not insignificant. 
And that number of both -- that 900, by the way, is quarantined employees and COVID employees, employees who have the virus. That number has come back down as we've seen it across the U.S. to a much more manageable number. It's in the -- I looked at it yesterday, it's in kind of the 200 range now down from the peak. So that is a -- that was a short-term cost that we were bearing that was -- is certainly coming back. And we won't see that repeat unless we have another variant that kicks up and causes us to be back in the same position."

Looking at margin enhancement, and you've had a great track record in historic years of achieving margin improvement year-to-year, but now as you reprice and a lot of your repricing is to pass through costs, you are able to protect EBITDA dollars but it can be somewhat margin dilutive, given the past nature.

I would say that what's really important is to go back to one of Jim's earlier comments about the fact that the acute nature of the cost increase that we experienced during the third quarter and the fact that our index revenue is more significantly weighted toward the first half of the year indicates that we had a mismatch in terms of when a lot of those price increases are pushed through and when we experienced the more acute cost increases. We are not in any way indicating that this is anything other than that lag and kind of a onetime or short term, I should say, impact in terms of margin degradation. 
Our outlook remains strong in terms of the business' ability to work both through pricing and operating efficiencies and automation that we've discussed in order to improve the long-term margin of the business. I think that 2022 can have some noise in it with regard to some of these timing differences continuing, particularly as you think about the year-on-year impact of the volume expansion that we've seen in 2021. But our outlook remains solid with respect to expectations over the long term being one of margin expansion even with a higher cost structure."

I'm not sure there's anybody working at our company today, maybe a couple of people in their 70s that have seen this type of rapid inflation. The example I gave of the customer that got the 4% price increase in May was a real example. So we weren't even seeing this in May. This came on as quickly as almost the end of July but -- and really has accelerated. 
You weren't hearing people talking about it. I mean, it's being talked about all the way up at the White House, being talked about by the Fed here. So I would tell you that this is more acute than we've seen before. But the other thing -- and you're right, Michael, we did cover it with price, and we think price is the primary lever to cover this and we're doing a good job with it. 
But that's why I wanted to make sure we stressed that there are some high turnover jobs that really don't have to do with this inflationary period. There's some high turnover jobs that we need to really seriously look at automating and, at the same time, using customer service digitalization to really extract maximum efficiency out of our organization. John and I have talked a lot about it, and we think when we fully automate these routes, there's somewhere between 10% and 15% efficiency improvement because you're not going to automate a truck driver job, certainly in my career, maybe even in my lifetime. But we do think we've got a significant opportunity there on the driver side for efficiency growth."

But as I mentioned, all year, we've seen things move just a little more slowly than we would have liked, and we have taken some proactive steps in order to pull some capital forward. That being said, right now, we think we could finish the year somewhere in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. We'd love for it to be a higher number than that, particularly as we've made investments in renewable energy and recycling specifically. 
In terms of the other puts and takes, I think it's important to recall that we expected an increase in our cash taxes on a year-over-year basis. We've seen that through the 9 months but you'll have another leg of that in Q4. And then we've seen significant working capital contributions in the first 9 months of the year. We think we'll get some of that back in Q4 just based on some of the timing impacts of some payments that we have. 
But all in all, really good performance in cash flow for the year. I would say it is the 1 that has certainly exceeded expectations in every single aspect of contribution. All in all, total free cash flow at about the midpoint of $2.55 billion is tremendous growth on a year-over-year basis and meaningfully ahead of the [ 19 65 ] that we normalized when you look at 2020 for the impact of the proceeds from divestitures from the ADS transaction.

Once we catch up with that and once we catch up with these adjustments on the 40% that's index-based, then unless inflation runs up from here, which we don't anticipate, I'm not sure I've seen anybody that anticipates that, then we feel like we're in a really good position with pricing to cover these cost increases plus add the margin. 
Now if inflation goes to 15%, then I will retract that statement. But I don't think anybody expects that. So right now, I mean, if you look at core price, for example, I mean, we're pretty happy with the core price numbers that we were showing. Core price was 6.1% for the quarter in commercial. That's a big core price number. If you look at the landfill line of business, which has gotten a lot of questions over the last couple of years, core price in landfill was 4.6%. That's 2 consecutive quarters over 4% of core price. 
And really, that's probably the best metric for looking at price increases is core price versus yield. Yield was very good as well, but core price probably is the best approximator of price increases. So I feel really comfortable with the existing kind of CPI and core inflation in the system that the pricing mechanisms that we have in place will cover that and also provide us some opportunity to improve margins as we go into 2022. Keep in mind that, that kind of 12-month look-back, a big piece of the adjustment that's coming in January won't include all of the inflation. That's going to take a year to capture that."

Just wondering, as you look at the road map that EPA has put out there, is there anything that you would comment on? Does it align with what you thought the EPA would do or think the EPA should do as they, I guess, evaluate the PFAS strategy?"

To your second question, is it profound enough for us to have to concede anything on the pricing front? No, we don't think so. And I think if you look at where a lot of the -- probably the most acute labor issue is for us is really around, if you look at our residential and you look at our pricing, what our pricing strategy has been and what our core price and yield results were for the quarter and over the last number of quarters, it has not impacted us there or frankly, in any other line of business."

So I think the way that we think about that, John mentioned having to take some of the older vehicles off of the sidelines, so to speak, and pull those into service. We saw that most significantly in the industrial line of business and roll off because that's where we were able to flex most significantly in 2020. 
While we do see it on the operating expense side, our long-term focus continues to be on optimizing our fleet strategy so that we focus on reducing the total cost of ownership of each vehicle. We've seen some pressure in terms of per unit costs on the fleet overall. Some of that's general inflationary cost pressures, but some of that is that we're driving toward automation to the points that I've made earlier, particularly in the residential line of business. So while we have a more expensive unit on the street, we definitely see the benefits of that in terms of lower operating expense, both from labor and efficiency. 
So overall, in the current quarter, that's a component of the cost pressure that we saw. But I would say that, that was certainly secondary to the wage pressures that we experienced overall, and we expect that to abate as we get truck deliveries. It's an interesting point that through 9 months, we'd only gotten 70% of the trucks that we expected to get in 2021 to date. So we think that when we get those trucks delivered, you'll start to see some of those impacts reduce as well."

But that's not the bulk of it. I think Devina spoke to the majority of it, which is really the fleet spend, some of the delays there, coupled against strong volume.

The progress that we've made on working capital management has been really strong. That's 1 where I would tell you it's too early for us to declare victory. We're implementing new systems and processes and those are showing some value, but it's certainly difficult to use that as lift above that 50% target. 
In terms of managing CapEx, that really is the 1 that we're focused on because for us, a capital dollar really should be looked at no differently than an M&A dollar. And if we can get a better return on invested capital from accelerating capital in our recycling business or renewable energy facilities, we're going to do that. And so while we're going to look for opportunities to accelerate capital, we're going to do so in the same prudent way that we always do from a capital allocation perspective and look at long-term maintenance capital versus what we will consider more of a growth-oriented or investment-oriented capital decision. So that's the 1 place that there could be an evolution in our discussion in 2022, but no specific outlook that we can provide at this point. We'll give you more color next quarter."

190694,1682812830,2412902,"Waste Management, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Our third quarter performance highlighted the exceptional cash generation capability of our business model as we generated nearly $1.2 billion of cash from operations. Our solid results put us on track to meet",925,"Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Our third quarter performance highlighted the exceptional cash generation capability of our business model as we generated nearly $1.2 billion of cash from operations. Our solid results put us on track to meet the higher full year financial outlook we provided last quarter, even as we faced some of the highest inflation that we've seen in years, along with the labor and supply chain constraints.  
Virtually no segment of the economy, including government and the private sector, has been unaffected by these historically acute inflationary and supply chain challenges. This burst of inflation accelerated through the third quarter, and during the quarter, we saw roughly $60 million of labor inflation and about $100 million of inflation in other operating cost categories. Overall, our underlying labor inflation for the third quarter was 8.7%.  
So that's the tough news. The good news is that the business continues to perform well as demonstrated by the fact that we still expect to finish the year within our previously adjusted operating EBIT raise, adjusted operating EBITDA and free cash flow guidance ranges. And we will be above our prior revenue range due to strong price execution and strengthening volumes.  
John, Devina and I will discuss what we're doing about these labor and inflationary pressures in the short term and the medium term. Not surprisingly, our disciplined price programs are the primary lever to combat cost inflation. Our pricing programs delivered core price of 4.6% and collection and disposal yield of 3.5% in the third quarter. Standout performance continues to be the residential line of business with a yield of 5%, while MSW yield improved to 3.5%.  
But keep in mind, the price escalations on about 40% of our revenue are tied to an index, often based on a look-back over the prior year, so there's a timing lag in adjusting index pricing when costs step up as quickly as they have. And it's important to understand that a portion of the remaining 60% of our business won't get the full 7% to 10% price increases we believe we need to cover rising costs until their next price increase cycle. A customer who has increased 4% in May won't get the full cost recovery price increase until next May.  
That said, we're seeing a favorable price environment across our open market businesses, evidenced by our lowest level of rollbacks in more than a decade. We're very focused on directly addressing the labor challenges. John will discuss the quarterly impact and how we're working to address this immediately. Strategically, we're looking at this acute challenge as an opportunity to expedite the automation of certain jobs.  
We said previously that we view the automation of certain high turnover positions as both a competitive advantage and a derisking mechanism in today's labor market where certain jobs simply don't attract the interest they previously did. The most recent examples of that are the customer setup role, which we just finished fully automating and the 35-plus percent reduction in labor we've seen where we've upgraded and rebuilt our single-stream recycling plants. Given the success of these rebuilds and the labor inflation challenges of late, we've accelerated the retooling of the remaining single-stream plants and expect to address 90% of single-stream volume by the 2023-2024 time frame.  
In the quarter, we saw some of the positive impacts of those new single-stream plants in our outstanding performance in our recycling business. Earnings contribution and margins for recycling were at their highest level ever, driven by strong demand for recycled material and great operating performance from the new state-of-the-art MRFs. We were equally pleased with results in our renewable energy business in the quarter, where robust growth continued, driven by more RINs sales and higher prices.  
With our long-standing expertise, continued growth in sustainability solutions and unrivaled asset network, WM is uniquely situated to support our current and prospective customers in their evolving sustainability needs. Our customers are increasingly seeking circular solutions for their materials, which is causing growing demand for recycled content. Of note, our focus on unlocking more plastic from the waste stream drove a 25% increase in plastics we recycle since 2019.  
Recycling and renewable energy are 2 of our key growth areas, highlighted in our Annual Sustainability Report published earlier this month. The report outlines the progress WM has made against our sustainability goals and details investments we've made to advance our sustainability journey. In particular, this year's report focuses on the people behind the progress WM has made in the past year and how they are doing their part to take care of our customers, neighbors and the environment and communities across North America.  
The bottom line for the quarter is this: we generated higher-than-expected volume and revenue growth in the third quarter, which positions us well for 2022. At the same time, we faced an unexpectedly acute and fast-moving challenge from the inflation, supply chain and labor shortage headwinds, and we managed our way through it well and still expect to achieve results within our 2021 guidance ranges. And this challenge presents an opportunity for us to move more decisively in those strategic areas of automation, sustainability and workforce planning to further separate ourselves in this industry.  
In conclusion, I'd like to thank the nearly 50,000 people behind WM's success. They continue to deliver, driving another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, operating EBITDA and free cash flow. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter."

Our team continues to execute very well despite a challenging operating environment, producing more than 7% organic revenue growth in collection and disposal business in the third quarter.

Our team continues to execute very well despite a challenging operating environment, producing more than 7% organic revenue growth in collection and disposal business in the third quarter. This growth, combined with continued integration of Advanced Disposal, drove operating EBITDA more than 14% higher. As Jim mentioned, we are seeing pressure on labor and other cost categories, and we are addressing these impacts through our pricing programs, controllable cost management, efficiency improvements and workforce planning.  
Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 180 basis points to 62.2% in the third quarter as we experienced pressure from inflationary costs, supply chain constraints and stronger-than-expected volume growth. In particular, costs related to the hiring and training of new employees impacted labor costs in the third quarter. We also saw overtime hours increase as the team adjusted to meet the higher-than-expected collection volumes. We anticipated a good portion of this labor pressure that is showing up in our costs as we made proactive market wage adjustments earlier in the year to get in front of labor shortages and meet growing demand.  
At the same time, we are working to automate a number of roles where we see longer-term challenges to attract and retain employees.  
In the residential line of business, we continue to work through the last 40% of our routes, including those from ADS that are not fully automated while continuing to be very selective in the business we are willing to take on, as evidenced by our yield and volume results in the third quarter and the last few years. While we're now incurring the costs associated with these investments, we're only in the early stages of seeing the benefits.  
The labor market supply chain constraints have accelerated in Q3, coupled with robust volume growth in the third quarter, have also added pressure in our fleet operations. Repair and maintenance costs are increasing as we hire additional technicians and incur some overtime hours to address the strong volume growth we continue to see in the collection lines of business. Similarly, we've had to temporarily place some of our higher-cost trucks back in service to address the volume demands. In addition, our third-party subcontractors at our transfer stations are facing similar pressures and are passing those increased costs on to us.  
Overall, efficiency in the collection business in the third quarter adjusting -- improved in the collection business in the third quarter, adjusting for increased training hours. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we are committed to recovering our cost increases through pricing and again, taking the most expensive truck off the road and reducing the most expensive hour of the day.  
Now I want to focus on several of the positives in the quarter. Turning to our strong revenue results, third quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 3.8%, which outpaced our expectations. We continue to see strong volume driven by economic reopening with commercial volume up 4.6% and special waste volume up by 16.6%, and we see runway for continued solid performance in the fourth quarter.  
Customer metrics were also strong in the quarter. Service increases outpaced service decreases by more than twofold for the second consecutive quarter and churn was 8.7%. Year-to-date, net new business for small and medium business customers is up more than 10%. And finally, our integration of Advanced Disposal continues to go smoothly. We've combined around 70% of the acquired operations into our billing and operational systems, and we remain on track to migrate virtually all the ADS customers by the end of the year.  
We've achieved nearly $26 million in annual run rate synergies during the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $60 million. Combined with the $15 million of annual run rate synergies realized in the fourth quarter of 2020, we're on track to reach $100 million by the end of the year. And we continue to forecast another $50 million to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of cost and capital savings. Our teams are working tirelessly to provide safe and reliable service to our customers and communities, and I want to thank them all for their efforts. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail."

As we have seen all year, robust volume growth, strong recycling commodity prices and increased collection and disposal core price continued to deliver top line growth ahead of expectations in the third quarter.",617,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As we have seen all year, robust volume growth, strong recycling commodity prices and increased collection and disposal core price continued to deliver top line growth ahead of expectations in the third quarter.   As a result, we are once again updating our revenue outlook for the year.  
Total company revenue growth is now expected to be between 17% and 17.5%, with yield and volume in our collection and disposal business of about 6.5%. This guidance also includes an expectation for continued strength in recycled commodity prices and RIN values. We're confirming our most recent 2021 adjusted operating EBITDA guidance of between $5 billion and $5.1 billion, which is an increase from the prior year of about 17% at the midpoint and almost 5% higher than our initial outlook for the year.  
Third quarter SG&A was 9.7% of revenue, a 40 basis point improvement over 2020. Included in our results is about $16 million of increased digital investments as we advanced technology that will benefit customer engagement and lower our cost to serve over the long term. We remain focused on managing our controllable spending, making sure that we allocate each dollar to initiatives that will enhance our business.  
Third quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $1.18 billion, an increase of 15%. Cash from operations growth continues to be driven by our robust increase in operating EBITDA, including the contributions from the ADS acquisition and lower interest costs. While there was a modest unfavorable working capital comparison in the third quarter due in large part to the timing of cash from CNG credit and our deferral of payroll taxes in 2020, overall, improvements in working capital demonstrate the benefit of tools we are putting in place to enhance our systems and processes.  
In the third quarter, capital spending was $464 million, bringing capital expenditures in the first 9 months of the year to $1.13 billion. Our 2021 pace of capital spending has continued to be slower than we planned due to supply chain constraints and construction project work taking longer than planned. As we discussed last quarter, we are proactively pulling forward capital investment, particularly in recycling, where we know the returns will be strong. Investments in recycling technology and equipment at our MRFs are expected to be about $200 million for the year.  
While we continue to target full year capital spending at the low end of our $1.78 billion to $1.88 billion guidance range, we could see 2021 coming in below targeted levels, with some of our spending pushed into 2022, primarily due to supply chain constraints.  
We generated $773 million of free cash flow in the third quarter. And through September, our business generated free cash flow of $2.29 billion, seeing us well on our way to our full year targeted free cash flow of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. We've returned more than $1.7 billion to our shareholders through the first 9 months, paying $730 million in dividends and repurchasing $1 billion of our stock. We continue to expect to repurchase up to our full authorization of $1.35 billion in 2021.  
Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.71x as the strength of our business performance and the successful integration of the acquired ADS business drove the achievement of our targeted leverage ratio ahead of plan. As we enter the final stretch of 2021, our teams are focused on accelerating our disciplined pricing programs, managing our controllable costs, positioning WM as an employer of choice and capturing growing volumes. We know our strategy sets us up for a solid finish to 2021.  
With that, Erica, we'd be happy to address the team's questions."

And a little bit of it was -- it was quicker than we thought. It was more acute than we thought. And the price that is our biggest lever, as I said in my remarks, to offset that is not perfectly timed with that so there is a lag there.  
We've talked a lot about the fact that 40% of our business is tied to an index. And I mentioned that there's, in many cases, a look-back on that. About -- Tyler, about 40% of our business in that 40%, about 40% of that comes in January, so the price adjustment comes in January. About 30% comes in July, so 70% of the price increases on that index business come in the first half of 2022. And then the remaining 30%, some of it comes in October, and then there's a smattering that comes in the remainder of the year.  
So -- and then on the open market piece, I gave the example of the customer that got the 4% price increase back in May. And look, we still have a customer to keep in mind here. We don't want to go back to that customer and say, ""Hey, inflation hit us harder than we thought so we're going to go ahead and increase you by another 6% here in October."" We're going to be smart about it and wait until we get to their annual cycle in May of next year, and then we'll increase them by the amount that we need to cover costs and improve margins."

So we would say that about 60% of the impact was from inflation and about 40% was from recycling brokerage. To put a little more color around the inflationary impacts that Jim mentioned earlier, that total was $160 million during the quarter. We estimate that our normal inflationary impacts would have been about $60 million of that, so that was $100 million in excess of what we consider normal inflationary impacts.  
And then you might recall that we had projected that we were going to have about $60 million over and above our normal run rate in the back half of the year. So we think that our costs in Q3 were about $60 million to $70 million above what we would have projected. And that, you can see, is a pretty meaningful impact to the overall margin of the business.  
I think it's important to look at our cost structure and see that 35% of our operating costs are labor-driven. And then when you consider subcontractor cost, which is effectively indirect labor, that's another 15%. So 50% of our cost structure is labor-driven and we have seen that as a big driver."

Hamzah, I would tell you that when I look at the labor increase whole dollars, and this is in aggregate, about 1/4 of it is related to some additional training and hiring we're doing. Some of that has to do with turnover pressures that I think we're seeing and just about everybody in the transportation industry is seeing. I think the good news is over the last 4 or 5 months, we've actually started to make good progress in terms of our retention rates and whatnot. And I think the labor resets we talked to last quarter, which are clearly showing up in this quarter as well are having an impact there. 
The other 3/4 of it, if you will, rough numbers is related to some of the OT we're incurring. Part of that, as I mentioned, is we don't view that over the long term as a bad thing because we're seeing volume increases that are outpacing our expectations. And I think as Jim mentioned previously to Tyler's question, we have a clear line of sight on what we need to do through pricing and efficiency gains, et cetera, and automation to be able to overcome that. 
I do think 70% of the index business resetting in the first half of the year is clearly something we're focused on. And as Jim mentioned, our pricing strategy more broadly is not going to change. Our expectations will have to change to keep pace with the cost increases we've outlined."

I like to use the baseball analogy since we're in Houston today. But I think we're probably in the second inning here. There's a lot that falls under that automation umbrella. It's not just -- we've talked a lot about customer service digitalization, which is really is kind of the digital side of that. But the automation that I refer to is, while it's technology, it's not technology as we think about it. It's not your mobile device, it's optical sorters at our plants. 
And we really have -- we have 45, I think, single-stream plants, and we've fully automated 4 of those plants at this point. So if you think about the fact that we're taking 35-ish percent of labor out, and to put that into dollars for you, it's about $1 million per plant per month in labor savings. And think about the fact that we still have 40 of those plants, 40-ish of those plants left. Now some of those plants, we're obviously automating the big ones first, so you won't get $1 million from the very smallest plant. 
But that's a piece of the automation. But to your question, it's not just those recycled positions. I mean, we have a lot of positions that have very high turnover that feel like they lend themselves to automation and we'll be looking at those going forward. So what's the total number that would be impacted by that? I don't know. But I think it's certainly more than just customer setup, which we fully automated and recycling. 
And then Hamzah, I want to make one last point to your question to John on OpEx, which we haven't talked about. But if you think about the COVID effect, we had almost 900 employees out at the peak, and the peak week, I think, was the third of September. And we paid those employees. We made a conscious decision to pay them. So if you think about the impact of that 900 -- by the way, a lot of those -- over half of those were drivers. So we are paying them. And at the same time, we are picking up their routes with overtime hours. The cost of that was somewhere between $2 million and $3 million over a 2-week period. So it's not insignificant. 
And that number of both -- that 900, by the way, is quarantined employees and COVID employees, employees who have the virus. That number has come back down as we've seen it across the U.S. to a much more manageable number. It's in the -- I looked at it yesterday, it's in kind of the 200 range now down from the peak. So that is a -- that was a short-term cost that we were bearing that was -- is certainly coming back. And we won't see that repeat unless we have another variant that kicks up and causes us to be back in the same position."

I would say that what's really important is to go back to one of Jim's earlier comments about the fact that the acute nature of the cost increase that we experienced during the third quarter and the fact that our index revenue is more significantly weighted toward the first half of the year indicates that we had a mismatch in terms of when a lot of those price increases are pushed through and when we experienced the more acute cost increases. We are not in any way indicating that this is anything other than that lag and kind of a onetime or short term, I should say, impact in terms of margin degradation. 
Our outlook remains strong in terms of the business' ability to work both through pricing and operating efficiencies and automation that we've discussed in order to improve the long-term margin of the business. I think that 2022 can have some noise in it with regard to some of these timing differences continuing, particularly as you think about the year-on-year impact of the volume expansion that we've seen in 2021.

So I would tell you that this is more acute than we've seen before. But the other thing -- and you're right, Michael, we did cover it with price, and we think price is the primary lever to cover this and we're doing a good job with it. 
But that's why I wanted to make sure we stressed that there are some high turnover jobs that really don't have to do with this inflationary period. There's some high turnover jobs that we need to really seriously look at automating and, at the same time, using customer service digitalization to really extract maximum efficiency out of our organization. John and I have talked a lot about it, and we think when we fully automate these routes, there's somewhere between 10% and 15% efficiency improvement because you're not going to automate a truck driver job, certainly in my career, maybe even in my lifetime.

But as I mentioned, all year, we've seen things move just a little more slowly than we would have liked, and we have taken some proactive steps in order to pull some capital forward. That being said, right now, we think we could finish the year somewhere in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. We'd love for it to be a higher number than that, particularly as we've made investments in renewable energy and recycling specifically. 
In terms of the other puts and takes, I think it's important to recall that we expected an increase in our cash taxes on a year-over-year basis. We've seen that through the 9 months but you'll have another leg of that in Q4. And then we've seen significant working capital contributions in the first 9 months of the year. We think we'll get some of that back in Q4 just based on some of the timing impacts of some payments that we have. 
But all in all, really good performance in cash flow for the year. I would say it is the one that has certainly exceeded expectations in every single aspect of contribution. All in all, total free cash flow at about the midpoint of $2.55 billion is tremendous growth on a year-over-year basis and meaningfully ahead of the [ $19.65 ] that we normalized when you look at 2020 for the impact of the proceeds from divestitures from the ADS transaction.

So we really are focused on taking care of our teammates here. And we think that pays dividends for us in terms of reducing the amount of churn. 
To John's point, I think the number I heard last week was there are 82,000 open trucking positions across the United States. And then, of course, at the same time, we're seeing this volume increase. And so we're trying to compensate for that as well. It's a good thing. It's a good problem to have. But yes, to John's point, I mean, we're getting past that peak. But we think we're well positioned. We like our position in terms of filling these roles. It's part of why we're -- we have really good pay benefits, and we hope to make sure that we differentiate ourselves there."

Once we catch up with that and once we catch up with these adjustments on the 40% that's index-based, then unless inflation runs up from here, which we don't anticipate, I'm not sure I've seen anybody that anticipates that, then we feel like we're in a really good position with pricing to cover these cost increases plus add the margin. 
Now if inflation goes to 15%, then I will retract that statement. But I don't think anybody expects that. So right now, I mean, if you look at core price, for example, I mean, we're pretty happy with the core price numbers that we were showing. Core price was 6.1% for the quarter in commercial. That's a big core price number. If you look at the landfill line of business, which has gotten a lot of questions over the last couple of years, core price in landfill was 4.6%. That's 2 consecutive quarters over 4% of core price. 
And really, that's probably the best metric for looking at price increases is core price versus yield. Yield was very good as well, but core price probably is the best approximator of price increases. So I feel really comfortable with the existing kind of CPI and core inflation in the system that the pricing mechanisms that we have in place will cover that and also provide us some opportunity to improve margins as we go into 2022. Keep in mind that, that kind of 12-month look-back, a big piece of the adjustment that's coming in January won't include all of the inflation. That's going to take a year to capture that."

So I think the way that we think about that, John mentioned having to take some of the older vehicles off of the sidelines, so to speak, and pull those into service. We saw that most significantly in the industrial line of business and roll off because that's where we were able to flex most significantly in 2020. 
While we do see it on the operating expense side, our long-term focus continues to be on optimizing our fleet strategy so that we focus on reducing the total cost of ownership of each vehicle. We've seen some pressure in terms of per unit costs on the fleet overall. Some of that's general inflationary cost pressures, but some of that is that we're driving toward automation to the points that I've made earlier, particularly in the residential line of business. So while we have a more expensive unit on the street, we definitely see the benefits of that in terms of lower operating expense, both from labor and efficiency. 
So overall, in the current quarter, that's a component of the cost pressure that we saw. But I would say that, that was certainly secondary to the wage pressures that we experienced overall, and we expect that to abate as we get truck deliveries. It's an interesting point that through 9 months, we'd only gotten 70% of the trucks that we expected to get in 2021 to date. So we think that when we get those trucks delivered, you'll start to see some of those impacts reduce as well."

The strong conversion in 2021, we step back from that and say, if we're targeting a conversion of every EBITDA dollar to free cash flow at 50%, we think that, that's the outcome that's representative of a long-term trend for our business. We've had success reducing our interest and tax cost. Tax, as you mentioned, could be a question mark for the year ahead, too early for us to say one way or the other, although we are optimistic based on some of the conversations that are happening currently. 
The progress that we've made on working capital management has been really strong. That's one where I would tell you it's too early for us to declare victory. We're implementing new systems and processes and those are showing some value, but it's certainly difficult to use that as lift above that 50% target. 
In terms of managing CapEx, that really is the one that we're focused on because for us, a capital dollar really should be looked at no differently than an M&A dollar. And if we can get a better return on invested capital from accelerating capital in our recycling business or renewable energy facilities, we're going to do that. And so while we're going to look for opportunities to accelerate capital, we're going to do so in the same prudent way that we always do from a capital allocation perspective and look at long-term maintenance capital versus what we will consider more of a growth-oriented or investment-oriented capital decision. So that's the one place that there could be an evolution in our discussion in 2022, but no specific outlook that we can provide at this point. We'll give you more color next quarter."

But I do think that when we look at the collection efficiency ex all of these training impacts, we've been really satisfied with the continued frontline execution of the team in delivering margin expansion, though it is cover to us.
