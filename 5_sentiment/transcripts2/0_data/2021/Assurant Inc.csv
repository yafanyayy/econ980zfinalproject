This was a significant achievement, demonstrating both the strength and resiliency of our business model and the dedication of our employees. Guided by Assurant's core values, our over 14,000 employees demonstrated an extraordinary commitment throughout this pandemic to each other, our partners and the hundreds of millions of customers we serve around the world. During this most challenging of years, I'm equally as proud of the steps we took to further advance our long-standing commitment as a responsible employer, including additional actions to foster a more diverse, equitable and inclusive environment within our communities. Some examples included: sustaining enterprise forms to openly discuss challenges still faced by many as we collectively combat races and in bigotry, expanding our supplier diversity and inclusion program to provide additional opportunities to increase the diversity of our vendor relationships and reaffirming our commitment to fair and equitable pay as we continue to review our policies and practices. Already in 2021, we've launched several additional initiatives, including more comprehensive enterprise-wide diversity training and the mandatory adoption of diverse candidates slates and interview teams to ensure we hire the best candidates. We also expect to launch enterprise employee resource groups to support a more diverse workforce. We believe these diversity initiatives will help us better connect to each other and the consumers we serve. 
Now let's move to our full year results. Net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophes, grew by 16% to $664 million and earnings per share increased 17% to $10.8. These results were in line with the outlook we provided in November and far exceeded the initial expectations of 10% to 14% operating earnings per share growth we outlined at the beginning of 2020. This performance was driven by strong results in Global Housing and continued growth in Global Lifestyle, particularly Connected Living. Throughout the year, our balance sheet remains strong. Combined, our 3 operating segments contributed a total of $821 million in dividends to the holding company. During 2020, we increased our common stock dividend for the 16th consecutive year and returned $455 million in share repurchases and common stock dividends. Our 2019 Investor Day objective of returning $1.35 billion by the end of 2021 is now 65% complete. And we expect to return the balance over the course of this year. As we build a stronger Assurant for the future, we've continued to make investments in enhancing key capabilities, and the rollout of new and expanded offerings to support our growing global customer base. Our superior customer experience remains a key differentiator. This was critically important during the pandemic and will remain vital as we emerge in this period. Specifically, our digital capabilities have contributed to new business opportunities and the longevity of our most important client partnerships across Assurant. At the end of 2020, our top clients had an average tenure of almost 17 years. We continue to believe there are significant future growth opportunities within our mobile, auto and renters businesses. Also taking into account the convergence of connected devices, cars and homes, which we refer to as the connected world. These opportunities also drove our decision to explore strategic alternatives for Global Preneed so that we can deepen our focus on our lifestyle and housing businesses and the connected consumer. Excluding Global Preneed and catastrophe losses, these connected businesses represented 66% of our 2020 segment net operating income, roughly double that of 2015. Together, they're expected to generate strong above-market growth with offerings that have embedded earnings, complementing our specialty P&C offerings. Given our compelling business model and expanded fee-for-service offerings is the key source to drive growth, we continue to believe our stock remains attractively priced. We currently traded at discount to more relevant peers, including those in the home services market. However, we believe our consistent earnings growth, cash flow generation and competitive position are, in many ways, stronger and more sustainable. 
Now let me share some 2020 highlights for each of our operating segments. Within Global Lifestyle, we increased earnings 7% to $437 million. This was driven by Connected Living, where earnings grew by 14% as we increased our mobile subscriber base to 54 million through new and expanded partnerships. Across Asia Pacific and North America, we added almost 2.7 million subscribers last year. Portion of this year-over-year growth can be attributed to our alignment with new market entrants like U.S. cable providers and a new wireless carrier in Asia Pacific. We also processed 7 million devices through our Assurant trading facilities in 2020 and closed on the acquisition of HYLA Mobile. As a leading provider of smartphone software and trade-in and upgrade, HYLA will further increase our scale, strengthen our capabilities and expand our client roster as we look to capitalize on the 5G upgrade cycle over the next several years. In our extended service contract business, we expanded our 10-plus year relationship with Lowe's home improvement with the introduction of Lowe's Tech Connect, a white label version of our new packet product providing tech support for smart home devices. 
In Global Automotive, we've increased the number of vehicles we protect by nearly 13% to over $49 million since acquiring the Warta Group, adding to the significant level of embedded earnings within the business. More recently, we've added scale and value to OEM, TPA and national clients through 2 acquisitions in key global automotive markets. With American Financial and Automotive Services, or AFAS, we added scale in our directed dealer and are already leveraging their best-in-class talent and dealer training programs. In the fourth quarter, we acquired EPG, a leading provider of service contracts and insurance sold through heavy equipment dealers and manufacturers, including and Daimler. Like AFAS, we believe this is a natural extension of our extended service contract business in a niche market we know well, which has attractive long-term growth opportunities. Given our focus on the customer experience, we also continued to improve the claims process for vehicle owners through digital enhancements of our virtual claims inspection process, reducing inspection times and minimizing the amount of time without the vehicle. Within Global Financial Services, we're excited to announce a new partnership with a large U.S. credit card issuer, where we're providing administration services for certain embedded card benefits that leverage our enhanced omnichannel customer experience capabilities. We're excited about the business' attractive growth prospects for the future. 
Moving to Global Housing. We delivered net operating income, excluding cats of $371 million, up $71 million from 2019. And our returns remain strong as our operating ROE, including cats, was 15% for the year. Within our lender place business, we had another strong year of client renewals, and we remain proud of our critical role in the mortgage lending process. We attribute the strength and longevity of our client relationships to our focus on customer experience as well as compliance and risk management. These will only get stronger as we continue to make progress on our proprietary single source processing platform, increasing productivity and improving customer experience over the long term. In multifamily housing, we increased policies 8% since 2019 and now protect over 2.4 million renters nationwide. We've continued to invest in future growth, particularly through digital enhancements and innovations as the ongoing rollout of our property management solution, Cover 360 continues to progress. We recently introduced a newly designed resident portal that makes renter's insurance compliance for residents simple and fully digital, which will ultimately increase attachment rates over the long term. 
In Global Preneed, earnings were down year-over-year in light of the COVID-19 global pandemic and continued low interest rate environment. But overall, Global Preneed performed well in 2020 and has continued to produce strong cash flows with a high-quality $6 billion asset base. 
To summarize, 2020 was a strong year for Assurant despite a challenging global environment. We took additional transformative steps to continue to build a stronger Assurant of the future and capitalize on the convergence of the connected world. As we look at 2021, we expect to provide our annual outlook once we complete our evaluation of strategic alternatives for Preneed. We have made progress exploring the potential sale of the business. To date, interest has been strong, and we expect to provide an update on our progress before our next earnings call in May. 
With that said, as we look at Assurant today, including Preneed, we are on track to deliver against the financial objectives shared at our 2019 Investor Day including 12% average annual operating EPS growth, excluding catastrophes for 2020 and 2021. As expected, this implies slower EPS growth in 2021 as we continue to invest for the future and build off of a stronger base in 2020 and also assumes a more normalized level of non-cat losses in Global Housing. In 2021, we will continue to prioritize investments in product innovation, further enhancing the customer experience and strengthening our social responsibility efforts, including actions to promote sustainability. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard [indiscernible] results and our high-level view of 2021. Richard?"

As Alan noted, we are pleased with our performance for 2020, particularly amidst the pandemic. I'm now going to review our fourth quarter 2020 results and underlying business trends for the year. For the four",1605,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. As Alan noted, we are pleased with our performance for 2020, particularly amidst the pandemic. I'm now going to review our fourth quarter 2020 results and underlying business trends for the year. 
For the fourth quarter 2020, net operating income, excluding catastrophes, declined by $3 million to $136 million, mainly due to a $28 million reduction in net investment income across all operating segments, partially offset by more favorable non-cat loss experience in housing. This drop in investment income reflects both the lower interest rate environment and includes a $12 million decline in income from sales of real estate joint venture partnerships. In the quarter, we also incurred $11 million of severance and real estate charges as we continue to manage expenses and evolve Assurant workplace environment. 
Now let's move to segment results for Global Lifestyle. The segment reported earnings of $88 million in the fourth quarter, down $9 million. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a $16 million decrease in net investment income spread across the businesses, half of which came from sales of real estate joint venture partnerships. Excluding the decline in investment income, segment earnings increased modestly. Underlying earnings growth was driven primarily by organic growth in Global Auto, while Connected Living earnings were flat compared to the prior year. Results in Connected Living were driven by continued mobile subscriber growth, particularly in Asia Pacific and North America as well as contributions from the acquisition of HYLA in December. This was largely offset by lower mobile results in Europe, mainly from $5 million of non-run rate items. In addition, the segment had $4 million of severance and real estate charges in the quarter that we don't expect going forward. 
Looking at total revenues. Net earned premiums and fees decreased by $37 million. This was driven mainly by a $78 million reduction in mobile trading revenue, primarily due to the contract change we disclosed in the second quarter. Excluding this change, Lifestyle revenues were up $41 million or 2%, driven by an 8% revenue increase in Global Auto from prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Overall, trading activity, which flows through fee income, was down year-over-year. However, as was the case in the last few years, we saw an uptick in December. This was driven by new phone introductions, greater device availability and contributions from HYLA during its first month with Assurant. Given the continued strong trading activity in January, we expect to see a sequential and year-over-year increase in volumes in the first quarter. For the full year of 2021 we expect to see continued growth in Global Lifestyle's net operating income with the growth more heavily weighted toward the second half of the year. Overall, earnings expansion will be led by mobile and will mainly come from new and expanded programs as well as contributions from recent acquisitions. We also anticipate improved profitability in financial services, which is positioned to steadily improve following the lower volume  experience seen in 2020. We are cautiously optimistic, particularly as it relates to some of our travel-related programs, which were negatively impacted by the pandemic. We expect Global Auto earnings to be down modestly, reflecting the pressure from the low interest rate environment. Continued investments in our capabilities, product offerings and customer experience are also anticipated during the course of the year. 
Moving now to Global Housing. Net operating income for the fourth quarter totaled $61 million compared to $73 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was largely due to $28 million of higher reportable catastrophes. Over half of the losses were from Hurricane with the balance primarily related to claims from Hurricane Delta. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings increased $16 million or 23% despite lower investment income of $8 million. The increase was driven by favorable non-cat loss experience across all lines of business. We saw reduced claims frequency and drove improved profitability in our sharing economy portfolio. Lender-placed results also reflected higher premium rates, mostly offset by declining REO volumes from ongoing foreclosure moratoriums. 
Turning to revenue. Global Housing net earned premiums and fees decreased 3%. Similar to previous quarters, this was driven mainly by 3 items: the exit of small commercial, the insolvent lender-placed client and lower REO volumes. The decrease was partially offset by growth in both our specialty property and multifamily housing businesses. We expect Global Housing's net operating income, excluding cats, to be lower in 2021 compared to 2020, an overall increase in our non-cat loss ratio to more normalized levels and higher cat reinsurance costs will be the primary drivers. We expect both impacts to begin in the first quarter. Regarding our cat reinsurance costs, in January, we completed approximately 2/3 of our 2021 catastrophe reinsurance program placement. As part of the placement, we secured additional multiyear coverage, resulting in approximately 52% of our U.S. program now benefiting from this feature. As expected, we saw an increase in the overall pricing of reinsurance in our purchases to date, which are multiyear layers help to offset. As we finalize the remaining portion of the program in July, we will continue to evaluate the risks and rewards of purchasing additional reinsurance and alternatives that could reduce our risk. We are not, however, currently assuming any increased coverage. We expect some increase in REO volumes in the second half of the year. However, we do not anticipate volumes reverting to pre COVID levels immediately, and volumes will be influenced by the timing of the foreclosure moratoriums. 
Now let's move to Global Preneed. The segment reported net operating income of $9 million, a decrease of $7 million year-over-year. In addition to lower investment income, we had nearly $4 million of nonrecurring items related to a system conversion and updated assumptions for the earnings pattern of new policies. While the GAAP impact of these items was $4 million, the statutory impact was immaterial. In addition, we experienced an increase in mortality trends as we exited the quarter. We continue to monitor trends and expect the increase in claims to continue into the first half of 2021. Revenue per Preneed was up 5%, primarily due to growth in U.S. sales and sales have increased significantly since the second quarter of 2020, so they remain below pre-COVID levels. For 2021, Global Preneed will remain in our operating results until we conclude our evaluation of strategic alternatives. Overall, we expect 2021 Preneed earnings will be up slightly compared to 2020 reported results, illustrating the strength of the business despite the ongoing challenge of the global pandemic. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $23 million compared to $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. This was primarily due to lower investment income and expense actions in the quarter. For the full year 2021, we expect the corporate net operating loss to improve from 2020. 
I also wanted to provide a quick update on our investment portfolio. The portfolio continued to perform well during the quarter. While investment income levels are low due to the lower short and longer-term yields available in the market and lower joint venture real estate income in the quarter, the strength of the portfolio can be seen through 3 items: the absence of defaults, the low level of credit downgrades and the increase in the value of those assets mark-to-market. 
Turning to holding company liquidity. We ended the year with $407 million, which is $182 million above our current minimum target level. In the fourth quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $292 million. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also had outflows from 3 main items: $147 million of share repurchases, $44 million in common and preferred stock dividends and $368 million related to the acquisitions of HYLA and EPG. As a reminder, we partially financed HYLA through the issuance of subordinated debt in the fourth quarter. 
As we enter 2021, our capital and liquidity positions remained strong, supported by the robust cash flows generated by Global Lifestyle and Global Housing. For the year overall, we expect dividends to approximate segment earnings, subject to the growth of the businesses and rating agency and regulatory capital requirements. We have now returned approximately $880 million in the last 2 years, and we expect to complete our 3-year $1.35 billion capital return objectives to shareholders in 2021. Similar to prior years, the pace of buybacks is expected to be somewhat weighted towards the second half of the year. In the first quarter through February 5, we repurchased an additional 120,000 shares for $16 million. We have $770 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization, which includes the additional authorization recently improved our Board of Directors. Additionally, in January, we redeemed the remaining $50 million of our March 2021 notes. 
Before closing, I also wanted to provide a reminder that our mandatory convertible shares will convert to common shares on March 15. The number of common shares issued will depend on our share price, leading up to the conversion date. At Assurant's current share price, we would expect conversion would result in the minimum issuance of shares. 
In summary, despite a year of uncertainty, we took action to safeguard our employees to provide our clients with superior service and to maintain our strong financial footing. As we turn the page to 2021, we're focused on continuing to deliver profitable growth, enhancing our products and services and meeting our commitments to all stakeholders. We look forward to the year ahead as we continue to drive Assurant to a strong future. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

Maybe I'll start and then Richard, you can go deeper on the question around investment income. If you look at that business, since we closed on the Warranty Group, we mentioned this in the prepared remarks, we've added something like 13% to our service contract count. And that's over the last couple of years. That bodes very well for the future. Those are embedded future earnings that are going to come through. And if you look at the underlying growth in the business before considering the investment income impact, this is a longer duration product than others in our portfolio other than Preneed. There's strong underlying growth, really driven by expanding share in our key dealer relationships and beginning to drive some of our capabilities from mobile into the business. We've also recently announced partnerships in Europe, and we've announced previously a partnership in China around electric vehicles. That's another source of innovation growth. So I think put aside the kind of short term what shows up in our earnings, the underlying strength is strong. But Richard, you should comment more on investment income and how we think about that."

And the overall portfolio, I would say, is more shorter in duration relative to Preneed. You think about Preneed, having a duration maybe of 10 years, think about half that or less for Auto. So the current drop in interest rates has had somewhat of a headwind impact on us. Who knows how long that's going to last, right? But in terms of moving forward, I think for a large part, we've taken into account the short-term interest rate impact this year so far. So that -- I don't think short-term rates are going to go any lower, much lower. So I think that's all settled in, and that's just cash coming in and out of the enterprise there. And then from a longer-term basis, I think your question is a good one. As things move on, if interest rates stay low, it's a competitive environment. So we'll see with pricing but that typically would happen in any market where there's some sort of interest rate spreads embedded in products. So over time, that should reprice. Obviously, Mark, there's typically a lag in things like that. In terms of 2021, we feel really good, as Alan said. I mean the business has good momentum. We've grown the number of protected vehicles that we've had. Our recent acquisition of EPG bodes well for the synergies and integration that we have with that company into ours and future growth. AFAS this summer as well, good, strong acquisition for us. So we think we're the strongest player, one of the strongest players in the market and positioned to win as we go forward."

And that comes from a couple of different parts. I think the first part is small commercial. We exited that business, which was weighing on our overall non-cat loss ratio. The second part would be the underwriting we've done and improvements within the specialty property and particularly the sharing economy part of the business with the growth there that we've had and some nice results there. So those 2 items, I would say, are very particular to Assurant. So not a phenomenon across the market. And then we've also seen claims come down and frequency of claims this year. We're not so much thinking it's due to COVID as we're thinking it's really due to kind of weather, more or less weather, and the wind, the flood and things like that this year. We did have a little more increase in the cats that we've had this year. So maybe there's a play against those 2 as well. Looking forward, we think that, as we said, in 2021, the non-cat loss ratio will move up, but we don't think it's going to move up that much. It's probably potentially a slow conversion towards where we were in the past. But given what we've done in our underwriting, the movements that I discussed a moment ago, we think we're going to be in a better place next year than we were historically. So move up a little bit progressively, but not as much as -- not to where we were in 2021 is our prediction."

So when we look at it, we'll always look at there are other actions that could further share some of that cat exposure away. But if we look at the overlap between our housing business and our lifestyle business, it's strong. If you think about the convergence around the home, the device, the car, we're starting to see opportunities to roll out what we do in lifestyle into housing. A lot of our mobile capabilities are really relevant in renters and in the connected home. Also, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, even in a relatively high cat year, we had a 15% ROE with cats and housing. So it's generating strong earnings, lots of cash to reinvest, and continues to be an important part of our strategy and portfolio, with the caveat that we have reduced our cat volatility a lot, and we'll continue to look at ways to reduce that cat volatility."

But through the actions over the last 4 or 5 years, we've now gotten lender-placed to where it's roughly stable on earnings ex-cat even if the housing market remains strong. And obviously, if the housing market does weaken at some point, we're going to be there to provide the support to the mortgage market that we've historically provided. So we don't know what might happen this year. There is always a lag. It depends a lot on what happens with the government foreclosure moratoriums. But we've certainly called out that our business has been impacted negatively in 2020 and continuing with just the lack of REO volume given the foreclosure moratoriums that are going on. But the business is well positioned. And if the market does weaken, we're going to be there, and we will support the mortgage industry through that."

Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our performance for  2020, driven by our market-leading specialty P&C and Connected Living offerings, 2020 represented the fourth consecutive year of strong profitable operating earnings growth for Assurant. This was a significant achievement, demonstrating both the strength and resiliency of our business model and the dedication of our employees.
Guided by Assurant's core values, our over 14,000 employees demonstrated an extraordinary commitment throughout this pandemic to each other, our partners and the hundreds of millions of customers we serve around the world. During this most challenging of years, I'm equally as proud of the steps we took to further advance our long-standing commitment as a responsible employer, including additional actions to foster a more diverse, equitable and inclusive environment within our communities.
Some examples included: sustaining enterprise forms to openly discuss challenges still faced by many as we collectively combat racism and bigotry, expanding our supplier diversity and inclusion program to provide additional opportunities to increase the diversity of our vendor relationships and reaffirming our commitment to fair and equitable pay as we continue to review our policies and practices.
Already in 2021, we've launched several additional initiatives, including more comprehensive enterprise-wide diversity training and the mandatory adoption of diverse candidate slates and interview teams to ensure we hire the best candidates. We also expect to launch enterprise employee resource groups to support a more diverse workforce. We believe these diversity initiatives will help us better connect to each other and the consumers we serve.
Now let's move to our full year results. Net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophes, grew by 16% to $664 million, and earnings per share increased 17% to $10.80. These results were in line with the outlook we provided in November and far exceeded the initial expectations of 10% to 14% operating earnings per share growth we outlined at the beginning of 2020. This performance was driven by strong results in Global Housing and continued growth in Global Lifestyle, particularly Connected Living. Throughout the year, our balance sheet remained strong.
Combined, our 3 operating segments contributed a total of $821 million in dividends to the holding company. During 2020, we increased our common stock dividend for the 16th consecutive year and returned $455 million in share repurchases and common stock dividends. Our 2019 Investor Day objective of returning $1.35 billion by the end of 2021 is now 65% complete, and we expect to return the balance over the course of this year.
As we build a stronger Assurant for the future, we've continued to make investments in enhancing key capabilities and the rollout of new and expanded offerings to support our growing global customer base. Our superior customer experience remains a key differentiator. This was critically important during the pandemic and will remain vital as we emerge in this period. Specifically, our digital capabilities have contributed to new business opportunities and the longevity of our most important client partnerships across Assurant. At the end of 2020, our top clients had an average tenure of almost 17 years.
We continue to believe there are significant future growth opportunities within our mobile, auto and renters businesses, also taking into account the convergence of connected devices, cars and homes, which we refer to as the connected world. These opportunities also drove our decision to explore strategic alternatives for Global Preneed so that we can deepen our focus on our Lifestyle and Housing businesses and the connected consumer.
Excluding Global Preneed and catastrophe losses, these connected businesses represented 66% of our 2020 segment net operating income, roughly double that of 2015. Together, they're expected to generate strong above-market growth with offerings that have embedded earnings, complementing our specialty P&C offerings.
Given our compelling business model and expanded fee-for-service offerings is the key source to drive growth, we continue to believe our stock remains attractively priced. We currently trade at a discount to more relevant peers, including those in the home services market. However, we believe our consistent earnings growth, cash flow generation and competitive position are, in many ways, stronger and more sustainable.
Now let me share some 2020 highlights for each of our operating segments. Within Global Lifestyle, we increased earnings 7% to $437 million. This was driven by Connected Living, where earnings grew by 14% as we increased our mobile subscriber base to 54 million through new and expanded partnerships. Across Asia Pacific and North America, we added almost 2.7 million subscribers last year.
Portion of this year-over-year growth can be attributed to our alignment with new market entrants like U.S. cable providers and a new wireless carrier in Asia Pacific. We also processed 7 million devices through our Assurant trading facilities in 2020 and closed on the acquisition of HYLA Mobile.
As a leading provider of smartphone software and trade-in and upgrade, HYLA will further increase our scale, strengthen our capabilities and expand our client roster as we look to capitalize on the 5G upgrade cycle over the next several years. In our extended service contract business, we expanded our 10-plus year relationship with Lowe's home improvement with the introduction of Lowe's TechConnect, a white label version of our new Pocket Geek Home product providing tech support for smart home devices.
In Global Automotive, we've increased the number of vehicles we protect by nearly 13% to over $49 million since acquiring The Warranty Group, adding to the significant level of embedded earnings within the business. More recently, we've added scale and value to our OEM, TPA and national dealer clients through 2 acquisitions in key global automotive markets.
With American Financial & Automotive Services, or AFAS, we added scale in our direct-to-dealer channel and are already leveraging their best-in-class talent and dealer training programs. In the fourth quarter, we acquired EPG, a leading provider of service contracts and insurance sold through heavy equipment dealers and manufacturers, including Volvo and Daimler. Like AFAS, we believe this is a natural extension of our extended service contract business in a niche market we know well, which has attractive long-term growth opportunities.
Given our focus on the customer experience, we also continued to improve the claims process for vehicle owners through digital enhancements of our virtual claims inspection process, reducing inspection times and minimizing the amount of time without the vehicle.
Within Global Financial Services, we're excited to announce a new partnership with a large U.S. credit card issuer, where we're providing administration services for certain embedded card benefits that leverage our enhanced omnichannel customer experience capabilities. We're excited about the business' attractive growth prospects for the future.
Moving to Global Housing. We delivered net operating income, excluding cats, of $371 million, up $71 million from 2019. And our returns remained strong as our operating ROE, including cats, was 15% for the year. Within our lender place business, we had another strong year of client renewals, and we remain proud of our critical role in the mortgage lending process. We attribute the strength and longevity of our client relationships to our focus on customer experience as well as compliance and risk management.
  
These will only get stronger as we continue to make progress on our proprietary single-source processing platform, increasing productivity and improving customer experience over the long term. In multifamily housing, we increased policies 8% since 2019 and now protect over 2.4 million renters nationwide.
We've continued to invest in future growth, particularly through digital enhancements and innovations as the ongoing rollout of our property management solution, Cover360, continues to progress. We recently introduced a newly designed resident portal that makes renters' insurance compliance for residents simple and fully digital, which will ultimately increase attachment rates over the long term.
In Global Preneed, earnings were down year-over-year in light of the COVID-19 global pandemic and continued low interest rate environment. But overall, Global Preneed performed well in 2020 and has continued to produce strong cash flows with a high-quality $6 billion asset base.
To summarize, 2020 was a strong year for Assurant despite a challenging global environment. We took additional transformative steps to continue to build a stronger Assurant for the future and capitalize on the convergence of the connected world. As we look at 2021, we expect to provide our annual outlook once we complete our evaluation of strategic alternatives for Preneed. We have made progress exploring the potential sale of the business. To date, interest has been strong, and we expect to provide an update on our progress before our next earnings call in May.
With that said, as we look at Assurant today, including Preneed, we are on track to deliver against the financial objectives shared at our 2019 Investor Day, including 12% average annual operating EPS growth, excluding catastrophes for 2020 and 2021. As expected, this implies slower EPS growth in 2021, as we continue to invest for the future and build off of a stronger base in 2020 and also assumes a more normalized level of non-cat losses in Global Housing. In 2021, we will continue to prioritize investments in product innovation, further enhancing the customer experience and strengthening our social responsibility efforts, including actions to promote sustainability.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review fourth quarter results and our high-level view of 2021. Richard?"

As Alan noted, we are pleased with our performance for 2020, particularly amidst the pandemic. I'm now going to review our fourth quarter 2020 results and underlying business trends for the year.For the fourt",1609,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. As Alan noted, we are pleased with our performance for 2020, particularly amidst the pandemic. I'm now going to review our fourth quarter 2020 results and underlying business trends for the year.
For the fourth quarter 2020, net operating income, excluding catastrophes, declined by $3 million to $136 million, mainly due to a $28 million reduction in net investment income across all operating segments, partially offset by more favorable non-cat loss experience in housing. This drop in investment income reflects both the lower interest rate environment and includes a $12 million decline in income from sales of real estate joint venture partnerships. In the quarter, we also incurred $11 million of severance and real estate charges as we continue to manage expenses and evolve Assurant's workplace environment.
Now let's move to segment results for Global Lifestyle. The segment reported earnings of $88 million in the fourth quarter, down $9 million. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a $16 million decrease in net investment income spread across the businesses, half of which came from sales of real estate joint venture partnerships. Excluding the decline in investment income, segment earnings increased modestly. Underlying earnings growth was driven primarily by organic growth in Global Auto, while Connected Living earnings were flat compared to the prior year.
Results in Connected Living were driven by continued mobile subscriber growth, particularly in Asia Pacific and North America as well as contributions from the acquisition of HYLA in December. This was largely offset by lower mobile results in Europe, mainly from $5 million of non-run rate items. In addition, the segment had $4 million of severance and real estate charges in the quarter that we don't expect going forward.
Looking at total revenues. Net earned premiums and fees decreased by $37 million. This was driven mainly by a $78 million reduction in mobile trading revenue, primarily due to the contract change we disclosed in the second quarter. Excluding this change, Lifestyle revenues were up $41 million or 2%, driven by an 8% revenue increase in Global Auto from prior period sales of vehicle service contracts.
Overall, trading activity, which flows through fee income, was down year-over-year. However, as was the case in the last few years, we saw an uptick in December. This was driven by new phone introductions, greater device availability and contributions from HYLA during its first month with Assurant. Given the continued strong trading activity in January, we expect to see a sequential and year-over-year increase in volumes in the first quarter.
For the full year of 2021, we expect to see continued growth in Global Lifestyle's net operating income, with the growth more heavily weighted toward the second half of the year. Overall, earnings expansion will be led by mobile and will mainly come from new and expanded programs as well as contributions from recent acquisitions. We also anticipate improved profitability in financial services, which is positioned to steadily improve following the lower volumes and unfavorable loss experience seen in 2020.
We are cautiously optimistic, particularly as it relates to some of our travel-related programs, which were negatively impacted by the pandemic. We expect Global Auto earnings to be down modestly, reflecting the pressure from the low interest rate environment. Continued investments in our capabilities, product offerings and customer experience are also anticipated during the course of the year.
Moving now to Global Housing. Net operating income for the fourth quarter totaled $61 million compared to $73 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was largely due to $28 million of higher reportable catastrophes. Over half of the losses were from Hurricane Zeta with the balance primarily related to claims from Hurricane Delta. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings increased $16 million or 23% despite lower investment income of $8 million. The increase was driven by favorable non-cat loss experience across all lines of business. We saw reduced claims frequency and drove improved profitability in our sharing economy portfolio. Lender-placed results also reflected higher premium rates, mostly offset by declining REO volumes from ongoing foreclosure moratoriums.
Turning to revenue. Global Housing net earned premiums and fees decreased 3%. Similar to previous quarters, this was driven mainly by 3 items: the exit of small commercial, the insolvent lender-placed client and lower REO volumes. The decrease was partially offset by growth in both our specialty property and multifamily housing businesses. We expect Global Housing's net operating income, excluding cats, to be lower in 2021 compared to 2020, an overall increase in our non-cat loss ratio to more normalized levels and higher cat reinsurance costs will be the primary drivers. We expect both impacts to begin in the first quarter.
Regarding our cat reinsurance costs, in January, we completed approximately 2/3 of our 2021 catastrophe reinsurance program placement. As part of the placement, we secured additional multiyear coverage, resulting in approximately 52% of our U.S. program now benefiting from this feature. As expected, we saw an increase in the overall pricing of reinsurance in our purchases to date, which are multiyear layers help to offset.
As we finalize the remaining portion of the program in July, we will continue to evaluate the risks and rewards of purchasing additional reinsurance and alternatives that could reduce our risk. We are not, however, currently assuming any increased coverage. We expect some increase in REO volumes in the second half of the year. However, we do not anticipate volumes reverting to pre-COVID levels immediately, and volumes will be influenced by the timing of the foreclosure moratoriums.
Now let's move to Global Preneed. This segment reported net operating income of $9 million, a decrease of $7 million year-over-year. In addition to lower investment income, we had nearly $4 million of nonrecurring items related to a system conversion and updated assumptions for the earnings pattern of new policies. While the GAAP impact of these items was $4 million, the statutory impact was immaterial.
In addition, we experienced an increase in mortality trends as we exited the quarter. We continue to monitor trends and expect the increase in claims to continue into the first half of 2021. Revenue per Preneed was up 5%, primarily due to growth in U.S. sales, and face sales have increased significantly since the second quarter of 2020, so they remain below pre-COVID levels.
For 2021, Global Preneed will remain in our operating results until we conclude our evaluation of strategic alternatives. Overall, we expect 2021 Preneed earnings will be up slightly compared to 2020 reported results, illustrating the strength of the business, despite the ongoing challenge of the global pandemic.  At Corporate, the net operating loss was $23 million compared to $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. This was primarily due to lower investment income and expense actions in the quarter. For the full year 2021, we expect the Corporate net operating loss to improve from 2020.
I also wanted to provide a quick update on our investment portfolio. The portfolio continued to perform well during the quarter. While investment income levels are low due to the lower short and longer-term yields available in the market and lower joint venture real estate income in the quarter, the strength of the portfolio can be seen through 3 items: the absence of defaults, the low level of credit downgrades and the increase in the value of those assets mark-to-market.
Turning to holding company liquidity. We ended the year with $407 million, which is $182 million above our current minimum target level. In the fourth quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $292 million. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also had outflows from 3 main items: $147 million of share repurchases, $44 million in common and preferred stock dividends and $368 million related to the acquisitions of HYLA and EPG. As a reminder, we partially financed HYLA through the issuance of subordinated debt in the fourth quarter.
As we enter 2021, our capital and liquidity positions remained strong, supported by the robust cash flows generated by Global Lifestyle and Global Housing. For the year overall, we expect dividends to approximate segment earnings, subject to the growth of the businesses and rating agency and regulatory capital requirements. We have now returned approximately $880 million in the last 2 years, and we expect to complete our 3-year $1.35 billion capital return objectives to shareholders in 2021. Similar to prior years, the pace of buybacks is expected to be somewhat weighted towards the second half of the year. In the first quarter through February 5, we repurchased an additional 120,000 shares for $16 million. We have $770 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization, which includes the additional authorization recently improved our Board of Directors. Additionally, in January, we redeemed the remaining $50 million of our March 2021 notes.
Before closing, I also wanted to provide a reminder that our mandatory convertible shares will convert to common shares on March 15. The number of common shares issued will depend on our share price, leading up to the conversion date. At Assurant's current share price, we would expect conversion would result in the minimum issuance of shares.
In summary, despite a year of uncertainty, we took action to safeguard our employees to provide our clients with superior service and to maintain our strong financial footing. As we turn the page to 2021, we're focused on continuing to deliver profitable growth, enhancing our products and services and meeting our commitments to all stakeholders. We look forward to the year ahead as we continue to drive Assurant to a strong future.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

It's really around providing all the services to keep you connected for every connected device that you own. And so that's exciting.
But broadly, if you look at Connected Living, it was another year of strong growth, that includes in our service contract business. And we continue to believe and you see it with our success that we've been able to expand and grow and deepen. I think we've announced now more than a dozen or so new partnerships in the last 3 or 4 years really driven by our innovation and our strength in key global markets around the world like Japan and Europe.
So I think we feel good about the momentum, and we're going to continue to invest to differentiate. We -- for example, in 2020, we substantially increased our investment in digital midyear. Just not that we aren't already strong in digital, but we see the impact of COVID, and we wanted to make sure we're doing everything possible to drive a complete digital omnichannel experience for our customers."

If I reflect on the subscriber count, certainly, 2020 was still a positive year. We grew the subscriber count despite COVID and despite the numerous disruptions in store closures that happened throughout the year. We had challenges in Latin America, the region that was most disrupted probably by COVID. But as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had strong growth in North America and Asia Pacific. And with the Sprint business, we are beginning to ramp that, and that will grow strongly as we go through 2021 and beyond. So certainly grew a little bit slower than prior years really because of COVID, but the underlying momentum and strength of that business remains strong."

If you look at our history, we have a strong track record of disciplined capital management and deploying capital to support and grow our company over time. Normally, we focus first on organic growth and ensuring that we're funding the growth that's happening.
We have strong underlying organic growth across our company. And then we look at M&A and return of capital. With M&A, as a reminder, we have a very high hurdle. We look at cash-on-cash IRR. And we're really just focused in our key growth engines of the connected world. So that's mobile, auto and renters. That's where the bulk of that would be. And if we have excess capital, our track record of returning it to shareholders over time is strong."

It makes the whole process of compliance and having the appropriate coverage easy.
So we feel good about our momentum. We continue to grow and gain share relative to the market. If you think about multifamily, it was disrupted by COVID more than many of the markets in the U.S. Just given the challenges with renters, we had a lot less mobility last year of people moving.

And that's over the last couple of years. That bodes very well for the future. Those are embedded future earnings that are going to come through.
And if you look at the underlying growth in the business before considering the investment income impacts, this is a longer-duration product than others in our portfolio other than Preneed. There's strong underlying growth, really driven by expanding share in our key dealer relationships and beginning to drive some of our capabilities from mobile into the business.
We've also recently announced partnerships in Europe, and we've announced previously a partnership in China around electric vehicles. That's another source of innovation growth. So I think put aside the kind of short term what shows up in our earnings, the underlying strength is strong. But Richard, you should comment more on investment income and how we think about that."

And the overall portfolio, I would say, is more shorter in duration relative to Preneed. You think about Preneed, having a duration maybe of 10 years, think about half that or less for Auto. So the current drop in interest rates has had somewhat of a headwind impact on us. Who knows how long that's going to last, right?
But in terms of moving forward, I think for a large part, we've taken into account the short-term interest rate impact this year so far. So that -- I don't think short-term rates are going to go any lower -- much lower. So I think that's all settled in, and that's just cash coming in and out of the enterprise there. And then from a longer-term basis, I think your question is a good one. As things move on, if interest rates stay low, it's a competitive environment. So we'll see with pricing, but that typically would happen in any market where there's some sort of interest rate spreads embedded in products. So over time, that should reprice. Obviously, Mark, there's typically a lag in things like that.
In terms of 2021, we feel really good, as Alan said. I mean, the business has good momentum. We've grown the number of protected vehicles that we've had. Our recent acquisition of EPG bodes well for the synergies and integration that we have with that company into ours and future growth. AFAS, this summer as well, good, strong acquisition for us. So we think we're the strongest player, one of the strongest players in the market and positioned to win as we go forward."

And that comes from a couple of different parts. I think the first part is small commercial. We exited that business, which was weighing on our overall non-cat loss ratio.
The second part would be the underwriting we've done and improvements within the Specialty Property and particularly the sharing economy part of the business with the growth there that we've had and some nice results there. So those 2 items, I would say, are very particular to Assurant. So not a phenomenon across the market.
And then we've also seen claims come down and frequency of claims this year. We're not so much thinking it's due to COVID as we're thinking it's really due to kind of weather, more or less weather and the wind, the flood and things like that this year. We did have a little more increase in the cats that we've had this year. So maybe there's a play against those two as well.
Looking forward, we think that, as we said, in 2021, the non-cat loss ratio will move up, but we don't think it's going to move up that much. It's probably potentially a slow conversion towards where we were in the past. But given what we've done in our underwriting, the movements that I discussed a moment ago, we think we're going to be in a better place next year than we were historically. So move up a little bit progressively, but not as much as -- not to where we were in 2021 is our prediction."

Are other competitors trying to get in on it? I assume that happens regularly, but I was wondering whether it's any more intense or has changed at all?"

And as we mentioned, we've renewed something like 85% of our relationships over the last 2 years, many of them early as we prepare to work with our clients on the conversion to our new tracking system. So I don't see the competitive pressure changing a lot. It's always there. But we've shown our ability. If you look at the last decade, we've been able to grow that business dramatically, really driven off of the value that we're creating for our partners and for our customers."

If you go back to 2012, '13, we were about $240 million of retained -- of that exposure. We're down, down to $80 million. We've also morphed our reinsurance tower, more than half of its multiyear now, which also creates a lot of stability. And we've also been pruning nonstrategic risk. So a great example of that was our exit of small commercial a year or so ago.
So when we look at it, we'll always look at their other actions that could further share some of that cat exposure away. But if we look at the overlap between our Housing business and our Lifestyle business, it's strong. If you think about the convergence around the home, the device, the car, we're starting to see opportunities to roll out what we do in Lifestyle into Housing. A lot of our mobile capabilities are really relevant in renters and in the connected home.
Also, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, even in a relatively high cat year, we had a 15% ROE with cats in Housing. So it's generating strong earnings, lots of cash to reinvest, and continues to be an important part of our strategy and portfolio, with the caveat that we have reduced our cat volatility a lot, and we'll continue to look at ways to reduce that cat volatility."

You've talked about the REO program. You can certainly understand that being under pressure with the foreclosure moratorium in place. But how about just these higher delinquencies?
Presumably, the escrow funds are getting used up. And if people aren't paying their mortgages, a lot of them are not paying insurance. How do we think about that? It seems like you've had very limited impact so far, but these have been delinquencies that have been in place since early mid last year.

Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the first quarter of 2021. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com.
We will start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session. 
Some of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports.
During today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. As we continue to shift to a more fee income capital-light business mix, we introduced adjusted EBITDA as part of our restated financial statement in April. This is another important financial metric for the company, reflective of our go-forward Global Lifestyle and Global Housing businesses.
In addition, as of January 1, global Preneed and the related entities included in the sale are considered discontinued operations and no longer included in our continuing operations, as reflected in the earnings press release and financial supplement. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement.

Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our results for the first quarter. We delivered double-digit earnings growth driven by favorable non-catastrophe loss experience, including improved underwriting in Global Housing, as well as continued profitable growth in our Global Automotive, multifamily housing and Connected Living businesses. Once again, results demonstrated the attractiveness of our market-leading specialty P&C and lifestyle offerings distributed across multiple channels. This is in addition to the compelling growth opportunities emerging across mobile, auto and renters. Together, these businesses represent what we refer to as the Connected World.
In 2020, our Connected World offerings represented 2/3 of our net operating income, excluding catastrophes, and in combination with our specialty P&C businesses will enable us to continue to expand our innovative offerings and deliver a superior and seamless customer experience. Generating over $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2020, our business portfolio is well positioned to sustain above-market growth and strong cash flows over time. And as we look ahead, we are continuously investing to bring innovation to market to build a more sustainable future for all of our stakeholders.
To that end, we recently published our 2021 social responsibility report, highlighting the many ways we are delivering on our commitment as a purpose-driven company. We are continuing to advance our ESG efforts, specifically within our strategic focus areas of talent, products and climate. Further integrating ESG within our business operations will be critical as we look to create an even more diverse, equitable and inclusive culture that promotes innovation, enhances sustainability and minimizes our carbon footprint for the benefit of all stakeholders.
Recent notable examples include: We are increasing all U.S. hourly wages to at least $15 per hour by July, which supports the financial well-being of our employees; we've launched an assessment of our carbon footprint, including our investment portfolio and supply chain as a critical step to setting a future long-term carbon emissions reduction goal; and we've further integrated sustainability into our offerings, such as rolling out electric vehicle products globally and extending the mobile device life cycle through trading services. With HYLA, we recently passed a significant milestone, repurposing our 100 millionth device. This has extended the life of devices, put billions of dollars back into consumers' hands and prevented additional e-waste from ending up in our landfills, supporting global sustainability.
We are pleased with our progress and are proud of the recognitions we have received, including our inclusion in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index and America's Best Employers for Diversity by Forbes, as well as being awarded the Best Place to Work in several of the key markets we operate. 
Sustainability and innovation go hand in hand. Recently, we surpassed $100 million invested through Assurant Ventures, our venture capital arm. This quarter, several high-quality investments in our portfolio announced SPAC transactions, including Cazoo, a fully digital U.K. car sales company; and SmartRent, a smart home automation provider. Given current attractive valuations, these investments have the potential to generate strong returns while also providing strategic insights that support our Connected World businesses, creating value-added partnerships and piloting new innovations.
Now let me share some first quarter highlights for each of our operating segments. We continue to see strong growth in Global Lifestyle, increasing earnings by 7% year-over-year. Over the years, we've continuously invested in mobile capabilities, such as same-day local repair or come-to-you repair for mobile devices, which provide another opportunity to drive value for our clients and the end consumer.
Most recently, in Connected Living, we've further strengthened our product capabilities and customer experience through the acquisition of TRYGLE in Japan. TRYGLE develops and operates a mobile phone app that allows consumers to manage the life cycle of their devices and centrally organizes digital product manuals for all connected products. 
Collectively, all of our investments have helped lead to 15 new client program launches since 2015. This includes partnerships with several U.S. cable providers, including XFINITY and Spectrum; as well as large mobile carriers in Japan, like KDDI and Rakuten.
Recently, we've expanded our global partnership with Samsung through the launch of Samsung Care+, a smartphone protection program, in Brazil and Mexico. We expect to further extend this partnership globally. We will continue to build on the strong momentum we have with our global multiproduct and multichannel strategy, bolstered by the additional investments we are making.
As an example, HYLA Mobile added scale and technology capabilities to our global trade-in and upgrade business and has been performing even better than our initial expectations. We're now providing over 30 trading programs around the world. The acquisition positions us to benefit from favorable tailwinds in the global mobile market, including the upcoming 5G smartphone rate cycle and new client relationships.
In Global Automotive, we continue to benefit from our scale and expertise as we now cover over 50 million vehicles. Already this year, we've seen a significant increase in auto production versus pre-pandemic first quarter levels. In the year acquiring AFS, we've combined our award-winning programs to create the Automotive Training Academy by Assurant. It's expanded in person and [indiscernible]
Within Global Financial Services 
[Audio Gap]
In Global Housing, net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophes, grew 17%. As we benefited from favorable non-cat loss experience, including improved underwriting results.
Within our lender-placed business, we continue to play a vital role in supporting the mortgage industry as we track over 31 million loans. The business remains well positioned, and we expect to benefit from investing in our superior customer platform over the long term.
Multifamily housing increased policies by 9% year-over-year to almost $2.5 million as we continue to grow through our affinity partnerships and PMC channel, including 7 of the top 10 largest TMCs in the U.S.
We've also continued to grow our sharing economy offerings, which include car sharing, on-demand delivery and vacation rental. Over the last 2 years, through our partnership with market leaders and on-demand delivery, we tripled the number of deliveries we protect over 1 billion deliveries. While it is too early to gauge whether the pandemic has fundamentally changed consumer demand for these services, we're encouraged by our momentum and the potential for future products and services in the gig economy.
Now let's move to our first quarter results and our 2021 outlook. Net operating income, excluding cats, grew by 13% to $182 million and earnings per share increased 16% to $3.03, demonstrating improved results in Global Housing and continued momentum in Global Lifestyle.
Given our strong performance in the first quarter and current business trends, we are increasing our full year outlook for 2021. We now expect 10% to 14% growth in operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophes, versus our initial expectation of 9% EPS growth. EPS expansion from the $9.88 in 2020 will be driven by high single-digit earnings growth, mainly from Global Lifestyle, and a lower corporate loss. Results will also benefit from share repurchases, including the completion of our 3-year $1.35 billion objective and the initial return of net proceeds from the Global Preneed sale. Our increased outlook largely reflects Global Housing's favorable non-catastrophe loss experience in the first quarter. As such, housing's earnings are expected to be down only modestly year-over-year from what was a strong 2020.
Looking at adjusted EBITDA, excluding catastrophes, the first quarter generated $302 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA will grow at a modestly higher rate than net operating income in 2021. 
Turning to capital. We ended March with $332 million of holding company liquidity after returning $80 million to shareholders through common stock dividends and buybacks during the quarter, and we expect to deliver on all of our commitments, sustaining our strong track record of capital return. In addition, throughout the year, we will continue to make strategic investments in our portfolio to position us well for sustained long-term growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review first quarter results and our 2021 outlook. Richard?"

As Alan noted, we are pleased with our first quarter performance as our results across Global Lifestyle and Global Housing remain strong. Before getting in first quarter performance, I want to provide a quick update on the sale of our preneed business.
In March, we announced our plan to sell the business for $1.3 billion to CUNA Mutual Group. Since signing, we have completed the necessary regulatory filings, and we remain on track to close the transaction by the end of the third quarter.
Now let's move to segment results for Global Lifestyle. This segment reported net operating income of $129 million in the first quarter, an increase of 7%, driven by Global Automotive and Connected Living. In Global Automotive, earnings increased $7 million or 18%. Results included a $4 million onetime benefit as well as a gain on investment income related to a specialty asset class from our TWG acquisition, which we don't expect to recur.
Year-over-year, underlying performance was driven by another quarter of global organic growth from U.S. EPA and international OEMs as well as some favorable loss experience. Connected Living grew earnings by 3%. However, this was muted by a $7 million favorable client recoverable within extended service contracts in the prior year period. Underlying performance was driven by mobile subscriber growth in Asia Pacific and North America, higher trading results from increased seasonal volume and contributions from our HYLA acquisition.
For the quarter, Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA increased 11% to $193 million, 4 points above net operating income growth. This reflects the segment's increased amortization related to higher deal-related intangibles, 4 more recent acquisitions in Global Automotive and Connected Living. IT depreciation expense also increased, stemming from higher investments. Lifestyle revenue decreased by $85 million. This was driven mainly by a $98 million reduction in mobile trading revenue, primarily due to the contract change we disclosed last year. 
Excluding this change, revenue for this segment was flat. For the full year, we continue to expect lifestyle revenues to be in line with last year at approximately $7.3 billion. As expected, overall trading volumes, which flow through fee income, increased year-over-year and sequentially. 
This was driven by 4 elements: new phone introductions last year, greater device availability, carrier promotions and contributions from HYLA. While the first quarter did benefit from strong mobile trading volumes, we do expect it to be a high watermark for the year given historical seasonal patterns.
Since year-end, we've increased covered mobile devices by 600,000 subs, driven by continued growth in North America and Asia Pacific. This year, we continue to expect covered Mobile devices to grow mid-single digits compared to 2020 as we grow subscribers in key geographies like the U.S. and Japan. As a reminder, we expect the growth rate of earnings to exceed the growth rate of covered mobile devices over time as we benefit from offering additional products and services to our clients and their end consumers.
For 2021, we still expect Global Lifestyle's net operating income to grow in the high single digits, compared to the $437 million reported in 2020. Growth will come from all lines of business, particularly Connected Living. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment is expected to grow double digits year-over-year.
Moving now to Global Housing. Net operating income for the first quarter totaled $67 million, compared to $74 million in the first quarter of 2020. The decrease was largely due to $22 million of higher reportable catastrophes, mainly related to the extreme winter weather, particularly from areas like Texas. Excluding the catastrophe losses, earnings increased $50 million or 17%. More than 2/3 of the increase was from favorable non-cat loss experience, mainly in our specialty offerings, including sharing economy products. We estimate that approximately half of the favorable loss experienced in the first quarter was from underwriting improvements, with the remainder of the benefit driven by favorable loss experience, which we don't expect to recur.
In addition, we saw continued growth in multifamily housing. Lender-placed results were up modestly. Higher premium rates and favorable non-cat loss experience were mostly offset by decline in REO volumes from ongoing foreclosure moratoriums. Looking at the placement rate, the modest sequential increase to 1.6% was attributable to a shift in business mix and is not an indication of a broader macro housing market shift.
Revenue decreased 2% related to a reduction in our specialty product offerings, which included the impact from the exit of Small Commercial as well as lower REO volumes. This decrease was partially offset by growth in multifamily housing, which grew 8% year-over-year, driven mainly by our affinity partners. We now expect Global Housing's net operating income, excluding cats, to be down modestly compared to 2020. This reflects our stronger first quarter and the assumption of a modest increase in our expected non-cat loss ratio to more normalized levels for the remainder of the year. We are also monitoring the REO foreclosure moratoriums and any additional extensions that may be announced.
As we position for the future, we will continue investments in the business to sustain and enhance our competitive position. At Corporate, the net operating loss was $22 million, which was flat year-over-year. For the full year, we continue to expect the corporate net operating loss to improve to approximately $90 million as we eliminate enterprise support costs associated with Global Preneed. As we think about the remainder of the year, for all of Assurant, we are beginning to plan for a phased reentry of our workforce post COVID. And we are evaluating our real estate footprint to align with new business and employee needs as we adapt to the future of work. This may result in additional expenses throughout the year.
I also wanted to provide a quick comment on our investment portfolio. With preneed moving to discontinued operations, our investment portfolio is now approximately $7.9 billion, excluding cash and cash equivalents. Given preneed's relatively longer average duration of around 10 years compared to the rest of our business, following the sale of preneed, our go-forward duration will drop to between 4.5 to 5 years. As a result, Our interest rate sensitivity will be reduced by approximately 2/3.
Turning to holding income and liquidity. We ended the first quarter with $332 million, which is $107 million above our current minimum target level. In the first quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $183 million. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also had outflows from 3 main items: $42 million of share repurchases; $43 million in common and preferred stock dividends; and $10 million mainly related to the acquisition of TRYGLE and Assurant Venture investments.
Also, in January, we redeemed the remaining $50 million of our March 2021 notes. And our mandatory convertible shares converted to approximately 2.7 million common shares during the quarter. For the year overall, we continue to expect dividends to approximate segment earnings subject to the growth of the businesses and rating agency and regulatory capital considerations. We've now completed over 70% and of our $1.35 billion capital return objective from 2019 to 2021 and remain confident that we will meet this objective by the end of this year.
In addition, we expect to begin incremental buybacks prior to closing the preneed transaction in the third quarter. The total buybacks associated with the net proceeds from the sale are expected to be returned within 1 year of the transaction close. In the second quarter through April 30, we repurchased an additional 95,000 shares for $14 million.
In summary, our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business and our capital and liquidity position. We remain focused on completing the sale of Global Preneed and delivering on our 2021 financial objectives.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

I think it's important when we talk about housing now to start with it's a really good business that's performing well. You saw the very strong 2020, good start to this year. Over the last 5 or 6 years, we've really fine-tuned the business. We're now in a good position if there is housing market weakness. I think that's an important backdrop.
Now we have been taking many actions over the last few years to reduce volatility. So one of those was bringing retention down to $80 million per event. That is now made -- if we do have a severe cat season, it's not a business risk to the company at all. It's just a onetime kind of earnings impact. We've also done things like moving to a multiyear tower. I think as of January, we're up to 52% of the towers now multiyear. That also smoothes out the volatility. 
And then we've been trimming exposure in areas where we don't feel like the risk/return tradeoff is attractive for true risk businesses like our -- the small commercial. And with that backdrop, we've been on a journey to become more credit-light. It's something we look at every year. We look at all of our businesses every year. The challenge with it, it's harder to see how the economics work with reinsurance, given where we're already buying down, too. So you need to come up with other structures. Those require a lot of earnings give up. And so it's not straightforward how you would actually do that and make sure that it was a good outcome for our shareholders.
The other way we've been addressing it is just growing the rest of our company. And so if you look at today our non-cat exposed businesses are now something like 75% of our earnings and growing much faster. And so over time, that's a dramatic shift in our exposure to whatever might happen with cat. So we'll certainly continue to work on it, but we feel like we've made great progress on it. And we're not going to do anything that isn't really positive for our shareholders."

So that's what allowed us to go out and win new clients like American Express.
Broadly, the way to think about that portion of our business, which rolls up through financial services, is their fee income. We're effectively administering programs for our partners. We're playing a role in adjudicating claims, but the risk, there's no risk for us. So it's fee income, not significant to our earnings yet, but certainly an opportunity over time to grow and then leverage these relationships to drive some of our other products into those companies and their customers.

And we benefit from that mix shift in the short term. In terms of repairs and maybe an increased cost of repairs, for most of our auto business, we're administering the repairs for our clients. And the clients realize the benefit or the challenges of parts shortages. So at the end of the day, not really material to us. And as we mentioned earlier, we're seeing pretty strong momentum in the underlying growth of auto at the moment."

But we push very hard on digital, even pre COVID, which I think helped mitigate that. We mentioned earlier we are seeing still some depressed activity in Europe. So that's an opportunity. But I think I wouldn't look at we were that impacted by COVID in terms of what was happening. And so therefore, growth in the economy is obviously positive. People buy things. That gives us new chances to attach and sale. But as I mentioned earlier, we feel confident whatever happens in the external environment that we're going to grow and outperform."

Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the first quarter of 2021. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com.
We will start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session. 
Some of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports.
During today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. As we continue to shift to a more fee income capital-light business mix, we introduced adjusted EBITDA as part of our restated financial statement in April. This is another important financial metric for the company, reflective of our go-forward Global Lifestyle and Global Housing businesses.
In addition, as of January 1, global Preneed and the related entities included in the sale are considered discontinued operations and no longer included in our continuing operations, as reflected in the earnings press release and financial supplement. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement.

Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our results for the first quarter. We delivered double-digit earnings growth driven by favorable non-catastrophe loss experience, including improved underwriting in Global Housing, as well as continued profitable growth in our Global Automotive, multifamily housing and Connected Living businesses. Once again, results demonstrated the attractiveness of our market-leading specialty P&C and lifestyle offerings distributed across multiple channels. This is in addition to the compelling growth opportunities emerging across mobile, auto and renters. Together, these businesses represent what we refer to as the Connected World.
In 2020, our Connected World offerings represented 2/3 of our net operating income, excluding catastrophes, and in combination with our specialty P&C businesses will enable us to continue to expand our innovative offerings and deliver a superior and seamless customer experience. Generating over $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2020, our business portfolio is well positioned to sustain above-market growth and strong cash flows over time. And as we look ahead, we are continuously investing to bring innovation to market to build a more sustainable future for all of our stakeholders.
To that end, we recently published our 2021 social responsibility report, highlighting the many ways we are delivering on our commitment as a purpose-driven company. We are continuing to advance our ESG efforts, specifically within our strategic focus areas of talent, products and climate. Further integrating ESG within our business operations will be critical as we look to create an even more diverse, equitable and inclusive culture that promotes innovation, enhances sustainability and minimizes our carbon footprint for the benefit of all stakeholders.
Recent notable examples include: We are increasing all U.S. hourly wages to at least $15 per hour by July, which supports the financial well-being of our employees; we've launched an assessment of our carbon footprint, including our investment portfolio and supply chain as a critical step to setting a future long-term carbon emissions reduction goal; and we've further integrated sustainability into our offerings, such as rolling out electric vehicle products globally and extending the mobile device life cycle through trading services. With HYLA, we recently passed a significant milestone, repurposing our 100 millionth device. This has extended the life of devices, put billions of dollars back into consumers' hands and prevented additional e-waste from ending up in our landfills, supporting global sustainability.
We are pleased with our progress and are proud of the recognitions we have received, including our inclusion in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index and America's Best Employers for Diversity by Forbes, as well as being awarded the Best Place to Work in several of the key markets we operate. 
Sustainability and innovation go hand in hand. Recently, we surpassed $100 million invested through Assurant Ventures, our venture capital arm. This quarter, several high-quality investments in our portfolio announced SPAC transactions, including Cazoo, a fully digital U.K. car sales company; and SmartRent, a smart home automation provider. Given current attractive valuations, these investments have the potential to generate strong returns while also providing strategic insights that support our Connected World businesses, creating value-added partnerships and piloting new innovations.
Now let me share some first quarter highlights for each of our operating segments. We continue to see strong growth in Global Lifestyle, increasing earnings by 7% year-over-year. Over the years, we've continuously invested in mobile capabilities, such as same-day local repair or come-to-you repair for mobile devices, which provide another opportunity to drive value for our clients and the end consumer.
Most recently, in Connected Living, we've further strengthened our product capabilities and customer experience through the acquisition of TRYGLE in Japan. TRYGLE develops and operates a mobile phone app that allows consumers to manage the life cycle of their devices and centrally organizes digital product manuals for all connected products. 
Collectively, all of our investments have helped lead to 15 new client program launches since 2015. This includes partnerships with several U.S. cable providers, including XFINITY and Spectrum; as well as large mobile carriers in Japan, like KDDI and Rakuten.
Recently, we've expanded our global partnership with Samsung through the launch of Samsung Care+, a smartphone protection program, in Brazil and Mexico. We expect to further extend this partnership globally. We will continue to build on the strong momentum we have with our global multiproduct and multichannel strategy, bolstered by the additional investments we are making.
As an example, HYLA Mobile added scale and technology capabilities to our global trade-in and upgrade business and has been performing even better than our initial expectations. We're now providing over 30 trading programs around the world. The acquisition positions us to benefit from favorable tailwinds in the global mobile market, including the upcoming 5G smartphone rate cycle and new client relationships.
In Global Automotive, we continue to benefit from our scale and expertise as we now cover over 50 million vehicles. Already this year, we've seen a significant increase in auto production versus pre-pandemic first quarter levels. In the year acquiring AFS, we've combined our award-winning training programs to create the Automotive Training Academy by Assurant. Its expanded in-person and  
virtual programs will allow us to scale faster and adapt to the changing needs of dealers and automotive professionals. 
Within Global Financial Services, we've added a number of embedded card benefit clients recently, including the previously announced partnership with American Express. We look forward to enhancing these partnerships and building on our existing suite of products. We look forward to enhancing these partnerships and building on our existing suite of products.
Moving to Global Housing, net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophes, grew 17%. As we benefited from favorable non-cat loss experience, including improved underwriting results.
Within our lender-placed business, we continue to play a vital role in supporting the mortgage industry as we track over 31 million loans. The business remains well positioned, and we expect to benefit from investing in our superior customer platform over the long term.
Multifamily housing increased policies by 9% year-over-year to almost $2.5 million as we continue to grow through our affinity partnerships and PMC channel, including 7 of the top 10 largest TMCs in the U.S.
We've also continued to grow our sharing economy offerings, which include car sharing, on-demand delivery and vacation rental. Over the last 2 years, through our partnership with market leaders and on-demand delivery, we tripled the number of deliveries we protect over 1 billion deliveries. While it is too early to gauge whether the pandemic has fundamentally changed consumer demand for these services, we're encouraged by our momentum and the potential for future products and services in the gig economy.
Now let's move to our first quarter results and our 2021 outlook. Net operating income, excluding cats, grew by 13% to $182 million and earnings per share increased 16% to $3.03, demonstrating improved results in Global Housing and continued momentum in Global Lifestyle.
Given our strong performance in the first quarter and current business trends, we are increasing our full year outlook for 2021. We now expect 10% to 14% growth in operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophes, versus our initial expectation of 9% EPS growth. EPS expansion from the $9.88 in 2020 will be driven by high single-digit earnings growth, mainly from Global Lifestyle, and a lower corporate loss. Results will also benefit from share repurchases, including the completion of our 3-year $1.35 billion objective and the initial return of net proceeds from the Global Preneed sale. Our increased outlook largely reflects Global Housing's favorable non-catastrophe loss experience in the first quarter. As such, housing's earnings are expected to be down only modestly year-over-year from what was a strong 2020.
Looking at adjusted EBITDA, excluding catastrophes, the first quarter generated $302 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA will grow at a modestly higher rate than net operating income in 2021. 
Turning to capital. We ended March with $332 million of holding company liquidity after returning $80 million to shareholders through common stock dividends and buybacks during the quarter, and we expect to deliver on all of our commitments, sustaining our strong track record of capital return. In addition, throughout the year, we will continue to make strategic investments in our portfolio to position us well for sustained long-term growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review first quarter results and our 2021 outlook. Richard?"

As Alan noted, we are pleased with our first quarter performance as our results across Global Lifestyle and Global Housing remain strong. Before getting in first quarter performance, I want to provide a quick update on the sale of our preneed business.
In March, we announced our plan to sell the business for $1.3 billion to CUNA Mutual Group. Since signing, we have completed the necessary regulatory filings, and we remain on track to close the transaction by the end of the third quarter.
Now let's move to segment results for Global Lifestyle. This segment reported net operating income of $129 million in the first quarter, an increase of 7%, driven by Global Automotive and Connected Living. In Global Automotive, earnings increased $7 million or 18%. Results included a $4 million onetime benefit as well as a gain on investment income related to a specialty asset class from our TWG acquisition, which we don't expect to recur.
Year-over-year, underlying performance was driven by another quarter of global organic growth from U.S. EPA and international OEMs as well as some favorable loss experience. Connected Living grew earnings by 3%. However, this was muted by a $7 million favorable client recoverable within extended service contracts in the prior year period. Underlying performance was driven by mobile subscriber growth in Asia Pacific and North America, higher trading results from increased seasonal volume and contributions from our HYLA acquisition.
For the quarter, Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA increased 11% to $193 million, 4 points above net operating income growth. This reflects the segment's increased amortization related to higher deal-related intangibles, 4 more recent acquisitions in Global Automotive and Connected Living. IT depreciation expense also increased, stemming from higher investments. Lifestyle revenue decreased by $85 million. This was driven mainly by a $98 million reduction in mobile trading revenue, primarily due to the contract change we disclosed last year. 
Excluding this change, revenue for this segment was flat. For the full year, we continue to expect lifestyle revenues to be in line with last year at approximately $7.3 billion. As expected, overall trading volumes, which flow through fee income, increased year-over-year and sequentially. 
This was driven by 4 elements: new phone introductions last year, greater device availability, carrier promotions and contributions from HYLA. While the first quarter did benefit from strong mobile trading volumes, we do expect it to be a high watermark for the year given historical seasonal patterns.
Since year-end, we've increased covered mobile devices by 600,000 subs, driven by continued growth in North America and Asia Pacific. This year, we continue to expect covered Mobile devices to grow mid-single digits compared to 2020 as we grow subscribers in key geographies like the U.S. and Japan. As a reminder, we expect the growth rate of earnings to exceed the growth rate of covered mobile devices over time as we benefit from offering additional products and services to our clients and their end consumers.
For 2021, we still expect Global Lifestyle's net operating income to grow in the high single digits, compared to the $437 million reported in 2020. Growth will come from all lines of business, particularly Connected Living. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment is expected to grow double digits year-over-year.
Moving now to Global Housing. Net operating income for the first quarter totaled $67 million, compared to $74 million in the first quarter of 2020. The decrease was largely due to $22 million of higher reportable catastrophes, mainly related to the extreme winter weather, particularly from areas like Texas. Excluding the catastrophe losses, earnings increased $50 million or 17%. More than 2/3 of the increase was from favorable non-cat loss experience, mainly in our specialty offerings, including sharing economy products. We estimate that approximately half of the favorable loss experienced in the first quarter was from underwriting improvements, with the remainder of the benefit driven by favorable loss experience, which we don't expect to recur.
In addition, we saw continued growth in multifamily housing. Lender-placed results were up modestly. Higher premium rates and favorable non-cat loss experience were mostly offset by decline in REO volumes from ongoing foreclosure moratoriums. Looking at the placement rate, the modest sequential increase to 1.6% was attributable to a shift in business mix and is not an indication of a broader macro housing market shift.
Revenue decreased 2% related to a reduction in our specialty product offerings, which included the impact from the exit of Small Commercial as well as lower REO volumes. This decrease was partially offset by growth in multifamily housing, which grew 8% year-over-year, driven mainly by our affinity partners. We now expect Global Housing's net operating income, excluding cats, to be down modestly compared to 2020. This reflects our stronger first quarter and the assumption of a modest increase in our expected non-cat loss ratio to more normalized levels for the remainder of the year. We are also monitoring the REO foreclosure moratoriums and any additional extensions that may be announced.
As we position for the future, we will continue investments in the business to sustain and enhance our competitive position. At Corporate, the net operating loss was $22 million, which was flat year-over-year. For the full year, we continue to expect the corporate net operating loss to improve to approximately $90 million as we eliminate enterprise support costs associated with Global Preneed. As we think about the remainder of the year, for all of Assurant, we are beginning to plan for a phased reentry of our workforce post COVID. And we are evaluating our real estate footprint to align with new business and employee needs as we adapt to the future of work. This may result in additional expenses throughout the year.
I also wanted to provide a quick comment on our investment portfolio. With preneed moving to discontinued operations, our investment portfolio is now approximately $7.9 billion, excluding cash and cash equivalents. Given preneed's relatively longer average duration of around 10 years compared to the rest of our business, following the sale of preneed, our go-forward duration will drop to between 4.5 to 5 years. As a result, Our interest rate sensitivity will be reduced by approximately 2/3.
Turning to holding income and liquidity. We ended the first quarter with $332 million, which is $107 million above our current minimum target level. In the first quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $183 million. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also had outflows from 3 main items: $42 million of share repurchases; $43 million in common and preferred stock dividends; and $10 million mainly related to the acquisition of TRYGLE and Assurant Venture investments.
Also, in January, we redeemed the remaining $50 million of our March 2021 notes. And our mandatory convertible shares converted to approximately 2.7 million common shares during the quarter. For the year overall, we continue to expect dividends to approximate segment earnings subject to the growth of the businesses and rating agency and regulatory capital considerations. We've now completed over 70% and of our $1.35 billion capital return objective from 2019 to 2021 and remain confident that we will meet this objective by the end of this year.
In addition, we expect to begin incremental buybacks prior to closing the preneed transaction in the third quarter. The total buybacks associated with the net proceeds from the sale are expected to be returned within 1 year of the transaction close. In the second quarter through April 30, we repurchased an additional 95,000 shares for $14 million.
In summary, our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business and our capital and liquidity position. We remain focused on completing the sale of Global Preneed and delivering on our 2021 financial objectives.

I think it's important when we talk about housing now to start with it's a really good business that's performing well. You saw the very strong 2020, good start to this year. Over the last 5 or 6 years, we've really fine-tuned the business. We're now in a good position if there is housing market weakness. I think that's an important backdrop.
Now we have been taking many actions over the last few years to reduce volatility. So one of those was bringing retention down to $80 million per event. That is now made -- if we do have a severe cat season, it's not a business risk to the company at all. It's just a onetime kind of earnings impact. We've also done things like moving to a multiyear tower. I think as of January, we're up to 52% of the towers now multiyear. That also smoothes out the volatility. 
And then we've been trimming exposure in areas where we don't feel like the risk/return tradeoff is attractive for true risk businesses like our -- the small commercial. And with that backdrop, we've been on a journey to become more credit-light. It's something we look at every year. We look at all of our businesses every year. The challenge with it, it's harder to see how the economics work with reinsurance, given where we're already buying down, too. So you need to come up with other structures. Those require a lot of earnings give up. And so it's not straightforward how you would actually do that and make sure that it was a good outcome for our shareholders.
The other way we've been addressing it is just growing the rest of our company. And so if you look at today our non-cat exposed businesses are now something like 75% of our earnings and growing much faster. And so over time, that's a dramatic shift in our exposure to whatever might happen with cat. So we'll certainly continue to work on it, but we feel like we've made great progress on it. And we're not going to do anything that isn't really positive for our shareholders."

We're playing a role in adjudicating claims, but the risk, there's no risk for us. So it's fee income, not significant to our earnings yet, but certainly an opportunity over time to grow and then leverage these relationships to drive some of our other products into those companies and their customers.

And we benefit from that mix shift in the short term. In terms of repairs and maybe an increased cost of repairs, for most of our auto business, we're administering the repairs for our clients. And the clients realize the benefit or the challenges of parts shortages. So at the end of the day, not really material to us. And as we mentioned earlier, we're seeing pretty strong momentum in the underlying growth of auto at the moment."

But we push very hard on digital, even pre COVID, which I think helped mitigate that. We mentioned earlier we are seeing still some depressed activity in Europe. So that's an opportunity.

Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the first quarter of 2021. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We will start today's call with brief remarks from Alan and Richard before moving into a Q&A session.
Some of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports.
During today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. As we continue to shift to a more fee income, capital-light business mix, we introduced adjusted EBITDA as part of our restated financial statement in April. This is another important financial metric for the company, reflective of our go-forward Global Lifestyle and Global Housing businesses. 
In addition, as of January 1, Global Preneed and the related entities included in the sale are considered discontinued operations and no longer included in our continuing operations, as reflected in the earnings press release and financial supplement.

Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our results for the first quarter. We delivered double-digit earnings growth driven by favorable non-catastrophe loss experience, including improved underwriting in Global Housing, as well as continued profitable growth in our Global Automotive, Multifamily Housing and Connected Living businesses. 
Once again, results demonstrated the attractiveness of our market-leading specialty P&C and lifestyle offerings distributed across multiple channels. This is in addition to the compelling growth opportunities emerging across mobile, auto and renters. Together, these businesses represent what we refer to as the Connected World. In 2020, our Connected World offerings represented 2/3 of our net operating income, excluding catastrophes and in combination with our specialty P&C businesses, will enable us to continue to expand our innovative offerings and deliver a superior and seamless customer experience. 
Generating over $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2020, our business portfolio is well positioned to sustain above-market growth and strong cash flows over time. And as we look ahead, we are continuously investing to bring innovation to market to build a more sustainable future for all of our stakeholders. To that end, we recently published our 2021 social responsibility report, highlighting the many ways we are delivering on our commitment as a purpose-driven company. 
We are continuing to advance our ESG efforts, specifically within our strategic focus areas of talent, products and climate. Further integrating ESG within our business operations will be critical as we look to create an even more diverse, equitable and inclusive culture that promotes innovation, enhances sustainability and minimizes our carbon footprint for the benefit of all stakeholders.
Recent notable examples include: We are increasing all U.S. hourly wages to at least $15 per hour by July, which supports the financial well-being of our employees. We've launched an assessment of our carbon footprint, including our investment portfolio and supply chain as a critical step to setting a future, long-term carbon emissions reduction goal. And we've further integrated sustainability into our offerings, such as rolling out electric vehicle products globally and extending the mobile device life cycle through trading services. With HYLA, we recently passed a significant milestone, repurposing our 100 millionth device. This has extended the life of devices, put billions of dollars back into consumers' hands and prevented additional e-waste from ending up in our landfills, supporting global sustainability.
We are pleased with our progress and are proud of the recognitions we have received, including our inclusion in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index and America's Best Employers for Diversity by Forbes as well as being awarded the Best Place to Work in several of the key markets we operate.
Sustainability and innovation go hand in hand. Recently, we surpassed $100 million invested through Assurant Ventures, our venture capital arm. This quarter, several high-quality investments in our portfolio announced SPAC transactions, including Cazoo, a fully digital U.K. car sales company; and SmartRent, a smart home automation provider. Given current attractive valuations, these investments have the potential to generate strong returns while also providing strategic insights that support our Connected World businesses, creating value-added partnerships and piloting new innovations. 
Now let me share some first quarter highlights for each of our operating segments. We continue to see strong growth in Global Lifestyle, increasing earnings by 7% year-over-year. Over the years, we continuously invested in mobile capabilities, such as same-day local repair or come-to-you repair for mobile devices, which provide another opportunity to drive value for our clients and the end consumer. 
Most recently in Connected Living, we've further strengthened our product capabilities and customer experience through the acquisition of TRYGLE in Japan. TRYGLE develops and operates a mobile phone app that allows consumers to manage the life cycle of their devices and centrally organizes digital product manuals for all connected products.
Collectively, all of our investments have helped lead to 15 new client program launches since 2015. This includes partnerships with several U.S. cable providers, including XFINITY and Spectrum, as well as large mobile carriers in Japan, like KDDI and Rakuten. 
Recently, we've expanded our global partnership with Samsung through the launch of Samsung Care+, a smartphone protection program, in Brazil and Mexico. We expect to further extend this partnership globally. We will continue to build on the strong momentum we have with our global, multiproduct and multichannel strategy, bolstered by the additional investments we are making.
As an example, HYLA Mobile added scale and technology capabilities to our global trade-in and upgrade business and has been performing even better than our initial expectations. We're now providing over 30 trading programs around the world. The acquisition positions us to benefit from favorable tailwinds in the global mobile market, including the upcoming 5G smartphone upgrade cycle and new client relationships. 
In Global Automotive, we continue to benefit from our scale and expertise as we now cover over 50 million vehicles. Already this year, we've seen a significant increase in auto production versus pre-pandemic first quarter levels. In the year since acquiring AFAS, we've combined our award-winning training programs to create the Automotive Training Academy by Assurant. Its expanded in-person and virtual programs will allow us to scale faster and adapt to the changing needs of dealers and automotive professionals. 
Within Global Financial Services, we've added a number of embedded card benefit clients recently, including the previously announced partnership with American Express. We look forward to enhancing these partnerships and building on our existing suite of products. 
Moving to Global Housing, net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophes, grew 17% as we benefited from favorable non-cat loss experience, including improved underwriting results. Within our lender-placed business, we continue to play a vital role in supporting the mortgage industry as we track over 31 million loans. The business remains well positioned, and we expect to benefit from investments in our superior customer platform over the long term. 
Multifamily Housing increased policies by 9% year-over-year to almost 2.5 million as we continue to grow through our affinity partnerships and PMC channel, including 7 of the top 10 largest PMCs in the U.S. 
We've also continued to grow our sharing economy offerings, which include car sharing, on-demand delivery and vacation rental. Over the last 2 years, through our partnership with market leaders in on-demand delivery, we tripled the number of deliveries we protect to over 1 billion deliveries. While it is too early to gauge whether the pandemic has fundamentally changed consumer demand for these services, we're encouraged by our momentum and the potential for future products and services in the gig economy.
Now let's move to our first quarter results and our 2021 outlook. Net operating income, excluding cats, grew by 13% to $182 million. And earnings per share increased 16% to $3.03, demonstrating improved results in Global Housing and continued momentum in Global Lifestyle. 
Given our strong performance in the first quarter and current business trends, we are increasing our full year outlook for 2021. We now expect 10% to 14% growth in operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophes, versus our initial expectation of 9% EPS growth. EPS expansion from the $9.88 in 2020 will be driven by high single-digit earnings growth, mainly from Global Lifestyle, and a lower corporate loss. Results will also benefit from share repurchases, including the completion of our 3-year $1.35 billion objective and the initial return of net proceeds from the Global Preneed sale. 
Our increased outlook largely reflects Global Housing's favorable non-catastrophe loss experience in the first quarter. As such, housing's earnings are expected to be down only modestly year-over-year from what was a strong 2020.
Looking at adjusted EBITDA, excluding catastrophes, the first quarter generated $302 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA will grow at a modestly higher rate than net operating income in 2021.
Turning to capital. We ended March with $332 million of holding company liquidity after returning $80 million to shareholders through common stock dividends and buybacks during the quarter, and we expect to deliver on all of our commitments, sustaining our strong track record of capital return. In addition, throughout the year, we will continue to make strategic investments in our portfolio to position us well for sustained, long-term growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review first quarter results and our 2021 outlook. Richard?"

As Alan noted, we are pleased with our first quarter performance as our results across Global Lifestyle and Global Housing remain strong. Before getting into first quarter performance, I want to provide a quick update on the sale of our preneed business. 
In March, we announced our plan to sell the business for $1.3 billion to CUNA Mutual Group. Since signing, we have completed the necessary regulatory filings, and we remain on track to close the transaction by the end of the third quarter. 
Now let's move to segment results for Global Lifestyle. This segment reported net operating income of $129 million in the first quarter, an increase of 7%, driven by Global Automotive and Connected Living. 
In Global Automotive, earnings increased $7 million or 18%. Results included a $4 million onetime benefit as well as a gain on investment income related to a specialty asset class from our TWG acquisition, which we don't expect to recur. Year-over-year, underlying performance was driven by another quarter of global organic growth from U.S. TPA and international OEMs as well as some favorable loss experience. 
Connected Living grew earnings by 3%. However, this was muted by a $7 million favorable client recoverable within extended service contracts in the prior year period. Underlying performance was driven by mobile subscriber growth in Asia Pacific and North America, higher trading results from increased seasonal volume and contributions from our HYLA acquisition.
For the quarter, lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA increased 11% to $193 million, 4 points above net operating income growth. This reflects the segment's increased amortization related to higher deal-related intangibles from more recent acquisitions in Global Automotive and Connected Living. IT depreciation expense also increased, stemming from higher investments. 
Lifestyle revenue decreased by $85 million. This was driven mainly by a $98 million reduction in mobile trading revenue, primarily due to the contract change we disclosed last year. Excluding this change, revenue for this segment was flat. For the full year, we continue to expect lifestyle revenues to be in line with last year at approximately $7.3 billion. 
As expected, overall trading volumes, which flow through fee income, increased year-over-year and sequentially. This was driven by 4 elements: new phone introductions last year, greater device availability, carrier promotions and contributions from HYLA. While the first quarter did benefit from strong mobile trading volumes, we do expect it to be a high watermark for the year given historical seasonal patterns. 
Since year-end, we've increased covered mobile devices by 600,000 subs, driven by continued growth in North America and Asia Pacific. This year, we continue to expect covered mobile devices to grow mid-single digits compared to 2020 as we grow subscribers in key geographies like the U.S. and Japan. As a reminder, we expect the growth rate of earnings to exceed the growth rate of covered mobile devices over time as we benefit from offering additional products and services to our clients and their end consumers. 
For 2021, we still expect Global Lifestyle's net operating income to grow in the high single digits, compared to the $437 million reported in 2020. Growth will come from all lines of business, particularly Connected Living. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment is expected to grow double digits year-over-year. 
Moving now to Global Housing. Net operating income for the first quarter totaled $67 million compared to $74 million in the first quarter of 2020. The decrease was largely due to $22 million of higher reportable catastrophes, mainly related to the extreme winter weather, particularly from areas like Texas. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings increased $50 million or 17%. More than 2/3 of the increase was from favorable non-cat loss experience, mainly in our specialty offerings, including sharing economy products. We estimate that approximately half of the favorable loss experience in the first quarter was from underwriting improvements, with the remainder of the benefit driven by favorable loss experience, which we don't expect to recur. 
In addition, we saw continued growth in Multifamily Housing. Lender-placed results were up modestly. Higher premium rates and favorable non-cat loss experience were mostly offset by decline in REO volumes from ongoing foreclosure moratoriums. Looking at the placement rate, the modest sequential increase to 1.6% was attributable to a shift in business mix and is not an indication of a broader macro housing market shift. 
Revenue decreased 2% related to a reduction in our specialty product offerings, which included the impact from the exit of small commercial as well as lower REO volumes. This decrease was partially offset by growth in Multifamily Housing, which grew 8% year-over-year, driven mainly by our affinity partners. 
We now expect Global Housing's net operating income, excluding cats, to be down modestly compared to 2020. This reflects our stronger first quarter and the assumption of a modest increase in our expected non-GAAP loss ratio to more normalized levels for the remainder of the year. We are also monitoring the REO foreclosure moratoriums and any additional extensions that may be announced. As we position for the future, we will continue investments in the business to sustain and enhance our competitive position. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $22 million, which was flat year-over-year. For the full year, we continue to expect the corporate net operating loss to improve to approximately $90 million as we eliminate enterprise support costs associated with Global Preneed. As we think about the remainder of the year, for all of Assurant, we are beginning to plan for a phased reentry of our workforce post COVID. And we are evaluating our real estate footprint to align with new business and employee needs as we adapt to the future of work. This may result in additional expenses throughout the year. 
I also wanted to provide a quick comment on our investment portfolio. With preneed moving to discontinued operations, our investment portfolio is now approximately $7.9 billion, excluding cash and cash equivalents. Given preneed's relatively longer average duration of around 10 years compared to the rest of our business, following the sale of preneed, our go-forward duration will drop to between 4.5 to 5 years. As a result, our interest rate sensitivity will be reduced by approximately 2/3.
Turning to holding company liquidity. We ended the first quarter with $332 million, which is $107 million above our current minimum target level. In the first quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $183 million. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also had outflows from 3 main items: $42 million of share repurchases; $43 million in common and preferred stock dividends; and $10 million mainly related to the acquisition of TRYGLE and Assurant Ventures investments.
Also, in January, we redeemed the remaining $50 million of our March 2021 notes. And our mandatory convertible shares converted to approximately 2.7 million common shares during the quarter. For the year overall, we continue to expect dividends to approximate segment earnings subject to the growth of the businesses and rating agency and regulatory capital considerations. We've now completed over 70% of our $1.35 billion capital return objective from 2019 to 2021 and remain confident that we will meet this objective by the end of this year.
In addition, we expect to begin incremental buybacks prior to closing the preneed transaction in the third quarter. The total buybacks associated with the net proceeds from the sale are expected to be returned within 1 year of the transaction close. In the second quarter through April 30, we repurchased an additional 95,000 shares for $14 million. 
In summary, our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business and our capital and liquidity position. We remain focused on completing the sale of Global Preneed and delivering on our 2021 financial objectives.

I think it's important when we talk about housing now, to start with it's a really good business that's performing well. You saw the very strong 2020, good start to this year. Over the last 5 or 6 years, we've really fine-tuned the lender-placed business. We're now in a good position if there is housing market weakness. So I think that's an important backdrop.
Now we have been taking many actions over the last few years to reduce volatility. So one of those was bringing retention down to $80 million per event. That has now made -- if we do have a severe cat season, it's not a business risk to the company at all. It's just a onetime kind of earnings impact. We've also done things like moving to a multiyear tower. I think as of January, we're up to 52% of the towers are now multiyear. That also smooths out the volatility. And then we've been trimming exposure in areas where we don't feel like the risk/return tradeoff is attractive for true risk businesses, like our exit of small commercial. 
And with that backdrop, we've been on a journey to become more credit-light. It's something we look at every year. We look at all of our businesses every year. The challenge with it, it's harder to see how the economics work with reinsurance, given where we're already buying down to. So you need to come up with other structures. Those require a lot of earnings give up. And so it's not straightforward how you would actually do that and make sure that it was a good outcome for our shareholders.
The other way we've been addressing it is just growing the rest of our company. And so if you look at today our non-cat exposed businesses are now something like 75% of our earnings and growing much faster. And so over time, that's a dramatic shift in our exposure to whatever might happen with cat. So we'll certainly continue to work on it, but we feel like we've made great progress on it. And we're not going to do anything that isn't really positive for our shareholders."

We're playing a role in adjudicating claims. But the risk, there's no risk for us. So it's fee income, not significant to our earnings yet, but certainly an opportunity over time to grow and then leverage these relationships to drive some of our other products into those companies and their customers.

We also just have embedded growth. If you think about our mobile programs and the 15 new programs that we've launched in the last 3 years or so, most of those are not mature. We also have embedded growth in our auto business with all those policies sold on new cars. They haven't started to earn yet. So I don't think from our business, we're going to see a significant impact just given how we're set out to perform whatever happens. But Richard, what would you say on the investment portfolio or other effects?"

And as Alan referred to the earlier comments, with the sale of preneed, our overall interest sensitivity is going down about 2/3. So our overall duration is going to be 4 to 4.5 to 5 years. 
Having said that, you know that today, our overall yield on the historic portfolio, if I can put it that way, is above current interest rates. So to the extent that current interest rates rise and the books rolling over the next 5 years, higher interest rates will actually be beneficial to us from that respect."

In terms of repairs and maybe increased cost of repairs, for most of our auto business, we're administering the repairs for our clients. And the clients realize the benefit -- or the challenges of parts shortages. So at the end of the day, not really material to us. And as we mentioned earlier, we're seeing pretty strong momentum in the underlying growth of auto at the moment."

And so with travel being very depressed, that obviously is an area that, as it rebounds, will have some link for us and benefit for us. 
In-store traffic has been lower. But we push very hard on digital, even pre-COVID, which I think helped mitigate that. We mentioned earlier we are seeing still some depressed activity in Europe. So that's an opportunity. 
But I think I wouldn't look at -- we were that impacted by COVID in terms of what was happening. And so therefore, growth in the economy is obviously a positive. People buy things. That gives us new chances to attach and sale. But as I mentioned earlier, we feel confident whatever happens in the external environment that we're going to grow and outperform."

Good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our second quarter results. Our performance so far this year across our Global Lifestyle and Global Housing businesses demonstrates the power of our strategy to support consumers connected lifestyle and continues to give us strong confidence in the future growth prospects for Assurant. 
Prior to reviewing our progress against our 2021 financial objectives, I wanted to take a moment to express my deep gratitude to our employees around the world, specifically for their continued dedication and support for all of Assurant's stakeholders during my tenure as CEO and especially over the last 18 months of the pandemic. Our talent is a great enabler of our company's growth and progress, and Keith Demmings' appointment as my successor is evidence of that. With a 25-year-long career with the company, Keith has a clear track record of success and personifies the values and integrity that are emblematic of Assurant's culture and he's a natural choice as our next CEO. His deep operational experience and strong engagement with clients has been instrumental in guiding Assurant's growth across the enterprise. As CEO, Keith will drive innovation through our connected world and Specialty P&C businesses. 
The completion of the sale of Global Preneed to CUNA Mutual Group marks another important milestone for Assurant as it enables our organization to further deepen our focus on our market-leading lifestyle and housing businesses. I would like to thank all of our former Preneed employees who have transitioned to CUNA Mutual Group for their tremendous support to Assurant and our clients and policyholders. 
As we look to the convergence of the connected mobile device, car and home, we believe our Connected Living, Global Automotive and Multifamily Housing businesses will continue their compelling history of strong growth into the future. Not only do our Connected World businesses have a history of profitable growth, more than tripling earnings over the last 5 years, we're also characterized by partnerships with leading global brands, broad multichannel distribution that provides consumers with choice, value and exceptional service and a track record of innovative offerings that have become industry standards. ESG is core to our strategy, and sure we'll build a more sustainable Assurant for all of our stakeholders focusing on talent, products and climate. 
During the quarter, we continued to advance our ESG efforts as we work to create an even more diverse, equitable and inclusive culture that promotes innovation, enhances sustainability and minimizes our carbon footprint. We recently completed our 2021 CDP climate survey, our sixth annual screen submission, expanding this year to include Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions across several categories. The CDP survey is an important climate change assessment, which many of our key stakeholders rely on each year. Our efforts have led to recognition that we're proud of. 
During the quarter, Assurant was recognized as a 2021 honoree of the Civic 50 by Points of Light, distinguishing Assurant as 1 of the 50 most community-minded companies in the U.S. We are proud of our progress and believe the future of Assurant is bright. Together, lifestyle and housing should continue to drive above-market growth and superior cash flow generation with the ability to outperform in a wide spectrum of economic scenarios and ultimately, continue to create greater shareholder value over time. 
Year-to-date, excluding reportable catastrophes, net operating income per share was $6.02, up 14% from the first half of last year and net operating income was $366 million, an increase of 13%. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 12% to $600 million. These results support our full year outlook of 10% to 14% growth in net operating income per share, excluding affordable catastrophes. While we expect earnings growth in the second half on a year-over-year basis, our outlook for the full year assumes a decline in earnings from the first half, reflecting increased investments to support long-term growth in our Connected World businesses, lower investment income and increased corporate and other expenses due to timing of spending. 
Turning to capital. From 2019 through June of this year, we've returned to shareholders over 88% or almost $1.2 billion of our 3-year $1.35 billion objective. In July, we repurchased an additional 737,000 shares for $115 million and declared our quarterly common stock dividend for the third quarter, essentially completing our objective when paid. In addition to completing this objective, we expect to return $900 million in net proceeds from the sale of Global Preneed within the next 12 months, and therefore, expect buybacks to continue at a higher-than-usual level throughout the remainder of the year and into 2022. 
I'll now turn the call over to Keith to review our key Connected World highlights for the quarter. Keith?"

I wanted to begin by expressing my thanks to Alan for his steadfast leadership and the successful transformation of Assurant since becoming CEO at the beginning of 2015. Through his strategic vision and intense focus on the evolving needs of our clients and end consumers, Alan and our team have solidified market-leading positions in our Connected World and Specialty P&C businesses, helped Assurant establish a strong growth, capital-light service-oriented business model where our Connected World offerings now comprise approximately 2/3 of our segment earnings and ultimately, work together to unlock the power of our Fortune 300 organization, prioritizing resources against initiatives with the highest growth potential and standing up key enterprise capabilities and functions, which we can now leverage across our growing client and customer base. 
As a result, Assurant is on track to deliver our fifth consecutive year of strong profitable growth. As I continue to work closely with Alan over the coming months, I'm also engaging with many of our key stakeholders, including shareholders and analysts, who have shared valuable perspectives as we define our multiyear plan. As I identify key focus areas, I will prioritize developing and recruiting top talent, investing strategically to sustain and accelerate growth through product innovation and new distribution models, differentiating us further from our competition through continuous improvement in our customer service delivery and supporting the investment community in better understanding our portfolio as we look to drive further value creation. Our long-term goal will continue to be to deliver sustained growth and value to all of our stakeholders. Our ability to deliver on these ambitions will require additional innovation and investments to ultimately provide a superior customer experience and deepen our client relationships. 
Innovation will continue to be a key differentiator for Assurant, especially as we evolve with the convergence of the connected consumer. As part of our ongoing commitment to delivering a superior customer experience with a range of service delivery options, we'll be further building out our same-day service and repair capabilities for which there is growing demand. This requires upfront investments, which we expect to accelerate in the second half of this year as we look to provide additional choice and convenience for the end consumer. These investments are critical to sustain our competitive advantage in markets like the U.S. As we look to continue our culture of innovation, you may have seen we recently announced 2 key leadership changes to support those efforts. 
Manny Becerra, a 31-year veteran of Assurant, who is instrumental in driving the growth of our mobile business, was appointed to the newly created role of Chief Innovation Officer. Given his many contributions to our success, including the development of our mobile protection and trade-in and upgrade business, he will bring dedicated resources to accelerate innovation across the enterprise to capitalize on the rapid convergence across our home, automotive and mobile products. Biju Nair will now lead our Connected Living business as its President. His strong track record of delivering profitable growth and client service excellence combined with his depth of experience, particularly as the former CEO of Hyla Mobile makes him the perfect choice. 
A prime example of how innovation has allowed us to deepen and expand client relationships as well as create new revenue streams is our long-standing partnership with T-Mobile. Over the past 8 years, we have worked together to offer their customers innovative device protection, trade-in and upgrade programs while further developing our supply chain services to support their mobile ecosystem. We are happy to announce that T-Mobile has extended our partnership as their device protection provider. While we are currently finalizing contract terms, we are excited about the multiyear extension of our relationship and our ability to continue to expand our services to deliver a superior customer experience. In addition to our innovation efforts,  our investments over the past several years have supported our growth through the success of new and strengthened client relationships. After an initial investment in 2017, this quarter, we purchased the remainder of Olivar, a provider of mobile device life cycle management and asset disposition services in South Korea. While small in size, this acquisition enhances our global asset disposition capabilities and deepens our footprint in the Asia Pacific region, while complementing the recent acquisitions of Alegre in Australia and Hyla Mobile. These investments have enhanced our technology, operational capabilities and partnerships in the trade-in and upgrade market, positioning us to capitalize on the 5G upgrade cycle over the next several years. 
While later this year, the growing availability of 5G smartphones, combined with trade-in promotions, demonstrate increasing momentum for the upgrade cycle. For carriers, retailers, OEMs and cable operators, 5G offers an opportunity to drive additional revenue and gain market share. Strong trade-in and upgrade promotions have also led to higher trade-in volumes for Assurant as well as higher Net Promoter Scores and net subscriber growth within our client base. Our focus on our client relationships, combined with our willingness to innovate to enhance the end consumer experience, continues to create momentum for our businesses. Over the last few months, we have delivered several new partnerships and renewals throughout the enterprise, including the renewal of 2 key European mobile clients, representing 700,000 subscribers; renewal of 8 global automotive partnerships, representing over 10 million policies across our distribution channels; renewal of 3 Multifamily Housing property management companies, including 2 of the largest in the U.S. as we continue to grow the rollout of our Cover360 product; renewal of 3 clients and 2 new partnerships in lender-placed as we provide critical support for the U.S. mortgage market. 
In summary, I am very excited to lead our 14,000 employees into the future and build on the tremendous momentum created under Alan's leadership. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review the second quarter results and our 2021 outlook. Richard?"
4026111,1673196987,2362223,"Assurant, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our second quarter performance, especially when compared to our strong results last year. For the quarter, we reported net operating income per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, of $2.99",1513,"Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our second quarter performance, especially when compared to our strong results last year. For the quarter, we reported net operating income per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, of $2.99, up 12% from the prior year period. Excluding GAAP's net operating income for the quarter, totaled $184 million. And adjusted EBITDA amounted to $298 million, a year-over-year increase of 12% and 10% respectively.
Our performance across Lifestyle and Housing remains strong, and we also benefited from a lower corporate loss and higher investment income, primarily related to the sale of a real estate joint venture partnership. 
Now let's move to segment results, starting with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported net operating income of $124 million in the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 2%. This was driven by growth in Global Automotive and more favorable experience in Global Financial Services. 
Earnings increased $7 million or 16% from continued strong year-over-year growth related to our U.S. clients across various distribution channels. Results within auto also included a $4 million increase from the sale of a real estate joint venture partnership. Absent this gain, investment income in auto was down. Connected Living earnings decreased by $9 million compared to a strong prior year period. The decline was primarily driven by less favorable loss experience in our extended service contract business. Mobile earnings were modestly lower. The less favorable loss experience in service contracts in mobile was primarily related to our European and Latin American businesses. These regions benefited from lower claims activity in the prior year period due to the pandemic. 
Our underlying mobile business continued to grow in North America and Asia Pacific from enrollment increases at mobile carriers and cable operators with an increase of over 1 million covered devices in the last year. In addition, contributions from acquisitions such as Hyla Mobile benefited results. 
For the quarter, Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA increased 6% to $186 million. This reflects the segment's increased amortization related to higher deal-related intangibles for more recent transactions in mobile and Global Automotive. 
IT depreciation expense also increased, stemming from higher investments. As we look at revenues, Lifestyle increased by $169 million or 10%. This was driven mainly by continued growth in Global Automotive and Connected Living. Within Global Automotive, revenue increased 13%, reflecting strong prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. 
Industry auto sales continued to increase during the quarter, with April seeing record levels in the U.S. This was reflected in our net written premiums of roughly $1.3 billion in the quarter, the highest quarter ever recorded. 
Connected Living revenues were 7% for the quarter. In addition to growth in service contracts, mobile fee income was driven by strong trading volumes, including contributions from Hyla. For the full year, Lifestyle revenues are expected to increase modestly compared to last year's Auto and Connected Living growth. We continue to expect covered mobile devices to grow mid-single digits in 2021 as we increase subscribers in key geographies like the U.S. and Japan. This also reflects a reduction of 750,000 mobile subscribers related to a European banking program that moved to another provider in the second quarter. As we previously outlined, this is not expected to significantly impact our profitability. 
For 2021, we still expect Global Lifestyle's net operating income to grow in the high single digits compared to the $437 million reported in 2020. While we expect earnings growth year-over-year for the second half, earnings in the second half of the year are expected to be lower compared to the strong first half performance, primarily due to 2 items:
First, investments will increase across Connected Living in the second half of the year, including our same-day service and repair capabilities. While these investments will mute earnings growth in the short term, they are expected to generate growth over the long term. And second, the investment income will be lower as we are not expecting gains from real estate joint venture partnerships that benefited the second quarter in auto. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the segment is still expected to grow double digits year-over-year at a faster pace than segment net operating income. 
Moving now to Global Housing. Net operating income for the quarter totaled $94 million compared to $85 million in the second quarter of 2020 due to $10 million of lower reportable catastrophes. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings were relatively flat as growth within lender-placed and higher investment income was offset by the expected increase in non-cat loss experience across all lines of business. Investment income included a $4 million increase from the sale of a real estate joint venture referenced earlier. 
Regarding the non-cat loss ratio, the second quarter of 2020 benefited from unusually low non-cat losses, including impacts from the pandemic. As anticipated, we saw an increase in the frequency and severity of claims in the second quarter. We also increased reserves related to the cost of settling runoff claims within our small commercial book. 
In Multifamily Housing, underlying growth was offset by increased investments to further strengthen our customer experience, including our digital-first capabilities. Within lender-placed, higher revenues and investment income were partially offset by unfavorable non-cat loss experience and declining REO volumes from ongoing foreclosure moratoriums. Looking at loans-tacked, the $1.5 million sequential loan 
decline was mainly attributable to a client portfolio that rolled off in the second quarter. However, the decline in loans-tracked, that should be partially offset by 2 new client partnerships in the quarter, which should enable us to onboard approximately 700,000 loans by year-end. 
We also continued to reduce risk within housing. At the end of June, we completed our 2021 catastrophe reinsurance program. To mitigate multi-event risk, we added a flexible limit that can be used to reduce our retention from $80 million to $55 million in certain second and third events or increase the top of the tower of $50 million in excess of $950 million in the rare case of a 1 in 174-year event. We also increased our multiyear coverage to over 50% of our U.S. tower. 
In terms of revenue, Global Housing's revenue increased 5%, primarily due to double-digit growth in Multifamily Housing as well as higher revenue in lender-placed, including higher premium rates and average insured values. As a result of the strong first half, we now expect Global Housing net operating income, excluding cat, to be flat compared to the $371 million in 2020. This is above our initial expectations that earnings would be down this year. Earnings in the second half are expected to be lower than the first half of the year, primarily related to 3 items: first, lower net investment income, particularly considering the real estate joint venture gain in the second quarter; second, lower results in our specialty P&C offerings after a strong first half; and third, continued investments in the business, particularly in Multifamily Housing to sustain and enhance our competitive position. We also continue to monitor the REO foreclosure moratoriums and any additional extensions that we announced. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $12 million compared to $29 million in the second quarter of 2020. This was driven by 2 items: First, lower employee-related expenses and third-party fees, which we expect to increase in the second half of the year. And second, we had $6 million of favorable onetime items, including a tax benefit and income from the sale of the real estate joint venture partnership. We also anticipate higher spending in the second half of the year compared to the first half due to an increase in recruiting and moderate travel and related expenses as we expect to begin a phased reentry of our workforce. In addition, third-party expenses are expected to increase due to acceleration and timing of investments. For the full year 2021, we now expect the corporate net operating loss to be approximately $85 million. This compares to our previous estimate of $90 million. 
Turning to holding company liquidity. We ended the second quarter with $353 million, which is $128 million above our current minimum target level. This excludes both the $1.2 billion in net proceeds from the sale of Preneed and the net proceeds from the second quarter debt offering, which were used for the July redemption of senior notes due in 2023. In the second quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $243 million. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also had outflows from 3 main items: $191 million of share repurchases, $42 million in common stock dividends and $17 million mainly related to mobile acquisitions, including Olivar and Assurant Venture investments. For the overall year, we continue to expect dividends to approximate segment earnings, subject to the growth of the businesses, rating agency and regulatory capital requirements, investment portfolio performance and any impact from a potential change in corporate U.S. tax rates. 
In summary, our strong performance for the first half of the year positions us nicely to meet our full year financial commitments while continuing to invest in our long-term growth.

We mentioned earlier, we're still negotiating the final details of the agreement. So more to come as we lock down some of the moving parts. In terms of economics, I'd probably make 2 points. First, I'd say that it's not uncommon for us to forgo some economics when we recontract with major clients. We recontract obviously, quite regularly, often think about the broader long-term potential of the relationships. The potential for additional volume and for offering new products and services over time. Specifically with respect to T-Mobile, given that the relationship continues to scale with significant volume from Sprint, we do expect to achieve lower per unit economics, but we expect that to be offset by significant volume growth and economies of scale within the overall programs. I would also say that we're well positioned as partners to help them introduce new products and services over time. We've had a great track record of expanding the services we provide over the last 8 years to continue to evolve to serve the consumer. And finally, I'd point out from a mobile perspective, we really are excited about our overall long-term potential to compete in this market across the value chain and from an efficiency point of view."

And if the market weakens, we will benefit and grow over time. So in terms of moratoriums and when they come off, if and when they do come off, we will see the impact with a lag. So even if they came off today broadly, which is -- there's still a lot to work through there and there'll be modifications and other things that will happen. We don't expect anything to happen in our placement rate this year, and where we could see an impact is when you get into 2022 and beyond. But I think the important takeaway on lender-placed is, we're still a clear market leader with a strong commitment to customer and client experience. And we will be there to partner with the world's leading U.S. as leading banks, if and when the housing market weakens."

So let me just clarify first the 2 buckets where we're making the investments or at least the most significant investments. So first we talked about is around same-day service and repair, this has been -- become a really important component of our value proposition. It's become more critical in the market demanded by clients, demanded by consumers and really improve the overall service experience. So we are going to be accelerating investments in the second half in terms of leadership personnel, in terms of technology and equipment. We're also working very hard to integrate our service delivery options seamlessly into the claims experience to really create a more dynamic claims process to give customers a better choice and options. That's, I think, critically important strategically for us. And I think we've got great advantages there today. So we're trying to accelerate those advantages in the market. That will drive revenue as we think about moving into 2022. We see this as a important opportunity to expand services with existing clients and also expand with new clients. 
In terms of the second bucket, I would say, operational investments that are focused on really the entire enterprise between both Housing and Lifestyle, investing more heavily in digital capabilities, self-service and automation. Think about things like digital sales and self-service portals, investing in our customer-facing applications integrating our communication channels, automating decisions around claims to make the process more efficient and more repeatable and then automating back-office tasks. We've got a fairly large project going across multiple lines of business and multiple geographies. And that will generate cost efficiency over time. But more than anything, it will create a much more seamless customer experience and I think make us that much more competitive in the market."

But essentially, what we did is we bought a -- what we call a second and third cover. So if ever we have an event that goes up into our retention -- past our retention on a second and third event, we actually go and reduce the retention down to $55 million from $80 million or if we didn't use that and there was a major event, it would help us at the top of the tower, too. So that will add a little bit, but it's a modest increase in our overall placement. And we were actually pleased to see that every year when we go to the market, we have a stable list of reinsurers that follow us. Think about 40 carriers being A- or better. And we are able to place our reinsurance on a kind of a like-for-like basis without this new feature I talked about at a little bit below where the market is. So we're really proud of what we've done with cat. And I guess the last thing I would say is the cat exposure that we have today is less than we had in previous years given how we've been working on our cat exposure overall, but also the growth in our other businesses, Multifamily Housing, Global, Auto, Connected Living. 
So one of the things we mentioned in our press release earlier this year that, for example, in a 1 in 50-year event, back in 2017, we would have kept 40% of our earnings. Now in a 1 in 50-year event, we retained 70% of those earnings.

Good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our second quarter results. Our performance so far this year across our Global Lifestyle and Global Housing businesses demonstrates the power of our strategy to support consumers connected lifestyle and continues to give us strong confidence in the future growth prospects for Assurant. 
Prior to reviewing our progress against our 2021 financial objectives, I wanted to take a moment to express my deep gratitude to our employees around the world, specifically for their continued dedication and support for all of Assurant's stakeholders during my tenure as CEO and especially over the last 18 months of the pandemic. Our talent is a great enabler of our company's growth and progress, and Keith Demmings' appointment as my successor is evidence of that. With a 25-year-long career with the company, Keith has a clear track record of success and personifies the values and integrity that are emblematic of Assurant's culture and he's a natural choice as our next CEO. His deep operational experience and strong engagement with clients has been instrumental in guiding Assurant's growth across the enterprise. As CEO, Keith will drive innovation through our connected world and Specialty P&C businesses. 
The completion of the sale of Global Preneed to CUNA Mutual Group marks another important milestone for Assurant as it enables our organization to further deepen our focus on our market-leading lifestyle and housing businesses. I would like to thank all of our former Preneed employees who have transitioned to CUNA Mutual Group for their tremendous support to Assurant and our clients and policyholders. 
As we look to the convergence of the connected mobile device, car and home, we believe our Connected Living, Global Automotive and Multifamily Housing businesses will continue their compelling history of strong growth into the future. Not only do our Connected World businesses have a history of profitable growth, more than tripling earnings over the last 5 years, we're also characterized by partnerships with leading global brands, broad multichannel distribution that provides consumers with choice, value and exceptional service and a track record of innovative offerings that have become industry standards. ESG is core to our strategy and sure we'll build a more sustainable Assurant for all of our stakeholders focusing on talent, products and climate. 
During the quarter, we continued to advance our ESG efforts as we work to create an even more diverse, equitable and inclusive culture that promotes innovation, enhances sustainability and minimizes our carbon footprint. We recently completed our 2021 CDP climate survey, our sixth annual scoring submission, expanding this year to include Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions across several categories. The CDP survey is an important climate change assessment, which many of our key stakeholders rely on each year. Our efforts have led to recognition that we're proud of. 
During the quarter, Assurant was recognized as a 2021 honoree of the Civic 50 by Points of Light, distinguishing Assurant as one of the 50 most community-minded companies in the U.S. We are proud of our progress and believe the future of Assurant is bright. Together, lifestyle and housing should continue to drive above-market growth and superior cash flow generation, with the ability to outperform in a wide spectrum of economic scenarios and ultimately, continue to create greater shareholder value over time. 
Year-to-date, excluding reportable catastrophes, net operating income per share was $6.02, up 14% from the first half of last year and net operating income was $366 million, an increase of 13%. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 12% to $600 million. These results support our full year outlook of 10% to 14% growth in net operating income per share, excluding affordable catastrophes. While we expect earnings growth in the second half on a year-over-year basis, our outlook for the full year assumes a decline in earnings from the first half, reflecting increased investments to support long-term growth in our Connected World businesses, lower investment income and increased corporate and other expenses due to timing of spending. 
Turning to capital. From 2019 through June of this year, we've returned to shareholders over 88% or almost $1.2 billion of our 3-year $1.35 billion objective. In July, we repurchased an additional 737,000 shares for $115 million and declared our quarterly common stock dividend for the third quarter, essentially completing our objective when paid. In addition to completing this objective, we expect to return $900 million in net proceeds from the sale of Global Preneed within the next 12 months, and therefore, expect buybacks to continue at a higher-than-usual level throughout the remainder of the year and into 2022. 
I'll now turn the call over to Keith to review our key Connected World highlights for the quarter. Keith?"

As I continue to work closely with Alan over the coming months, I'm also engaging with many of our key stakeholders, including shareholders and analysts, who have shared valuable perspectives as we define our multiyear plan. As I identify key focus areas, I will prioritize developing and recruiting top talent, investing strategically to sustain and accelerate growth through product innovation and new distribution models, differentiating us further from our competition through continuous improvement in our customer service delivery and supporting the investment community in better understanding our portfolio as we look to drive further value creation. Our long-term goal will continue to be to deliver sustained growth and value to all of our stakeholders. Our ability to deliver on these ambitions will require additional innovation and investments to ultimately provide a superior customer experience and deepen our client relationships. 
Innovation will continue to be a key differentiator for Assurant, especially as we evolve with the convergence of the connected consumer. As part of our ongoing commitment to delivering a superior customer experience with a range of service delivery options, we'll be further building out our same-day service and repair capabilities for which there is growing demand. This requires upfront investments, which we expect to accelerate in the second half of this year as we look to provide additional choice and convenience for the end consumer. These investments are critical to sustain our competitive advantage in markets like the U.S. 
As we look to continue our culture of innovation, you may have seen we recently announced 2 key leadership changes to support those efforts. Manny Becerra, a 31-year veteran of Assurant, who is instrumental in driving the growth of our mobile business, was appointed to the newly created role of Chief Innovation Officer. Given his many contributions to our success, including the development of our mobile protection and trade-in and upgrade business, he will bring dedicated resources to accelerate innovation across the enterprise to capitalize on the rapid convergence across our home, automotive and mobile products. 
Biju Nair will now lead our Connected Living business as its President. His strong track record of delivering profitable growth and client service excellence combined with his depth of experience, particularly as the former CEO of Hyla Mobile makes him the perfect choice. 
A prime example of how innovation has allowed us to deepen and expand client relationships as well as create new revenue streams is our long-standing partnership with T-Mobile. Over the past 8 years, we have worked together to offer their customers innovative device protection, trade-in and upgrade programs while further developing our supply chain services to support their mobile ecosystem. We are happy to announce that T-Mobile has extended our partnership as their device protection provider. While we are currently finalizing contract terms, we are excited about the multiyear extension of our relationship and our ability to continue to expand our services to deliver a superior customer experience. 
In addition to our innovation efforts, our investments over the past several years have supported our growth through the success of new and strengthened client relationships. After an initial investment in 2017, this quarter, we purchased the remainder of Olivar, a provider of mobile device life cycle management and asset disposition services in South Korea. While small in size, this acquisition enhances our global asset disposition capabilities and deepens our footprint in the Asia Pacific region while complementing the recent acquisitions of Alegre in Australia and Hyla Mobile. These investments have enhanced our technology, operational capabilities and partnerships in the trade-in and upgrade market, positioning us to capitalize on the 5G upgrade cycle over the next several years. 
While later this year, the growing availability of 5G smartphones, combined with trade-in promotions, demonstrate increasing momentum for the upgrade cycle. For carriers, retailers, OEMs and cable operators, 5G offers an opportunity to drive additional revenue and gain market share. Strong trade-in and upgrade promotions have also led to higher trade-in volumes for Assurant as well as higher Net Promoter Scores and net subscriber growth within our client base. Our focus on our client relationships, combined with our willingness to innovate to enhance the end consumer experience, continues to create momentum for our businesses. 
Over the last few months, we have delivered several new partnerships and renewals throughout the enterprise, including the renewal of 2 key European mobile clients, representing 700,000 subscribers; renewal of 8 global automotive partnerships, representing over 10 million policies across our distribution channels; renewal of 3 Multifamily Housing property management companies, including 2 of the largest in the U.S. as we continue to grow the rollout of our Cover360 product; renewal of 3 clients and 2 new partnerships in lender-placed as we provide critical support for the U.S. mortgage market. 
In summary, I am very excited to lead our 14,000 employees into the future and build on the tremendous momentum created under Alan's leadership. 
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review the second quarter results and our 2021 outlook. Richard?"
4026111,1673196987,2362607,"Assurant, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our second quarter performance, especially when compared to our strong results last year. For the quarter, we reported net operating income per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, of $2.99",1521,"Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our second quarter performance, especially when compared to our strong results last year. For the quarter, we reported net operating income per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, of $2.99, up 12% from the prior year period. Excluding GAAP's net operating income for the quarter, totaled $184 million. And adjusted EBITDA amounted to $298 million, a year-over-year increase of 12% and 10% respectively.
Our performance across Lifestyle and Housing remains strong, and we also benefited from a lower corporate loss and higher investment income, primarily related to the sale of a real estate joint venture partnership. 
Now let's move to segment results, starting with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported net operating income of $124 million in the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 2%. This was driven by growth in Global Automotive and more favorable experience in Global Financial Services. 
Earnings increased $7 million or 16% from continued strong year-over-year growth related to our U.S. clients across various distribution channels. Results within auto also included a $4 million increase from the sale of a real estate joint venture partnership. Absent this gain, investment income in auto was down. Connected Living earnings decreased by $9 million compared to a strong prior year period. The decline was primarily driven by less favorable loss experience in our extended service contract business. Mobile earnings were modestly lower. The less favorable loss experience in service contracts in mobile was primarily related to our European and Latin American businesses. These regions benefited from lower claims activity in the prior year period due to the pandemic. 
Our underlying mobile business continued to grow in North America and Asia Pacific from enrollment increases at mobile carriers and cable operators with an increase of over 1 million covered devices in the last year. In addition, contributions from acquisitions such as Hyla Mobile benefited results. 
For the quarter, Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA increased 6% to $186 million. This reflects the segment's increased amortization related to higher deal-related intangibles for more recent transactions in mobile and Global Automotive. 
IT depreciation expense also increased, stemming from higher investments. As we look at revenues, Lifestyle increased by $169 million or 10%. This was driven mainly by continued growth in Global Automotive and Connected Living. Within Global Automotive, revenue increased 13%, reflecting strong prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. 
Industry auto sales continued to increase during the quarter, with April seeing record levels in the U.S. This was reflected in our net written premiums of roughly $1.3 billion in the quarter, the highest quarter ever recorded. 
Connected Living revenues were 7% for the quarter. In addition to growth in service contracts, mobile fee income was driven by strong trading volumes, including contributions from Hyla. For the full year, Lifestyle revenues are expected to increase modestly compared to last year's $7.3 billion, mainly driven by year-to-date Global Auto and Connected Living growth. We continue to expect covered mobile devices to grow mid-single digits in 2021 as we increase subscribers in key geographies like the U.S. and Japan. This also reflects a reduction of 750,000 mobile subscribers related to a European banking program that moved to another provider in the second quarter. As we previously outlined, this is not expected to significantly impact our profitability. 
For 2021, we still expect Global Lifestyle's net operating income to grow in the high single digits compared to the $437 million reported in 2020. While we expect earnings growth year-over-year for the second half, earnings in the second half of the year are expected to be lower compared to the strong first half performance, primarily due to 2 items: First, investments will increase across Connected Living in the second half of the year, including our same-day service and repair capabilities. While these investments will mute earnings growth in the short term, they are expected to generate growth over the long term. And second, the investment income will be lower as we are not expecting gains from real estate joint venture partnerships that benefited the second quarter in auto. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the segment is still expected to grow double digits year-over-year at a faster pace than segment net operating income. 
Moving now to Global Housing. Net operating income for the quarter totaled $94 million compared to $85 million in the second quarter of 2020 due to $10 million of lower reportable catastrophes. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings were relatively flat as growth within lender-placed and higher investment income was offset by the expected increase in non-cat loss experience across all lines of business. Investment income included a $4 million increase from the sale of a real estate joint venture referenced earlier. 
Regarding the non-cat loss ratio, the second quarter of 2020 benefited from unusually low non-cat losses, including impacts from the pandemic. As anticipated, we saw an increase in the frequency and severity of claims in the second quarter. We also increased reserves related to the cost of settling runoff claims within our small commercial book. 
In Multifamily Housing, underlying growth was offset by increased investments to further strengthen our customer experience, including our digital-first capabilities. Within lender-placed, higher revenues and investment income were partially offset by unfavorable non-cat loss experience and declining REO volumes from ongoing foreclosure moratoriums. Looking at loans-tracked, the $1.5 million sequential loan decline was mainly attributable to a client portfolio that rolled off in the second quarter. However, the decline in loans-tracked, that should be partially offset by 2 new client partnerships in the quarter, which should enable us to onboard approximately 700,000 loans by year-end. 
We also continued to reduce risk within housing. At the end of June, we completed our 2021 catastrophe reinsurance program. To mitigate multi-event risk, we added a flexible limit that can be used to reduce our retention from $80 million to $55 million in certain second and third events or increase the top of the tower of $50 million in excess of $950 million in the rare case of a one in 174-year event. We also increased our multiyear coverage to over 50% of our U.S. tower. 
In terms of revenue, Global Housing's revenue increased 5%, primarily due to double-digit growth in Multifamily Housing as well as higher revenue in lender-placed, including higher premium rates and average insured values. As a result of the strong first half, we now expect Global Housing's net operating income, excluding cat, to be flat compared to the $371 million in 2020. This is above our initial expectations that earnings would be down this year. Earnings in the second half are expected to be lower than the first half of the year, primarily related to 3 items: first, lower net investment income, particularly considering the real estate joint venture gain in the second quarter; second, lower results in our specialty P&C offerings after a strong first half; and third, continued investments in the business, particularly in Multifamily Housing to sustain and enhance our competitive position. We also continue to monitor the REO foreclosure moratoriums and any additional extensions that may be announced. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $12 million compared to $29 million in the second quarter of 2020. This was driven by 2 items: First, lower employee-related expenses and third-party fees, which we expect to increase in the second half of the year. And second, we had $6 million of favorable onetime items, including a tax benefit and income from the sale of the real estate joint venture partnership. We also anticipate higher spending in the second half of the year compared to the first half due to an increase in recruiting and moderate travel and related expenses as we expect to begin a phased reentry of our workforce. In addition, third-party expenses are expected to increase due to acceleration and timing of investments. For the full year 2021, we now expect the corporate net operating loss to be approximately $85 million. This compares to our previous estimate of $90 million. 
Turning to holding company liquidity. We ended the second quarter with $353 million, which is $128 million above our current minimum target level. This excludes both the $1.2 billion in net proceeds from the sale of Preneed and the net proceeds from the second quarter debt offering, which were used for the July redemption of senior notes due in 2023. In the second quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $243 million. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also had outflows from 3 main items: $191 million of share repurchases, $42 million in common stock dividends and $17 million mainly related to mobile acquisitions, including Olivar and Assurant Venture investments. 
For the overall year, we continue to expect dividends to approximate segment earnings, subject to the growth of the businesses, rating agency and regulatory capital requirements, investment portfolio performance and any impact from a potential change in corporate U.S. tax rates. 
In summary, our strong performance for the first half of the year positions us nicely to meet our full year financial commitments while continuing to invest in our long-term growth.

We mentioned earlier, we're still negotiating the final details of the agreement. So more to come as we lock down some of the moving parts. In terms of economics, I'd probably make 2 points. First, I'd say that it's not uncommon for us to forgo some economics when we recontract with major clients. We recontract obviously, quite regularly, often think about the broader long-term potential of the relationships. The potential for additional volume and for offering new products and services over time. 
Specifically with respect to T-Mobile, given that the relationship continues to scale with significant volume from Sprint, we do expect to achieve lower per unit economics, but we expect that to be offset by significant volume growth and economies of scale within the overall programs. I would also say that we're well-positioned as partners to help them introduce new products and services over time. We've had a great track record of expanding the services we provide over the last 8 years to continue to evolve to serve the consumer.

So our new and used mix is normally around 50-50 or maybe 53% used today. Used tends to have slightly higher attach rates. Obviously, it earns a little bit quicker. We've seen our clients taking share through consolidation. We've seen clients expanding their used car operations, rolling out strong digital brands. So there's a lot of growth, I would say, within our core client base. And then certainly, we've added some new clients as well. But strong car sales, large clients that are gaining share and then winning some new deals in the market."

So let me just clarify first the 2 buckets where we're making the investments or at least the most significant investments. So first we talked about is around same-day service and repair, this has been -- become a really important component of our value proposition. It's become more critical in the market demanded by clients, demanded by consumers and really improve the overall service experience. So we are going to be accelerating investments in the second half in terms of leadership personnel, in terms of technology and equipment. We're also working very hard to integrate our service delivery options seamlessly into the claims experience to really create a more dynamic claims process to give customers a better choice and options. 
That's, I think, critically important strategically for us. And I think we've got great advantages there today. So we're trying to accelerate those advantages in the market. That will drive revenue as we think about moving into 2022. We see this as a important opportunity to expand services with existing clients and also expand with new clients. 
In terms of the second bucket, I would say, operational investments that are focused on really the entire enterprise between both Housing and Lifestyle, investing more heavily in digital capabilities, self-service and automation. Think about things like digital sales and self-service portals, investing in our customer-facing applications integrating our communication channels, automating decisions around claims to make the process more efficient and more repeatable and then automating back-office tasks. We've got a fairly large project going across multiple lines of business and multiple geographies. And that will generate cost efficiency over time. But more than anything, it will create a much more seamless customer experience and I think make us that much more competitive in the market."

But essentially, what we did is we bought a -- what we call a second and third cover. So if ever we have an event that goes up into our retention -- past our retention on a second and third event, we actually go and reduce the retention down to $55 million from $80 million or if we didn't use that and there was a major event, it would help us at the top of the tower, too. So that will add a little bit, but it's a modest increase in our overall placement. 
And we were actually pleased to see that every year when we go to the market, we have a stable list of reinsurers that follow us. Think about 40 carriers being A- or better. And we are able to place our reinsurance on a kind of a like-for-like basis without this new feature I talked about at a little bit below where the market is. So we're really proud of what we've done with cat. And I guess the last thing I would say is the cat exposure that we have today is less than we had in previous years given how we've been working on our cat exposure overall, but also the growth in our other businesses, Multifamily Housing, Global, Auto, Connected Living. 
So one of the things we mentioned in our press release earlier this year that, for example, in a one in 50-year event, back in 2017, we would have kept 40% of our earnings. Now in a one in 50-year event, we retained 70% of those earnings.

Our third quarter results were strong, driven by double-digit operating earnings growth in Global Lifestyle. The strength of our Global Automotive and Connected Living offerings continue to validate our long-term strategy of focusing on our higher growth, fee-based and capital-light businesses. 
We continue to make progress in building a more sustainable company for all stakeholders. During the quarter, a few key highlights included, for the first time, Assurant was awarded a Bronze accreditation by Echo Vadis, one of the largest sustainability ratings companies, making Assurant among the top 50% of all 75,000 participating companies. In addition, this quarter, we provided additional transparency to track our progress on our journey to build a more diverse and inclusive Assurant with the recent disclosure of our EEO1 report, which provides gender, race and ethnicity data by job category for our U.S.-based employees. We believe a diverse and inclusive workforce will best foster innovation, a key ingredient to sustaining our outperformance longer term. 
Looking at our financial performance. Year-to-date, net operating income per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, was $8.75, up 12% compared to the first 9 months of last year. Net operating income and adjusted EBITDA, also excluding cats, both increased by 10% to $528 million and $862 million, respectively. These results support our full year outlook of 10% to 14% growth in net operating income per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, marking our fifth consecutive year of strong profitable growth. Given year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we would expect to end the year closer to the top half of this range. 
We've also now completed our 3-year $1.35 billion capital return objective from our 2019 Investor Day, a quarter ahead of schedule. 
Following the close on the sale of Global Preneed in August, we've also made meaningful progress in returning an additional $900 million to shareholders. Our 2021 EPS outlook is driven by at least high single-digit net operating income growth, excluding cats, as well as share repurchases. 
Turning to our business performance. 
In Global Lifestyle, we are on track to grow adjusted EBITDA by double-digits in 2021 from $637 million in 2020, driven by Global Automotive and Connected Living. We have benefited from the stable recurring revenue stream of our installed base of mobile subscribers and our success in launching additional offerings and capabilities for our mobile carrier, cable operator, OEM and retail clients globally. Additionally, our mobile trade-in and upgrade business and expanded service delivery options are increasingly important to our profitability and also in providing a differentiated and superior customer experience. 
Within Global Automotive, we benefited from increased scale, growing the number of vehicles we protect by 20% to over 52 million since the Warranty Group acquisition in 2018. We believe auto will continue to be one of our key growth businesses in the future. 
In Global Housing, we continue to be on track for another year of better than market returns, with an annualized operating ROE of nearly 15% for the first 9 months of this year. This includes $113 million of catastrophe losses, which further demonstrates the superior returns of this differentiated business. Our countercyclical lender-placed insurance business remains an integral part of the mortgage industry framework in the U.S. Within lender-placed, as we renew existing clients and add new partners, we will continue to enhance the experience through the ongoing rollout of our single-source processing platform. Our multifamily housing business now supports over 2.5 million renters across the U.S. and has more than doubled earnings since 2015 through our strong partnerships with our affinity and property management company clients. Our investments in digital capabilities, such as our Cover 360 property management solution, continues to drive more value for our partners and an enhanced customer experience. Overall, we believe our portfolio of high growth, fee-based, capital light offerings and high-return specialty P&C businesses sets us apart as a long-term outperformer and sustained value creator for our shareholders. 
With my retirement at year-end, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank all of our stakeholders that have supported Assurant's strategic vision and path over the last 7 years. Most of all, I'm humbled by our 15,000 employees who through their dedication to serve our clients and our 300 million customers worldwide have successfully transformed Assurant. Together, we have significantly strengthened our Fortune 300 company, that should continue to deliver above market growth and superior cash flow. With our President, Keith Demmings, succeeding me as CEO in January, I'm confident Assurant will accelerate our strategy and continue to differentiate our superior customer experience while further deepening client relationships. 
I'll now turn the call over to Keith to review our key business highlights in greater detail for the quarter. Keith?"

On behalf of our employees, I wanted to express our sincere thanks to Alan for his leadership as CEO. I've been fortunate to have had a front row seat and a role in supporting Alan's vision and the transformation of Assurant. Importantly, he has continued to evolve the purpose of our company to drive value for all stakeholders: customers, employees, communities and shareholders. The impact he's had on our people and the overall culture of our company has been exemplary. And I appreciate Alan's personal mentorship and partnership, and wish him the very best in his retirement. 
As we build on Assurant's momentum over the long term, I believe our talent and innovation will be critical factors to achieving success and growth, especially as we focus more on the convergence around the connected consumer. From a talent perspective, Assurant has developed a deep and diverse bench of internal leaders. 
A few weeks ago, I announced our refreshed management committee effective in January, including 2 new leadership appointments illustrating our strong bench. First, Keith Meier, our current President of International, will succeed Gene Mergelmeyer as Chief Operating Officer, as Gene will be retiring at year-end. Gene's significant contributions to Assurant over the last 30-plus years, including as COO over his last 5 years, have been instrumental in creating market-leading positions, producing profitable growth and transforming the organization. 
In succeeding Gene, Keith Meier brings nearly 25 years of experience at Assurant to the COO role. Since 2016, as President of Assurant International, he has driven growth across our global markets, most recently with strong success in Asia Pacific. In this new role, Keith will be focused on advancing Assurant's business strategy and market leadership positions as well as identifying additional opportunities to deliver a superior customer experience. 
Second, Martin Jens will become President of Global Automotive. With over 30 years of experience, he currently leads the transformation and growth strategy for auto and has been instrumental in our introduction of innovative new products, like EB1, our electric vehicle warranty protection. In addition to emerging opportunities and innovation, Martin will be focused on driving growth and improving the customer experience, including working with our partners to deliver best-in-class dealer training. 
These 2 new appointments, along with recent appointments of Biju Nair as President of Connected Living and Manny Becerra as our Chief Innovation Officer as well as the other management committee members, represent a strong team to help lead us into the future. 
In addition to talent, innovation is an important strength of the organization, not only the development of new digital products and offerings for our clients, but also through new paths to grow and scale Assurant's businesses. Within Connected Living, innovation was a significant theme this quarter through ongoing enhancements of our mobile service delivery options. 
As part of the recently finalized multiyear contract extension with T-Mobile, we're expanding the services Assurant provides to continuously improve the customer experience for millions of T-Mobile customers. As of November 1, Assurant is partnering with T-Mobile to begin the nationwide rollout of in-store device repair services to approximately 500 stores provided by Assurant's industry certified repair experts. In addition, we have also transitioned all of the legacy Sprint Protection subscribers to the new T-Mobile device protection offering. As a result, this significantly adds to our mobile device count, now at roughly 63 million as of November 1. Overall, the expansion of our service delivery options is critical to sustaining our competitive advantage. 
We also recently signed a multiyear renewal with Spectrum Mobile, continuing to provide a comprehensive device protection program, which includes trade-in, premium tech support and Pocket Geek Mobile, Assurant's on-device diagnostic tool. With the renewal, we will also be expanding the offering to include Pocket Geek Privacy, which enables consumers to better protect and manage their personal information online through various features. This is another example of how we're able to grow by adding services and capabilities to existing clients. 
In addition, the mobile business continues to see strong attachment rates given the increased reliance on mobile devices as well as rising device prices. Our fee-driven trade in and upgrade business, including the previous acquisitions of HYLA and Alegre, have performed extraordinarily well already this year as we enter the early innings of the 5G upgrade cycle. In fact, almost a year after the transaction of HYLA closed, I am happy to report the acquisition has performed better than expected, ahead of the low teens forward EBITDA the acquisition was valued on. 
With the growing availability and popularity of 5G-enabled smartphones, we expect to see our 30-plus trade-in and upgrade programs continue to grow. Our progress is demonstrated through our ability to manage large-scale programs with superior technology. This is further supported by increasing our attach rates for trade-in programs as our clients' promotional efforts encourage consumers to upgrade. Overall, we have processed nearly 18 million devices so far this year, reducing e-waste and increasing digital access with high-quality affordable phones. 
Through the scale and capabilities of our trade-in and upgrade programs, we benefit from an additional source of profits and improved client economics and customer retention. 
This quarter, we are pleased to announce that we have signed a multiyear contract extension with AT&T to manage their device trade-in program. This includes providing analytics as well as device collection and processing for all of their sales channels, including retail, B2B, dealer and direct-to-consumer. AT&T was a key client added with the HYLA acquisition. And we look forward to continuing to do business with them, specifically as we help support the growing adoption of 5G-enabled devices. 
In Global Automotive, policies increased by 4 million or 8% year-over-year and production is well above pre-pandemic levels as we continue to take advantage of our scale and talent. So far this year, the business has also benefited from strong used car growth, which tends to earn faster than new car sales. This, along with the fact that earnings from the business are recognized over a multiyear period, provides good visibility into future performance of the business. 
As we drive innovation within auto, we continued the global rollout of EV1, an electric vehicle and hybrid protection product to North America. EV1 has now been rolled out in 7 countries. While the electric vehicle market is still in its infancy, our EV1 product will allow Assurant an opportunity to better evaluate customer demand and leverage our learnings to position us well for the expected increase in electric vehicle adoption in the future. 
Our multifamily housing business grew policies by 7% year-over-year from growth in our affinity partners as well as our PMC relationships where we continue the rollout of our innovative Cover 360 product. 
In addition, we have seen other digital investments create opportunities for future growth. Our newly designed digital sales portal, which makes it faster and easier for residents to sign up for a policy, is driving significantly higher product attachment rates. Our new portal has seen an increase in conversion rates versus our legacy website since it was first introduced last year. 
In summary, our ability to strengthen Assurant's talent and innovation, supported by critical investments, has and should continue to drive momentum for the future. 
I will now turn the call over to Richard to review the third quarter results and our 2021 outlook. Richard?"
4026111,1684279403,2422666,"Assurant, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Alan noted, we are pleased with our third quarter performance as our results reflect strong growth across Global Lifestyle and solid earnings in Global Housing. For the quarter, we reported net operatin",1456,"Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. 
As Alan noted, we are pleased with our third quarter performance as our results reflect strong growth across Global Lifestyle and solid earnings in Global Housing. 
For the quarter, we reported net operating income per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, of $2.73, up 5% from the prior year period. Excluding cats, net operating income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter each increased 4% to $162 million and $262 million, respectively. 
Now let's move to segment results, starting with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported net operating income of $124 million in the third quarter, a year-over-year increase of 16%. Growth was driven by Global Automotive and continued earnings expansion within Connected Living's mobile business. 
In Global Automotive, earnings increased $8 million or 21% from continued Global growth in our U.S. national dealer and third-party administrator channels, including contributions from our AFAS and international OEM channels. Better loss experience in select ancillary products and higher investment income also supported earnings growth in the quarter. 
Connected Living earnings increased by $6 million or 9% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by continued mobile subscriber growth in North America and better performance in Asia Pacific as well as higher trade-in volumes, led by contributions from our HYLA acquisition and carrier promotions. 
This quarter, Global Automotive and Connected Living results also included a modest onetime tax benefit that improved earnings. 
For the quarter, Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA increased 17% to $177 million. This reflects the segment's increased amortization, resulting from higher deal-related intangibles for more recent transactions in mobile and global automotive. IT depreciation expense also increased, stemming from higher investments. 
As we look at revenues, Lifestyle revenues increased by $158 million or 9%. This was driven mainly by continued growth in Connected Living and Global Automotive. Within Connected Living, revenue increased 10%, boosted by mobile fee income that was driven by strong trade-in volumes, including contributions from HYLA. Trade and volumes were supported by new phone introductions and carrier promotions from the introduction of new 5G devices. Higher revenue from growth in domestic mobile subscribers was offset by declines in runoff mobile programs. 
Mobile subscribers were up slightly year-over-year and flat year-to-date as mid-single-digit subscriber growth in North America was offset by declines in other geographies, mostly due to 3 factors: first, the 750,000 subscribers related to a runoff European banking program previously mentioned, which is not expected to be a significant impact in our profitability; second, subscriber growth for existing programs moderating in Asia Pacific; and third, a slower-than-expected recovery from the pandemic in Latin America. 
In Global Automotive, revenue increased 8%, reflecting strong prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Industry auto sales remained elevated in the third quarter. And we benefited from this trend as reflected in the year-over-year growth of our net written premium by 12%. We have though seen this trend begin to normalize beginning into the fourth quarter. 
For the full year, Lifestyle revenues are expected to increase modestly compared to last year's $7.3 billion, mainly driven by Global Auto and Connected Living growth. For all of 2021, we still expect Global Lifestyle's net operating income to grow in the high single-digits compared to 2020. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment is expected to grow double-digits year-over-year, which continues to grow at a faster pace than segment net operating income. 
As previously reported, we began our investment in the Tmall in-store repair capability this quarter. However, due to the timing of the rollout, most of our associated start-up costs will occur in the fourth quarter. These costs primarily relate to technician hiring and parts sourcing. We do expect these costs to meaningfully impact Connected Living's profitability as we end the year. In addition, we expect our effective tax rate to return to a more normal level, approximately 23%. 
Looking ahead to 2022, we expect earnings expansion to continue, but more likely at more moderated levels as we continue to invest for growth, including additional implementation start-up costs for in-store service and repair. 
Moving to Global Housing. Net operating income, excluding catastrophe losses, was $81 million for the third quarter. Including the $78 million of preannounced catastrophe losses, mainly from Hurricane Ida, net operating income totaled $3 million. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings decreased $19 million due to anticipated higher non-cat losses, which returned to levels more in line with historical averages. As a reminder, favorable non-cat losses in 2020 were not representative of historical trends. And third quarter 2020 marked the lowest point of last year, mainly driven by loss experience within lender-placed and specialty products. The year-over-year earnings decline was nearly all driven by unfavorable non-cat loss experience from several factors. The largest driver, which contributed close to half of the increase, was from the expected normalization of the non-cat loss ratio. The balance of the decline was split relatively evenly between increased reserves related to our specialty P&C offerings, primarily in our on-demand sharing economy business, as well as higher claims severity. Claims severity included moderate impacts from inflationary factors, such as higher labor and material costs. While there is always a lag. If this trend continues, we would expect higher loss costs to be offset by increased rates over time. In multifamily housing, underlying growth was offset by increased investments to further strengthen our customer experience, including our digital-first capability. 
Global Housing revenue decreased slightly year-over-year from lower specialty P&C revenues as well as a cat reinstatement premium resulting from Hurricane Ida and lower REO volumes in lender-placed. This was partially offset by higher average insured values and premium rates in lender-place and growth in multifamily housing. We continued to expect Global Housing's net operating income, excluding cats, to be flat for the full year compared to 2020. For the fourth quarter and into 2022, we would expect non-cat losses to continue to be above 2020, but in line with year-to-date 2021 experience, which is consistent with long-term trends. We also continued to monitor the REO foreclosure moratoriums and any additional extensions that may be announced. 
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $21 million, an improvement of $4 million compared to the third quarter of 2020. This was driven by 2 items: first, lower employee-related expenses and third-party fees; and second, expense savings associated with reducing our real estate footprint. In the fourth quarter, we do anticipate a higher loss due to the timing of spend. For the full year 2021, we now expect the Corporate net operating loss to be approximately $80 million, driven by favorable year-to-date results, mainly from the onetime tax and real estate joint venture benefit in the second quarter. This compares to our previous estimate of $85 million. As we look forward to 2022, we would expect our net operating loss in Corporate to be closer to $90 million, more in line with historical trends. 
Turning to the holding company liquidity, including the net proceeds from the sale of Preneed in August. We ended the third quarter with over $1.3 billion, well above our current minimum target level. In the third quarter, dividends from operating segments totaled $127 million. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also had outflows from 3 main items: $323 million of share repurchases; $39 million in common stock dividends; and $11 million mainly related to Assurant Ventures investments. In addition to completing our 2019 Investor Day objective of returning $1.35 billion to shareholders from 2019 through [ 2020 ] [ $900 million ] in Global Preneed sale proceeds through share repurchases. For the year overall, we continued to expect dividends to approximate segment earnings, subject to the growth of the businesses, rating agency and regulatory capital requirements, and investment portfolio performance. 
I also want to provide a quick update on Assurant Ventures, our venture capital arm. In the third quarter, 3 investments in our portfolio went public via SPACs. We are pleased with the results as the 3 investments exceeded a 7x multiple on investment capital under their respective SPAC transaction terms. These transactions combined with strong performance in the broader ventures portfolio led to a $75 million after-tax gain flowing through net income in the quarter. In addition to strong returns, these investments also provide key insights into emerging technologies and capabilities within our connected consumer growth businesses. 
Before turning to Q&A, I too would like to take a minute to thank Alan for his partnership over the last 5 years. In addition to positioning Assurant for long-term success and growth, he has created an environment of inclusion and community, truly representative of our core values: common sense and common decency. Alan, I wish you all the very best in retirement. Well deserved. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

There's also a little less certainty in the minds of consumers around the reliability of all of the technology. So we do expect to see strong performance over time. I would say it's really early, and it will evolve as we start to see more and more EVs in the market and as we start to see our clients maturing around not just selling electric vehicles, but attaching F&I products and services.

Assurant operates in businesses that have attracted more attention in regard to inflation, parts and labor costs in automotive, chip shortages in mobile, in Global Housing. Housing is a risk-based business where you have inflation exposure that you can mitigate with rate. But I think a lot of investors who look at Assurant are your typical insurance investor and sometimes misunderstand to the extent at which the risk in mobile and automotive is ceded off to clients and how it operates on a fee-like basis. So I think investors understand this dynamic exists, but not the degree of which.

Thanks, Keith. And I think you sort of bolt it on the main points. When we look at it, I would say, short term in this quarter, we mentioned that severities were up a little bit, probably 1/4 of the whole change in the non-debt loss ratio. Those severities are really labor and claims costs increasing there. But over the long term, I think we're -- we look at it maybe being slightly positive, at least neutral. Because what happens? I mean, Keith mentioned the reinsurance that we have with our clients on the fee-based side. So there's a large sharing of profitability on that side of the business. But then on the P&C side, where housing, whatever, where we are taking on the claims and the risk, there's 2 things that would happen. Lender-placed, we have averaged insured values would go up. So as the prices of housing goes up with inflation, we would see an increase in our -- in the premium to the average insured value. Also, over time, we would be able to recover a large part, if not all of that, through our rate filings. So we feel that obviously insulates us quite well. And then finally, with inflation, over time, we would anticipate that interest rates would increase, and we would get an uptick in our investment income. So overall, we're not looking at it as being any type of a significant negative. Anything that's neutral could be a small positive."

And we also a few years ago started to really following the consumer as they own and rent their home and their car, and trying to really build off of our experience in our rental and the franchise that we have there. And what we're really doing today is we're insuring a short-term transaction. So think about you're renting your home or you're using your car to make a food delivery. And what we're excited about with that business, and then I'll answer the question directly, both -- it's a new distribution channel for us. If you think about we can embed some of our capabilities around rental into a rental of a home. And then what's particularly interesting is the gig economy. And if you think about the workers who are now delivering food or using their car to provide services, it's an interesting opportunity for us to drive not that product as much as our other products, our service contracts, our mobile capabilities, our renters insurance. So that's really been the genesis of what we're doing there. 
In terms of the reserve this quarter, it's affecting really maybe, what, $5 million, I think, was the amount. And it's really development on prior reported claims. So think of it as the catch-up to align with all of our future expectations. And then over the last couple of years, as we've gained experience in this business, we've been modifying our product structures. We've increased rates, and we've put in place extensive reinsurance. So we'll never -- we don't anticipate having any significant or material losses from this business. And in fact, it's been a very well-performing business for us over the last couple of years."

And I think Alan has put us in a good position to succeed over the future under Keith's leadership."

So as we look at what's happened since close, trade-in volumes are up significantly. We've seen, obviously, not just demand from 5G, significant client promotions where trade-ins are the main incentive being used, increasing attach rates and just, I think, pent-up demand coming out of the pandemic. So we talk about the performance of the acquisition, 50% better than we modeled based on '21. So we're thrilled with how it's going. But more than that, really excited about the integration, how well that's working, our ability to protect talent, obviously, a significant renewal of a major relationship with AT&T. And then as you think about the overall volumes process, we talked about 18 million devices so far this year, that compares to 14 million for full year 2020. And that's overall in total combining HYLA and Assurant. So yes, HYLA's a big driver of fee income, but we've also seen growth on what I would call the legacy Assurant side of the trade-in business as well, and similar trends are happening across clients and across the market. So it's a really strong time for trade-in in the global market."

Our third quarter results were strong, driven by double-digit operating earnings growth in Global Lifestyle. The strength of our Global Automotive and Connected Living offerings continue to validate our long-term strategy of focusing on our higher growth, fee-based and capital-light businesses. We continue to make progress in building a more sustainable company for all stakeholders. 
During the quarter, a few key highlights included: for the first time, Assurant was awarded a bronze accreditation by EcoVadis, one of the largest sustainability ratings companies, making Assurant among the top 50% of all 75,000 participating companies. In addition, this quarter, we provided additional transparency to track our progress on our journey to build a more diverse and inclusive Assurant with the recent disclosure of our EEO-1 report, which provides gender, race and ethnicity data by job category for our U.S.-based employees. We believe a diverse and inclusive workforce will best foster innovation, a key ingredient to sustaining our outperformance longer term.  
Looking at our financial performance. Year-to-date, net operating income per share excluding reportable catastrophes was $8.75, up 12% compared to the first 9 months of last year. Net operating income and adjusted EBITDA also excluding cats both increased by 10% to $528 million and $862 million, respectively. These results support our full year outlook of 10% to 14% growth in net operating income per share excluding reportable catastrophes, marking our fifth consecutive year of strong profitable growth. Given year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we would expect to end the year closer to the top half of this range.  
We've also now completed our 3-year $1.35 billion capital return objective from our 2019 Investor Day, a quarter ahead of schedule. Following the close on the sale of Global Preneed in August, we've also made meaningful progress in returning an additional $900 million to shareholders. Our 2021 EPS outlook is driven by at least high single-digit net operating income growth excluding cats as well as share repurchases.  
Turning to our business performance. In Global Lifestyle, we are on track to grow adjusted EBITDA by double digits in 2021 from $637 million in 2020, driven by Global Automotive and Connected Living. We have benefited from the stable recurring revenue stream of our installed base of mobile subscribers and our success in launching additional offerings and capabilities for our mobile carrier, cable operator, OEM and retail clients globally. Additionally, our mobile trade-in and upgrade business and expanded service delivery options are increasingly important to our profitability and also in providing a differentiated and superior customer experience.  
Within Global Automotive, we benefited from increased scale, growing the number of vehicles we protect by 20% to over 52 million since The Warranty Group acquisition in 2018. We believe auto will continue to be one of our key growth businesses in the future.  
In Global Housing, we continue to be on track for another year of better-than-market returns, with an annualized operating ROE of nearly 15% for the first 9 months of this year. This includes $113 million of catastrophe losses, which further demonstrates the superior returns of this differentiated business. Our countercyclical lender-placed insurance business remains an integral part of the mortgage industry framework in the U.S. Within lender-placed, as we renew existing clients and add new partners, we will continue to enhance the experience through the ongoing rollout of our single-source processing platform. 
Our multifamily housing business now supports over 2.5 million renters across the U.S. and has more than doubled earnings since 2015 through our strong partnerships with our affinity and property management company clients. Our investments in digital capabilities such as our Cover360 property management solution continues to drive more value for our partners and an enhanced customer experience. Overall, we believe our portfolio of high-growth, fee-based, capital-light offerings and high-return specialty P&C businesses sets us apart as a long-term outperformer and sustained value creator for our shareholders.  
With my retirement at year-end, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank all of our stakeholders that have supported Assurant's strategic vision and path over the last 7 years. Most of all, I'm humbled by our 15,000 employees, who through their dedication to serve our clients and our 300 million customers worldwide have successfully transformed Assurant. Together, we have significantly strengthened our Fortune 300 company that should continue to deliver above-market growth and superior cash flow. With our President, Keith Demmings, succeeding me as CEO in January, I'm confident Assurant will accelerate our strategy and continue to differentiate our superior customer experience while further deepening client relationships.  
I'll now turn the call over to Keith to review our key business highlights in greater detail for the quarter. Keith?"

On behalf of our employees, I wanted to express our sincere thanks to Alan for his leadership as CEO. I've been fortunate to have had a front row seat and a role in supporting Alan's vision and the transformation of Assurant. 
Importantly, he has continued to evolve the purpose of our company to drive value for all stakeholders: customers, employees, communities and shareholders. The impact he's had on our people and the overall culture of our company has been exemplary, and I appreciate Alan's personal mentorship and partnership and wish him the very best in his retirement. As we build on Assurant's momentum over the long term, I believe our talent and innovation will be critical factors to achieving success and growth, especially as we focus more on the convergence around the connected consumer. 
From a talent perspective, Assurant has developed a deep and diverse bench of internal leaders. A few weeks ago, I announced our refreshed management committee effective in January, including 2 new leadership appointments illustrating our strong bench. First, Keith Meier, our current President of International, will succeed Gene Mergelmeyer as Chief Operating Officer as Gene will be retiring at year-end. Gene's significant contributions to Assurant over the last 30-plus years, including as COO over his last 5 years, have been instrumental in creating market-leading positions, producing profitable growth and transforming the organization.  
In succeeding Gene, Keith Meier brings nearly 25 years of experience at Assurant to the COO role. Since 2016, as President of Assurant International, he has driven growth across our global markets, most recently with strong success in Asia Pacific. In this new role, Keith will be focused on advancing Assurant's business strategy and market leadership positions as well as identifying additional opportunities to deliver a superior customer experience.  
Second, Martin Jenns will become President of Global Automotive. With over 30 years of experience, he currently leads the transformation and growth strategy for auto and has been instrumental in our introduction of innovative new products, like EV One, our electric vehicle warranty protection. In addition to emerging opportunities and innovation, Martin will be focused on driving growth and improving the customer experience, including working with our partners to deliver best-in-class dealer training. These 2 new appointments, along with recent appointments of Biju Nair as President of Connected Living and Manny Becerra as our Chief Innovation Officer as well as the other management committee members, represent a strong team to help lead us into the future.  
In addition to talent, innovation is an important strength of the organization, not only the development of new digital products and offerings for our clients but also through new paths to grow and scale Assurant's businesses. Within Connected Living, innovation was a significant theme this quarter through ongoing enhancements of our mobile service delivery options. As part of the recently finalized multiyear contract extension with T-Mobile, we're expanding the services Assurant provides to continuously improve the customer experience for millions of T-Mobile customers. As of November 1, Assurant is partnering with T-Mobile to begin the nationwide rollout of in-store device repair services to approximately 500 stores provided by Assurant's industry-certified repair experts. 
In addition, we have also transitioned all of the legacy Sprint protection subscribers to the new T-Mobile device protection offering. As a result, this significantly adds to our mobile device count, now at roughly 63 million as of November 1. Overall, the expansion of our service delivery options is critical to sustaining our competitive advantage.  
We also recently signed a multiyear renewal with Spectrum Mobile, continuing to provide a comprehensive device protection program, which includes trade-in, premium tech support and Pocket Geek Mobile, Assurant's on-device diagnostic tool. With the renewal, we will also be expanding the offering to include Pocket Geek Privacy, which enables consumers to better protect and manage their personal information online through various features. This is another example of how we're able to grow by adding services and capabilities to existing clients.  
In addition, the mobile business continues to see strong attachment rates given the increased reliance on mobile devices as well as rising device prices. Our fee-driven trade-in and upgrade business, including the previous acquisitions of HYLA and Alegre, have performed extraordinarily well already this year as we enter the early innings of the 5G upgrade cycle. In fact, almost a year after the transaction of HYLA closed, I am happy to report the acquisition has performed better than expected, ahead of the low-teens forward EBITDA the acquisition was valued on. 
With the growing availability and popularity of 5G-enabled smartphones, we expect to see our 30-plus trade-in and upgrade programs continue to grow. Our progress is demonstrated through our ability to manage large-scale programs with superior technology. This is further supported by increasing our attach rates for trade-in programs as our clients' promotional efforts encourage consumers to upgrade. Overall, we have processed nearly 18 million devices so far this year, reducing e-waste and increasing digital access with high-quality affordable phones. Through the scale and capabilities of our trade-in and upgrade programs, we benefit from an additional source of profit and improved client economics and customer retention.  
This quarter, we are pleased to announce that we have signed a multiyear contract extension with AT&T to manage their device trade-in program. This includes providing analytics as well as device collection and processing for all of their sales channels, including retail, B2B, dealer and direct to consumer. AT&T was a key client added with the HYLA acquisition, and we look forward to continuing to do business with them, specifically as we help support the growing adoption of 5G-enabled devices.  
In Global Automotive, policies increased by 4 million or 8% year-over-year and production is well above pre-pandemic levels as we continue to take advantage of our scale and talent. So far this year, the business has also benefited from strong used car growth, which tends to earn faster than new car sales. This, along with the fact that earnings from the business are recognized over a multiyear period, provides good visibility into future performance of the business.  
As we drive innovation within auto, we continued the global rollout of EV One, an electric vehicle and hybrid protection product to North America. EV One has now been rolled out in 7 countries. While the electric vehicle market is still in its infancy, our EV One product will allow Assurant an opportunity to better evaluate customer demand and leverage our learnings to position us well for the expected increase in electric vehicle adoption in the future.  
Our multifamily housing business grew policies by 7% year-over-year from growth in our affinity partners as well as our PMC relationships where we continue the rollout of our innovative Cover360 product. In addition, we have seen other digital investments create opportunities for future growth. Our newly designed digital sales portal, which makes it faster and easier for residents to sign up for a policy, is driving significantly higher product attachment rates. Our new portal has seen an increase in conversion rates versus our legacy website since it was first introduced last year. 
In summary, our ability to strengthen Assurant's talent and innovation, supported by critical investments, has and should continue to drive momentum for the future. I will now turn the call over to Richard to review the third quarter results and our 2021 outlook. Richard?"
4026111,1684279403,2422968,"Assurant, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Alan noted, we are pleased with our third quarter performance as our results reflect strong growth across Global Lifestyle and solid earnings in Global Housing. For the quarter, we reported net operating in",1462,"Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Alan noted, we are pleased with our third quarter performance as our results reflect strong growth across Global Lifestyle and solid earnings in Global Housing. For the quarter, we reported net operating income per share excluding reportable catastrophes of $2.73, up 5% from the prior year period. Excluding cats, net operating income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter each increased 4% to $162 million and $262 million, respectively.  
Now let's move to segment results, starting with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported net operating income of $124 million in the third quarter, a year-over-year increase of 16%. Growth was driven by Global Automotive and continued earnings expansion within Connected Living's mobile business.  
In Global Automotive, earnings increased $8 million or 21% from continued Global growth in our U.S. national dealer and third-party administrator channels, including contributions from our AFAS and international OEM channels. Better loss experience in select ancillary products and higher investment income also supported earnings growth in the quarter.  
Connected Living earnings increased by $6 million or 9% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by continued mobile subscriber growth in North America and better performance in Asia Pacific as well as higher trade-in volumes, led by contributions from our HYLA acquisition and carrier promotions. This quarter, Global Automotive and Connected Living results also included a modest onetime tax benefit that improved earnings. 
For the quarter, lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA increased 17% to $177 million. This reflects the segment's increased amortization resulting from higher deal-related intangibles for more recent transactions in mobile and Global Automotive. IT depreciation expense also increased, stemming from higher investments.  
As we look at revenues, lifestyle revenues increased by $158 million or 9%. This was driven mainly by continued growth in Connected Living and Global Automotive. Within Connected Living, revenue increased 10%, boosted by mobile fee income that was driven by strong trade-in volumes, including contributions from HYLA. Trade-in volumes were supported by new phone introductions and carrier promotions from the introduction of new 5G devices. 
Higher revenue from growth in domestic mobile subscribers was offset by declines in run-off mobile programs. Mobile subscribers were up slightly year-over-year and flat year-to-date as mid-single-digit subscriber growth in North America was offset by declines in other geographies, mostly due to 3 factors: first, the 750,000 subscribers related to a run-off European banking program previously mentioned, which is not expected to be a significant impact in our profitability; second, subscriber growth for existing programs moderating in Asia Pacific; and third, a slower-than-expected recovery from the pandemic in Latin America.  
In Global Automotive, revenue increased 8%, reflecting strong prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Industry auto sales remained elevated in the third quarter, and we benefited from this trend as reflected in the year-over-year growth of our net written premium by 12%. We have though seen this trend begin to normalize beginning into the fourth quarter. 
For the full year, Lifestyle revenues are expected to increase modestly compared to last year's $7.3 billion, mainly driven by global auto and Connected Living growth. For all of 2021, we still expect Global Lifestyle's net operating income to grow in the high single digits compared to 2020. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment is expected to grow double digits year-over-year, which continues to grow at a faster pace than segment net operating income.  
As previously reported, we began our investment in the T-MO in-store repair capability this quarter. However, due to the timing of the rollout, most of our associated start-up costs will occur in the fourth quarter. These costs primarily relate to technician hiring and parts sourcing. We do expect these costs to meaningfully impact Connected Living's profitability as we end the year. In addition, we expect our effective tax rate to return to a more normal level, approximately 23%. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect earnings expansion to continue but more likely at more moderated levels as we continue to invest for growth, including additional implementation start-up costs for in-store service and repair.  
Moving to Global Housing. Net operating income excluding catastrophe losses was $81 million for the third quarter. Including the $78 million of preannounced catastrophe losses, mainly from Hurricane Ida, net operating income totaled $3 million. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings decreased $19 million due to anticipated higher non-cat losses, which returned to levels more in line with historical averages. As a reminder, favorable non-cat losses in 2020 were not representative of historical trends, and third quarter 2020 marked the lowest point of last year, mainly driven by loss experience within lender-placed and specialty products. 
The year-over-year earnings decline was nearly all driven by unfavorable non-cat loss experience from several factors. The largest driver, which contributed close to half of the increase, was from the expected normalization of the non-cat loss ratio. The balance of the decline was split relatively evenly between increased reserves related to our specialty P&C offerings, primarily in our on-demand sharing economy business, as well as higher claims severity. 
Claims severity included moderate impacts from inflationary factors such as higher labor and material costs. While there is always a lag, if this trend continues, we would expect higher loss costs to be offset by increased rates over time. 
In multifamily housing, underlying growth was offset by increased investments to further strengthen our customer experience, including our digital-first capability. Global Housing revenue decreased slightly year-over-year from lower specialty P&C revenues as well as a cat reinstatement premium resulting from Hurricane Ida and lower REO volumes in lender-placed. This was partially offset by higher average insured values and premium rates in lender-placed and growth in multifamily housing. 
We continued to expect Global Housing's net operating income excluding cats to be flat for the full year compared to 2020. For the fourth quarter and into 2022, we would expect non-cat losses to continue to be above 2020 but in line with year-to-date 2021 experience, which is consistent with long-term trends. We also continued to monitor the REO foreclosure moratoriums and any additional extensions that may be announced.  
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $21 million, an improvement of $4 million compared to the third quarter of 2020. This was driven by 2 items: first, lower employee-related expenses and third-party fees; and second, expense savings associated with reducing our real estate footprint. In the fourth quarter, we do anticipate a higher loss due to the timing of spend. 
For the full year 2021, we now expect the Corporate net operating loss to be approximately $80 million, driven by favorable year-to-date results, mainly from the onetime tax and real estate joint venture benefit in the second quarter. This compares to our previous estimate of $85 million. As we look forward to 2022, we would expect our net operating loss in Corporate to be closer to $90 million, more in line with historical trends.  
Turning to the holding company liquidity. Including the net proceeds from the sale of Preneed in August, we ended the third quarter with over $1.3 billion, well above our current minimum target level. In the third quarter, dividends from operating segments totaled $127 million. 
 
In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also had outflows from 3 main items: $323 million of share repurchases, $39 million in common stock dividends and $11 million mainly related to Assurant Ventures investments. In addition to completing our 2019 Investor Day objective of returning $1.35 billion to shareholders from 2019 through 2021, we have also completed roughly 1/4 of our objective to return $900 million  in Global Preneed sale proceeds through share repurchases. For the year overall, we continue to expect dividends to approximate segment earnings, subject to the growth of the businesses, rating agency and regulatory capital requirements and investment portfolio performance.  
I also want to provide a quick update on Assurant Ventures, our venture capital arm. In the third quarter, 3 investments in our portfolio went public via SPACs. We are pleased with the results as the 3 investments exceeded a 7x multiple on investment capital under their respective SPAC transaction terms. These transactions combined with strong performance in the broader ventures portfolio led to a $75 million after-tax gain flowing through net income in the quarter. In addition to strong returns, these investments also provide key insights into emerging technologies and capabilities within our connected consumer businesses.  
Before turning to Q&A, I too would like to take a minute to thank Alan for his partnership over the last 5 years. In addition to positioning Assurant for long-term success and growth, he's created an environment of inclusion and community, truly representative of our core values: common sense and common decency. Alan, I wish you all the very best in retirement. Well deserved.  
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

So first thing I'd emphasize is just the strong partnership that we've had with T-Mobile for many years, which has obviously scaled significantly over time. So we're extremely pleased to have reached a multiyear extension. And then the migration of the Sprint customers on November 1 along with the ramping of same-unit repair inside of 500 T-Mobile stores is obviously very exciting as we look to the future. 
As we've discussed on previous calls, it's not uncommon for us to forgo economics when we re-contract with major clients. That's particularly true if a client scales dramatically over time, which obviously is the case with T-Mobile. As a result of the new agreement going forward, we do expect lower per-unit economics. But I would say that once we get same-unit repair fully ramped and normalize our performance, which will take some time, we do expect overall to be able to more than offset the margin pressure with the additional Sprint volume with economies of scale within the business and obviously, with the addition of the additional in-store repair services. 
And we're really well positioned as partners as we look to continue to drive customer experiences and innovation for the future. So overall, a really strategically important accomplishment for us, not just the renewal, but launching same-unit repair, I think, is critical as we look to accelerate our competitive advantage in the Connected Living business, and this positions us really well."

And as we've demonstrated over many years, we continue to innovate not just around the products but services, capabilities, how can we invest more around delivering exceptional customer experience. And certainly, a partnership with T-Mobile that is now significantly more scaled, we believe, is going to yield more opportunities to partner together for the future.

I would say that began to normalize a little bit from where we were in the first and second quarter. But it was only modestly down from Q2, up 12% over 2020 and actually up 27% over 2019. So that, we'd certainly expect to taper off going forward. There's obviously constraints around supply chain that's affecting new car sales, but those constraints have been more than offset by the volume that our clients are doing on the used side of the business, which has been very dramatic and overall leading to elevated levels of sales."

Assurant operates in businesses that have attracted more attention in regard to inflation, parts and labor costs in automotive, chip shortages in mobile and Global Housing.

But I think a lot of investors who look at Assurant are your typical insurance investor and sometimes misunderstand the extent of which the risk in mobile and automotive is ceded off to clients and how it operates on a fee-like basis.

When we look at it, I would say, short term in this quarter, we mentioned that severities were up a little bit, probably 1/4 of the whole change in the non-cat loss ratio. Those severities are really labor and claims costs increasing there. 
But over the long term, I think we're -- we look at it maybe being slightly positive, at least neutral. Because what happens -- I mean Keith mentioned the reinsurance that we have with our clients on the fee-based side, so there's a large sharing of profitability on that side of the business. But then on the P&C side, where -- housing, whatever, where we are taking on the claims and the risk, there's 2 things that would happen. 
Lender-placed, we have -- average insured values would go up. So as the prices of housing go up with inflation, we would see an increase in our -- in the premiums to the average insured value. Also, over time, we would be able to recover a large part, if not all, of that through our rate filings. So we feel that obviously insulates us quite well. 
And then finally with inflation, over time, we would anticipate that interest rates would increase and we would get an uptick in our investment income. So overall, we're not looking at it as being any type of a significant negative. If anything, it's neutral, could be a small positive."

I expect servicers to actively work with borrowers on loan modifications to keep the loans performing. 
There's so much strength generally in the housing market. Customers have positive equity in the home. So I think a lot of that activity will delay some of the placement rate from flowing through.

Maybe let me take that one and give a little bit of history on what we're doing there. So in specialty, we have a variety of products, things like antique auto, a little bit of the international property we write. And we also, a few years ago, started to do a couple of on-demand products related to really following the consumer as they own and rent their home and their car and trying to really build off of our experience in rental and the franchise that we have there. And what we're really doing today is we're insuring a short-term transaction, so think about you're renting your home or you're using your car to make a food delivery. 
And what we're excited about with that business, and then I'll answer the question directly, both -- it's a new distribution channel for us. If you think about we can embed some of our capabilities around rental into a rental of a home. And then what's particularly interesting is the gig economy. And if you think about the workers who are now delivering food or using their car to provide services, it's an interesting opportunity for us to drive not that product as much as our other products, our service contracts, our mobile capabilities, our renter's insurance. So that's really been the genesis of what we're doing there. 
In terms of the reserve this quarter, it's affecting really maybe, what, $5 million, I think was the amount. And it's really development on prior reported claims. So think of it as the catch-up to align with all of our future expectations. And then over the last couple of years, as we've gained experience in this business, we've been modifying our product structures. We've increased rates, and we've put in place extensive reinsurance.

So that will be in the fourth quarter. And then we would anticipate some coming in next year. So I mean in terms of rolling into next year, there'll be some amount.

Our third quarter results were strong, driven by double-digit operating earnings growth in Global Lifestyle. The strength of our Global Automotive and Connected Living offerings continue to validate our long-term strategy of focusing on our higher growth, fee-based and capital-light businesses. We continue to make progress in building a more sustainable company for all stakeholders. 
During the quarter, a few key highlights included: for the first time, Assurant was awarded a bronze accreditation by EcoVadis, one of the largest sustainability ratings companies, making Assurant among the top 50% of all 75,000 participating companies. In addition, this quarter, we provided additional transparency to track our progress on our journey to build a more diverse and inclusive Assurant with the recent disclosure of our EEO-1 report, which provides gender, race and ethnicity data by job category for our U.S.-based employees. We believe a diverse and inclusive workforce will best foster innovation, a key ingredient to sustaining our outperformance longer term.  
Looking at our financial performance. Year-to-date, net operating income per share excluding reportable catastrophes was $8.75, up 12% compared to the first 9 months of last year. Net operating income and adjusted EBITDA also excluding cats both increased by 10% to $528 million and $862 million, respectively. These results support our full year outlook of 10% to 14% growth in net operating income per share excluding reportable catastrophes, marking our fifth consecutive year of strong profitable growth. Given year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we would expect to end the year closer to the top half of this range.  
We've also now completed our 3-year $1.35 billion capital return objective from our 2019 Investor Day, a quarter ahead of schedule. Following the close on the sale of Global Preneed in August, we've also made meaningful progress in returning an additional $900 million to shareholders. Our 2021 EPS outlook is driven by at least high single-digit net operating income growth excluding cats as well as share repurchases.  
Turning to our business performance. In Global Lifestyle, we are on track to grow adjusted EBITDA by double digits in 2021 from $637 million in 2020, driven by Global Automotive and Connected Living. We have benefited from the stable recurring revenue stream of our installed base of mobile subscribers and our success in launching additional offerings and capabilities for our mobile carrier, cable operator, OEM and retail clients globally. Additionally, our mobile trade-in and upgrade business and expanded service delivery options are increasingly important to our profitability and also in providing a differentiated and superior customer experience.  
Within Global Automotive, we benefited from increased scale, growing the number of vehicles we protect by 20% to over 52 million since The Warranty Group acquisition in 2018. We believe auto will continue to be one of our key growth businesses in the future.  
In Global Housing, we continue to be on track for another year of better-than-market returns, with an annualized operating ROE of nearly 15% for the first 9 months of this year. This includes $113 million of catastrophe losses, which further demonstrates the superior returns of this differentiated business. Our countercyclical lender-placed insurance business remains an integral part of the mortgage industry framework in the U.S. Within lender-placed, as we renew existing clients and add new partners, we will continue to enhance the experience through the ongoing rollout of our single-source processing platform. 
Our multifamily housing business now supports over 2.5 million renters across the U.S. and has more than doubled earnings since 2015 through our strong partnerships with our affinity and property management company clients. Our investments in digital capabilities such as our Cover360 property management solution continues to drive more value for our partners and an enhanced customer experience. Overall, we believe our portfolio of high-growth, fee-based, capital-light offerings and high-return specialty P&C businesses sets us apart as a long-term outperformer and sustained value creator for our shareholders.  
With my retirement at year-end, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank all of our stakeholders that have supported Assurant's strategic vision and path over the last 7 years. Most of all, I'm humbled by our 15,000 employees, who through their dedication to serve our clients and our 300 million customers worldwide have successfully transformed Assurant. Together, we have significantly strengthened our Fortune 300 company that should continue to deliver above-market growth and superior cash flow. With our President, Keith Demmings, succeeding me as CEO in January, I'm confident Assurant will accelerate our strategy and continue to differentiate our superior customer experience while further deepening client relationships.  
I'll now turn the call over to Keith to review our key business highlights in greater detail for the quarter. Keith?"

On behalf of our employees, I wanted to express our sincere thanks to Alan for his leadership as CEO. I've been fortunate to have had a front row seat and a role in supporting Alan's vision and the transformation of Assurant. 
Importantly, he has continued to evolve the purpose of our company to drive value for all stakeholders: customers, employees, communities and shareholders. The impact he's had on our people and the overall culture of our company has been exemplary, and I appreciate Alan's personal mentorship and partnership and wish him the very best in his retirement. As we build on Assurant's momentum over the long term, I believe our talent and innovation will be critical factors to achieving success and growth, especially as we focus more on the convergence around the connected consumer. 
From a talent perspective, Assurant has developed a deep and diverse bench of internal leaders. A few weeks ago, I announced our refreshed management committee effective in January, including 2 new leadership appointments illustrating our strong bench. First, Keith Meier, our current President of International, will succeed Gene Mergelmeyer as Chief Operating Officer as Gene will be retiring at year-end. Gene's significant contributions to Assurant over the last 30-plus years, including as COO over his last 5 years, have been instrumental in creating market-leading positions, producing profitable growth and transforming the organization.  
In succeeding Gene, Keith Meier brings nearly 25 years of experience at Assurant to the COO role. Since 2016, as President of Assurant International, he has driven growth across our global markets, most recently with strong success in Asia Pacific. In this new role, Keith will be focused on advancing Assurant's business strategy and market leadership positions as well as identifying additional opportunities to deliver a superior customer experience.  
Second, Martin Jenns will become President of Global Automotive. With over 30 years of experience, he currently leads the transformation and growth strategy for auto and has been instrumental in our introduction of innovative new products, like EV One, our electric vehicle warranty protection. In addition to emerging opportunities and innovation, Martin will be focused on driving growth and improving the customer experience, including working with our partners to deliver best-in-class dealer training. These 2 new appointments, along with recent appointments of Biju Nair as President of Connected Living and Manny Becerra as our Chief Innovation Officer as well as the other management committee members, represent a strong team to help lead us into the future.  
In addition to talent, innovation is an important strength of the organization, not only the development of new digital products and offerings for our clients but also through new paths to grow and scale Assurant's businesses. Within Connected Living, innovation was a significant theme this quarter through ongoing enhancements of our mobile service delivery options. As part of the recently finalized multiyear contract extension with T-Mobile, we're expanding the services Assurant provides to continuously improve the customer experience for millions of T-Mobile customers. As of November 1, Assurant is partnering with T-Mobile to begin the nationwide rollout of in-store device repair services to approximately 500 stores provided by Assurant's industry-certified repair experts. 
In addition, we have also transitioned all of the legacy Sprint protection subscribers to the new T-Mobile device protection offering. As a result, this significantly adds to our mobile device count, now at roughly 63 million as of November 1. Overall, the expansion of our service delivery options is critical to sustaining our competitive advantage.  
We also recently signed a multiyear renewal with Spectrum Mobile, continuing to provide a comprehensive device protection program, which includes trade-in, premium tech support and Pocket Geek Mobile, Assurant's on-device diagnostic tool. With the renewal, we will also be expanding the offering to include Pocket Geek Privacy, which enables consumers to better protect and manage their personal information online through various features. This is another example of how we're able to grow by adding services and capabilities to existing clients.  
In addition, the mobile business continues to see strong attachment rates given the increased reliance on mobile devices as well as rising device prices. Our fee-driven trade-in and upgrade business, including the previous acquisitions of HYLA and Alegre, have performed extraordinarily well already this year as we enter the early innings of the 5G upgrade cycle. In fact, almost a year after the transaction of HYLA closed, I am happy to report the acquisition has performed better than expected, ahead of the low-teens forward EBITDA the acquisition was valued on. 
With the growing availability and popularity of 5G-enabled smartphones, we expect to see our 30-plus trade-in and upgrade programs continue to grow. Our progress is demonstrated through our ability to manage large-scale programs with superior technology. This is further supported by increasing our attach rates for trade-in programs as our clients' promotional efforts encourage consumers to upgrade. Overall, we have processed nearly 18 million devices so far this year, reducing e-waste and increasing digital access with high-quality affordable phones. Through the scale and capabilities of our trade-in and upgrade programs, we benefit from an additional source of profit and improved client economics and customer retention.  
This quarter, we are pleased to announce that we have signed a multiyear contract extension with AT&T to manage their device trade-in program. This includes providing analytics as well as device collection and processing for all of their sales channels, including retail, B2B, dealer and direct to consumer. AT&T was a key client added with the HYLA acquisition, and we look forward to continuing to do business with them, specifically as we help support the growing adoption of 5G-enabled devices.  
In Global Automotive, policies increased by 4 million or 8% year-over-year and production is well above pre-pandemic levels as we continue to take advantage of our scale and talent. So far this year, the business has also benefited from strong used car growth, which tends to earn faster than new car sales. This, along with the fact that earnings from the business are recognized over a multiyear period, provides good visibility into future performance of the business.  
As we drive innovation within auto, we continued the global rollout of EV One, an electric vehicle and hybrid protection product to North America. EV One has now been rolled out in 7 countries. While the electric vehicle market is still in its infancy, our EV One product will allow Assurant an opportunity to better evaluate customer demand and leverage our learnings to position us well for the expected increase in electric vehicle adoption in the future.  
Our multifamily housing business grew policies by 7% year-over-year from growth in our affinity partners as well as our PMC relationships where we continue the rollout of our innovative Cover360 product. In addition, we have seen other digital investments create opportunities for future growth. Our newly designed digital sales portal, which makes it faster and easier for residents to sign up for a policy, is driving significantly higher product attachment rates. Our new portal has seen an increase in conversion rates versus our legacy website since it was first introduced last year. 
In summary, our ability to strengthen Assurant's talent and innovation, supported by critical investments, has and should continue to drive momentum for the future. I will now turn the call over to Richard to review the third quarter results and our 2021 outlook. Richard?"
4026111,1684279403,2481984,"Assurant, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Alan noted, we are pleased with our third quarter performance as our results reflect strong growth across Global Lifestyle and solid earnings in Global Housing. For the quarter, we reported net operating in",1462,"Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Alan noted, we are pleased with our third quarter performance as our results reflect strong growth across Global Lifestyle and solid earnings in Global Housing. For the quarter, we reported net operating income per share excluding reportable catastrophes of $2.73, up 5% from the prior year period. Excluding cats, net operating income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter each increased 4% to $162 million and $262 million, respectively.  
Now let's move to segment results, starting with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported net operating income of $124 million in the third quarter, a year-over-year increase of 16%. Growth was driven by Global Automotive and continued earnings expansion within Connected Living's mobile business.  
In Global Automotive, earnings increased $8 million or 21% from continued Global growth in our U.S. national dealer and third-party administrator channels, including contributions from our AFAS and international OEM channels. Better loss experience in select ancillary products and higher investment income also supported earnings growth in the quarter.  
Connected Living earnings increased by $6 million or 9% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by continued mobile subscriber growth in North America and better performance in Asia Pacific as well as higher trade-in volumes, led by contributions from our HYLA acquisition and carrier promotions. This quarter, Global Automotive and Connected Living results also included a modest onetime tax benefit that improved earnings. 
For the quarter, lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA increased 17% to $177 million. This reflects the segment's increased amortization resulting from higher deal-related intangibles for more recent transactions in mobile and Global Automotive. IT depreciation expense also increased, stemming from higher investments.  
As we look at revenues, lifestyle revenues increased by $158 million or 9%. This was driven mainly by continued growth in Connected Living and Global Automotive. Within Connected Living, revenue increased 10%, boosted by mobile fee income that was driven by strong trade-in volumes, including contributions from HYLA. Trade-in volumes were supported by new phone introductions and carrier promotions from the introduction of new 5G devices. 
Higher revenue from growth in domestic mobile subscribers was offset by declines in run-off mobile programs. Mobile subscribers were up slightly year-over-year and flat year-to-date as mid-single-digit subscriber growth in North America was offset by declines in other geographies, mostly due to 3 factors: first, the 750,000 subscribers related to a run-off European banking program previously mentioned, which is not expected to be a significant impact in our profitability; second, subscriber growth for existing programs moderating in Asia Pacific; and third, a slower-than-expected recovery from the pandemic in Latin America.  
In Global Automotive, revenue increased 8%, reflecting strong prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Industry auto sales remained elevated in the third quarter, and we benefited from this trend as reflected in the year-over-year growth of our net written premium by 12%. We have though seen this trend begin to normalize beginning into the fourth quarter. 
For the full year, Lifestyle revenues are expected to increase modestly compared to last year's $7.3 billion, mainly driven by global auto and Connected Living growth. For all of 2021, we still expect Global Lifestyle's net operating income to grow in the high single digits compared to 2020. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment is expected to grow double digits year-over-year, which continues to grow at a faster pace than segment net operating income.  
As previously reported, we began our investment in the T-MO in-store repair capability this quarter. However, due to the timing of the rollout, most of our associated start-up costs will occur in the fourth quarter. These costs primarily relate to technician hiring and parts sourcing. We do expect these costs to meaningfully impact Connected Living's profitability as we end the year. In addition, we expect our effective tax rate to return to a more normal level, approximately 23%. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect earnings expansion to continue but more likely at more moderated levels as we continue to invest for growth, including additional implementation start-up costs for in-store service and repair.  
Moving to Global Housing. Net operating income excluding catastrophe losses was $81 million for the third quarter. Including the $78 million of preannounced catastrophe losses, mainly from Hurricane Ida, net operating income totaled $3 million. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings decreased $19 million due to anticipated higher non-cat losses, which returned to levels more in line with historical averages. As a reminder, favorable non-cat losses in 2020 were not representative of historical trends, and third quarter 2020 marked the lowest point of last year, mainly driven by loss experience within lender-placed and specialty products. 
The year-over-year earnings decline was nearly all driven by unfavorable non-cat loss experience from several factors. The largest driver, which contributed close to half of the increase, was from the expected normalization of the non-cat loss ratio. The balance of the decline was split relatively evenly between increased reserves related to our specialty P&C offerings, primarily in our on-demand sharing economy business, as well as higher claims severity. 
Claims severity included moderate impacts from inflationary factors such as higher labor and material costs. While there is always a lag, if this trend continues, we would expect higher loss costs to be offset by increased rates over time. 
In multifamily housing, underlying growth was offset by increased investments to further strengthen our customer experience, including our digital-first capability. Global Housing revenue decreased slightly year-over-year from lower specialty P&C revenues as well as a cat reinstatement premium resulting from Hurricane Ida and lower REO volumes in lender-placed. This was partially offset by higher average insured values and premium rates in lender-placed and growth in multifamily housing. 
We continued to expect Global Housing's net operating income excluding cats to be flat for the full year compared to 2020. For the fourth quarter and into 2022, we would expect non-cat losses to continue to be above 2020 but in line with year-to-date 2021 experience, which is consistent with long-term trends. We also continued to monitor the REO foreclosure moratoriums and any additional extensions that may be announced.  
At Corporate, the net operating loss was $21 million, an improvement of $4 million compared to the third quarter of 2020. This was driven by 2 items: first, lower employee-related expenses and third-party fees; and second, expense savings associated with reducing our real estate footprint. In the fourth quarter, we do anticipate a higher loss due to the timing of spend. 
For the full year 2021, we now expect the Corporate net operating loss to be approximately $80 million, driven by favorable year-to-date results, mainly from the onetime tax and real estate joint venture benefit in the second quarter. This compares to our previous estimate of $85 million. As we look forward to 2022, we would expect our net operating loss in Corporate to be closer to $90 million, more in line with historical trends.  
Turning to the holding company liquidity. Including the net proceeds from the sale of Preneed in August, we ended the third quarter with over $1.3 billion, well above our current minimum target level. In the third quarter, dividends from operating segments totaled $127 million. 
 
In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also had outflows from 3 main items: $323 million of share repurchases, $39 million in common stock dividends and $11 million mainly related to Assurant Ventures investments. In addition to completing our 2019 Investor Day objective of returning $1.35 billion to shareholders from 2019 through 2021, we have also completed roughly 1/4 of our objective to return $900 million  in Global Preneed sale proceeds through share repurchases. For the year overall, we continue to expect dividends to approximate segment earnings, subject to the growth of the businesses, rating agency and regulatory capital requirements and investment portfolio performance.  
I also want to provide a quick update on Assurant Ventures, our venture capital arm. In the third quarter, 3 investments in our portfolio went public via SPACs. We are pleased with the results as the 3 investments exceeded a 7x multiple on investment capital under their respective SPAC transaction terms. These transactions combined with strong performance in the broader ventures portfolio led to a $75 million after-tax gain flowing through net income in the quarter. In addition to strong returns, these investments also provide key insights into emerging technologies and capabilities within our connected consumer businesses.  
Before turning to Q&A, I too would like to take a minute to thank Alan for his partnership over the last 5 years. In addition to positioning Assurant for long-term success and growth, he's created an environment of inclusion and community, truly representative of our core values: common sense and common decency. Alan, I wish you all the very best in retirement. Well deserved.  
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

So first thing I'd emphasize is just the strong partnership that we've had with T-Mobile for many years, which has obviously scaled significantly over time. So we're extremely pleased to have reached a multiyear extension. And then the migration of the Sprint customers on November 1 along with the ramping of same-unit repair inside of 500 T-Mobile stores is obviously very exciting as we look to the future. 
As we've discussed on previous calls, it's not uncommon for us to forgo economics when we re-contract with major clients. That's particularly true if a client scales dramatically over time, which obviously is the case with T-Mobile. As a result of the new agreement going forward, we do expect lower per-unit economics. But I would say that once we get same-unit repair fully ramped and normalize our performance, which will take some time, we do expect overall to be able to more than offset the margin pressure with the additional Sprint volume with economies of scale within the business and obviously, with the addition of the additional in-store repair services. 
And we're really well positioned as partners as we look to continue to drive customer experiences and innovation for the future. So overall, a really strategically important accomplishment for us, not just the renewal, but launching same-unit repair, I think, is critical as we look to accelerate our competitive advantage in the Connected Living business, and this positions us really well."

So this does create a really interesting long-term opportunity for growth. 
And as we've demonstrated over many years, we continue to innovate not just around the products but services, capabilities, how can we invest more around delivering exceptional customer experience. And certainly, a partnership with T-Mobile that is now significantly more scaled, we believe, is going to yield more opportunities to partner together for the future.

As you saw, our covered policies increased a lot, 4 million and 8% from last year. But I would also highlight sales production was well above pre-pandemic levels. So we're seeing really, really strong performance. We achieved almost $1.2 billion of net written premium when you look at the quarterly results. 
I would say that began to normalize a little bit from where we were in the first and second quarter. But it was only modestly down from Q2, up 12% over 2020 and actually up 27% over 2019. So that, we'd certainly expect to taper off going forward. There's obviously constraints around supply chain that's affecting new car sales, but those constraints have been more than offset by the volume that our clients are doing on the used side of the business, which has been very dramatic and overall leading to elevated levels of sales."

So we do expect to see strong performance over time. I would say it's really early.

Assurant operates in businesses that have attracted more attention in regard to inflation, parts and labor costs in automotive, chip shortages in mobile and Global Housing. Housing is a risk-based business where you have inflation exposure that you can mitigate with rate. But I think a lot of investors who look at Assurant are your typical insurance investor and sometimes misunderstand the extent of which the risk in mobile and automotive is ceded off to clients and how it operates on a fee-like basis. 
So I think investors understand this dynamic exists but not the degree of which. So maybe you can give us your thoughts there on how Assurant is positioned in an increasingly inflationary environment."

When we look at it, I would say, short term in this quarter, we mentioned that severities were up a little bit, probably 1/4 of the whole change in the non-cat loss ratio. Those severities are really labor and claims costs increasing there. 
But over the long term, I think we're -- we look at it maybe being slightly positive, at least neutral. Because what happens -- I mean Keith mentioned the reinsurance that we have with our clients on the fee-based side, so there's a large sharing of profitability on that side of the business. But then on the P&C side, where -- housing, whatever, where we are taking on the claims and the risk, there's 2 things that would happen. 
Lender-placed, we have -- average insured values would go up. So as the prices of housing go up with inflation, we would see an increase in our -- in the premiums to the average insured value. Also, over time, we would be able to recover a large part, if not all, of that through our rate filings. So we feel that obviously insulates us quite well. 
And then finally with inflation, over time, we would anticipate that interest rates would increase and we would get an uptick in our investment income. So overall, we're not looking at it as being any type of a significant negative. If anything, it's neutral, could be a small positive."

I expect servicers to actively work with borrowers on loan modifications to keep the loans performing. 
There's so much strength generally in the housing market. Customers have positive equity in the home. So I think a lot of that activity will delay some of the placement rate from flowing through. And certainly, same thing is true on the foreclosure side as well that will affect the REO business.

Maybe let me take that one and give a little bit of history on what we're doing there. So in specialty, we have a variety of products, things like antique auto, a little bit of the international property we write. And we also, a few years ago, started to do a couple of on-demand products related to really following the consumer as they own and rent their home and their car and trying to really build off of our experience in rental and the franchise that we have there. And what we're really doing today is we're insuring a short-term transaction, so think about you're renting your home or you're using your car to make a food delivery. 
And what we're excited about with that business, and then I'll answer the question directly, both -- it's a new distribution channel for us. If you think about we can embed some of our capabilities around rental into a rental of a home. And then what's particularly interesting is the gig economy. And if you think about the workers who are now delivering food or using their car to provide services, it's an interesting opportunity for us to drive not that product as much as our other products, our service contracts, our mobile capabilities, our renter's insurance. So that's really been the genesis of what we're doing there. 
In terms of the reserve this quarter, it's affecting really maybe, what, $5 million, I think was the amount. And it's really development on prior reported claims. So think of it as the catch-up to align with all of our future expectations. And then over the last couple of years, as we've gained experience in this business, we've been modifying our product structures. We've increased rates, and we've put in place extensive reinsurance. So we'll never -- we don't anticipate having any significant or material losses from this business. And in fact, it's been a very well-performing business for us over the last couple of years."

So I think it's a really, really well structured financial deal. And our interests are very aligned, and it's very motivated around delivering an exceptional experience in the store. So I feel really good about not just the deal that we put together but how we're working together with T-Mobile to really change the industry."

You see that we do seem to be at a bottom with placement rates. Now when the forbearance and foreclosure period will end, it will be a slow take-up. We continue to grow in multifamily housing. So we think we're well positioned for 2022. 
Having said that, as Keith mentioned, we still need to continue to invest in ourselves and in our business. And it's not like we're without headwinds in terms of some interest rates or inflation. But I really feel good about where we are as a business totally. And I think Alan has put us in a good position to succeed over the future under Keith's leadership."

So as we look at what's happened since close, trade-in volumes are up significantly. We've seen obviously not just demand from 5G, significant client promotions where trade-ins are the main incentive being used, increasing attach rates and just, I think, pent-up demand coming out of the pandemic. So we talk about the performance of the acquisition, 50% better than we modeled based on '21. So we're thrilled with how it's going. But more than that, really excited about the integration, how well that's working, our ability to protect talent, obviously a significant renewal of a major relationship with AT&T. 
And then as you think about the overall volumes process, we talked about 18 million devices so far this year. That compares to 14 million for full year 2020, and that's overall in total, combining HYLA and Assurant. So yes, HYLA's a big driver of fee income but we've also seen growth on what I would call the legacy Assurant side of the trade-in business as well. And similar trends are happening across clients and across the market, so it's a really strong time for trade-in in the global market."

I think awareness for the programs, the value proposition for our products continues to improve.
