Just to get to the point in terms of expected levels, we would expect at each quarter end to maintain at least $1 billion of homebuilding cash, but would expect most quarters to see between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. I would say the primary driver behind that shift over the last year is we've been building a little bit more. It's just a significant increase in volume and scale and activity, which feel like it's prudent to ensure that we have sufficient cushion to manage significant sudden changes in the business to avoid having any potential liquidity crunches. That just gives us that much more flexibility to respond when we see opportunities in the market. And so we've seen a number of significant shifts in our business over the last few years from a sharp increase in interest rates, which decreased demand in late '18. And to the pandemic disruption in the spring of 2020. To then the very significant increase in demand that we saw in the summer of 2020 and ever since. And so from that standpoint, having a bit more cushion, a bit more liquidity to respond, whichever direction we need to go in the business, we just feel like it's prudent.

But we've been on an ongoing effort to expand our relationships with developers across the country. Of course, our relationship with Forestar continues to bear fruit as well. So a significant portion of the additions to our lot position through options came from our third-party developers and our relationship with Forestar. And with the significant growth we've seen in demand and significant volume increases that we've seen, that we certainly want to make sure we stay in position to maintain. We probably have stepped up our efforts to ensure that we're keeping our pipeline sufficiently out in front of us with the volume we're seeing today. The volume we see today, Matt, as well as looking forward to more medium term, we just don't see a lot of overbuilding, a lot of excess supply in the marketplace relative to household formation demand. And so we want to maintain, as Bill said, adequate support of inventory for that medium-term land. So that's why you're seeing our controlled lot position increased.

First question, I kind of wanted to ask about the underwriting and the gross margins, maybe from another angle and apologies if maybe I'm beating a dead horse here. But with the gross margins at 24%, obviously, that's -- you almost have a very good problem to deal with in kind of keeping those margins extensively to the extent possible at these levels, which are kind of rarefied air for you historically. You mentioned earlier that you haven't seen much appreciation in lot prices, light prices being pretty stable, and the deal flow is pretty attractive right now. But if home price appreciation were to moderate obviously, today, it's in a, let's call it, a high single-digit type of year-over-year dynamic on a same-store basis. If that were to moderate more to like a low single-digit rate. Given where you're underwriting the deals to today, should we expect that gross margin to come in a little bit over the next couple of years? Is that the right way to think about it? Or are there other factors that maybe we're not appreciating?"

But we feel very comfortable with our current lot position that we are going to be able to offset costs going forward and hopefully hang in around this 24% range.

After these rental communities are constructed and achieve a stabilized level of leased occupancy, each community is expected to be marketed for sale. Our single-family rental operations are currently reported in our homebuilding segment.
During the quarter ended December 31, we completed our first sale of a single-family rental community representing 124 homes for $31.8 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $14 million. We currently expect one more sale of a single-family rail community later this fiscal year. At December 31, our homebuilding fixed assets included $106.6 million of assets related to our single-family rental platform, representing 13 communities totaling 890 single-family rental homes and owned finished lots. We still expect our total investments in our single and multifamily rental platforms to more than double during fiscal 2021. Bill?"

I would say the primary driver behind that shift over the last year is we've been building a little bit more. It's just a significant increase in volume and scale and activity, which feel like it's prudent to ensure that we have sufficient cushion to manage significant sudden changes in the business to avoid having any potential liquidity crunches. That just gives us that much more flexibility to respond when we see opportunities in the market. And so we've seen a number of significant shifts in our business over the last few years from a sharp increase in interest rates, which decreased demand in late '18. And to the pandemic disruption in the spring of 2020. To then the very significant increase in demand that we saw in the summer of 2020 and ever since. And so from that standpoint, having a bit more cushion, a bit more liquidity to respond, whichever direction we need to go in the business, we just feel like it's prudent.

But we've been on an ongoing effort to expand our relationships with developers across the country. Of course, our relationship with Forestar continues to bear fruit as well. So a significant portion of the additions to our lot position through options came from our third-party developers and our relationship with Forestar. And with the significant growth we've seen in demand and significant volume increases that we've seen, that we certainly want to make sure we stay in position to maintain. We probably have stepped up our efforts to ensure that we're keeping our pipeline sufficiently out in front of us with the volume we're seeing today. The volume we see today, Matt, as well as looking forward to more medium term, we just don't see a lot of overbuilding, a lot of excess supply in the marketplace relative to household formation demand. And so we want to maintain, as Bill said, adequate support of inventory for that medium-term land. So that's why you're seeing our controlled lot position increased.

And I'm curious, we hear from a lot of builders. When we underwrite land, we assume today's absorptions today is pricing. And obviously, the current environment makes that a little bit tricky because your margins and your absorptions are at cycle highs. So I'm curious, as you look at the composition of the land you've tied up over the last 12 months, could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about underwriting to gross margin, to return on inventory to absorptions, whatever metrics you guys think about internally?

You mentioned earlier that you haven't seen much appreciation in lot prices, light prices being pretty stable, and the deal flow is pretty attractive right now. But if home price appreciation were to moderate obviously, today, it's in a, let's call it, a high single-digit type of year-over-year dynamic on a same-store basis. If that were to moderate more to like a low single-digit rate.

The D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding first quarter, which included a 98% increase in consolidated pretax income to over $1 billion, a 48% increase in revenues to $5.9 billion, and a 56% increase in net sales orders to 20,418. Our pretax profit margin for the quarter improved 440 basis points to 17.4%, while our earnings increased 84% to $2.14 per diluted share. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31 was 28%, and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 24.4%. These results reflect the strength of our homebuilding and financial services teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint, and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Housing market conditions remain very strong, and our teams are focused on maximizing returns and improving capital efficiency in each of our communities while increasing our market share.
However, we remain cautious regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic or other external factors may have on the economy and our operations in the future. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and experienced teams position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our home blending operations and managing our product offering, incentives, home prices, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments.

The sequential increase in our gross margin from September to December exceeded our expectations and reflects the broad strength of the housing market across almost all of our markets. We continue to see very strong demand and a limited supply of homes, especially at affordable price points, and we still have pricing power and are currently using very few sales incentives. 
On a per square foot basis, our revenues were up 4% from the prior year quarter, while our stick and brick cost per square foot was down 1.5%, and our lot cost per square foot was up 4%. Sequentially, our revenues were flat on a per square foot basis, while our stick and brick cost per square foot decreased 1.5%, and our lot cost decreased 1.5%. Although we didn't see the impact of rising costs in our December quarter, we do expect both our construction and lot costs will increase on a per square foot basis in our homes closed next quarter. 
With the strength of today's market conditions, we expect to offset these cost pressures with price increases, and currently expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter. We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the return on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand.

But I'm reminded about that statement, luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. And you guys have done a great job over the last couple of years preparing for this situation. And so I wanted to ask you about your comment as to capital allocation. Because you indicated there that you are wanting to carry higher cash levels than normal for the foreseeable future. I think you made reference to some uncertainty in the current environment. But arguably, homebuilding is always difficult to predict. And so I'm curious, what is a good rule of thumb for modeling your cash levels going forward? And what are the kind of things that you're looking to fade or dissipate in order to pave the way for you to hold lower cash levels than that?"

Just to get to the point in terms of the expected levels, we would expect at each quarter end to maintain at least $1 billion of homebuilding cash, but would expect most quarters to see between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. I would say the primary driver behind that shift over the last year is we've been building a little bit more. It's just a significant increase in volume and scale and activity, which feel like it's prudent to ensure that we have sufficient cushion to manage significant sudden changes in the business to avoid having any potential liquidity crunches. That just gives us that much more flexibility to respond when we see opportunities in the market. 
And so we've seen a number of significant shifts in our business over the last few years from a sharp increase in interest rates, which decreased demand in late '18 to the pandemic disruption in the spring of 2020 to then the very significant increase in demand that we saw in the summer of 2020 and ever since. And so from that standpoint, having a bit more cushion, a bit more liquidity to respond, whichever direction we need to go in the business, we just feel like it's prudent. I don't see us changing that strategy. I think that just puts us in a very strong and flexible position to respond to market changes."

But if home price appreciation were to moderate obviously, today, it's in a, let's call it, a high single-digit type of year-over-year dynamic on a same-store basis.

And additionally, you're expecting SG&A ratio to be flat sequentially versus historically, a little bit better.

Deliveries were a little bit ahead of what we had guided to in addition to ASP is a little higher, which drives a little more SG&A leverage. Something Jessica touched on before is the lower level of completed inventory, especially the completed specs that were carrying the business today, able to operate the inventory portfolio very efficiently. And that requires less SG&A to maintain and care for those homes while they're sitting completed because we do run those costs through SG&A.

After reinvesting in our homebuilding business, our cash flow priorities are balanced among increasing our investment in both our multi and single-family rental platforms, maintaining our conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying dividends and repurchasing shares to reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 1.5% from the beginning of fiscal 2021.

We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. 
Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts continue to be remarkable. We are incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations.

Build times have elongated a bit with supply chain disruptions and some of the labor availability. 
Our production process, our consistent cadence of starts helps us overcome a lot of that. Selling homes after we've started them in their production cycle gives us more assurance of a completion date. And we're able to better work with the buyers on matching that completion and closing date, align with what they need to move in for whatever situation they're coming from. So keeping that buyer happy through the process, and most importantly, that day, they move in their house, they're very happy with the completed deal or new home that they've just purchased."

But I'd also think you could increase production within each type of community, like each supervisor running a little more labor or paying overtime rates or whatever. So what I'm wondering is, as you look at your absorption rates today, per community, how much room is there from here to increase either your mix of higher running communities, higher absorption communities?

Whereas in the resale market, most homes are now selling above asking price.
And so given the prices in the resale market are up, gosh, pretty close to 20% right now, isn't it right to think that your prices in your community should be able to rise further from here based simply on the pricing that has already been achieved in the resale market and which obviously, first-time buyers are paying?

We plan to continue maintaining higher homebuilding cash balances and liquidity than in prior years to support the increased scale and activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 16.8% at the end of March, with $2.5 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding and no senior note maturities in the next 12 months. At March 31, our stockholders' equity was $13 billion, and book value per share was $35.96, up 25% from a year ago. 
For the trailing 12 months ended March, our return on equity was 27.1% compared to 19.1% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $72.7 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in May. 
We repurchased 4.5 million shares of common stock for $350.4 million during the quarter, and the remaining outstanding share repurchase authorization at March 31 was $115.1 million. This week, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase authorization replacing the company's previous authorization. The new authorization has no expiration date. We are committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis, and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year. Jessica?"

We anticipate a financial services pretax profit margin of approximately 45%, and we expect our income tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23% for the quarter. For the full fiscal year of 2021, we now expect consolidated revenues of $26.8 billion to $27.5 billion and to close between 82,500 and 84,500 homes. We still expect to generate positive cash flow from our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2021. However, we are not providing specific guidance for our homebuilding cash flow this year as we prioritize augmenting our housing and land and lot inventories to support higher demand. 
After reinvesting in our homebuilding business, our cash flow priorities are balanced among increasing our investment in both our multi and single-family rental platforms, maintaining our conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying dividends and repurchasing shares to reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 1.5% from the beginning of fiscal 2021.

So we will wait until the home is still ready, and the buyer is satisfied with the home to be in there. At the same time, buyers are very anxious to get in their homes. Build times have elongated a bit with supply chain disruptions and some of the labor availability. 
Our production process, our consistent cadence of starts helps us overcome a lot of that. Selling homes after we've started them in their production cycle gives us more assurance of a completion date. And we're able to better work with the buyers on matching that completion and closing date, align with what they need to move in for whatever situation they're coming from. So keeping that buyer happy through the process, and most importantly, that day, they move in their house, they're very happy with the completed deal or new home that they've just purchased."

I want to ask you guys about production capacity. Putting community count growth aside, because everyone is very focused on that, I'm focused on the potential for your absorption, unit production per community to increase from here. One way is, obviously, through a mix of communities, bringing on larger communities. I think you referred to that a little bit, or more entry level communities, which naturally have a higher level absorption. 
But I'd also think you could increase production within each type of community, like each supervisor running a little more labor or paying overtime rates or whatever. So what I'm wondering is, as you look at your absorption rates today, per community, how much room is there from here to increase either your mix of higher running communities, higher absorption communities? Or  -- and I should say, how much ability is there to increase your throughput within each type of community through -- from here, given that your starts are up 34%, I think or so, this past quarter?"

And that drives a very good result for our shareholders. And we talked about absorption as a global deal. It's really subdivision-by-subdivision, market-by-market. And our improvement in the platform and in the -- what had been our smaller markets, scaling up to become big markets, has been nothing short of phenomenal. I mean, we've got great operators out there that, I think, have a lot of room to scale up, and they're positioned to do it and we've got a market that has really derisked that effort.

Whereas in the resale market, most homes are now selling above asking price.
And so given the prices in the resale market are up, gosh, pretty close to 20% right now, isn't it right to think that your prices in your community should be able to rise further from here based simply on the pricing that has already been achieved in the resale market and which obviously, first-time buyers are paying?

Our FICO scores stayed extremely stable as have our debt-to-income levels. So it's showing us that the buyer and the consumer is healthy today.

I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding third quarter, highlighted by a 78% increase in earnings to $3.06 per diluted share. Our consolidated pretax income increased 81% on a 35% increase in revenues to $7.3 billion, and our pretax profit margin improved 490 basis points to 19.4%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 34.9%, and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 29.5%. 
These results reflect our experienced teams and the production capabilities, our ability to leverage the -- scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. 
Housing market conditions remain very robust, and we are focused on maximizing returns and increasing our market share further. However, multiple disruptions in the supply chain, combined with the improvement in economic conditions and strong demand for new homes, have resulted in shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market, which has caused our construction time to become less predictable. As our top priority is to consistently fulfill our commitments to our homebuyers, we have slowed our home sales pace to more closely align to our current production levels and are selling homes later in the construction cycle when we can better ensure the certainty of home close date for our homebuyers. We expect to work through these issues and increase our production capacity. 
We started construction on 22,600 homes this quarter, and our homes and inventory increased 44% from a year ago to 47,300 homes at June 30, 2021, positioning us to finish 2021 strong and to achieve double-digit growth again in 2022. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments.

For the quarter, 98% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 66% of our home buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 45% of the mortgage company's volume.

During the 9 months ended June, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $276 million, even while we have reinvested significant operating capital to expand our homebuilding inventories in response to strong demand. At June 30, we had $3.7 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.7 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. We believe this level of homebuilding cash and liquidity is appropriate to support the increased scale and activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 16% at the end of June with $2.5 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding and no senior note maturities in the next 12 months. 
At June 30, our stockholders' equity was $13.8 billion and book value per share was $38.54, up 27% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended June, our return on equity was 29.5% compared to 19.9% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $72.1 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in August. 
We repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock for $241.2 million during the quarter for a total of 8.1 million shares repurchased fiscal year-to-date for $661.4 million.

It's more ongoing supply constraints, yet your orders are down 17%, and that's in contrast to prior commentary of flat to down single digits.

And so as we're managing that and trying to manage the customer experience is as best we can, that has resulted in us releasing sales in more communities later in the construction cycle than we were previously. So it's been, I would say, an incremental restriction of sales that's resulted in probably a bit more of a sales order restriction than we would have anticipated a quarter ago. But it's something that as we work through the supply chain issues and start to have better visibility and get more of our production later in the construction cycle and essentially catch up a bit on production, then we'll be able to probably resume a better pace on sales orders."

I mean that is an extended pretty of time right now.

We really are trying to improve the experience of the homebuyer. And when we give somebody a day to close, we intend to -- it because their whole life revolves around that. And as the certainty of close date was impacted by windows installation, anything and everything that -- appliances that was taking place through the last 6 months, it just became obvious to us that we need to be more restricted than what we're doing. 
Trust me, it is soul-crushing to our salespeople to have somebody walk in, ready, willing, able to buy and being told that we have houses that will be coming available in 30 to 45 days, and we will be glad to call you. What is different to me this market cycle than any other than I've ever been a part of is that, 30 or 45 days later, you call that person, and yes, they're still trying to buy a house.

It stands, obviously, in stark contrast to 2018 through 2020, where you also had periods of home price appreciation, not anywhere near the same level, but you were able to maintain that average closing price right around 300 for 3 straight years. 
So the question is what are you doing going forward to -- I understand that, obviously, you have a price that's maybe below most of your peers, but still that monthly payment has been something that you guys pride yourselves on. Is there any actions that you can take over the next year or 2 to -- perhaps to reverse that trend either through building slightly further out or maybe slightly different footprints or more attached products, whatever it might be, to perhaps reverse that trend, particularly to the extent that rates might rise. The real concerns here in the marketplace is that the current price, maybe it's okay in the current backdrop but might be more vulnerable in the next year or 2. So anything that you're doing in terms of your product mix, your geographic mix that might help solve those issues?"

Typically, this time of year, we'd be sitting on 40%, 45% specs. Today, the only specs we have are at our houses we haven't released to the market. So again, it's -- we're trying to drive efficiency in the process. And by controlling when that house is sold, if it does help, we'll meet customer expectation. And it also eliminates a lot of frustration on the building side, where a buyer is coming out and they have been told -- they bought a house in January, and they have been told they'd be moving into June and the house [indiscernible] to move into. So they're out there every day monitoring the progress of their house against the progress of every other home in the community. And it just adds a level of difficulty that, to be honest with you right now today, we don't want and we don't need. And it's -- if somebody gets frustrated in the build process, they stay frustrated for a very long time. Very hard to meet the expectation once they get up to it. So by limiting that, by pushing the maturity of our inventory further down the process before we inject a buyer into, we're trying to take some of the pressure off our trades and our builders. And when did that process take place. I will tell you, in some divisions, it started in January and then it went other divisions in February. And really by April -- in April, 1st of May, it took hold in some of our very large divisions in the state of Texas. 
And it just got to the point where we were spending more time -- we were spending a significant amount of time dealing with the customers' frustration on this close date of their house at the expense of other things we could be doing that would drive future efficiency and production capabilities. So again, it's -- it was a process that took place over multiple months, beginning in one division and ending really ending in Texas. 
So Don Horton has said many times, never thought he'd see a day when he couldn't build every house he could sell in the state of Texas. I can tell you today, there's not enough lots or trade capacity to meet demand in the state of Texas. I don't care if you're Don Horton or any of the other public builders out there. It's very difficult to get a house built today. We're doing a better job than anybody else, and we're going to get better at what we're doing. It's -- there is a tremendous amount of demand out there."

And the question then, of course, is will the demand be sufficient to absorb that. Because right now, it's probably a little tricky to get a firm grasp on what that demand is when you're turning buyers away. So are you tracking that on your kind of a local basis, what other builders are doing in terms of restricting sales but starting homes? And how would you anticipate responding if, let's just say, later this year or in your fiscal 1Q, you start releasing more homes for sale, other builders do the same thing and the demand is not quite what you expected it to be?

Rising interest rates always are a significant cost input into the value of the homes and the monthly payment. We monitor obviously that very closely and looking at affordability. I think Jessica touched on it before with 2 points and the stress testing we did the backlog. The backlog can withstand some interest rate upward movement right now. 
In addition, the DTI, the debt-to-income levels we're seeing in our borrowers this most recent quarter actually ticking down a little bit despite the average loan size going up. So the credit quality of our buyers are good. Looking at our for-sale communities, the vast majority of the buyers of those homes are owner-occupied homes. We don't have any institutional relational outtake programs in our for-sale communities. Our institutional focus would be on the build-to-rent communities, which are separate and apart from the for-sale side of our business. 
It's hard to know all the things that may change in the future, Ken. But one thing we do focus on and have focused on for many years is maintaining a very strong flexible balance sheet, as you said, where we have great low leverage, strong equity capitalization and very good liquidity. That allows us to take advantage of the market conditions as they change and continue to consolidate market share, especially at a local level where we can turn that local market share leverage and do outperformance."

I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding third quarter, highlighted by a 78% increase in earnings to $3.06 per diluted share. Our consolidated pretax income increased 81% on a 35% increase in revenues to $7.3 billion, and our pretax profit margin improved 490 basis points to 19.4%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 34.9%, and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 29.5%. 
These results reflect our experienced teams and the production capabilities, our ability to leverage the -- scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. 
Housing market conditions remain very robust, and we are focused on maximizing returns and increasing our market share further. However, multiple disruptions in the supply chain, combined with the improvement in economic conditions and strong demand for new homes, have resulted in shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market, which has caused our construction time to become less predictable. As our top priority is to consistently fulfill our commitments to our homebuyers, we have slowed our home sales pace to more closely align to our current production levels and are selling homes later in the construction cycle when we can better ensure the certainty of home close date for our homebuyers. We expect to work through these issues and increase our production capacity. 
We started construction on 22,600 homes this quarter, and our homes and inventory increased 44% from a year ago to 47,300 homes at June 30, 2021, positioning us to finish 2021 strong and to achieve double-digit growth again in 2022. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments.

The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 17%, down from 22% in the prior year quarter. 
As David described, in this very strong demand environment, our local teams are restricting the sales order pace in each of their communities based on the number of homes in inventory, construction time and lot position. They continue to adjust sales pace -- prices to market on a community-by-community basis while staying focused on providing value to our buyers. 
Based on the stage of completion of our current homes and inventory, production schedules and capacity, we expect to continue restricting the pace of our sales orders during our fourth fiscal quarter. As a result, we expect our fourth quarter net sales orders to be lower than the third quarter.

And I think there's some concern in the market, which I share, that, that pricing dynamic may be beginning to negatively impact sales rates. I'm curious if that's something you felt that you saw, you've said a lot of positive things about demand, and whether or not now the restriction on sales, it looks like it's far more important to you to manage absorption pace than pricing it. And I also know that's made -- that decision is made at a local level. So can you sort of help untangle that for me that are we really not using price and just using price to cover costs and because demand is good?

So it's been, I would say, an incremental restriction of sales that's resulted in probably a bit more of a sales order restriction than we would have anticipated a quarter ago.

And as the certainty of close date was impacted by windows installation, anything and everything that -- appliances that was taking place through the last 6 months, it just became obvious to us that we need to be more restricted than what we're doing. 
Trust me, it is soul-crushing to our salespeople to have somebody walk in, ready, willing, able to buy and being told that we have houses that will be coming available in 30 to 45 days, and we will be glad to call you.

Typically, this time of year, we'd be sitting on 40%, 45% specs. Today, the only specs we have are at our houses we haven't released to the market. So again, it's -- we're trying to drive efficiency in the process. And by controlling when that house is sold, if it does help, we'll meet customer expectation. And it also eliminates a lot of frustration on the building side, where a buyer is coming out and they have been told -- they bought a house in January, and they have been told they'd be moving into June and the house [indiscernible] to move into. So they're out there every day monitoring the progress of their house against the progress of every other home in the community. And it just adds a level of difficulty that, to be honest with you right now today, we don't want and we don't need. And it's -- if somebody gets frustrated in the build process, they stay frustrated for a very long time. Very hard to meet the expectation once they get up to it. So by limiting that, by pushing the maturity of our inventory further down the process before we inject a buyer into, we're trying to take some of the pressure off our trades and our builders. And when did that process take place. I will tell you, in some divisions, it started in January and then it went other divisions in February. And really by April -- in April, 1st of May, it took hold in some of our very large divisions in the state of Texas. 
And it just got to the point where we were spending more time -- we were spending a significant amount of time dealing with the customers' frustration on this close date of their house at the expense of other things we could be doing that would drive future efficiency and production capabilities. So again, it's -- it was a process that took place over multiple months, beginning in one division and ending really ending in Texas. 
So Don Horton has said many times, never thought he'd see a day when he couldn't build every house he could sell in the state of Texas. I can tell you today, there's not enough lots or trade capacity to meet demand in the state of Texas. I don't care if you're Don Horton or any of the other public builders out there. It's very difficult to get a house built today. We're doing a better job than anybody else, and we're going to get better at what we're doing.

And usually, our first read, Alan, is on the existing home side. So our local guys are very in tune with what's going on with both existing home inventory and other public builders in their market. And as always, we can adjust our start schedule up or down based on market conditions. 
So if what you're saying were to come true, and there start to be signs of some sort of increased supply in the market that the demand is not going to be there for, which right now feels like we are a long ways away from, we would be able to adjust our starts accordingly community by community where we saw those signs, like we always do, to make sure we don't end up with an excess supply of completed specs. But with 500 completed homes across the country today, we're just so far from having that conversation on a national level. But those are things that our local operators certainly pay attention to all the time when they're looking at their business plan and what they're going to do going forward. Our plan would be to continue to consolidate market share regardless of market conditions. And we believe we're going to continue to be the best positioned to do that kind of regardless of what the demand profile looks like in future periods."

David, you mentioned obviously many times this is unlike anything you've seen in terms of having to turn buyers away. When I look at your business, obviously, the one big thing that's changed in terms of your strategy now versus prior cycles on the land strategy. You own a lot fewer lots or a much smaller supply of land on a year supply basis than you have in the past. And you're more reliant on third-party developers through option contracts, et cetera. So I'm curious what you're seeing from the developers, are they facing outsized pressure on their development time lines vis-a-vis perhaps what you're seeing on your own portfolio? And is that, in any way, slowing the process down? It's not just you. Obviously, the whole industry is shifting more towards that strategy.

In addition, the DTI, the debt-to-income levels we're seeing in our borrowers this most recent quarter actually ticking down a little bit despite the average loan size going up. So the credit quality of our buyers are good. Looking at our for-sale communities, the vast majority of the buyers of those homes are owner-occupied homes.

But one thing we do focus on and have focused on for many years is maintaining a very strong flexible balance sheet, as you said, where we have great low leverage, strong equity capitalization and very good liquidity. That allows us to take advantage of the market conditions as they change and continue to consolidate market share, especially at a local level where we can turn that local market share leverage and do outperformance."

I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding third quarter, highlighted by a 78% increase in earnings to $3.06 per diluted share. Our consolidated pretax income increased 81% on a 35% increase in revenues to $7.3 billion, and our pretax profit margin improved 490 basis points to 19.4%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 34.9%, and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 29.5%. 
These results reflect our experienced teams and the production capabilities, our ability to leverage new order scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Housing market conditions remain very robust, and we are focused on maximizing returns and increasing our market share further. 
However, multiple disruptions in the supply chain, combined with the improvement in economic conditions and strong demand for new homes, have resulted in shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market, which has caused our construction time to become less predictable. As our top priority is to consistently fulfill our commitments to our homebuyers, we have slowed our home sales pace to more closely align to our current production levels and are selling homes later in the construction cycle when we can better ensure the certainty of home close date for our homebuyers. We expect to work through these issues and increase our production capacity. 
We started construction on 22,600 homes this quarter, and our homes and inventory increased 44% from a year ago to 47,300 homes at June 30, 2021, positioning us to finish 2021 strong and to achieve double-digit growth again in 2022. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. 
We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments. Mike?"

The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 17%, down from 22% in the prior year quarter. 
As David described, in this very strong demand environment, our local teams are restricting the sales order pace in each of their communities based on the number of homes and inventory, construction time and lot position. They continue to adjust sales pace -- prices to market on a community-by-community basis while staying focused on providing value to our buyers. 
Based on the stage of completion of our current homes and inventory, production schedules and capacity, we expect to continue restricting the pace of our sales orders during our fourth fiscal quarter. As a result, we expect our fourth quarter net sales orders to be lower than the third quarter. However, we are confident that we will be well positioned to deliver double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2022 with 32,200 homes in backlog, 47,300 homes in inventory, a robust lot supply and strong trade and supplier relationships.

We're all focused on improving returns. And it's -- I think it's going to extend the cycle again. But again, we're not charts water from a demand aspect right now"

So again, it's -- we're trying to drive efficiency in the process. 
And by controlling when that house is sold, if it does help, we'll meet customer expectation. And it also eliminates a lot of frustration on the building side, where a buyer is coming out and they have been told -- they bought a house in January, and they have been told they'd be moving into June and the house is ready to move into. So they're out there every day monitoring the progress of their house against the progress of every other home in the community. 
And it just adds a level of difficulty that, to be honest with you right now today, we don't want and we don't need. And it's -- if somebody gets frustrated in the build process, they stay frustrated for a very long time. Very hard to meet the expectation once they get upset. So by limiting that, by pushing the maturity of our inventory further down the process before we inject a buyer into. 
We're trying to take some of the pressure off our trades and our builders. And when did that process take place. I will tell you, in some divisions, it started in January and then it went other divisions in February. And really by April -- in April, 1st of May, it took hold in some of our very large divisions in the state of Texas. 
And it just got to the point where we were spending more time -- we were spending a significant amount of time dealing with the customers' frustration on this close date of their house at the expense of other things we could be doing that would drive future efficiency and production capabilities. So again, it's -- it was a process that took place over multiple months, beginning in one division and ending in really ending in May in Texas. 
So Don Horton has said many times, never thought he'd see a day when he couldn't build every house he could sell in the state of Texas. I can tell you today, there's not enough lots or trade capacity to meet demand in the state of Texas. I don't care if you're Don Horton or any of the other public builders out there.

I think, obviously, a lot of questions on the home price increases and what impact that could have on affordability. You said you've seen the credit profile of your buyers keeping pace with the home price increases you've instituted up to this point. 
Which I was a little surprised at just given the fact we know incomes are not up 20% year-over-year, and rates are pretty stable now after obviously going down quite a bit in the second half of last year, so should I interpret that to imply that maybe the mix of your buyers or the buyers in your interest lists are kind of slowly shifting maybe towards more of a move-up buyer or at least a more affluent first-time buyer than you've historically seen over the last few years?"

And we look at the existing home inventory levels that are available in given marketplaces, they're just not there. And so the quick move in homes, the specs we had that were completed last year, obviously, they were absorbed very quickly into the marketplace. 
We restricted the sale of a lot of our homes to give better certainty to that homebuyer in the process of their delivery date and with -- in a rising price environment, when we're restricting the sale that we're able to price to market at the time we signed the contract, which is then closer to the delivery date."

So I guess the follow-up to that point then is, obviously, it's an incredibly tight supply environment today. You guys are holding back sales, restricting sales. A lot of other builders are kind of doing or saying the same thing. So it would seem like if you kind of connect the dots here, a lot of homes are being started today. Not a lot of those homes yet are released for sale. 
So at some point in the future, you would think inventory is going to come to the market in a pretty meaningful way. And the question then, of course, is will the demand be sufficient to absorb that? Because right now, it's probably a little tricky to get a firm grasp on what that demand is when you're turning buyers away. 
So are you tracking that on your kind of a local basis, what other builders are doing in terms of restricting sales but starting homes? And how would you anticipate responding if, let's just say, later this year or in your fiscal 1Q, you start releasing more homes for sale, other builders do the same thing and the demand is not quite what you expected it to be? Are you willing to accept a lower absorption pace? Are you going to start at that point to maybe discount a little bit? What would the thought process be?"

So if what you're saying were to come true, and there start to be signs of some sort of increased supply in the market that the demand is not going to be there for, which right now feels like we are a long ways away from, we would be able to adjust our starts accordingly community by community where we saw those signs, like we always do, to make sure we don't end up with an excess supply of completed specs. 
But with 500 completed homes across the country today, we're just so far from having that conversation on a national level. But those are things that our local operators certainly pay attention to all the time when they're looking at their business plan and what they're going to do going forward.

And you're more reliant on third-party developers through option contracts, et cetera. So I'm curious what you're seeing from the developers, are they facing outsized pressure on their development time lines vis-a-vis perhaps what you're seeing on your own portfolio?

I don't want our operators to have a false expectation about the pricing that's achievable in the market by having a guy from California bid on a house and stuff, look on a guy in Texas.

Rising interest rates always are a significant cost input into the value of the homes and the monthly payment. We monitor obviously that very closely and looking at affordability. I think Jessica touched on it before with 2 points and the stress testing we did the backlog. The backlog can withstand some interest rate upward movement right now. 
In addition, the DTI, the debt-to-income levels we're seeing in our borrowers this most recent quarter actually ticking down a little bit despite the average loan size going up. So the credit quality of our buyers are good. Looking at our for-sale communities, the vast majority of the buyers of those homes are owner-occupied homes. 
We don't have any institutional relational outtake programs in our for-sale communities. Our institutional focus would be on the build-to-rent communities, which are separate and apart from the for-sale side of our business. It's hard to know all the things that may change in the future, Ken. 
But one thing we do focus on and have focused on for many years is maintaining a very strong flexible balance sheet, as you said, where we have great low leverage, strong equity capitalization and very good liquidity. That allows us to take advantage of the market conditions as they change and continue to consolidate market share, especially at a local level where we can turn that local market share leverage and do outperformance."

Given that Paul is new to his role, he will not be an active participant today, but we are glad to have him with us and believe his extensive homebuilding experience will strengthen our executive team. The D.R. Horton team finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, which included a 63% increase in consolidated pretax income to $1.7 billion and a 27% increase in revenue to $8.1 billion. Our pretax profit margin for the quarter improved 480 basis points to 21.3%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 65% to $3.70. 
For the year, consolidated pretax income increased 80% to $5.4 billion on a $27.8 billion of revenue. Our pretax profit margin for the year improved 460 basis points to 19.3%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 78% to $11.41. We closed a record 81,965 homes this year, an increase of over 16,500 homes or 25% from last year, while also achieving a historical low homebuilding SG&A percentage of 7.3%. Our homebuilding return on inventory was 37.9% and our return on equity was 31.6%. These results reflect our experienced teams and their production capabilities. Our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Our homebuilding cash flow from operations for 2021 was $1.2 billion. Over the past 5 years, we have generated $5.9 billion of cash flow from homebuilding operations, while growing our consolidated revenues by 128% and our earnings per share by 383%. 
During this time, we also more than doubled our book value per share, reduced our homebuilding leverage to under 20% and increased our homebuilding liquidity by $2.8 billion, all while significantly increasing our returns on inventory and equity. Housing market conditions remain very robust, and we are focused on maximizing returns and increasing our market share further. However, there are still significant challenges in the supply chain, including shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market. As a result, we continued restricting our home sales pace during the fourth quarter by selling homes later in the construction cycle to align with our production levels and better ensure certainty of home closing date for our homebuyers. We expect to work through the supply chain challenges and ultimately increase our production capacity. After starting construction on 22,400 homes this quarter, our homes in inventory increased 26% from a year ago to 47,800 homes at September 30, 2021. In October, we started more than 8,000 homes, further positioning us to achieve double-digit growth again in 2022. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize our returns.

Our average number of active selling communities decreased 5% from the prior year and was down 3% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the fourth quarter was [ $378,300 ] up 23% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the fourth quarter was 19%, flat with the prior year quarter. As David described, new home demand remains very strong, and our local teams are continuing to restrict our sales order pace where necessary on a community-by-community basis based on the number of homes in inventory, construction times, production capacity and lot position. They also continue to adjust sales prices to market while staying focused on providing value to our buyers. We are still restricting the pace of our sales orders during our first fiscal quarter, but to a lesser extent than during our fourth quarter. As a result, we expect our first quarter net sales orders to be approximately equal to or slightly higher than our 20,418 sales orders in the first quarter last year.

So the 24-month cash back is still a part of every deal we underwrite and has been a primary factor, I think, in driving our optional acquisition because it's -- we have to find partners. We have to control the lots we want to control. So we've got to be good partners for these tens. And that's been a focus through this entire cycle.

I would say more recently, one thing that is impacting our turns and our ability to actually return our cash in 24 months is the extension of our construction times with the supply chain delays. We have seen further elongation of our construction times, I believe, on a year-over-year basis. Our closings this quarter were the construction times were longer by about 7 weeks, which is a bit longer than we would have reported last quarter. And so that is a factor that is causing a bit of friction in our inventory turns right now.

I don't think in any way it's sales have been reflective of the demand environment. We have consciously chosen not to push our sales contracts and take advantage of that demand until we can meet those customer expectations properly. So we've seen that our completed homes in inventory that are unsold are still below 1,000 homes, and that's scattered across the country.

Understanding, obviously, a lot's in flux, but as you look through the rest of the year, obviously, a lot of people are focusing on the reduction of lumber costs as a tailwind. At the same time, you have some other headwinds in terms of additional cost inflation, and I guess, assuming incentives and discounts are steady. Just trying to get a sense of how you think at this point between lumber and other areas of cost inflation and the current pricing that you have in place, how things might progress throughout the rest of '22?"

So you heard our specific gross margin guide for fiscal Q1, which was essentially relatively in line with Q4. As Bill mentioned, continued lumber headwinds in that December quarter. Some of that does back off as we move throughout next year. But ultimately, the gross margin that we achieved for fiscal 2022 as a whole is going to be dependent on the strength of the spring selling season. which we're pretty far out on. But I think we do feel with the strength in today's market, we should be in a very good position to continue to hopefully at least maintain gross margins from here. but we'll update as necessary as we move throughout the year and see how the spring unfolds and some of the supply chain pressures that are continuing to drive some cost increases."

And trying to -- during coating to get places being not only from an executive officer standpoint, but from a regional president standpoint. We were asking [ gas ] to get on place and really became less and less comfortable with that. So I think on the last call, I made a statement about infrastructure and then immediately had a kind of we're talking about it because the infrastructure I was talking about was our platform, which was a dual COO roles and then doubling our reach count. And it -- so that we're continuing to scale up our platform to make to coincide with the scale up in market share that we're gaining. And we've got great people that have performed at exceptional levels. But as you move up that next step, the role changes and the skill set changes. So you've got to get young guys in a position, in my mind anyway, and what we've talked about up here. You've got to get the younger guy into a position regional role, where he's working through divisions instead of on top of vision, and it's a training process. And so while we've got a great market, while we're scaling up in absorptions, we need to scale up in people. And Paul gives us the ability to touch the regional guys more consistently and to be in the market more consistently. He travels, Mike travels, I travel. And by increasing the number of regions we were then able to elevate people within divisions to leadership roles. And it's just kind of a consistency there stuff where we get more people access to that role and give them a chance to learn that job before something happens and you were forced to make a change. So it's a part of continuing to scale for our next 5 years in a row. And it's -- we've got great people, and we've got an incredibly strong management team. That's something that, to be honest with you, I think about all the time. It's the quality of our people at the division level and region level compared to when I started to the company compared to when we went public or even compared to the last cycle, what I call super-cycle.

D.R. Horton team finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, which included a 63% increase in consolidated pretax income to $1.7 billion and a 27% increase in revenue to $8.1 billion. Our pretax profit margin for the quarter improved 480 basis points to 21.3% and our earnings per diluted share increased 65% to $3.70.  
For the year, consolidated pretax income increased 80% to $5.4 billion on a $27.8 billion of revenue. Our pretax profit margin for the year improved 460 basis points to 19.3%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 78% to $11.41. We closed a record 81,965 homes this year, an increase of over 16,500 homes or 25% from last year, while also achieving a historical low homebuilding SG&A percentage of 7.3%. 
Our homebuilding return on inventory was 37.9% and our return on equity was 31.6%. These results reflect our experienced teams and their production capabilities. Our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Our homebuilding cash flow from operations for 2021 was $1.2 billion. Over the past 5 years, we have generated $5.9 billion of cash flow from homebuilding operations, while growing our consolidated revenues by 128% and our earnings per share by 383%.  
During this time, we also more than doubled our book value per share, reduced our homebuilding leverage under 20%, and increased our homebuilding liquidity by $2.8 billion, all while significantly increasing our returns on inventory and equity. 
Housing market conditions remain very robust, and we are focused on maximizing returns and increasing our market share further. However, there are still significant challenges in the supply chain, including shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market. As a result, we continued restricting our home sales pace during the fourth quarter by selling homes later in the construction cycle to align with our production levels and better ensure certainty of home closing date for our homebuyers. 
We expect to work through the supply chain challenges and ultimately increase our production capacity. After starting construction on 22,400 homes this quarter, our homes in inventory increased 26% from a year ago to 47,800 homes at September 30, 2021. In October, we started more than 8,000 homes, further positioning us to achieve double-digit growth again in 2022. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize our returns.

A year ago, our fourth quarter net sales orders were up 81% due to the surge in housing demand during the first year of the pandemic when we had significantly more completed homes available to sell and prior to the supply chain challenges that arose in 2021.  
Our average number of active selling communities decreased 5% from the prior year and was down 3% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the fourth quarter was $378,300, up 23% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the fourth quarter was 19%, flat with the prior year quarter. As David described, new home demand remains very strong, and our local teams are continuing to restrict our sales order pace where necessary on a community-by-community basis based on the number of homes in inventory, construction times, production capacity and lot position. 
They also continue to adjust sales prices to market while staying focused on providing value to our buyers. We are still restricting the pace of our sales orders during our first fiscal quarter, but to a lesser extent than during our fourth quarter. As a result, we expect our first quarter net sales orders to be approximately equal to or slightly higher than our 20,418 sales orders in the first quarter last year.  
Our October net sales order volume was in line with our plans, and we remain confident that we are well positioned to deliver double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2022 with 26,200 homes in backlog, 47,000 homes in inventory, a robust lot supply and strong trade and supplier relationships.

I would say more recently, one thing that is impacting our turns and our ability to actually return our cash in 24 months is the extension of our construction times with the supply chain delays. We have seen further elongation of our construction times, I believe, on a year-over-year basis. Our closings this quarter were -- the construction times were longer by about 7 weeks, which is a bit longer than we would have reported last quarter.

Again, I think, obviously, really encouraging, we do an analysis of your starts and your inventory. And it certainly -- we agree, we saw a really big positive inflection in your production metrics that we can see externally. And so I wanted to ask you about your comment about sales restrictions because a lay person or somebody listening from the outside could hear you say, ""Hey, we're reducing our sales restrictions"" and think to themselves, well, yes, that's because demand has weakened. And so therefore, there aren't as many people on waiting list and things like that. 
And so I was wondering if you could clarify with maybe a little more detail. Are you -- these sales restrictions, which are starting to get alleviated or being relaxed. Is that a sign of slowing demand or increasing supply? And assuming it's not a weakening of demand, I just wanted to go back to what you said in March, I think, Jessica, that you did a stress test on your backlog. I thought that gave a lot of comfort about affordability. I was wondering if you did that recently."

We look at that every quarter in our backlog and found no real change. In fact, there may be a slight improvement from the March quarter to what we saw in September quarter backlog. And the sales restrictions is certainly a function of supply. We're seeing that we have been able to pull more homes through the production process to points where we are able to give that buyer a more confident delivery date and give them a better experience in the process. 
I don't think in any way it's -- sales have been reflective of the demand environment. We have consciously chosen not to push our sales contracts and take advantage of that demand until we can meet those customer expectations properly. So we've seen that our completed homes in inventory that are unsold are still below 1,000 homes, and that's scattered across the country. So it's not like we're seeing any pile up of available inventory. It's when we're releasing homes, we're able to sell those homes in the normal course of business."

And trying to -- during COVID, trying to get places being not only from an executive officer standpoint, but from a regional president standpoint. We were asking guys to get on planes and really became less and less comfortable with that. So I think on the last call, I made a statement about infrastructure and then immediately had to quit talking about it. Because the infrastructure I was talking about was our platform, which was dual COO roles and then doubling our reach count. 
And it -- so that we're continuing to scale up our platform to make -- to coincide with the scale up in market share that we're gaining. And we've got great people that have performed at exceptional levels. But as you move up that next step, the role changes and the skill set changes. So you've got to get young guys in a position, in my mind anyway, and what we've talked about up here. You've got to get the younger guy into a position, a regional role, where he's working through divisions instead of on top of divisions, and it's a training process. 
And so while we've got a great market, while we're scaling up in absorptions, we need to scale up in people. And Paul gives us the ability to touch the regional guys more consistently and to be in the market more consistently, as he travels, Mike travels, I travel. And by increasing the number of regions we were then able to elevate people within divisions to leadership roles. And it's just kind of a consistency stair step where we get more people access to that role and give them a chance to learn that job before something happens and you were forced to make a change. 
So it's a part of continuing to scale for our next 5 years in a row. And it's -- we've got great people, and we've got an incredibly strong management team. And that's something that, to be honest with you, I think about all the time, is the quality of our people at the division level and region level compared to when I started to the company or compared to when we went public or even compared to the last cycle, what I call super-cycle.

I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding third quarter, highlighted by a 78% increase in earnings to $3.06 per diluted share. Our consolidated pretax income increased 81% on a 35% increase in revenues to $7.3 billion, and our pretax profit margin improved 490 basis points to 19.4%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 34.9%, and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 29.5%. 
These results reflect our experienced teams and the production capabilities, our ability to leverage new order scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Housing market conditions remain very robust, and we are focused on maximizing returns and increasing our market share further. 
However, multiple disruptions in the supply chain, combined with the improvement in economic conditions and strong demand for new homes, have resulted in shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market, which has caused our construction time to become less predictable. As our top priority is to consistently fulfill our commitments to our homebuyers, we have slowed our home sales pace to more closely align to our current production levels and are selling homes later in the construction cycle when we can better ensure the certainty of home close date for our homebuyers. We expect to work through these issues and increase our production capacity. 
We started construction on 22,600 homes this quarter, and our homes and inventory increased 44% from a year ago to 47,300 homes at June 30, 2021, positioning us to finish 2021 strong and to achieve double-digit growth again in 2022. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. 
We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments. Mike?"

The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 17%, down from 22% in the prior year quarter. 
As David described, in this very strong demand environment, our local teams are restricting the sales order pace in each of their communities based on the number of homes in inventory, construction time and lot position. They continue to adjust sales pace -- prices to market on a community-by-community basis while staying focused on providing value to our buyers. 
Based on the stage of completion of our current homes in inventory, production schedules and capacity, we expect to continue restricting the pace of our sales orders during our fourth fiscal quarter. As a result, we expect our fourth quarter net sales orders to be lower than the third quarter.

Our plan is to take that up next year, and we positioned land, lots people to affect that plan. So demand out there is just unlike anything I've ever seen. 
And I think our focus is on how to meet that demand in the most efficient manner. And injecting a homeowner into the process sooner rather than later impacts our ability to get the houses built and extends that time. And it makes it harder for our trace and our superintendents. I can tell you, it is through our history to have somebody walk into our models and to tell them we don't have a house for you to buy today is something that is foreign to us. And as difficult as anything I've ever seen on our salespeople. 
And it is a tough environment to be in a sales office today. And I talk -- in our travels, I talked to our people. We're going to provide a home for everybody walking in. We just need to keep them patient and understand their frustration. But that's just -- again, it's a market I've never seen. Demand is just unbelievable today.

And we did not restrict sales as soon as the general market did, and which just geometrically increased our demand. And it's again, we're all managing through a market that none of us have ever seen.

Because it seems like it was affected to a really similar degree consistently across your markets despite these local community-by-community decisions. 
So can you sort of go over the mechanics, I guess, of how you all, Horton management, really communicates the strategy to -- I believe you said earlier, these sort of frustrated individual operators and sales folks? What are you telling people to look for in terms of I think you said homes in inventory and extended cycle times today versus ideally where you want them to be in order to begin releasing those sales again?"

Typically, this time of year, we'd be sitting on 40%, 45% specs. Today, the only specs we have are at our houses we haven't released to the market. So again, it's -- we're trying to drive efficiency in the process. 
And by controlling when that house is sold, if it does help, we'll meet customer expectation. And it also eliminates a lot of frustration on the building side, where a buyer is coming out and they have been told -- they bought a house in January, and they have been told they'd be moving into June and the house is ready to move into. So they're out there every day monitoring the progress of their house against the progress of every other home in the community. 
And it just adds a level of difficulty that, to be honest with you, right now today, we don't want and we don't need. And it's -- if somebody gets frustrated in the build process, they stay frustrated for a very long time. Very hard to meet the expectation once they get upset. So by limiting that, by pushing the maturity of our inventory further down the process before we inject a buyer into. 
We're trying to take some of the pressure off our trades and our builders. And when did that process take place. I will tell you, in some divisions, it started in January and then it went other divisions in February. And really by April, end April, 1st of May, it took hold in some of our very large divisions in the state of Texas. 
And it just got to the point where we were spending more time -- we were spending a significant amount of time dealing with the customers' frustration on this close date of their house at the expense of other things we could be doing that would drive future efficiency and production capabilities. So again, it was a process that took place over multiple months, beginning in one division and ending in -- really ending in May in Texas. 
So Don Horton has said many times, never thought he'd see a day when he couldn't build every house he could sell in the state of Texas. I can tell you today, there's not enough lots or trade capacity to meet demand in the state of Texas. I don't care if you're Don Horton or any of the other public builders out there. It's very difficult to get a house built today. We're doing a better job than anybody else, and we're going to get better at what we're doing. But it's -- there is a tremendous amount of demand out there."

You said you've seen the credit profile of your buyers keeping pace with the home price increases you've instituted up to this point. 
Which I was a little surprised at just given the fact we know incomes are not up 20% year-over-year, and rates are pretty stable now after obviously going down quite a bit in the second half of last year, so should I interpret that to imply that maybe the mix of your buyers or the buyers in your interest lists are kind of slowly shifting maybe towards more of a move-up buyer or at least a more affluent first-time buyer than you've historically seen over the last few years?"

And we look at the existing home inventory levels that are available in given marketplaces, they're just not there. And so the quick move in homes, the specs we had that were completed last year, obviously, they were absorbed very quickly into the marketplace. 
We restricted the sale of a lot of our homes to give better certainty to that homebuyer in the process of their delivery date and with -- in a rising price environment, when we're restricting the sale date, we're able to price to market at the time we sign the contract, which is then closer to the delivery date."

So I guess the follow-up to that point then is, obviously, it's an incredibly tight supply environment today. You guys are holding back sales, restricting sales. A lot of other builders are kind of doing or saying the same thing. So it would seem like if you kind of connect the dots here, a lot of homes are being started today. Not a lot of those homes yet are released for sale. 
So at some point in the future, you would think inventory is going to come to the market in a pretty meaningful way. And the question then, of course, is will the demand be sufficient to absorb that? Because right now, it's probably a little tricky to get a firm grasp on what that demand is when you're turning buyers away. 
So are you tracking that on your kind of a local basis, what other builders are doing in terms of restricting sales but starting homes? And how would you anticipate responding if, let's just say, later this year or in your fiscal 1Q, you start releasing more homes for sale, other builders do the same thing and the demand is not quite what you expected it to be? Are you willing to accept a lower absorption pace? Are you going to start at that point to maybe discount a little bit? What would the thought process be?"

So if what you're saying were to come true, and there start to be signs of some sort of increased supply in the market that the demand is not going to be there for, which right now feels like we are a long ways away from, we would be able to adjust our starts accordingly community by community where we saw those signs, like we always do, to make sure we don't end up with an excess supply of completed specs. 
But with 500 completed homes across the country today, we're just so far from having that conversation on a national level. But those are things that our local operators certainly pay attention to all the time when they're looking at their business plan and what they're going to do going forward. 
Our plan would be to continue to consolidate market share regardless of market conditions. And we believe we're going to continue to be the best positioned to do that kind of regardless of what the demand profile looks like in future periods."

On a trailing 12-month basis, we've started 94,500 homes. That in and of itself is double-digit growth over what our planned deliveries are this year. So we're already in position to deliver double digit and working to improve on that and expand on that as we move into '22. 
So we feel like we're in a great position to do that. There will be challenges. There will be unknown challenges that we haven't dealt with yet, but we're confident in our teams and our ability to continue to maintain the current pace and incrementally improve on it as we move into '22 on our starts."

But that's not a giant component of what we're seeing in sales price or margin. It certainly is impactful and it certainly happened in our extended longer communities, especially at the price points we have -- we're offering in the entry level. 
We don't like that -- I personally don't like that process because in '05, '06, there was a false demand by people running around putting houses on the contract that they never intended to close. I don't want our operators to have a false expectation about the pricing that's achievable in the market by having a guy from California bid on a house and stuff, look on a guy in Texas. 
And then all of a sudden, every house is worth what a guy transferring in from California is willing to pay. We're trying to stay very close to these markets. And our goal is to sell everybody who walks into our house and into our model of home. And we're not there right now, but we're certainly going to get to there."

So look all the stocks that are reporting today across all the categories, record margins, record demand, limited supply, right? What's different this cycle is that we have very low interest rates into COVID, very high consumer credit, right? Governments are printing all the money. 
And structurally, in housing, there's a very high propensity for institutional buyers, right? I mean it's coming from builders like you, your other large builders, something $5 billion, $6 billion portfolios all the time, buying 15,000, 20,000 unit properties. 
So look, I think you guys obviously have the best business model in many ways, and you're working on your land supply. So I understand all that. But where are -- as an operator, I mean, your WIP is less capitalized, it is an inventory divided by WIP, than it is historically. And your leverage is so low. I mean, what is -- what are you going to look for, I guess, to see when -- yes. 
It seems like you're over-earning. Obviously, you guys -- there's nothing that will indicate your margins are going down. You're actually going up. But I mean, what do you think it will be there? Are you looking -- how are you looking at the existing side? How are you looking at people bidding on properties that's maybe not an individual investor but all this institutional money that's coming in because the cap rates are still good? What is it that you're looking at separate from the operations on the macro that causes you -- yes, I don't know, if there's a factor to look at rather than the operational side. That's it."

Rising interest rates always are a significant cost input into the value of the homes and the monthly payment. We monitor obviously that very closely and looking at affordability. I think Jessica touched on it before with 2 points and the stress testing we did the backlog. The backlog can withstand some interest rate upward movement right now. 
In addition, the DTI, the debt-to-income levels we're seeing in our borrowers this most recent quarter actually ticking down a little bit despite the average loan size going up. So the credit quality of our buyers are good. Looking at our for-sale communities, the vast majority of the buyers of those homes are owner-occupied homes. 
We don't have any institutional relational outtake programs in our for-sale communities. Our institutional focus would be on the build-to-rent communities, which are separate and apart from the for-sale side of our business. It's hard to know all the things that may change in the future, Ken. 
But one thing we do focus on and have focused on for many years is maintaining a very strong, flexible balance sheet, as you said, where we have great low leverage, strong equity capitalization and very good liquidity. That allows us to take advantage of the market conditions as they change and continue to consolidate market share, especially at a local level where we can turn that local market share leverage and do outperformance."
