We will review how we closed 2020 and discuss 2021 financial guidance. I'm pleased to report we finished the year with a very strong quarter. We delivered double-digit growth in all key financial metrics and once again reported results above our financial targets. 
This is all the more remarkable since last year's fourth quarter was so strong. As you know, it was a difficult year. And as we navigate it through the pandemic, we try to be as transparent as possible and provide visibility to our expected financial performance. In such highly unusual circumstances, the default reaction will normally be to withdraw guidance and watch from the sidelines. But as you know, we tried our best to share with you what we saw. 
We did the same at the end of the third quarter, when we decided to provide our 2021 outlook as soon as we had some visibility, which was a full quarter earlier than usual. Today, this outlook has become clearer, and we've decided to update and raise that guidance. 
Let's start by reviewing our fourth quarter results. Revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $3.298 billion, which was $108 million, above the high end of our guidance range. A little over 70% of these beats came from strong organic performance, less than 30% from favorable foreign exchange. Revenue growth was 13.9% on a reported basis and 12.2% at constant currency. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $735 million grew 14.5%, reflecting our revenue growth and productivity measures. The $25 million beat above the high end of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger organic revenue performance. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.11 grew 21.3%. The beat here entirely reflects the adjusted EBITDA drop through. 
Our strong fourth quarter financial results were driven by numerous operating achievements during 2020. A little bit more color on those achievements, starting with technology. Demand for our technology offerings remain strong in 2020. 60 new clients decided to deploy OCE last year, bringing our total number of OCE client wins to 140 since launch. As you know, at the beginning of 2020, a top 15 global pharma client began deployment of OCE in the U.S. This client has now decided to begin global OCE deployment for their medical teams, namely their almost 2,000 medical science liaisons worldwide. The same client is also expanding its use of IQVIA technologies through our HCP engagement management platform. 
We launched this platform during 2020. And HCP engagement management works in conjunction with OCE to ensure global commercial activities are executed in compliance with all global regulations. In addition to HCP engagement management, you would have seen that during 2020, we also launched OCE Optimizer. OCE Optimizer is a real-time map based territory and sales rep alignment solution, which helps our clients plan their sales rep activity and improve their marketing plans. 
Switching to our real-world business. Our real work business has been relatively well insulated from the impact of the virus, and it has strong growth for the year. The business is advanced in the use of secondary data, remote monitoring and virtual research approaches, which helped the team pivot quickly to working in the new remote world at the onset of the pandemic. 
Our rich clinical data assets are key to our real-world differentiation. The team has continued to invest in these rich clinical data assets and these assets now include over 1 billion active nonidentified patients globally, and the team is busy integrating this rich clinical data into research. 
In 2020, we launched CARE, our COVID Active Research Experience registry to have communities and public health authorities better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the population. We're leveraging this platform along with our vast experience of registries and analytics to partner with the FDA to support a better understanding of how people are affected by exposure to Cove. This work will help identify what symptoms individuals experience, the length and severity of symptoms and whether any medications or supplements, they are taking affect the severity of those symptoms. It's a perfect application of our real-world capabilities. 
Similarly, we have become the partner of choice around the world to assist various governments and health care authorities with large-scale diagnostic testing and monitoring of COVID patients. These new series of offerings, which leverages our connected capabilities contributed incrementally to the strong sequential growth in our TAS segment. 
Moving to R&DS. As you know, the R&DS team responded quickly in 2020 to support our clients with the development of vaccine en therapies for COVID-19. We've been involved in more than 300 clinical trials and studies for the virus, including 4 of the 5 vaccine trials that made it through Phase III and were funded by the U.S. government in operational world speed. 
To help speed recruitment, we leveraged our direct-to-patient solutions, which include the use of patient registries and IQVIA-sponsored advertisement. To date, we've recruited over 100,000 patients to COVID trials. The pandemic has accelerated the need for remote and risk-based monitoring in clinical research which, in turn, has accelerated the adoption of our Virtual Trial technology. 
In total, we've won over 60 new studies using our Virtual Trial solutions across 10 therapeutic areas, including awards with 5 top 10 pharma clients. The technology suite combines eConsent, telemedicine, eCOA and digital communication and its platform on Health Cloud, the Salesforce platform that is purpose-built for health care and life sciences. This technology is being deployed to speed vaccine development and was an important factor in helping the team secure the 2 Phase III full-service cove trials that we are working on. 
The environment for R&D and outsourcing remains very healthy. Biotech funding remains strong with the National Venture Capital Association reporting a record number of deals for the year. The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand, and is at an all-time high. It is this healthy environment, combined with our differentiated capabilities, that has resulted in strong new business awards for the R&DS team. 
Our contracted backlog, including pass-throughs, grew 18.5% year-over-year to $22.6 billion at December 31, 2020. As a result, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $5.9 billion, up 13.5% year-over-year. We continue to build on our strong momentum in the fourth quarter with the team delivering a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.41, including pass-throughs; and 1.42, excluding pass-throughs. We exited the year with an LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio of 1.53, including pass-throughs and 1.44, excluding pass-throughs cost thus. We expect continued strong activity going forward as our pipeline of R&DS opportunities is growing double digits in both volume and dollars across a very wide range of therapies. 
I'll now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance."

Fourth quarter revenue of $3.298 billion, grew 13.9% on a reported basis and 12.2% at constant currency. Revenue for the full year was $11.359 billion, which was up 2.4% reported and 2.3% at constant currency. 
Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter of $1.425 billion increased 17.4% reported and 15.1% at constant currency. The sequential bump in growth this quarter versus the 9.2% growth in the third quarter was due to the COVID-related work that Ari mentioned. 
Full year Technology and Analytics Solutions revenue was $4.858 billion, up 8.3% reported and 8.1% at constant currency. R&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $1.684 billion was up 14.5% at actual FX rates and 13.2% at constant currency. Pass-throughs were a tailwind of 220 basis points to fourth quarter R&DS revenue growth due entirely to COVID work. But you should note that R&DS delivered double-digit organic growth on both the services and a [indiscernible] basis. Again, strong performance, especially considering the tough comparison to the fourth quarter of 2019 when organic service revenue also grew at a double-digit rate. 
For the full year, R&D Solutions revenue was $5.760 billion, essentially flat on both a reported and constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of pass-throughs, R&D Solutions' full year reported revenue grew 2.2%. 
CSMS revenue of $189 million was down 10% reported and 11.9% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. For the full year, CSMS revenue of $741 million was down 9% at actual FX rates and 9.2% at constant currency. Demand for field reps continues to be soft in the current environment. As a result, business development activity has slowed. But the businesses performed modestly better than we expected as our clients have largely retained existing field reps. 
Now moving down to P&L. Our adjusted EBITDA was $735 million for the fourth quarter, which was growth of 14.5%. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $2.384 billion. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $119 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.61. The for the full year, GAAP net income was $279 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.43. Adjusted net income was $411 million for the fourth quarter and $1.252 billion for the full year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 21.3% in the fourth quarter at $2.11. Diluted earnings per share was [Audio Gap] a 5% year-over-year would close 2020 at $22.6 billion. 
We expect $5.9 billion to this backlog to convert to revenue over the next 12 months, which [Audio Gap] and this provides the basis for our 2021 guidance, which I'll be discussing shortly. 
Now let's go to the balance sheet. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 billion and debt was $12.5 billion, so our net debt was $10.7 billion. Our net leverage ratio at December 31 improved a 4.5x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, and that compares to a peak of 4.8x at the end of the second quarter and 4.7x at the end of the third quarter. And you'll recall that we've committed to deleveraging to between 3.5 and 4x net leverage as we exit 2022. And you can expect that we'll make good progress towards its target in 2021 due to our double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and improved free cash flow conversion. 
The cash flow continues to be a bright spot. Cash flow from operations was $750 million in the fourth quarter, up 29% year-over-year. CapEx was $176 million, resulting in free cash flow of $574 million. For the full year, free cash flow was $1.34 billion, up 61% year-over-year. 
We resumed share repurchase activity during the fourth quarter, repurchasing $102 billion of our shares. Full year share repurchases were $423 million we ended the year at 194.8 million diluted shares outstanding and currently have $918 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our program. 
As a result of our strong free cash flow performance, actions we took at the onset of pandemic to access capital markets and capital allocation decisions during the year, we now have $3.3 billion of dry powder on our balance sheet. Between the undrawn revolver of $1.5 billion and the cash balance of $1.8 billion. We will continue to be judicious in how we use this liquidity, consistent with our goal of reducing net leverage. 
Okay. Let's turn to guidance now. We're raising our full year guidance by $250 million for revenue at the low end of the range and by $300 million at the high end of the range. The new revenue guidance is $12.550 billion to $12.900 billion. A little under half of this increase is driven by a stronger outlook for the business and the remainder is from favorable FX movements versus the guidance we provided on our third quarter call. 
I note that the revised guidance includes about 200 basis points of FX tailwind versus the prior year. We're also raising our full year profit guidance. We've increased our adjusted EBITDA by $35 million at the low end of the range and by $40 million at the high end of the range, resulting in full year guidance of $2.760 billion to $2.840 billion. The change in FX versus our prior guidance actually had a slightly negative impact on profit due to the unusual mix of currency fluctuations versus a historic norm. 
So the adjusted EBITDA increase that you see in our guidance is more than entirely the result of the stronger organic revenue outlook. We're raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.12 at the low end of the range and by $0.13 to the high end of the range to $7.77 to $8.08 in this represents year-over-year growth of 21% to 25.9%. 
And let me go a little deeper to provide you with some color to help you with your models. First, when you're modeling quarterly revenue, keep in mind that the second quarter will be easiest comparison and the fourth quarter will be the toughest comparison. And within our adjusted diluted EPS guidance, we've assumed interest expense of approximately $415 million. Operation, depreciation and amortization of slightly over $400 million. Other below the line expense items such as minority interest of approximately $50 million and a continuation of share repurchase activity. Our guidance also assumes that the effective tax rate will remain largely in line with 2020. 
Our full year 2021 guidance assumes that current foreign exchange rates remain in effect for the balance of the year. Now before turning to first quarter guidance, let me give you a look at the segment growth rates for 2021. We currently expect Tech & Analytics Solutions reported revenue growth to be between 9% and 12%. And R&D Solutions reported revenue growth to be between 14% and 17%, which includes a 100 basis point headwind from pass-throughs and CSMs reported revenue growth is expected to be down about 2%, weaker early in the year and recovering later in the year. 
Now as in the past, we're also providing guidance for the coming quarter. And this assumes that FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter. On that basis, first quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.150 billion and $3.200 billion, representing reported growth of 14.4% to 16.2%. All 3 segments should deliver similar constant currency growth rates to what we saw in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $660 million and $675 million, representing reported growth of 17.4% to 20.1%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $1.81 and $1.87, up 20.7% to 24.7%. 
So to summarize, we delivered strong fourth quarter results with double-digit growth in all key financial metrics, and that's on top of a strong fourth quarter in 2019. We posted mid-teens revenue growth for both our TAS and R&DS segments. R&DS improved to $22.6 billion, up 18.5% year-over-year. We posted strong free cash flow for the fourth quarter and the full year of $574 million for the quarter and $1.34 billion for the year. 
We closed 2020 with net leverage of 4.5x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and a very healthy liquidity position, including an undrawn revolver and $1.8 billion of cash. And as we look to 2021, we see double-digit revenue growth, margin expansion, adjusted diluted EPS growth of over 20% our continued robust R&DS bookings activity and a further reduction in our net leverage ratio. 
And with that, let me hand it back over to our operator for the Q&A session."

It seems like record constant currency growth in the quarter from the segment despite the Events management business, I'm assuming not really coming fully back. And if I heard you correctly, Ari, it sounded like a good portion of the acceleration was driven by real-world evidence for the government. I'm just curious how sustainable some of that work might be into 2021, kind of what's assumed in this healthy guidance of 9% to 12% in TAS.

Look, TAS, in general, has been more insulated from the impact of COVID during 2020 than R&DS or CSMS, right? So our data and they need things consulting our real-world business were pretty much unaffected. And as you noted, the only pockets there that we had where we had issues with the advanced management business which essentially came to a hole. Now in the fourth quarter, the underlying TAS business returned to normal growth rate. It has already returned to normal growth rates in the third quarter. I think we posted 9.2% of constant currency growth in the third quarter. The sequential increase in that growth rate in the fourth quarter, which is about, let's call it, 600 basis points was entirely new, as you noted, to the incremental work from COVID-related activities. So we expect this incremental contribution to continue about the same pace into the first quarter. Now similar to RMD, the COVID working tas has been faster execution and the guidance that we give you for 2021 does include the COVID work that we have visibility to. But I can tell you there's no COVID work in the second half of 2021 that's built into our guidance. It's still early in the year, so this could change, right? It's not going to stop abruptly. But right now, the bulk of what we see in terms of COVID working TAS for 2021 is in the first quarter, similar as in the fourth quarter and a little bit of sale in the second quarter, and that's it. What is that COVID work by way? It's mainly related to projects for governments, essentially using our people and analytics to support authorities in the management of the crisis. Real-world work for the FDA that I described in my introductory remarks. We're also performing large-scale diagnostic testing and monitoring of cover patients for other governments in Europe, in Asia, around the world. And we are assuming that's going to go away, certainly by the middle of the year in our guidance. But again, that's -- that could prove to be -- I have an expectation, again, it's not built in the guidance. We have an expectation that we will continue to have similar type of work as we've developed capabilities and really a new set of offerings, which we intend to go-to-market going forward."

I mean, look, mid double-digit growth in TAS is not the new Europe. We said TAS growth accelerated, but we accelerated to the high single-digit growth that we always anticipated pre pandemic. If you go back to the guidance we gave, the long-term guidance we gave you. In June of 2019, we did expect tass to reach high single digits, 8%, 9% and eventually 10% but that's that's the underlying case growth business. Now with R and DS, it also, of course, would be misleading to look at the R&DS business and say that's the Avis mid double-digit growth. Obviously, it's hard to -- it's harder to determine what we would have been without the COVID work because without the COVID work, there would have been other business that had essentially been push to the right, right, in R&DS, as you can understand. But by the way, even absent the large cove trials that we've been privileged to work on we would have had very strong underlying R&DS services growth in the fourth quarter as well. Now we expect COVID work to be with us through 2021. And maybe also into 2022 because there's a need for vaccines from multiple manufacturers to meet global demand. There are new vaccines that are being developed for variants of the virus, there are alternative vaccines that are needed in case of adverse safety events or quality issues or manufacturing delays. There are novel treatment programs that are targeted at specific populations and conditions and of course, there are post-approval commitments to regulators, all of which do require continued R&DS work. Now, look, we have a large backlog to execute $22.6 billion at the end of 2020. We are -- look, we have to -- we have to have the ability to execute on this existing backlog and that ability will continue to improve. Site startup and patient recruitment continues to improve. The next 12 months revenue from backlog has increased so all of this provides the basis for our 2021 R&DS revenue guidance. The pipeline of opportunities is very strong. If we exclude COVID opportunities, our pipeline is showing good growth. For example, the oncology pipeline is in the mid double-digit growth. The CNS pipeline is up low double digits, 12%, 13%. Cardiovascular and diabetes pipe is growing strong double digits, very, very strong double digits. So if your question is suggesting that what happens post COVID, we're not falling off a group. We have the vast majority of the backlog is not covered, obviously. If you look at our bookings in 2020, every quarter, except for the first quarter, obviously, COVID-related work represented between 15% and 20% of our services bookings. And for the year, I think it was exactly 15%, 1.5%. So we continue to book very, very solid good business across all therapy areas. And we expect our strong growth in R&DS to continue even post COVID."

We just learned ways to work around it, although we would expect it to improve gradually, yes. Absolute. In the first -- when -- in the trough at the worst moment of the crisis, we were like less than 20% of [indiscernible] And that really created huge headwinds for our NDS business, as you know. Second quarter earnings call, we told you that we have gone up to 53% site access and at the end of the third quarter, we were at about 70% site access. And the kind of bad is good news here that we have not improved that metric. It remains at 70%. However, we've learned to work around that. And the reason why it hasn't gone back to 100%, frankly, is because of all these new flare ups, et cetera. But the good news here is that it's been out right because it's not true so much we found really the number of sites, but it's really other metrics. The main metric we look at at the beginning of the pandemic because site access because, again, without that, you've got nothing. But we found out that there is a critical mass of size access, which, again, we think is about the level where we are now. Whereby our remote monitoring capabilities then prevent material disruption to the delivery of our services in general. We've got site networks, relationships. We can work around size that are not yet up and running for clinical research. And today, we can pivot much faster to remote monitoring versus when this pandemic hit. Now if you look at start up activity, which is another important metric that we were looking at, which had also come to a hold, is now back to baseline levels pre pandemic. And that's extremely good news. And there hasn't been any major change from this due to the increases in COVID cases or the new variants of the virus. So start-up activity, people have room to work with the virus, and it's essentially back to pre pandemic levels, and we don't see that changing. Patient recruitment, another very important metric. Obviously, it usually lags site start-up, but essentially, those trends are very strong, and the patients are returning to sites essentially close to pre pandemic level. So again, we're very encouraged by that. You had another question on..."

Well, I mentioned that in my etrma ks that our virtual trials technology has been really brought to the front here in the context of COVID. If you step back and think about what OCT is there's really 4 blocks. There's a digital site suite, which focus on the size side portal, payments, et then there's a digital patient suite with what the patient has to go through with eConsent, eCOA, that's where the virtual trial essentially is the study hub then you have the digital trial management suite to the CTMS, risk-based monitoring and any of the compliance suite with RIM smart and vigilance. So the technologies in our site suite the patient suite and the compliance suite went live during 2020. And the technologies in our trial management suite will be going live shortly, most likely end of the first quarter, beginning of the second quarter of this year. So again, of these 4 suites, the sites, the patients and the compliance they are all went live during 2020. And the trial management suite will be live to be -- probably March, April time frame this year. And we are seeing very strong interest from clients. We've seen an increase in RFP activity for the OCD platform. Not just for individual suites or stand alone products, but for the whole platform. We are seeing interest from all customer segments, large, mid and and stay tuned, we'll report more on that. But the answer to your question is we are live for most of the products, and it will be fully live and operational by the beginning of the second quarter."

So what we've tried to do is provide guidance to tell you how much we think is going to burn during the course of the year, the next 12 months revenue and allow you to take it from there. Yes, the COVID work does burn quicker than the other work. There's no question about that. But we don't guide to a particular backlog conversion rate because it's just too difficult to do because it depends also on how much you happen to be booking. If you're booking a lot like we have been recently, and obviously, the backlog goes up and the burn rate goes down, but that's not a bad thing. So yes, I would expect you would see a faster burn of the COVID-related work, which we mentioned was about 15% of our service bookings in 2020 and a more normal rate of burn on the rest of the backlog. And I think it still remains to be seen how much additional COVID-related work we're going to book as we go through 2021. That's -- it's still a question mark."

The -- as you can see from our cash flow statement, the principal driver, in fact, pretty much the whole driver of our improvement in cash flow -- free cash flow in 2020. And was due to improved collections performance. And that's a combination of collecting quicker but also billing in a more timely fashion and structure in our contracts. So that we built earlier. And part of our collections effort, which we put a lot of focus on was bringing down our overdue receivables. We took our eye off the ball on that a little bit and put a lot of focus on that. And we're able to substantially put a dent in our overdue receivables, which has helped quite a bit. And I think a lot of the processes we put in place, all of them should persist into 2021. We have to continue to put emphasis on it, but we've improved our processes, and we expect that to continue. Now you did identify something that's important, which is that the COVID-related work did bring some benefit in terms of customer advances and being able to bill in advance that helped our 2020 cash flow. I would -- so when you look at our 2020 cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net income, it was unusually high. We target more in the 80% to 90% free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net income in a normal year. But cash flow is very lumpy. So it bounces around. We had a very strong year in 2021. It means as a percentage of net income -- excuse me, 2020 as a percentage of net income. It probably won't be quite as strong in 2020. But fundamentally, we've improved quite a lot in terms of cash conversion, and you should see continued benefit from that going into the future."

And if not, kind of when do we see it? Yes. So again, we continue to see very good traction in the marketplace. Obviously, it takes time to deploy. We had 60 client wins in 2020. And I should point out, obviously, despite the difficult environment created by the pandemic, we continue to sell a total 140 client wins since the launch, we keep winning 2 out of 3x against competition. We're deploying large clients, which we disclosed before. We have a global deployment with Roche. We have a global deployment with Nova Nordisk international operations. Astrazeneca U.S. deployment as well. We have another top 15 pharma deployment for a country in Asia and other top 50 clients that's globally deploying for their medical teams so we already have -- I'm not sure we disclose this number, but we do have tens of thousands of users already. Now does this move the needle? I mean $12.9 billion revenue company? No, not in 2021. But it is providing very significant growth and certainly, it is an area where we expect strong margin drop-through to over time. As we complete implementations, as you know, it's a -- the drop-through becomes much more attractive when revenue is license driven. And we are starting to see that, but it will continue to increase as we complete deployments and implementation. Now we continue to sell.

Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.
In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.
I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib."

We will review how we closed 2020 and discuss 2021 financial guidance. I'm pleased to report we finished the year with a very strong quarter. We delivered double-digit growth in all key financial metrics and once again reported results above our financial targets.
This is all the more remarkable since last year's fourth quarter was so strong. As you know, it was a difficult year. And as we navigated through the pandemic, we try to be as transparent as possible and provide visibility to our expected financial performance. In such highly unusual circumstances, the default reaction will normally be to withdraw guidance and watch from the sidelines. But as you know, we tried our best to share with you what we saw.
We did the same at the end of the third quarter when we decided to provide our 2021 outlook as soon as we had some visibility, which was a full quarter earlier than usual. Today, this outlook has become clearer, and we've decided to update and raise that guidance.
Let's start by reviewing our fourth quarter results. Revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $3.298 billion, which was $108 million above the high end of our guidance range. A little over 70% of this beat came from strong organic performance, less than 30% from favorable foreign exchange. Revenue growth was 13.9% on a reported basis and 12.2% at constant currency.
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $735 million grew 14.5%, reflecting our revenue growth and productivity measures. The $25 million beat above the high end of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger organic revenue performance. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.11 grew 21.3%. The beat here entirely reflects the adjusted EBITDA drop-through.
Our strong fourth quarter financial results were driven by numerous operating achievements during 2020. A little bit more color on those achievements, starting with technology. Demand for our technology offerings remained strong in 2020. 60 new clients decided to deploy OCE last year, bringing our total number of OCE client wins to 140 since launch. As you know, at the beginning of 2020, a top 15 global pharma client began deployment of OCE in the U.S. This client has now decided to begin global OCE deployment for their medical teams, namely their almost 2,000 medical science liaisons worldwide.
The same client is also expanding its use of IQVIA technologies through our HCP engagement management platform. We launched this platform during 2020. HCP engagement management works in conjunction with OCE to ensure global commercial activities are executed in compliance with all global regulations.
In addition to HCP engagement management, you would have seen that during 2020, we also launched OCE Optimizer. OCE Optimizer is a real-time map-based territory and sales rep alignment solution, which helps our clients plan their sales rep activity and improve their marketing plans.
Switching to our real-world business. Our real-world business has been relatively well insulated from the impact of the virus, and it has strong growth for the year. The business is advanced in the use of secondary data, remote monitoring and virtual research approaches, which helped the team pivot quickly to working in the new remote world at the onset of the pandemic.
Our rich clinical data assets are key to our real-world differentiation. The team has continued to invest in these rich clinical data assets, and these assets now include over 1 billion active nonidentified patients globally, and the team is busy integrating this rich clinical data into research.
In 2020, we launched CARE, our COVID Active Research Experience registry to help communities and public health authorities better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the population. We're leveraging this platform, along with our vast experience of registries and analytics, to partner with the FDA to support a better understanding of how people are affected by exposure to COVID. This work will help identify what symptoms individuals experience, the length and severity of symptoms and whether any medications or supplements they are taking affect the severity of those symptoms. It's a perfect application of our real-world capabilities.
Similarly, we have become the partner of choice around the world to assist various governments and health care authorities with large-scale diagnostic testing and monitoring of COVID patients. These new series of offerings, which leverages our connected capabilities, contributed incrementally to the strong sequential growth in our TAS segment.
Moving to R&DS. As you know, the R&DS team responded quickly in 2020 to support our clients with the development of vaccines and therapies for COVID-19. We've been involved in more than 300 clinical trials and studies for the virus, including 4 of the 5 vaccine trials that made it through Phase III and were funded by the U.S. government in Operation Warp Speed. To help speed recruitment, we leveraged our direct-to-patient solutions, which include the use of patient registries and IQVIA-sponsored advertisement. To date, we've recruited over 100,000 patients to COVID trials. The pandemic has accelerated the need for remote and risk-based monitoring in clinical research which, in turn, has accelerated the adoption of our virtual trial technology.
In total, we've won over 60 new studies using our Virtual Trial solutions across 10 therapeutic areas, including awards with 5 top 10 pharma clients. The technology suite combines eConsent, telemedicine, eCOA and digital communication and its platform on Health Cloud, the Salesforce platform that is purpose-built for health care and life sciences. This technology is being deployed to speed vaccine development and was an important factor in helping the team secure the 2 Phase III full-service COVID trials that we are working on.
The environment for R&D and outsourcing remains very healthy. Biotech funding remains strong, with the National Venture Capital Association reporting a record number of deals for the year. The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand and is at an all-time high. It is this healthy environment, combined with our differentiated capabilities, that has resulted in strong new business awards for the R&DS team.
Our contracted backlog, including pass-throughs, grew 18.5% year-over-year to $22.6 billion at December 31, 2020. As a result, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $5.9 billion, up 13.5% year-over-year. We continue to build on our strong momentum in the fourth quarter, with the team delivering a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.41, including pass-throughs, and 1.42, excluding pass-throughs. We exited the year with an LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio of 1.53, including pass-throughs, and 1.44, excluding pass-throughs. We expect continued strong activity going forward as our pipeline of R&DS opportunities is growing double digits in both volume and dollars across a very wide range of therapies.
I'll now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance."
137473239,702367383,2202667,"IQVIA Holdings Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2021",2021-02-10,"Earnings Calls","IQVIA Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone.

As Ari mentioned, this was a strong quarter to close the year. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of $3.298 billion grew 13.9% on a reported basis and 12.2% at constant currency. Revenue for the full year was $11.359 billion, which was up 2.4% reported and 2.3% at constant currency.
Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter of $1.425 billion increased 17.4% reported and 15.1% at constant currency. The sequential bump in growth this quarter versus the 9.2% growth in the third quarter was due to the COVID-related work that Ari mentioned. Full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $4.858 billion, up 8.3% reported and 8.1% at constant currency.
R&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $1.684 billion was up 14.5% at actual FX rates and 13.2% at constant currency. Pass-throughs were a tailwind of 220 basis points to fourth quarter R&DS revenue growth due entirely to COVID work. But you should note that R&DS delivered double-digit organic growth on both the services and a 606 basis. Again, strong performance, especially considering the tough comparison to the fourth quarter of 2019 when organic service revenue also grew at a double-digit rate.
For the full year, R&D Solutions revenue was $5.760 billion, essentially flat on both a reported and constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of pass-throughs, R&D Solutions' full year reported revenue grew 2.2%.
CSMS revenue of $189 million was down 10% reported and 11.9% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. For the full year, CSMS revenue of $741 million was down 9% at actual FX rates and 9.2% at constant currency. Demand for field reps continues to be soft in the current environment. As a result, business development activity has slowed. But the businesses performed modestly better than we expected as our clients have largely retained existing field reps.
Now moving down to P&L. Our adjusted EBITDA was $735 million for the fourth quarter, which was growth of 14.5%. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $2.384 billion. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $119 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.61. For the full year, GAAP net income was $279 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.43. Adjusted net income was $411 million for the fourth quarter and $1.252 billion for the full year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 21.3% in the fourth quarter to $2.11. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share was $6.42.
Now as Ari highlighted, R&DS new business activity remained strong. Backlog grew 18.5% year-over-year, and it closed 2020 at $22.6 billion. We expect $5.9 billion of this backlog to convert to revenue over the next 12 months, which represents a year-over-year increase of 13.5%, and this provides the basis for our 2021 guidance, which I'll be discussing shortly.
Now let's go to the balance sheet. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 billion, and debt was $12.5 billion, so our net debt was $10.7 billion. Our net leverage ratio at December 31 improved to 4.5x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, and that compares to a peak of 4.8x at the end of the second quarter and 4.7x at the end of the third quarter. And you'll recall that we've committed to deleveraging to between 3.5 and 4x net leverage as we exit 2022. And you can expect that we'll make good progress towards this target in 2021 due to our double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and improved free cash flow conversion.
The cash flow continues to be a bright spot. Cash flow from operations was $750 million in the fourth quarter, up 29% year-over-year. CapEx was $176 million, resulting in free cash flow of $574 million. For the full year, free cash flow was $1.34 billion, up 61% year-over-year.
We resumed share repurchase activity during the fourth quarter, repurchasing $102 billion of our shares. Full year share repurchases were $423 million. We ended the year at 194.8 million diluted shares outstanding and currently have $918 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our program.
As a result of our strong free cash flow performance, actions we took at the onset of the pandemic to access capital markets and capital allocation decisions during the year, we now have $3.3 billion of dry powder on our balance sheet between the undrawn revolver of $1.5 billion and the cash balance of $1.8 billion. We will continue to be judicious in how we use this liquidity, consistent with our goal of reducing net leverage.
Okay. Let's turn to guidance now. We're raising our full year guidance by $250 million for revenue at the low end of the range and by $300 million at the high end of the range. The new revenue guidance is $12.550 billion to $12.900 billion. A little under half of this increase is driven by a stronger outlook for the business, and the remainder is from favorable FX movements versus the guidance we provided on our third quarter call. I note that the revised guidance includes about 200 basis points of FX tailwind versus the prior year.
We're also raising our full year profit guidance. We've increased our adjusted EBITDA by $35 million at the low end of the range and by $40 million at the high end of the range, resulting in full year guidance of $2.760 billion to $2.840 billion. The change in FX versus our prior guidance actually had a slightly negative impact on profit due to the unusual mix of currency fluctuations versus a historic norm. So the adjusted EBITDA increase that you see in our guidance is more than entirely the result of the stronger organic revenue outlook.
We're raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.12 at the low end of the range and by $0.13 to the high end of the range to $7.77 to $8.08. This represents year-over-year growth of 21% to 25.9%.
And let me go a little deeper to provide you with some color to help you with your models. First, when you're modeling quarterly revenue, keep in mind that the second quarter will be the easiest comparison, and the fourth quarter will be the toughest comparison. And within our adjusted diluted EPS guidance, we've assumed interest expense of approximately $415 million, operational depreciation and amortization of slightly over $400 million, other below-the-line expense items such as minority interest of approximately $50 million and a continuation of share repurchase activity. Our guidance also assumes that the effective tax rate will remain largely in line with 2020. Our full year 2021 guidance assumes that current foreign exchange rates remain in effect for the balance of the year.
Now before turning to first quarter guidance, let me give you a look at the segment growth rates for 2021. We currently expect Tech & Analytics Solutions reported revenue growth to be between 9% and 12%; R&D Solutions reported revenue growth to be between 14% and 17%, which includes a 100 basis point headwind from pass-throughs; and CSMS reported revenue growth is expected to be down about 2%, weaker early in the year and recovering later in the year.
Now as in the past, we're also providing guidance for the coming quarter. And this assumes that FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter. On that basis, first quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.150 billion and $3.200 billion, representing reported growth of 14.4% to 16.2%. All 3 segments should deliver similar constant currency growth rates to what we saw in the fourth quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $660 million and $675 million, representing reported growth of 17.4% to 20.1%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $1.81 and $1.87, up 20.7% to 24.7%.
So to summarize, we delivered strong fourth quarter results with double-digit growth in all key financial metrics, and that's on top of a strong fourth quarter in 2019. We posted mid-teens revenue growth for both our TAS and R&DS segments. R&DS backlog improved to $22.6 billion, up 18.5% year-over-year. We posted strong free cash flow for the fourth quarter and the full year of $574 million for the quarter and $1.34 billion for the year.
We closed 2020 with net leverage of 4.5x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and a very healthy liquidity position, including an undrawn revolver and $1.8 billion of cash. And as we look to 2021, we see double-digit revenue growth, margin expansion, adjusted diluted EPS growth of over 20%, continued robust R&DS bookings activity and a further reduction in our net leverage ratio.
And with that, let me hand it back over to our operator for the Q&A session."

It seems like record constant currency growth in the quarter from the segment despite the events management business, I'm assuming, not really coming fully back. And if I heard you correctly, Ari, it sounded like a good portion of the acceleration was driven by real-world evidence for the government. I'm just curious how sustainable some of that work might be into 2021, kind of what's assumed in this healthy guidance of 9% to 12% in TAS. And then just any thoughts on the other pieces of TAS outside of real-world evidence in the guidance would be helpful."

Look, TAS, in general, has been more insulated from the impact of COVID during 2020 than R&DS or CSMS, right? So our data analytics, consulting, our real-world business were pretty much unaffected. And as you noted, the only pockets there",406,"Yes. Thank you. Look, TAS, in general, has been more insulated from the impact of COVID during 2020 than R&DS or CSMS, right? So our data analytics, consulting, our real-world business were pretty much unaffected. And as you noted, the only pockets there that we had -- where we had issues were the events management business, which essentially came to a halt.
Now in the fourth quarter, the underlying TAS business returned to normal growth rate. It had already returned to normal growth rates in the third quarter. I think we posted 9.2% of constant currency growth in the third quarter. The sequential increase in that growth rate in the fourth quarter, which is about, let's call it, 600 basis points, was entirely new, as you noted, to the incremental work from COVID-related activities. So we expect this incremental contribution to continue about the same pace into the first quarter.
Now similar to R&DS, the COVID work in TAS has been faster execution, and the guidance that we give you for 2021 does include the COVID work that we have visibility to. But I can tell you, there's no COVID work in the second half of 2021 that's built into our guidance. It's still early in the year, so this could change, right? It's not going to stop abruptly. But right now, the bulk of what we see in terms of COVID work in TAS for 2021 is in the first quarter, similar as in the fourth quarter and a little bit of tail in the second quarter, and that's it.
What is that COVID work by the way? It's mainly related to projects for governments, essentially using our people and analytics to support authorities in the management of the crisis. There's the real work -- real-world work for the FDA that I described in my introductory remarks. We're also performing large-scale diagnostic testing and monitoring of COVID patients for other governments in Europe, in Asia, around the world. And we are assuming that's going to go away, certainly by the middle of the year in our guidance. But again, that could be -- that could prove to be -- I have an expectation -- again, it's not built in the guidance. I have an expectation that we will continue to have similar type of work as we've developed capabilities and really a new set of offerings, which we intend to go to market going forward."

I mean look, mid-double-digit growth in TAS is not the new norm. We said TAS growth accelerated, but we accelerated to the high single-digit growth that we always anticipated pre pandemic. If you go back to the guidance we gave, the long-term guidance we gave you in June of 2019, we did expect TAS to reach high single digits, 8%, 9% and eventually 10%, but that's the underlying TAS growth business.
Now with R&DS, it also, of course, would be misleading to look at the R&DS business and say that's the new norm with mid-double-digit growth. Obviously, it's hard to -- it's harder to determine what we would have been without the COVID work because without the COVID work, there would have been other business that had essentially been pushed to the right, right, in R&DS, as you can understand. But by the way, even absent the large COVID trials that we've been privileged to work on, we would have had very strong underlying R&DS services growth in the fourth quarter as well.
Now we expect COVID work to be with us through 2021 and maybe also into 2022 because there's a need for vaccines from multiple manufacturers to meet global demand; there are new vaccines that are being developed for variants of the virus; there are alternative vaccines that are needed in case of adverse safety events or quality issues or manufacturing delays; there are novel treatment programs that are targeted at specific populations and conditions; and of course, there are postapproval commitments to regulators, all of which do require continued R&DS work.
Now look, we have a large backlog to execute, $22.6 billion at the end of 2020. We are -- look, we have to have the ability to execute on this existing backlog, and that ability will continue to improve. Site start-up and patient recruitment continues to improve. The next 12 months revenue from backlog has increased. So all of this provides the basis for our 2021 R&DS revenue guidance.
The pipeline of opportunities is very strong. If we exclude COVID opportunities, our pipeline is showing good growth. For example, the oncology pipeline is in the mid-double-digit growth. The CNS pipeline is up low double digits, 12 -- it's 12%, 13%. Cardiovascular and diabetes pipe is growing strong double digits, very, very strong double digits.
So if your question is suggesting that what happens post COVID, we're not falling off a cliff. We have -- the vast majority of the backlog is not COVID, obviously. If you look at our bookings in 2020, every quarter, except for the first quarter, obviously, COVID-related work represented between 15% and 20% of our services bookings. And for the year, I think it was exactly 15%, 1-5. So we continue to book very, very solid good business across all therapy areas. And we expect our strong growth in R&DS to continue even post COVID."

And that really created huge headwinds for our R&DS business as you know.
Second quarter earnings call, we told you that we had gone up to 53% site access, and at the end of the third quarter, we were at about 70% site access. And the kind of bad news, good news here is that we have not improved that metric. It remains at 70%. However, we've learned to work around that. And the reason why it hasn't gone back to 100%, frankly, is because of all these new flare-ups, et cetera. But the good news here is that it's been all right because the -- it's not so much we found really the number of sites, but it's really other metrics. The main metric we looked at, at the beginning of the pandemic was site access because, again, without that, you've got nothing. But we found out that there is a critical mass of site access, which, again, we think is about the level where we are now, whereby our remote monitoring capabilities then prevent material disruption to the delivery of our services in general. We've got site networks relationships. We can work around sites that are not yet up and running for clinical research. And today, we can pivot much faster to remote monitoring versus when this pandemic hit.
Now if you look at start-up activity, which is another important metric that we were looking at, which had also come to a halt, it's now back to baseline levels pre pandemic. And that's extremely good news. And there hasn't been any major change from this due to the increases in COVID cases or the new variants of the virus. So start-up activity, people have room to work with the virus, and it's essentially back to prepandemic levels, and we don't see that changing.
Patient recruitment, another very important metric. Obviously, it usually lags site start-up, but essentially, those trends are very strong, and the patients are returning to sites essentially close to prepandemic levels. So again, we're very encouraged by that. You had another question on..."

If you step back and think about what OCT is, there's really 4 blocks: there's a Digital Site Suite, which focus on the site portal, payments, eTMF; then there's a digital patient suite, with -- what the patient has to go through with eConsent, eCOA, that's where the Virtual Trial essentially is, the study hub; then you have the Digital Trial Management Suite with the CTMS, Risk-Based Monitoring; and then you have the compliance suite with RIM Smart and Vigilance. So the technologies in our site suite, the patient suite and the compliance suite went live during 2020. And the technologies in our trial management suite will be going live shortly, most likely end of the first quarter, beginning of the second quarter of this year. So again, of these 4 suites, the site, the patient and the compliance, they all went live during 2020. And the trial management suite will be live -- to be -- probably March, April time frame this year.
And we are seeing very strong interest from clients. We've seen an increase in RFP activity for the OCT platform, not just for individual suites or stand-alone products, but for the whole platform. We are seeing interest from all customer segments, large, mid and EBP. And stay tuned, we'll report more on that.

So what we've tried to do is provide guidance to tell you how much we think is going to burn during the course of the year, the next 12 months revenue and allow you to take it from there. Yes, the COVID work does burn quicker than the other work. There's no question about that. But we don't guide to a particular backlog conversion rate because it's just too difficult to do because it depends also on how much you happen to be booking. If you're booking a lot, like we have been recently, and obviously, the backlog goes up and the burn rate goes down, but that's not a bad thing.
So yes, I would expect you would see a faster burn of the COVID-related work, which we mentioned was about 15% of our service bookings in 2020, and a more normal rate of burn on the rest of the backlog. And I think it still remains to be seen how much additional COVID-related work we're going to book as we go through 2021. That's still a question mark."

The -- as you can see from our cash flow statement, the principal driver, in fact, pretty much the whole driver of our improvement in cash flow -- free cash flow in 2020 was due to improved collections performance. And that's a combination of collecting quicker but also billing in a more timely structure in our contracts so -- that we built earlier. And part of our collections effort, which we put a lot of focus on, was bringing down our overdue receivables. We took our eye off the ball on that a little bit and put a lot of focus on that. And we're able to substantially put a dent in our overdue receivables, which has helped quite a bit.
And I think a lot of the processes we put in place, all of them should persist into 2021. We have to continue to put emphasis on it, but we've improved our processes, and we expect that to continue.
Now you did identify something that's important, which is that the COVID-related work did bring some benefit in terms of customer advances and being able to bill in advance that helped our 2020 cash flow. I would -- so when you look at our 2020 cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net income, it was unusually high. We target more in the 80% to 90% free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net income in a normal year. But cash flow is very lumpy. So it bounces around. We had a very strong year in 2021. It means as a percentage of net income -- excuse me, 2020 as a percentage of net income, it probably won't be quite as strong in 2020. But fundamentally, we've improved quite a lot in terms of cash conversion, and you should see continued benefit from that going into the future."

This morning, we reported reported first quarter results with strong double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. And as a result of this performance, we have once again raised [Audio Gap] pre-COVID plans for 2021. 
Our revised guidance today significantly exceeds those original plans. In many ways, 2020 was a reset year for our company and also for the industry. We've been saying for a long time that the traditional time lines for the development of new drugs raised the bar in terms of what expectations should be. 
The crisis accelerated the adoption of new technologies and we believe it will force a lasting change in how innovative medicines are developed or relevant to our clients and has highlighted the power of our differentiated offerings. The deep client engagements that we had during the pandemic demonstrated how uniquely [Audio Gap] that can improve drug development and commercial time lines. 
[Audio Gap] push to the right. And two, the trial costs that did not get started as they were crowded out by the COVID. This pent-up demand across therapy areas combined with record levels of [Audio Gap] process of revisiting our Vision 2022 goals. 
We plan to update you later this year on our vision 2022 progress, and lay the groundwork for the next phase of our journey. Stay tuned for more information. For now, let's review the quarter. 
Revenue for the first quarter grew 24% on a reported basis and 21% at constant currency, was $209 million above the high end of our guidance range. About half of these bit came from higher pass-throughs. 
First, [Audio Gap] organic revenue performance. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.18 grew 45%. The beat here entirely reflects the adjusted EBITDA drop-through. A little bit more color on the business. Our commercial technology presence continues to grow as we launch new offerings in the market. During the quarter, it [Audio Gap] in 14 countries, marketing inactivities by providing  automated sales call recommendations to the field [Audio Gap] machine learning algorithms. 
Our technology platform or electronic world as well as R&D team is also experiencing strong user-friendly interface to collect clinical data directly from patients. We launched this solution during 2019, and the team is seeing strong user acceptance. To date, we've been awarded over 125 studies with over 300,000 patients enrolled and over 4 million surveys completed. 
We continue to build on our strong bookings momentum in our NBS business. In the first quarter, we achieved a [Audio Gap] for LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.52, including pass-throughs; and 1.45, excluding pass-throughs. These numbers are all the more impressive, obviously, given our strong revenue growth. 
Our contracted backlog in RDS, including pass-throughs, grew 18.3% year-over-year Eloxatin it's $5 billion. That's up 31.1% year-over-year. 
The R&D team is building on the success we experienced in 2020 with our hybrid virtual trial offering or the term of art is now decentralized trials. In the first quarter, we won decentralized trials in new therapeutic areas, including cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. 
We are working with 5 of the top [Audio Gap] we have recruited almost [Audio Gap] interest in Q square solutions from Quest Diagnostics is an industry-leading laboratory services safety bio analytical, vaccine, genomics [Audio Gap] for us and gives us the flexibility to build out greater bioanalytical, genomic and biomarker capabilities as we see increased attractive growth opportunities in this expanding market.

GAAP net income was $212 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share almost $425 million for the first quarter and adjusted [Audio Gap] to $2.18. The solutions delivered another exceptional quarter of net new business. [Audio Gap] 
And of course, this metric now includes the first quarter of 2020, which is a further indication that we see the momentum of the business continuing beyond this year. 
Now let's review the balance sheet. At March [indiscernible] and debt was $12.2 [indiscernible] $9 billion. Our railing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, marking the first time since just following the merger that this ratio was below 4x. 
And this is particularly [Audio Gap] and we're pleased to have achieved this to target entering 2021. First quarter cash flow, free cash flow, in particular was very strong $867 million. CapEx was 149 in a $7 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under for the program.

Today, we're revising our guidance upward again as follows. We're raising our full year 2021 revenue guidance, both at the low and the high end of the range, resulting in an increase. The new revenue guidance is $13.200 billion to $13.500 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 16.2% to 18.8%. [Audio Gap]
Now compared to the prior year, FX is expected to be a tailwind of about 150 basis points to full year revenue growth. From a segment perspective, we now expect full MS business would be slightly down, remains unchanged. 
We're also raising our full year profit guidance. As a result of stronger revenue outlook, we've increased please adjusted EBITDA guidance at both below and high-end of the range. It's resulting in an increase of $133 million at the midpoint. Our new full year growth. $55 million [Audio Gap] transaction on April 1, as a result of that, we raised our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.12 to a new range of $7.89 to $8.20. 
We're now raising both the low and diluted EPS guidance of $8.50 to $8.75 or year-over-year growth of 32.4% to 36.3%. A little bit of detail on the P&L. An effective tax rate of approximately 20% for the full year. This guidance assumes a current foreign [Audio Gap]

I'd like to make you aware of a couple of leadership  changes within IQVIA. Andrew Marckwick who has lead our Corporate FP&A function will take over as SVP of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Nick has been in his role for over 3 years and has a very deep knowledge of the company and our financials. Now he will be succeeded by Mike Fido, who has served as CFO of the R&D FT unit for the past 2 years. 
And finally, those of you on the fixed income side know that Andrew has also served as our Treasurer for the past couple of years. And Manny Caracas, who is our Corporate Controller, will also assume leadership of the treasury function going forward. Now rest assured, Andrew will stay around for a few days to finish up the quarter and take all your questions. [Audio Gap]"

This morning, we reported first quarter results with strong double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. And as a result of this performance and an improved outlook for the rest of the year, we have once again raised our guidance. The 2021 guidance that we provided you last quarter was already within reach of our original pre-COVID plans for 2021.  Our revised guidance today significantly exceeds those original plans.  
In many ways, 2020 was a reset year for our company and also for the industry. We've been saying for a long time that the traditional time lines for the development of new drugs are too long. The speed at which COVID vaccines were developed in 2020 has obviously raised the bar in terms of what expectations should be.  The crisis accelerated the adoption of new technologies, and we believe it will force a lasting change in how innovative medicines are developed and commercialized.  All of this has made IQVIA even more relevant to our clients and has highlighted the power of our differentiated offerings. The deep client engagement that we had during the pandemic demonstrated how uniquely positioned we are to bring new insights and expertise that can improve drug development and commercial time lines. 
What is also becoming clear is that there is a lot of pent-up demand due to, one, the many trials that were slowed down or temporarily pushed to the right; and two, the trials that did not get started as they were crowded out by the COVID resolution efforts on which everyone was focused.  This pent-up demand across therapy areas, combined with record levels of biotech funding, provide a very strong backdrop for our industry. 
As a result of these favorable conditions, we've started the process of revisiting our Vision 2022 goals. We plan to update you later this year on our Vision 22 progress and lay the groundwork for the next phase of our journey.  We may do this at an investor conference later this year, especially if we are able to hold one in person. So stay tuned for more information. 
For now, let's review the quarter.  Revenue for the first quarter grew 24% on a reported basis and 21% at constant currency, was $209 million above the high end of our guidance range. About half of these beat came from strong operational performance and a half was from higher pass-throughs.  
First quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 32%, reflecting our revenue growth and productivity measures. The $69 million beat above the high end of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger  organic revenue performance.  First quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.18 grew 45%. The beat here entirely reflects the adjusted EBITDA drop-through. 
A little bit more color on the business. Our commercial technology presence continues to grow as we launch new offerings in the market. During the quarter, a top 10 pharma client deployed our next best action solution in 14 countries. This tool is a SaaS-based technology platform that optimizes our client sales force effectiveness. It increases the success of their marketing activities by providing automated sales call recommendations to the field based on advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms.  
Our base OCM CRM win rate remains strong. We added another 10 new clients this quarter and now have 150 clients deploying about 70,000 users.  Our eCOA technology platform, or electronic Clinical Outcome Assessment, tool, which is used by our real-world as well as R&DS team is also experiencing strong demand. This cloud-based platform utilizes a user-friendly interface to collect clinical data directly from patients. We launched this solution during 2019, and the team is seeing strong user acceptance. To date, we've been awarded over 125 studies, with over 300,000 patients enrolled and over 4 million surveys completed.  
Moving now to R&DS. We continue to build on our strong bookings momentum in our R&DS business. In the first quarter, we achieved a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.41, including pass-throughs; and 1.41, excluding pass-throughs. At March 31, our  LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.52, including pass-throughs; and 1.45, excluding pass-throughs. These numbers are all the more impressive, obviously, given our strong revenue growth.  
Our contracted backlog in R&DS, including pass-throughs, grew 18.3% year-over-year to $23.2 billion at March 31, 2021. As a result, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased by over $600 million sequentially to $6.5 billion, that's up 31.1% year-over-year.  
The R&D team is building on the success we experienced in 2020 with our hybrid virtual trial offering or the term of art is now decentralized trials. In the first quarter, we won decentralized trials in new therapeutic areas, including cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.  We are working with 5 of the top 10 pharma clients. And to date, we have recruited almost 170,000 patients using our advanced decentralized trial solutions. 
Finally, you saw that on April 1, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in Q^2 Solutions from Quest Diagnostics. As you know, Q^2 is an industry-leading laboratory service provider for clinical trials with global capabilities across safety, bioanalytical, vaccine, genomics and bioanalytical testing, along with best-in-class technology in biospecimen and consent life cycle management. This transaction streamlines strategic decision-making for us and gives us the flexibility to build out greater bioanalytical, genomic and biomarker capabilities as we see increased attractive growth opportunities in this expanding market. 
With that, I will turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Ron?"

As Ari mentioned, this was a very strong quarter. Let's start first by giving some more detail on revenue.  First quarter revenue of $3.409 billion  grew 23.8% on a reported basis and 21.4% at constant currency.",1224,"Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. 
As Ari mentioned, this was a very strong quarter. Let's start first by giving some more detail on revenue.  First quarter revenue of $3.409 billion  grew 23.8% on a reported basis and 21.4% at constant currency. 
Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first quarter was $1.348 billion, which was up 20.7% reported and 17.1% at constant currency.  R&D Solutions first quarter revenue of $1.868 billion improved 29.6% at actual FX rates and 28.1% at constant currency. Pass-through revenues were a tailwind of 770 basis points to the R&DS revenue growth rate in the quarter.  CSMS revenue of $193 million was down 1.5% reported and 4.1% on a constant currency basis. 
Moving down to P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $744 million for the quarter, representing growth of 32.4%. Margins expanded 140 basis points despite significant headwinds from higher pass-through revenue and lower margin COVID work. 
GAAP net income was $212 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.09. Adjusted net income was $425 million for the first quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 45.3% to $2.18. 
R&D Solutions delivered another exceptional quarter of net new business. Backlog was up 18.3% year-over-year to $23.2 billion at March 31. Next twelve months revenue, as Ari mentioned, from backlog grew significantly and currently stands at $6.5 billion, up 31.1% year-over-year.  And of course, this metric now includes the first quarter of 2022, which is a further indication that we see the momentum of the business continuing beyond this year. 
Now let's review the balance sheet. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.3 billion  and debt was $12.2 billion, resulting in net debt of $9.9 billion. Our net leverage ratio at March 31 improved to 3.9x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, marking the first time since just following the merger that this ratio was below 4x. 
And this is particularly noteworthy. You may recall that in 2019, when we gave you our 3-year guidance, we've committed to delever to 4 turns or below exiting 2022, and we're pleased to have achieved this target entering 2021. 
First quarter cash flow, free cash flow in particular, was very strong. Cash flow from operations was $867 million. CapEx was $149 million, resulting in free cash flow of $718 million. We repurchased $50 million of our shares in the quarter, which leaves us with $867 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under the program. 
Now let's turn to guidance. You'll recall that back on April 1 when we announced the acquisition of Quest's 40% interest in our Q^2 joint venture, we raised our 2021 EPS guidance by $0.12 to reflect the elimination of Quest minority interest in the joint venture's earnings. We left our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance unchanged, of course, because we already consolidated the financials of the joint venture prior to the transaction. 
Well, today, we're revising our guidance upward again as follows. We're raising our full year 2021 revenue guidance, both at the low and the high end of the range, resulting in an increase of $625 million at the midpoint of the range. The new revenue guidance is $13.200 billion to $13.500 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 16.2% to 18.8%.  This increased guidance range reflects the first quarter strength and the continued operational momentum that we see in the business and also absorbed an FX headwind versus our previous guidance.  Now compared to the prior year, FX is expected to be a tailwind of about 150 basis points to full year revenue growth. 
From a segment perspective, we now expect full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue to grow at a low to mid-teens percentage rate and R&D Solutions to grow in the low to mid-20s. Our previous expectations that revenue in the CSMS business would be slightly down remains unchanged. 
We're also raising our full year profit guidance. As a result of stronger revenue outlook, we've increased adjusted EBITDA guidance at both the low and high end of the range, resulting in an increase of $133 million at the midpoint. Our new full year guidance is $2.900 billion to $2.965 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 21.6% to 24.4%. 
Moving to EPS. I mentioned the Q^2 transaction on April 1. As a result of that, we raised our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.12 to a new range of $7.89 to $8.20.  We're now raising both the low and the high end of that guidance range, resulting in a new adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $8.50 to $8.75 or year-over-year growth of 32.4% to 36.3%. 
A little bit of detail on the P&L. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $400 million for the year. Operational depreciation and amortization, it's still expected to be somewhat over $400 million. And we're continuing to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 20% for the full year. This guidance assumes that current foreign currency exchange rates remain in effect for the rest of the year. 
Now let's turn to the second quarter guidance. Assuming FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, second quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.225 billion to $3.300 billion, which represents reported growth of 27.9% to 30.9%; adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $690 million and $715 million, which represents reported growth of 42.9% to 48.0%; and finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2 and $2.10, up 69.5% to 78%. 
And so to summarize, we delivered very strong first quarter results, once again reporting double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. This included revenue growth of over 20% in both our TAS and R&DS segments. R&DS backlog improved to $23.2 billion, up 18% year-over-year. Next 12 months revenue from that backlog increased to $6.5 billion, up 31% year-over-year. Free cash flow was strong again this quarter. Net leverage improved to 3.9x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. And finally, given the strong momentum we see in the business, we are once again raising our full year guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. 
Before we open up the call for Q&A, I'd like to make you aware of a couple of leadership changes within IQVIA Finance organization. Andrew Markwick, who has lead our Investor Relations function for the past 4 years very capably, I think you'll all agree, is moving on to become CFO of the R&DS unit. Nick Childs, who currently runs our Corporate FP&A function, will take over as SVP of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Nick has been in his role for over 3 years and has a very deep knowledge of the company and our financials. Now he will be succeeded by [ Mike Fido ], who has served as CFO of the R&DS unit for the past 2 years.  
And finally, those of you on the fixed income side know that Andrew has also served as our Treasurer for the past couple of years. And Manny Korakis, who is our Corporate Controller, will also assume leadership of the Treasury function going forward. Now rest assured, Andrew will stay around for a few days to finish up the quarter and take all your questions and to assure a smooth transition to both Nick and Manny.
And with that, let me hand it back over to Casey, who will open the call for Q&A."

I'm sure you will miss having to talk to all of us all the time. I was going to ask, Ari, about the long-term guidance, but I think it sounds like I can anticipate the answer will be wait until later this year. Obviously, the updated revenue guidance today looks like it's a CAGR of 9% to 10% off of 19%. So it sounds like, if I heard you right, we'll get more on that later. 
So instead, maybe I'll just go back to a bigger industry question around M&A.  Ron, you mentioned getting the leverage below the target that you guys had set out. And clearly, there's a ton of activity in the space right now. So I'm curious, Ari, as you look at the business and you look at some of the movement around you in the space and what your competitors are doing, do you feel like there are capabilities that you really need to go out and buy to enhance or build out what you're already doing? Or do you think IQVIA is in a pretty formidable competitive standpoint where it is today?"

Well, John, you're -- I'm sorry, who -- hold on a sec, oh, Robert. Lots of questions here, and I would not mind that -- your long-term question either.

Lots of questions here, and I would not mind that -- your long-term question either. But the reason why we think we need to update our long-term guidance is, you will recall, in June 2019, we shared our 3-year planning process and the goals that we set for ourselves. We have called both on the top line and on the productivity measures and the continued efforts to reengineer the company and make it more efficient. And we set some targets in terms of top line and bottom line growth at the time. 
Now obviously, a lot has happened. 2020, as I said in my introductory remarks, were -- was largely reset here. And therefore, we feel it's appropriate to pause and update you on the progress we've made. And look, I think I'm not going to shock anyone to say that we think that those targets are no longer relevant and that we are going to likely grow through those numbers in 2022. To give you some more precision, we feel that we need to complete our planning process. And then when we ready later this year, we'll hopefully have an investor conference similar to what we had in June '19 and then update '22 and obviously try to give you a sense for the new maybe 2025 targets. So that's for the long-term strategy and goals. 
With respect to M&A activity in the sector, look, we're not surprised since the merger that we did IMS and Quintiles back in '16. Now we're approaching the fifth year anniversary, lots of activity has occurred. We believe strongly it's in reaction to what we did. We disturbed and disrupted the industry, which was the goal of the merger. We believe we are accomplishing the goals we had set for ourselves at the time. We believe the strategy was right, the strategic rationale was right. And hence, the flurry of activity to try to acquire those capabilities anyway possible. And barring the ability to acquire those technology, data and analytics capabilities, then CROs are compelled to either sell themselves or merge. And that's all I would say on what's happening. 
With respect to our own M&A activity, we've said before that we were interested in deploying capital to acquire strategically compelling companies that added capabilities. We've done that mostly in the technology area to accelerate the growth of our technology business and the acquisition of those capabilities. We will, of course, look every time that -- in assets that is within our businesses is put up for sale, and you probably all know what those have been or are, and we look and we do the work. In every case, we are fast so far. 
So that's all I will say. I mean we've said before that we have -- look, we have a lot of liquidity, right? We have now between the $2.3 billion at the end of the quarter and the $1.5 billion of untapped revolver capacity that's $3.8 billion. Obviously, we used $760 million of that on April 1 for the acquisition of the minority stake in the lab business, which we are very, very excited about. 
And so we have a little over $3 billion of cash on that deployable. And we'd rather spend it, a, on internal developments; b, on strategic acquisitions. And then barring all of that, we would invest the balance of available cash by redistributing to shareholders via share repurchase, as we've done historically. Thanks, Robert."

So look, on the number of trials, I have no recollection of the number of trials. I can tell you, look, the most relevant impacts from COVID are, obviously, the COVID vaccine trials, which are large and fast burning, as you know. And so that's really what moves the needle. We've got lots of small COVID-related activity all around the company, but that doesn't move the needle. What moves the needle are these COVID vaccine trials. And as you know, of the 5 Phase III large vaccine trials funded by Operation Warp Speed, we've had work on 4 of them. Now we haven't done the full clinical trial on all 4 of them. We've done it on 2 of them. And the other ones, on the third one, we've got the pharmacovigilance work; and on the other one, we have the lab work. So those are the ones that have had the most impact. 
With respect to the impact on the first quarter, excluding this work, R&DS revenue grew mid-teens. So that's the impact in the first quarter. 
What was your other question? Now you also should point out that the COVID work has had an impact on the first quarter growth forecast as well. As you know, we've said that on previous earnings calls, we've had demand from governments around the world, in the U.S., the FDA, in Europe, in Asia as well. And those have also provided high growth in the first quarter. Without those activities, the TAS revenue growth would have been in the high single digits. So roughly, I think you could say that COVID contributed all these large fast-burning COVID work and the TAS work contributed about half of the total company revenue growth. 
What was your question on the --I guess on the R&DS backlog, you asked what it is as a portion of the backlog. If I recall, Andrew, correct me if I'm wrong, if we look at the service backlog in R&DS, it's in the high single digits."

It certainly is going to remain with us through 2021 and well into 2022. 
There are many reasons for that. There are many vaccines from multiple manufacturers that are being developed to meet global demand. We are still responding to RFPs for vaccines around the world in many other countries that want to develop their own vaccines. There are follow-up studies for adapting the vaccines for the mutations of the virus. There are alternative versions of the vaccines that will be needed in case of adverse safety events or in case of quality or manufacturing issues. And then there are a bunch of novel treatment programs that are targeted at specific populations, specific conditions. And then there is a lot of safety monitoring work that is also in the pipe. 
So again, the first point, and I understand the context of your question, is that COVID-related work is not going away anytime soon and it's here for a while. We're very happy that we have our fair share of that market. What I also should say, because I know if you didn't ask the question, you're going to ask it soon, that the RFP pipeline across the board is very strong, well beyond COVID. In fact, our pipeline of qualified RFPs is approaching $25 billion, if I remember correctly."

So because of that, we've got that pent-up demand that's coming out. 
And number two, lots of projects that normally would have come in were displaced, crowded out by the efforts that everyone puts on trying to resolve the COVID situation. And so all of that is coming through.

That's not our new normal, obviously, and I explained why in response to Eric's question, was the impact of that large, fast-burning vaccine work for COVID has on our business. Now excluding all of that, the business has strong momentum. You will recall, we gave guidance for where we wanted to get as a company by the end of 2022, and we said high single digits was going to be our new normal. Well, we believe we are going to be above that, excluding all of the disruption and the unusual bubbles. 
So again, excluding that fast-burning work that we had in the first quarter, the R&DS business grew mid-double digits and the TAS business grew high single digits, excluding the COVID-related work. So that, we're very, very comfortable with. The rest of the year, obviously, will be higher than that, again, because we have the trailing impact of COVID we think well into '22 and the pent-up demand that needs to be caught up. So all of that helps build momentum. 
With respect to your specific question on real-world, it is strong double-digit growth in Q1. I mentioned the -- we spoke last time about the care registry for the FDA. We spoke about the patient monitoring efforts, the deployment of our events. We now have over 1 billion patient lives in our database, and we continue to deploy E360 platform for clients. We're deploying our eCOA platform, which helps collect clinical data directly from patients. We are extremely strong demand on real-world. Obviously, this is just getting started now, but we are seeing demand to attract patient populations in terms of people who had the virus, in terms of surveilling patients that actually took the vaccines and monitoring for potential adverse effects, et cetera. So all of that plays right smack in back in the center of what our capabilities are in real-world. Thank you, Shlomo."

Whatever I say here is just opinions and a little bit of an educated set of observations based on, as you said, improved science and being -- having our fingers on the pulse of the industry. Look, we were already gaining share, and we're not counting on others to be weaker than they were in order to gain share. We are largely -- our market share gains, which I think are evident, are the results of our unique differentiated capability and offerings. So that's number one. We don't spend that much time looking at what other people do in the industry. We focus on our strategy and building out our capabilities and trying to persuade customers that they should go with us, and we are successful doing that. 
Now if I look out, obviously, I can't miss the activity. You will recall that INC Research and inVentiv merged in order to form Syneos. LabCorp bought Chiltern. PRA bought Symphony Health. ICON is merging with PRA. PPD is selling itself to TMO. What else? LabCorp is exploring strategic alternatives, whatever that means. So lots of activity, and I'm probably missing some. 
But generally, when you -- I -- in the CRO business, there are few cases where there is synergy between 2 CROs, very few cases. If someone is largely present in Phase I or preclinical in Phase I or someone that is stronger in Phase II, Phase III, then maybe you could say there's complementarity and value. If someone is very strong in the U.S., very weak in Asia and someone else is very strong in Asia, very weak in the U.S., then there is geographic complementarity and there is value. But in most cases, they are serving the same client base. And in many cases, including for the people that I just mentioned who are merging, they are clients -- they, the 2 of them, are the preferred providers for a client. So what do you think is going to happen? The client is not going to remain with 1 provider. 
So we now are going to have a negative synergy, a dyssynergy, on the revenue side. Yes, you always have cost benefits because you don't need 2 CEOs, 2 CFOs, 2 general counsels, et cetera, et cetera. But largely, this is a project-based business. You still need a different team for every project. So your level of scalability as a result of merger and the efficiency because you put 2 CROs together is extremely limited. 
So I don't see that much value there and don't come back to me if I have -- we have [ been provided ] a CRO, again, why [ buy ] a CRO? Again, there could be cases where it does make sense, again, because the complementarity are indeed complementary or because the customer coverage is complementary, et cetera. 
Now again, we want to focus on what we do. Clearly, a company in a merger situation is weakened. We experienced it ourselves. Despite the fact that we were doing a merger between 2 totally different companies that were bringing together rich capabilities to each other, but the merger, no doubt about it, is disruptive. A sale is disruptive, talent, fees. Obviously, it's an opportunity for us. Again, we're not counting on that. We are gaining share regardless. Thank you."

We had 150 since launch. The large client deployments are going very well.  Implementations went well despite the COVID environment. Last year, there were barely  any slowdowns. In fact, some deployments are seeing accelerated time lines. Everything is on schedule. 
I don't know if we disclosed the names of the clients or not in this business. I'm not sure. The feedback is very positive, generally. The field reps are very engaged. Your way, of course, of the Roche global deployments, the Novo Nordisk international operation, the AstraZeneca U.S. deployment, all of that is largely on target with very good positive feedback. You know that OCE is rather revolutionary compared to other offerings in the market. It's just -- it's not just a CRM. It's platformed on Force.com and the Lightning Platform. It's a very collaborative tool, utilizes AI and machine learning to integrate various functions within the pharma companies' commercial operations, enables faster integration of data and, therefore, faster deployments, links the health care providers and the script data for a better view of the doctor. And all of that, again, optimizes our clients' sales force effectiveness. 
And then since then, obviously, we're adding modules that are based on the OCE platform. We've got HCP engagement management. We've got OCE optimizers. We've got next best action. All of those are enhancing functional capabilities that our clients are buying and that helps grow the business even faster."

But how do you think about -- do you have to change anything about hiring, thinking about where you're going for people? Are you worried about wage pressure? But it's clearly you're going to have to add a lot of people to continue to build -- to get to the growth.

And that's an actual challenge when you're growing and you're in a service industry. And you're right, the software-based business or the data subscription business, they are growing, but not at the pace that the services business is growing. And in aggregate, in relative terms, we're still going to need to hire people. 
Now 2 observations. Number one, in early 2020, end '19, early 2020, in anticipation of continued growth, we already had hired a lot of people. We did not restructure people in 2020. We kept people and even when they weren't working and we paid them. They are here and they're now working and delivering. So we haven't had to hire more people as much as you might think relative to our work force last year. And it's part of the reason why we're having nice margin expansion there. 
Second observation is we talked before about merger of competitors. Obviously, this is going to lead to some talent bleed and availability. And we are, in fact, being approached and the talent is there. But yes, I mean wage inflation, that's true industry -- across industry and certainly in our industry as well. 
So we'll have to deal with that. You know that we have a program to continue to seek efficiencies, scale, whether it's through consolidation of activities, using our offshore centers, automation of processes, et cetera. And we have lots of programs to create cost efficiencies that, again, the purpose of which is to continue to be able to deliver margin expansion even as we've got wage inflation.

And they're also saying although there has been pressure from the industry, from clients to extend billing terms, we're -- that's kind of winding down. There's a onetime impact, then you hit steady state. 
Now having said that, look, cash flow is lumpy. So I'm not going to promise that we're going to have $700 million of free cash flow every quarter. It tends to go up and down. But we have fundamentally shifted our emphasis on improving cash flow, and you've seen that over the past year. 
Just as a general guidance, help in the guidance, you would expect free cash flow in an average year to be between 80% and 90% of adjusted net income. And keep in mind that our adjusted net income is growing quite strongly. So our cash flow will grow on that basis. 
But in any given quarter or any given year even, it may differ from that. Cash flow is not like earnings, it isn't as smooth. It goes up and down. But yes, we have seen improvement, and we expect continued strong cash flow going forward, but expect the normal volatility that any company is going to have in cash flow."

It's an outsized improvement and gives great visibility for the next 12 months. 
And I wondered if there was also something to be read into that either that sites and patient recruitment are opening up and there's a greater comfort level that is materially in terms of your clients' willingness to move forward and sites cooperation on that and/or some of your tools for patient recruitment that are having that impact.

And yes, you're absolutely right and your observation is correct. There's been a dramatic, sequential improvement in our next 12 months revenue growth outlook for the R&DS business by over $600 million. And this is the result of our continued strong net new bookings performance as well as, again, as you pointed out correctly, steadily improving clinical trial recovery landscape. 
Now by the way, this metric of next 12 months now includes the first quarter of 2022, which is, again, an encouraging sign, as you also point out, of continuous strength well beyond this year. 
Now in terms of the improvements that we're seeing in terms of accessibility to sites and so on and so forth, recall that we had in the Q1 earnings call, just a year ago, 20% access to our -- to the sites. 20% of our sites are accessible. In the Q2 call, it was 53%; Q3 was about 70%; Q4 was slightly above 70%. And now it's higher than that and trending up as well. I think it's in the 75%, 76% range. Our guidance for 2021 takes many factors into account. 
With respect to the next 12 months LMB -- sorry, next 12 months revenue from the backlog, we do this project by project, right? It's a bottom-up process where we evaluate the expected revenue burn for each project for the next 12 months. So it's an extremely precise exercise, and I think a very relevant measure and indication of the visibility on our business going forward. 
But beyond access to site, look, the site start-up activity is essentially -- is actually above the 2019 levels. So site start-up activity is a very strong indication of revenue burn going forward and that's above pre-pandemic levels. Patient recruitment, it's close to pre-pandemic levels, and we see trending up and probably above in not-too-distant future. Patient visits, same thing, very close to pre-pandemic levels and trending up. 
So bottom line, these metrics provide a strong confidence that the trial pipeline, and I'm talking now about the non-COVID trial pipeline, the one that's being awarded or that was awarded and pushed to the right, is starting to be delivered with sites enrolling, patients enrolling and patient visits. So you're absolutely correct, and thank you for bringing up the question. I hope that you're going to draw the conclusion, Dave."

This morning, we reported second quarter results with outstanding double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. Following the strong performance, we've once again raised our guidance for the year. As you recall, we're tracking ahead of our pre-COVID V 22 financial plan.
The health of the life sciences industry continues to strengthen. New clinical trial starts are trending well above recent historical figures. They are up 22% versus 2020 levels and up 7% compared to 2019. The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand to record to numbers, indicating a large backlog of potential launches, some of which have been pushed to the right during the pandemic last year.
And finally, biotech funding continues to increase significantly. According to the National Venture Capital Association, funding totaled $25 billion in the first half of 2021. This represents an increase of 64% compared to the first half of 2020, which itself was already a record first half year.
During 2020, the pandemic disrupted execution of clinical trials and businesses requiring face-to-face interactions. But at the same time, it accelerated change in the industry. It created new demand for new services. And IQVIA is uniquely positioned to deliver based on the differentiated capabilities such as data analytics, advanced technology offerings, and of course, our deep scientific and therapeutic expertise, all of which capabilities were highlighted to our clients during the pandemic. We are confident that these capabilities will continue to drive strong demand for both our clinical and commercial offerings in 2021 into 2022 and beyond.
As we begin thinking about our plans during 2022, I am pleased to announce that we will be hosting an investor conference in New York City on November 16, where we will update you on our V 22 progress and share our plans for the next phase in IQVIA's evolution. Nick and the team will, of course, provide more details once all the logistics are set and available.
With that, let's review the second quarter in more detail. Revenue for the second quarter grew 36.4% on a reported basis and 33.2% at constant currency. This represents growth that was $176 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. About 40% of this beat came from strong operational performance, and the remainder was from higher pass-throughs.
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 49.5%, reflecting the revenue growth drop-through as well as productivity measures. The $20 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger operational performance. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.13 grew 80.5%. That was 8% above the midpoint of our guidance range and was driven entirely by the adjusted EBITDA drop-through.
Let me provide a little more update and color on the business during the quarter. Starting with our real-world evidence business. It once again performed well, strengthening its leadership position. This included a recent win with a top 20 pharma client to develop an ophthalmology evidence platform for upcoming product launches. The platform integrates primary and secondary data and layers on AI/ML tools to monitor patient safety in realtime. This will allow this client to add new products and indications to the platform without initiating new studies. This, of course, will save critical amounts of time and money while also reducing the burden on patients and sites.
Turning to our commercial technology business. It continues to increase penetration among top 10 life science companies and emerging biopharma clients. A top 5 pharma client entered during the quarter into a commercial agreement to leverage the IQVIA human data science cloud as part of their core data and digital strategy for one of their large therapeutic areas. This client plans to roll out this platform in over 50 countries to centralize all of their fragmented data assets, resolve data management complexity and improve speed to insights.
Our orchestrated customer engagement offering, OCE, gained additional ground this quarter as 9 new clients adopted the platform for commercial operations, including 2 wins with large biotech clients. One of these OCE biotech clients has the potential for a global rollout to over 20 countries. The other large biotech win represents a competitive win back of the customer-facing team in the U.S. To date, we have 159 client wins for OCE.
Our Clinical Technology Solutions team continued our path to innovation in decentralized clinical trials with the introduction of IQVIA's Clinical Data Analytics Suite or CDAS. This solution builds on our human data science cloud platform, provides life science companies with new approaches to data use and harmonization as well as producing AI/ML and analytics-based insights. As an open scalable cloud platform, CDAS seamlessly works with sponsors' existing data archive and systems. We now have all of the top 10 and 18 out of the top 20 pharma clients using at least one of the several modules within our clinical technology suite.
By connecting the right technology with the right data sources, IQVIA is enabling customers to identify new opportunities to maximize product value, get to market faster, improve departmental and business alignment and reduce costs.
Switching to our R&DS business. During the quarter, it continued to build on its strong momentum, with over $2.5 billion of net new bookings on a 606 basis. In the quarter, we achieved a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.34 including pass-throughs and 1.37 excluding pass-throughs. As of June 30, our LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.45 including pass-throughs and 1.40 excluding pass-throughs. 
Our contracted backlog in R&DS including pass-throughs grew 16.7% year-over-year to $23.9 billion as of June 30, 2021. As a result, our next 12 months' revenue from backlog increased to $6.6 billion, which is up 19.6% year-over-year.
I want to highlight the lab business, which continues to be a key driver of growth and therefore will remain an area of strong investments for IQVIA. You'll recall that on April 1, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in Q^2 Solutions from Quest Diagnostics. Following this transaction, we announced our plans to expand our laboratory operation in Scotland to bolster our investment in cutting-edge technologies, including next-generation genomic sequencing and testing.
Also in the quarter, we agreed to acquire Myriad RBM, adding to our capabilities in the lab. RBM specializes in biomarker detection and quantification testing that supports early- and late-phase drug development in key therapeutic areas such as oncology, CNS and immunology. This acquisition fits nicely into our strategy to develop specialized testing and precision medicine to help support drug development with state-of-the-art solutions. These actions further demonstrate our commitment to advancing outcomes in this space, and we are excited to continue to grow and innovate in the lab business. The Myriad RBM transaction is expected to close sometime in the third quarter.
I'll now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance in the quarter. Ron?"

R&D Solutions second quarter revenue of $1.891 billion was up 53.1% at actual FX rates and 50.7% at constant currency. Now excluding the impact of pass-through, second quarter R&DS revenue grew 44.6% year-over-year. For the first half, revenue in R&D Solutions was up 44.5% reported and 38.5% at constant currency.
CSMS revenue of $194 million in the quarter grew 9.6% reported and 7.3% on a constant currency basis. And that brings the first half CSMS revenue to $387 million, up 3.8% reported and 1.3% at constant currency.
And moving down the P&L and going to adjusted EBITDA. That was $722 million in the second quarter, which represented growth of 49.5%, bringing first half adjusted EBITDA to $1.464 billion, up 40.3% year-over-year. Second quarter GAAP net income was $175 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.90. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $387 million or $1.99 per diluted share.
Adjusted net income was $416 million for the second quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 80.5% to $2.13. For the first half, adjusted net income was $841 million or $4.32 per share.
Let's turn briefly to R&D Solutions. As Ari mentioned, we delivered another outstanding quarter of net new business. We see backlog grew 16.7% year-over-year to $23.9 billion at June 30. And next 12 months' revenue from backlog at June 30 stood at $6.6 billion, up 19.6% year-over-year.
Okay. Now on to the balance sheet. At June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 billion, and debt was $12.3 billion, which results in net debt of $10.5 billion. Our net leverage ratio at June 30 came in at 3.74x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.
Cash flow was again strong in the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $539 billion -- million and CapEx was $145 million, resulting in free cash flow of $394 million. This brought our free cash flow for the first half of 2021 to over $1.1 billion, which is a material improvement over our 2019 and 2020 results.
In the quarter, we repurchased $45 million of our shares, leaving us with $822 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our latest program.
And now on to guidance. We're raising our full year 2021 revenue guidance by $275 million at the midpoint, reflecting the strong second quarter and the continued operational momentum that we see in the business. Our new revenue guidance is $13.550 billion to $13.700 billion, which is year-over-year growth of 19.3% to 20.6%. I would note there's no FX impact versus our previous guidance. Compared to prior year FX continues to be a tailwind of 150 basis points to full year revenue growth.
Looking at the segments. We continue to expect full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue to grow low to mid-teens and R&D Solutions revenue to grow mid- to high 20s, while we now expect the CSMS business to be up low single digits.
You saw that we also raised our profit guidance. As a result of the stronger revenue outlook, we've increased our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance by $43 million at the midpoint. Our new full year guidance is $2.950 billion to $3 billion, which represents growth of 23.7% to 25.8%.
Moving to EPS. We adjusted our -- excuse me, we increased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.18 at the midpoint. Our new guidance range is $8.70 to $8.90, which is growth year-over-year of 35.5% to 38.6%. Our full year 2021 guidance assumes that June 30 foreign currency rates remain in effect for the second half.
I'd now like to review the revenue guidance for the third quarter. Third quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.290 billion and $3.365 billion, representing growth of 18.1% to 20.8%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $710 million and $730 million, up 17.5% to 20.9%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.06 and $2.13, growing 26.4% to 30.7%. And again, our third quarter 2021 guidance assumes June 30 foreign currency rates remain in effect for the quarter.
So to summarize, we delivered very strong second quarter results. We had double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. We posted revenue growth of over 20% in our TAS segment and over 50% in R&DS segment. R&DS backlog improved again to $23.9 billion, up 16.7% year-over-year. Next 12 months' revenue from that backlog increased to $6.6 billion. That's up 19.6% year-over-year. We reported another strong quarter of free cash flow. And given the momentum that we see in the business and our strong second quarter results, we're once again raising our full year guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS.
So with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for questions and answers."

The first, of course, would be our earnings growth, which was quite good. But beyond that, we've made substantial progress and continue to make progress in reducing our days sales outstanding. We've had a real focus on that over the past year, bringing down past dues, improving our billing terms with customers, building sooner because we have substantial unbilled amounts. And all of that has contributed to strong collections.
The one caveat I would say is that some of the COVID-related work does come with some advances that will burn off over time. So we're still targeting to have cash flow in any given year in the range of 80% to 90% of adjusted net income. Now obviously, substantially stronger than that so far this year. I think it's probably about 125% for the first half. And if we can beat that 80% to 90% range, great, but I think that's a good kind of medium-term sort of target for cash flow in a normal environment. But we're very happy with the progress we've made on cash flow and expect cash flow to continue to be strong for the future."

I mean, Eric, this is -- thank you for highlighting that aspect of our performance in the second quarter.

I mean, Eric, this is -- thank you for highlighting that aspect of our performance in the second quarter. As you know, we were not happy with our cash flow performance back in 2000 -- I guess, in '18, our total yearly free cash flow was $600 million. So just barely half of what the first half performance was this year. In '19, I think it was around $800 million. And last year, in 2020, we bumped that up to $1.3 billion or thereabouts. So we're very, very pleased with our performance, and just for the reasons that Ron highlighted, especially grateful to the finance team for focusing on the management of our receivables, collections and generally, bill-to-cash type of process improvements. That took a lot of efforts but we think will continue to pay dividends.
We also remember had committed to investors that we would reduce our leverage ratio from the mid- to high 4s on a net basis to 4 or less by the end of 2022. And I would note that for 2 quarters in a row, we are below that for probably a year earlier. Now again, we might see the leverage ratio move up and down, depending on circumstances and our spend on M&A and share repurchases. But that's where we are, and we're very pleased with that performance.
The second question you had was on COVID work and how much it represents. I think it's always probably best to look at how much COVID work is in our backlog. And I just want to say that the total -- the large COVID vaccine trials, which have represented the bulk of our work in COVID, represent less -- actually much less than 5% of our total backlog. And so that gives you a sense.
And in terms of -- now having said that, we expect COVID work to continue to remain part of our business for the foreseeable future. We expect COVID studies to have a long tail through 2021, well into 2022 and perhaps 2023. There will be a need for vaccines for multiple manufacturers. We still have in our pipeline RFPs for vaccine work from different companies around the world. There are new vaccines being developed for the variants. There are alternative vaccines that are being needed for adverse safety events, quality issues, manufacturing delays. And then there are a bunch of novel treatment programs that are targeting specific populations and conditions. So all of that is still in our pipeline. But again, the large vaccine work is less water than 5 percentage points of our total backlog including pass-throughs.
So any other commentary you want to make on revenue or impact or really not significant?"

We've been looking after our employees. We didn't restructure. We continue to pay our people well.
Now does it cause a certain amount of anxiety in the industry? And yes, it's true. And has it caused some level of wage inflation? Yes, that is true.

But I think we've got a combination of a lot of factors: one, catch-up work. You're correct. I mean there's a lot of work that was done last year remotely. And we still need to have site document -- on-site document verification activities that need to take place. So that's another boost to our growth.
Thirdly, there is the simple fact that projects that were supposed to get started last year were pushed to the right. And so that also has a demand. Fourthly, we've been gaining market share. We've been saying it over and over again. And I think the numbers are pretty clear. Given our consistently higher book-to-bill ratios and the size of our revenues, I think the math clearly will indicate that we are gaining share. And we are now beginning to execute on all of these projects that started with some delay last year. And finally, there is the COVID work. So all of that contributes to this very strong growth rates that we have reported. 
Your other question which were operational metrics, site access and so on. Look, we are essentially -- I think we could say about 80% or so or approaching 80% into the site access. Given all the flareups, infection grows in different parts of the world. But our guidance for 2021 takes a lot of factors into account, including site accessibility.
We also believe we are at a -- some kind -- at critical mass. In other words, we can deliver with a combination of different methods we have perfected in terms of remote visits and so on. It's good to monitor site access as a metric when it sets in the general recovery, but they don't correlate exactly with revenue recognition. There's many other metrics we track: the site startups, which have essentially returned to the baseline of 2019; patient recruitment, which are running at or above the 2019 averages; patient visits, which are essentially close to the pre-pandemic levels. So all of those -- bottom line, these metrics provide us with the confidence that the trial pipeline is not only being awarded, as exemplified by -- as illustrated by our strong bookings, but also it's starting to be delivered, meaning the sites are enrolling, the patients are enrolling and the patient visits are taking place. So I hope that clarifies where we are operationally in R&DS."

I mentioned in my introductory remarks that every single one of our -- of the top 10 pharma clients is using one module of our clinical technology suite and 18 of the top 20. So we are gaining ground and making progress.
The -- essentially all of the suites have been launched and most modules are being used, and the sales pipeline continues to increase. We see a lot of interest from our clients for the platform itself and also for individual or stand-alone modules. We're seeing interest from all customer segments. I talked about the top 20, but it's also true for the mid and EVP. We have demands for multiple products within the digital patient suite. Some of that is driving some of the growth that you saw on the TAS business.
The CDAS suite, which I talked about in my introductory remarks, is the Clinical Data Analytics Suite connects structured and nonstructured data from clinical trials into a central repository that creates one version of the truth that allows predictive analytics to be run, et cetera. It's a key benefit for clients, which, as you know, the big vaccine issue in health care is the interoperability of data between customers, between the people who run the the trials, like IQVIA in this case, and various competitive applications and data sources.
So the CDAS product eliminates the need to reconnect individual applications to each other. And instead, these applications, they connect directly to CDAS and enable us to harmonize the data and provide an intuitive and scalable solution to map multiple clinical data sources enables us to use AI/ML layers of analytics using this single-data ecosystem. So we are very pleased with the progress. Our clients are beginning to understand the value, and we are beginning to penetrate that customer base. Thank you."

We are performing well with the large pharma deployments, which we have talked about. I think Roche already has 15,000-or-so users in deployment.

We talked about it before. We used to call it Virtual Trials. Hybrid trials, we talked about it and we felt we were making great progress. And then the pandemic happened, and we saw how critical those capabilities were, and that accelerated the development.
Basically, it's a combination of remote technologies and digital -- the part of the clinical trial that can be digitized. So the suite for us combined eConsent, which you're familiar with, telemedicine, modules, eCOA, and of course, a lot of digital communication. It basically optimizes and virtualizes the relationships between local labs, health care providers when it's necessary. It sort of establishes a virtual network of investigators and care professionals. And what we do is that we agree on preset terms with the investigators that agreed to participate.
We have internally operationalized this business and we have a separate team, a decentralized trial team. For example, we've got decentralized clinical trial clinical research coordinator that can support the sites in a remote way, help navigate technology. This is new for all of the investigators and certainly for the patients. So we need -- we figured out during the pandemic that we needed a centralized team to assist, sort of kind of a help desk, if you will. There are -- there's also -- so there's kind of a sort of a wide growth service to help patients and sites through the decentralized trial process.
We also have research nurses and phlebotomy solutions team that build on our global network to support the decentralized studies. So again, we are moving to -- from -- we moved from the pre-2020 piloting phase where we had, I believe, at the time, sort of 60-or-so small trials that essentially were experimental in nature and people wanted to sort of try it out to a maturing phase.
We have added many wins. We've -- so far in 2021, I think we have more than a dozen larger decentralized clinical trials that were won. We added new therapeutic areas. We are working with 5 of the top 10 large pharma clients. And I would note that one of the reasons we were able to win so many, a bigger proportion than anyone else of the COVID work, whether it's therapeutic trials or vaccine trial, was our more advanced decentralized trial capability.
And again, we cover probably 10-or-so therapeutic areas, nephrology, oncology, psychiatry, CNS, dermatology, et cetera. And it's moving to a more mature phase, and we will speak more about that in the future. Again, in the context of the very large R&D business we have, it's still not something that's kind of moving the needle in the numbers. Given the very strong growth that we have, it's not materializing.

And soon enough, we're going to be the only one standing here that's independent. But we -- look, generally, the clinical trial business is an attractive area. It's a high-growth area. It's something that's well into the long term going to deliver superior returns, we believe, as an industry, and that is attracting a lot of interest from buyers, whether it's private equity or other large entities that want to search of accelerate -- opportunities to accelerate their revenue or profit growth. So that -- all of that is good news for our industry.
In terms of what are the consequences strategically, operationally, I think it's pretty clear that -- first of all, we don't need to ""participate."" obviously, we look every time, and most of these companies have been shopped to us obviously. We look at these companies. And in all cases, we've passed because we think the valuations or our ability to gain share does not require us to buy or to participate in this M&A trend.
It's hard to gain a lot when you -- for a CRO to acquire another CRO. I mean there are opportunities to complement capabilities, whether it's therapeutic-wise or geographic-wise, that could be areas of the business, preclinical Phase I, Phase II, Phase III complementary strengths. So again, these are the 3 dimensions: geography, therapy areas or stage in the drug development process that could lend themselves to more or less complementarity or overlap.
Now the consolidation has taken place does provide opportunities. As you know, I said before, we have been gaining share significantly. So we don't need to do that. It is a fact that when there is a large merger or large acquisition, there is disruption. We believe it ourselves. So there is generally a loss of talent, and we are seeing it for -- coming from others. And there is generally a desire by customers to keep 2, 3 or 4 providers. And so if providers overlap when they serve the same customer, you can expect that the sponsor will look to further diversify their provider base. So all of this is true.
Look, we -- both talent and customers are present opportunities, but we're not so focused on this. We just -- we're focused on executing on our strategy. It's worked so far, and we're confident it will continue to work.
Other acquisitions, obviously, looking at things. As always, there's a rich pipeline always. You've noted we haven't done much last year. We haven't done much this year so far, save for the Q^2 minority acquisition. But we are looking at other things always in the technology space. And we have a rich pipeline. It's just -- it's a binary thing. Acquisition happen or they don't happen. So I can't really talk a bunch about that."

I mean, look, a lot of clients did not cancel contracts last year because they didn't know how long this was going to last. And while our field reps weren't able to actually be in the field, but many of them remained on the bench with contracts kind of suspended or we renegotiated. That caused some disruption. And as we have begun turning the business around but -- so it slipped and went back into the red in terms of revenue growth.
But now we're seeing that we are going back -- and I mean, look, this is never going to be a double-digit grower, I don't think. So this is the best it's going to be, single-digit growth. And we are managing it. It's becoming less of a flash point, simply because in the size of our company and the growth of the rest of the business, this is becoming relatively small.
Now look, you will recall that we -- shortly after the merger nearly 5 years ago, we tried to sell it. As a whole, we then found that it wouldn't catch much of a value. And therefore, we pulled the business, integrated it into our regions. It's very integrated now into our commercial operations. There are contracts which is very useful. In fact, I've mentioned before the decentralized trial business, where we are using nurses from that -- from the CSMS business to help with the virtual aspects for the -- going to visit patients at home and so on. So there's kind of an added value. It's not going to move the needle one way or the other as it used to be in the old Quintiles days or in the early IQVIA days.

The health of the life sciences industry continues to strengthen. New clinical trial starts are trending well above recent historical figures. They are up 22% versus 2020 levels and up 7% compared to 2019. The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand to record numbers, indicating a large backlog of potential launches, some of which have been pushed to the right during the pandemic last year. 
And finally, biotech funding continues to increase significantly. According to the National Venture Capital Association, funding totaled $25 billion in the first half of 2021. This represents an increase of 64% compared to the first half of 2020, which itself was already a record first half year. 
During 2020, the pandemic disrupted execution of clinical trials and businesses requiring face-to-face interactions. But at the same time, it accelerated change in the industry. It created new demand for new services. And IQVIA is uniquely positioned to deliver based on the differentiated capabilities such as data analytics, advanced technology offerings, and of course, our deep scientific and therapeutic expertise, all of which capabilities were highlighted to our clients during the pandemic. 
We are confident that these capabilities will continue to drive strong demand for both our clinical and commercial offerings in 2021 into 2022 and beyond. 
As we begin thinking about our plans during 2022, I am pleased to announce that we will be hosting an investor conference in New York City on November 16, where we will update you on our V 22 progress and share our plans for the next phase in IQVIA's evolution. Nick and the team will, of course, provide more details once all the logistics are set and available. 
With that, let's review the second quarter in more detail. Revenue for the second quarter grew 36.4% on a reported basis and 33.2% at constant currency. This represents growth that was $176 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. About 40% of this beat came from strong operational performance, and the remainder was from higher pass-throughs. 
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 49.5%, reflecting the revenue growth drop-through as well as productivity measures. The $20 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger operational performance. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.13 grew 80.5%. That was 8% above the midpoint of our guidance range and was driven entirely by the adjusted EBITDA drop-through. 
Let me provide a little more update and color on the business during the quarter. Starting with our real-world evidence business. It once again performed well, strengthening its leadership position. This included a recent win with a top 20 pharma client to develop an ophthalmology evidence platform for upcoming product launches. The platform integrates primary and secondary data and layers on AI/ML tools to monitor patient safety in realtime. This will allow this client to add new products and indications to the platform without initiating new studies. This, of course, will save critical amounts of time and money while also reducing the burden on patients and sites. 
Turning to our commercial technology business. It continues to increase penetration among top 10 life science companies and emerging biopharma clients. A top 5 pharma client entered during the quarter into a commercial agreement to leverage the IQVIA human data science cloud as part of their core data and digital strategy for one of their large therapeutic areas. This client plans to roll out this platform in over 50 countries to centralize all of their fragmented data assets, resolve data management complexities and improve speed to insights. 
Our orchestrated customer engagement offering, OCE, gained additional ground this quarter as 9 new clients adopted the platform for commercial operations, including 2 wins with large biotech clients. One of these OCE biotech clients has the potential for a global rollout to over 20 countries. The other large biotech win represents a competitive win back of the customer-facing team in the U.S. To date, we have 159 client wins for OCE. 
Our clinical technology solutions team continued our path to innovation in decentralized clinical trials with the introduction of IQVIA's Clinical Data Analytics Suite or CDAS. This solution builds on our human data science cloud platform, provides life science companies with new approaches to data use and harmonization as well as producing AI/ML and analytics-based insights. As an open scalable cloud platform, CDAS seamlessly works with sponsors' existing data archive and systems. We now have all of the top 10 and 18 out of the top 20 pharma clients using at least one of the several modules within our clinical technology suite. 
By connecting the right technology with the right data sources, IQVIA is enabling customers to identify new opportunities to maximize product value, get to market faster, improve departmental and business alignment and reduce costs. 
Switching to our R&DS business. During the quarter, it continued to build on its strong momentum, with over $2.5 billion of net new bookings on a 606 basis. In the quarter, we achieved a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.34 including pass-throughs and 1.37 excluding pass-throughs. As of June 30, our LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.45 including pass-throughs and 1.40 excluding pass-throughs. 
Our contracted backlog in R&DS including pass-throughs grew 16.7% year-over-year to $23.9 billion as of June 30, 2021. As a result, our next 12 months' revenue from backlog increased to $6.6 billion, which is up 19.6% year-over-year. 
I want to highlight the lab business, which continues to be a key driver of growth and, therefore, will remain an area of strong investments for IQVIA. You'll recall that on April 1, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in Q2 Solutions from Quest Diagnostics. Following this transaction, we announced our plans to expand our laboratory operation in Scotland to bolster our investment in cutting-edge technology, including next-generation genomic sequencing and testing. 
Also in the quarter, we agreed to acquire Myriad RBM, adding to our capabilities in the lab. RBM specializes in biomarker detection and quantification testing that supports early- and late-phase drug development in key therapeutic areas such as oncology, CNS and immunology. This acquisition fits nicely into our strategy to develop specialized testing and precision medicine to help support drug development with state-of-the-art solutions. These actions further demonstrate our commitment to advancing outcomes in this space, and we are excited to continue to grow and innovate in the lab business. The Myriad RBM transaction is expected to close sometime in the third quarter. 
I'll now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance in the quarter. Ron?"

Let me first start with revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3.438 billion grew 36.4% on a reported basis and 33.2% at constant currency. First half revenue was $6.847 billion, growing at 29.8% reported and 27%",879,"Yes. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let me first start with revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3.438 billion grew 36.4% on a reported basis and 33.2% at constant currency. First half revenue was $6.847 billion, growing at 29.8% reported and 27% at constant currency. 
Our Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the second quarter was $1.353 billion. That was up 22% reported and 17.9% at constant currency. For the first half, Tech & Analytics Solutions revenue was $2.701 billion, up 21.3% reported and 17.5% at constant currency. 
R&D Solutions second quarter revenue of $1.891 billion was up 53.1% at actual FX rate and 50.7% at constant currency. Now excluding the impact of pass-through, second quarter R&DS revenue grew 44.6% year-over-year. For the first half, revenue in R&D Solutions was up 44.5% reported and 38.5% at constant currency. 
CSMS revenue of $194 million in the quarter grew 9.6% reported and 7.3% on a constant currency basis. And that brings the first half CSMS revenue to $387 million, up 3.8% reported and 1.3% at constant currency. 
And moving down the P&L and going to adjusted EBITDA. That was $722 million in the second quarter, which represented growth of 49.5%, bringing first half adjusted EBITDA to $1.466 billion, up 40.3% year-over-year. Second quarter GAAP net income was $175 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.90. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $387 million or $1.99 per diluted share. 
Adjusted net income was $416 million for the second quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 80.5% to $2.13. For the first half, adjusted net income was $841 million or $4.32 per share. 
Let's turn briefly to R&D Solutions. As Ari mentioned, we delivered another outstanding quarter of net new business. We see backlog grew 16.7% year-over-year to $23.9 billion at June 30. And next 12 months' revenue from backlog at June 30 stood at $6.6 billion, up 19.6% year-over-year. 
Okay. Now on to the balance sheet. At June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 billion, and debt was $12.3 billion, which results in net debt of $10.5 billion. Our net leverage ratio at June 30 came in at 3.74x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. 
Cash flow was again strong in the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $539 billion -- million and CapEx was $145 million, resulting in free cash flow of $394 million. This brought our free cash flow for the first half of 2021 to over $1.1 billion, which is a material improvement over our 2019 and 2020 results. 
In the quarter, we repurchased $45 million of our shares, leaving us with $822 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our latest program. 
And now on to guidance. We're raising our full year 2021 revenue guidance by $275 million at the midpoint, reflecting the strong second quarter and the continued operational momentum that we see in the business. Our new revenue guidance is $13.550 billion to $13.700 billion, which is year-over-year growth of 19.3% to 20.6%. I would note there's no FX impact versus our previous guidance. Compared to prior year FX continues to be a tailwind of 150 basis points to full year revenue growth. 
Looking at the segments. We continue to expect full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue to grow low to mid-teens and R&D Solutions revenue to grow mid- to high 20s, while we now expect the CSMS business to be up low single digits. 
You saw that we also raised our profit guidance. As a result of the stronger revenue outlook, we've increased our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance by $43 million at the midpoint. Our new full year guidance is $2.950 billion to $3 billion, which represents growth of 23.7% to 25.8%. 
Moving to EPS. We adjusted our -- excuse me, we increased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.18 at the midpoint. Our new guidance range is $8.70 to $8.90, which is growth year-over-year of 35.5% to 38.6%. 
Our full year 2021 guidance assumes that June 30 foreign currency rates remain in effect for the second half. 
Now to review the revenue guidance for the third quarter. Third quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.290 billion and $3.365 billion, representing growth of 18.1% to 20.8%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $710 million and $730 million, up 17.5% to 20.9%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.06 and $2.13, growing 26.4% to 30.7%. And again, our third quarter 2021 guidance assumes June 30 foreign currency rates remain in effect for the quarter. 
So to summarize, we delivered very strong second quarter results. We had double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. We posted revenue growth of over 20% in our TAS segment and over 50% in R&DS segment. R&DS backlog improved again to $23.9 billion, up 16.7% year-over-year. Next 12 months' revenue from that backlog increased to $6.6 billion. That's up 19.6% year-over-year. We reported another strong quarter of free cash flow. And given the momentum that we see in the business and our strong second quarter results, we're once again raising our full year guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. 
So with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for questions and answers."

Second question, just COVID-related. It's the typical standard ask: if you could give any insights on COVID revenue in the quarter, bookings, backlog, thoughts on the tail end of 2022, that would be helpful as well."

The first, of course, would be our earnings growth, which was quite good. But beyond that, we've made substantial progress and continue to make progress in reducing our days sales outstanding. We've had a real focus on that over the past year, bringing down past dues, improving our billing terms with customers, billing sooner because we have substantial unbilled amounts. And all of that has contributed to strong collections. 
The one caveat I would say is that some of the COVID-related work does come with some advances that will burn off over time. So we're still targeting to have cash flow in any given year in the range of 80% to 90% of adjusted net income. Now obviously, substantially stronger than that so far this year. I think it's probably about 125% for the first half. And if we can beat that 80% to 90% range, great, but I think that's a good kind of medium-term sort of target for cash flow in a normal environment. But we're very happy with the progress we've made on cash flow and expect cash flow to continue to be strong for the future."

I mean, Eric, this is -- thank you for highlighting that aspect of our performance in the second quarter.

I mean, Eric, this is -- thank you for highlighting that aspect of our performance in the second quarter. As you know, we were not happy with our cash flow performance back in 2000 -- I guess, in '18, our total yearly free cash flow was $600 million. So just barely half of what the first half performance was this year. In '19, I think it was around $800 million. And last year, in 2020, we bumped that up to $1.3 billion or thereabouts. So we're very, very pleased with our performance, and just for the reasons that Ron highlighted, especially grateful to the finance team for focusing on the management of our receivables, collections and generally, bill-to-cash type of process improvements. That took a lot of efforts but we think we'll continue to pay dividends. 
We also remember had committed to investors that we would reduce our leverage ratio from the mid- to high 4s on a net basis to 4 or less by the end of 2022. And I would note that for 2 quarters in a row, we are below that for probably a year earlier. Now again, we might see the average ratio move up and down, depending on circumstances and our spend on M&A and share repurchases. But that's where we are, and we're very pleased with that performance. 
The second question you had was on COVID work and how much it represents. I think it's always probably best to look at how much COVID work is in our backlog. And I just want to say that the total -- the large COVID vaccine trials which have represented the bulk of our work in COVID, represent less -- actually much less than 5% of our total backlog. And so that gives you a sense. 
And in terms of -- now having said that, we expect COVID work to continue to remain part of our business for the foreseeable future. We expect COVID studies to have a long tail through 2021, well into 2022 and perhaps 2023. There will be a need for vaccines for multiple manufacturers. We still have, in our pipeline, RFPs for vaccine work from different companies around the world. There are new vaccines being developed for the variants. There are alternative vaccines that are being needed for adverse safety events, quality issues, manufacturing delays. And then there are a bunch of novel treatment programs that are targeting specific populations and conditions. So all of that is still in our pipeline. But again, the large vaccine work is less, way less than 5 percentage points of our total backlog including pass-throughs. 
So any other commentary you want to make on revenue or impact are really not significant."

We've been looking after our employees. We didn't restructure. We continue to pay our people well.

And we are now beginning to execute on all of these projects that started with some delay last year. And finally, there is the COVID work. So all of that contributes to this very strong growth rates that we have reported. 
Your other question which were operational metrics, site access and so on. Look, we are essentially -- I think we could say about 80% or so or approaching 80% into the site access. Given all the flareups, infection grows in different parts of the world. But our guidance for 2021 takes a lot of factors into account, including site accessibility.
We also believe we are at a -- some kind -- at critical mass. In other words, at 80%, we can deliver, with a combination of different methods we have perfected in terms of remote visits and so on. It's good to monitor site access as a metric when it sets in the general recovery, but they don't correlate exactly with revenue recognition. There's many other metrics we track: the site startups, which have essentially returned to the baseline of 2019; patient recruitment, which are running at or above the 2019 averages; patient visits, which are essentially close to the pre-pandemic levels. 
So all of those -- bottom line, these metrics provide us with the confidence that the non-COVID trial pipeline is not only being awarded, as exemplified by -- as illustrated by our strong bookings, but also, it's starting to be delivered, meaning the sites are enrolling, the patients are enrolling and the patient visits are taking place. So I hope that clarifies where we are operationally in R&DS."

We see a lot of interest from our clients for the platform itself and also for individual or suites stand-alone modules. We're seeing interest from all customer segments. I talked about the top 20, but it's also true for the mid- and EVP. We have demands for multiple products within the digital patient suite. Some of that is driving some of the growth that you saw on the TAS business.
The CDAS suite, which I talked about in my introductory remarks, is -- the Clinical Data Analytics Suite connects structured and nonstructured data from clinical trials into a central repository that creates one version of the truth that allows predictive analytics to be run, et cetera. It's a key benefit for clients, which, as you know, the big vaccine issue in health care is the interoperability of data between customers, between the people who run the trials, like IQVIA in this case, and various competitive applications and data sources.
So the CDAS product eliminates the need to reconnect individual applications to each other. And instead, these applications, they connect directly to CDAS and enables to harmonize the data and provide an intuitive and scalable solution to map multiple clinical data sources, enables us to use AI/ML layers of analytics using this single-data ecosystem. So we are very pleased with the progress. Our clients are beginning to understand the value, and we are beginning to penetrate that customer base. Thank you."

We talked about it before. We used to call it virtual trials, hybrid trials. We talked about it and we felt we were making great progress. And then the pandemic happened, and we saw how critical those capabilities were, and that accelerated the development.
Basically, it's a combination of remote technologies and digital -- the part of the clinical trial that can be digitized. So the suite, for us, combined eConsent, which you're familiar with, telemedicine, modules, eCOA, and of course, a lot of digital communication. It basically optimizes and virtualizes the relationships between local labs, health care providers when it's necessary. It sort of establishes a virtual network of investigators and care professionals. And what we do is that we agree on preset terms with the investigators that agreed to participate.
We have internally operationalized this business and we have a separate team, a decentralized trial team. For example, we've got decentralized clinical trial, clinical research coordinator that can support the sites in a remote way, help navigate technology. This is new for all of the investigators and certainly for the patients. So we need -- we figured out during the pandemic that we needed a centralized team to assist sort of, kind of a help desk, if you will. There are -- there's also -- so there's kind of a sort of a wide growth service to help patients and sites through the decentralized trial process.
We also have research nurses and phlebotomy solutions team that build on our global network to support the decentralized studies. So again, we are moving to -- from -- we moved from the pre-2020 piloting phase where we had, I believe, at the time, sort of 60-or-so small trials that essentially were experimental in nature and people wanted to sort of try it out to a maturing phase.
We have added many wins. We've -- so far in 2021, I think we have more than a dozen larger decentralized clinical trials that were won. We added new therapeutic areas. We are working with 5 of the top 10 large pharma clients. And I would note that one of the reasons we were able to win so many, a bigger proportion than anyone else of the COVID work, whether it's therapeutic trials or vaccine trial, was our more advanced decentralized trial capability.
And again, we cover probably 10-or-so therapeutic areas, nephrology, oncology, psychiatry, CNS, dermatology, et cetera. And it's moving to a more mature phase, and we will speak more about that in the future. Again, in the context of the very large R&DS business we have, it's still not something that's kind of moving the needle in the numbers.

And soon enough, we're going to be the only one standing here that's independent. But we -- look, generally, the clinical trial business is an attractive area. It's a high-growth area. It's something that's, well into the long term, going to deliver superior returns, we believe, as an industry, and that is attracting a lot of interest from buyers, whether it's private equity or other large entities that want to -- are in search of accelerate -- opportunities to accelerate their revenue or profit growth. So that -- all of that is good news for our industry.
In terms of what are the consequences strategically, operationally, I think it's pretty clear that -- first of all, we don't need to ""participate."" Obviously, we look every time, and most of these companies have been [ shopped ] to us obviously. We look at these companies. And in cases, we've passed because we think the valuations or our ability to gain share does not require us to buy or to participate in this M&A trend.
It's hard to gain a lot when you -- for a CRO to acquire another CRO. I mean there are opportunities to complement capabilities, whether it's therapeutic-wise or geographic-wise, that could be areas of the business, preclinical Phase I, Phase II, Phase III complementary strengths. So again, these are the 3 dimensions: geography, therapy areas or stage in the drug development process that could lend themselves to more or less complementarity overlap.
Now the consolidation has taken place thus provide opportunities. As you know, I said before, we have been, like, gaining share significantly so we don't need to do that. It is a fact that when there is a large merger or large acquisition, there is disruption. We believe it ourselves. So there is generally a loss of talent. We are seeing it for -- coming from others. And there is, generally, a desire by customers to keep 2, 3 or 4 providers. And so if providers overlap when they serve the same customer, you can expect that the sponsor will look to further diversify their provider base. So all of this is true.
Look, we -- both talent and customers are -- present opportunities, but we're not so focused on this. We just -- we're focused on executing on our strategy. It's worked so far, and we're confident it will continue to work.
Other acquisitions, obviously, we're looking at things. As always, there's a rich pipeline always. You've noted we haven't done much last year. We haven't done much this year so far, save for the Q2 minority acquisition. But we are looking at other things, always in the technology space. And we have a rich pipeline. It's just -- it's a binary thing. Acquisition happen or they don't happen. So I can't really talk much about that."

And while our field reps weren't able to actually be in the field, but many of them remained on the bench with contracts kind of suspended or renegotiated. That caused some disruption. And as we have begun turning the business around but -- so it slipped and went back into the red in terms of revenue growth.
But now we're seeing that we are going back -- and I mean, look, this is never going to be a double-digit grower, I don't think. So this is the best it's going to be, single-digit growth. And we are managing it. It's becoming less of a flash point, simply because in the size of our company and the growth of the rest of the business, this is becoming relatively small.
Now look, you will recall that we -- shortly after the merger, nearly 5 years ago, we tried to sell it as a whole. We then found that it wouldn't fetch much of a value. And therefore, we pulled the business, integrated it into our regions. It's very integrated now into our commercial operations. There are contracts which is very useful. In fact, I've mentioned before, the decentralized trial business, where we are using nurses from that -- from the CSMS business to help with the virtual aspects for the -- going to visit patients at home and so on.

This morning, we reported second quarter results with outstanding double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. Following the strong performance, we've once again raised our guidance for the year. As you recall, we're tracking ahead of our pre-COVID V22 financial plan. 
The health of the life sciences industry continues to strengthen. New clinical trial starts are trending well above recent historical figures. They are up 22% versus 2020 levels and up 7% compared to 2019. The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand to record numbers, indicating a large backlog of potential launches, some of which have been pushed to the right during the pandemic last year. 
And finally, biotech funding continues to increase significantly. According to the National Venture Capital Association, funding totaled $25 billion in the first half of 2021. This represents an increase of 64% compared to the first half of 2020, which itself was already a record first half year. 
During 2020, the pandemic disrupted execution of clinical trials and businesses requiring face-to-face interactions. But at the same time, it accelerated change in the industry. It created new demand for new services. And IQVIA is uniquely positioned to deliver based on the differentiated capabilities such as data analytics, advanced technology offerings, and of course, our deep scientific and therapeutic expertise, all of which capabilities were highlighted to our clients during the pandemic. 
We are confident that these capabilities will continue to drive strong demand for both our clinical and commercial offerings in 2021 into 2022 and beyond. 
As we begin thinking about our plans during 2022, I am pleased to announce that we will be hosting an investor conference in New York City on November 16, where we will update you on our V22 progress and share our plans for the next phase in IQVIA's evolution. Nick and the team will, of course, provide more details once all the logistics are set and available. 
With that, let's review the second quarter in more detail. Revenue for the second quarter grew 36.4% on a reported basis and 33.2% at constant currency. This represents growth that was $176 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. About 40% of this beat came from strong operational performance, and the remainder was from higher pass-throughs. 
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 49.5%, reflecting the revenue growth drop-through as well as productivity measures. The $20 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger operational performance. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.13 grew 80.5%. That was 8% above the midpoint of our guidance range and was driven entirely by the adjusted EBITDA drop-through. 
Let me provide a little more update and color on the business during the quarter. Starting with our real-world evidence business, it once again performed well, strengthening its leadership position. This included a recent win with a top 20 pharma client to develop an ophthalmology evidence platform for upcoming product launches. The platform integrates primary and secondary data and layers on AI/ML tools to monitor patient safety in real time. This will allow this client to add new products and indications to the platform without initiating new studies. This, of course, will save critical amounts of time and money while also reducing the burden on patients and sites. 
Turning to our commercial technology business. It continues to increase penetration among top 10 life science companies and emerging biopharma clients. A top 5 pharma client entered during the quarter into a commercial agreement to leverage the IQVIA human data science cloud as part of their core data and digital strategy for one of their large therapeutic areas. This client plans to roll out this platform in over 50 countries to centralize all of their fragmented data assets, resolve data management complexities and improve speed to insights. 
Our orchestrated customer engagement offering, OCE, gained additional ground this quarter as 9 new clients adopted the platform for commercial operations, including 2 wins with large biotech clients. One of these OCE biotech clients has the potential for a global rollout to over 20 countries. The other large biotech win represents a competitive win back of the customer-facing team in the U.S. To date, we have 159 client wins for OCE. 
Our clinical technology solutions team continued our path to innovation in decentralized clinical trials with the introduction of IQVIA's Clinical Data Analytics Suite or CDAS. This solution builds on our human data science cloud platform, provides life science companies with new approaches to data use and harmonization as well as producing AI/ML and analytics-based insights. As an open scalable cloud platform, CDAS seamlessly works with sponsors' existing data archive and systems. We now have all of the top 10 and 18 out of the top 20 pharma clients using at least one of the several modules within our clinical technology suite. 
By connecting the right technology with the right data sources, IQVIA is enabling customers to identify new opportunities to maximize product value, get to market faster, improve departmental and business alignment, and reduce costs. 
Switching to our R&DS business. During the quarter, it continued to build on its strong momentum, with over $2.5 billion of net new bookings on a 606 basis. In the quarter, we achieved a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.34 including pass-throughs and 1.37 excluding pass-throughs. As of June 30, our LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.45 including pass-throughs and 1.40 excluding pass-throughs. 
Our contracted backlog in R&DS including pass-throughs grew 16.7% year-over-year to $23.9 billion as of June 30, 2021. As a result, our next 12 months' revenue from backlog increased to $6.6 billion, which is up 19.6% year-over-year. 
I want to highlight the lab business, which continues to be a key driver of growth and, therefore, will remain an area of strong investment for IQVIA. You'll recall that on April 1, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in Q2 Solutions from Quest Diagnostics. Following this transaction, we announced our plans to expand our laboratory operation in Scotland to bolster our investment in cutting-edge technology, including next-generation genomic sequencing and testing. 
Also in the quarter, we agreed to acquire Myriad RBM, adding to our capabilities in the lab. RBM specializes in biomarker detection and quantification testing that supports early and late-phase drug development in key therapeutic areas such as oncology, CNS and immunology. This acquisition fits nicely into our strategy to develop specialized testing and precision medicine to help support drug development with state-of-the-art solutions. These actions further demonstrate our commitment to advancing outcomes in this space, and we are excited to continue to grow and innovate in the lab business. The Myriad RBM transaction is expected to close sometime in the third quarter. 
I'll now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance in the quarter. Ron?"

Let me first start with revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3.438 billion grew 36.4% on a reported basis and 33.2% at constant currency. First half revenue was $6.847 billion, growing at 29.8% reported and 27%",876,"Yes. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let me first start with revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3.438 billion grew 36.4% on a reported basis and 33.2% at constant currency. First half revenue was $6.847 billion, growing at 29.8% reported and 27% at constant currency. 
Our Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the second quarter was $1.353 billion. That was up 22% reported and 17.9% at constant currency. For the first half, Tech & Analytics Solutions revenue was $2.701 billion, up 21.3% reported and 17.5% at constant currency. 
R&D Solutions second quarter revenue of $1.891 billion was up 53.1% at actual FX rate and 50.7% at constant currency. Now excluding the impact of pass-through, second quarter R&DS revenue grew 44.6% year-over-year. For the first half, revenue in R&D Solutions was up 40.5% reported and 38.5% at constant currency. 
CSMS revenue of $194 million in the quarter grew 9.6% reported and 7.3% on a constant currency basis. And that brings the first half CSMS revenue to $387 million, up 3.8% reported and 1.3% at constant currency. 
And moving down the P&L and going to adjusted EBITDA. That was $722 million in the second quarter, which represented growth of 49.5%, bringing first half adjusted EBITDA to $1.466 billion, up 40.3% year-over-year. Second quarter GAAP net income was $175 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.90. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $387 million or $1.99 per diluted share.  Adjusted net income was $416 million for the second quarter. And adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 80.5% to $2.13. For the first half, adjusted net income was $841 million or $4.32 per share. 
Let's turn briefly to R&D Solutions. As Ari mentioned, we delivered another outstanding quarter of net new business. We see backlog grew 16.7% year-over-year to $23.9 billion at June 30. And next 12 months' revenue from backlog at June 30 stood at $6.6 billion, up 19.6% year-over-year. 
Okay. Now on to the balance sheet. At June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 billion, and debt was $12.3 billion, which results in net debt of $10.5 billion. Our net leverage ratio at June 30 came in at 3.74x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. 
Cash flow was again strong in the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $539 million and CapEx was $145 million, resulting in free cash flow of $394 million. This brought our free cash flow for the first half of 2021 to over $1.1 billion, which is a material improvement over our 2019 and 2020 results. 
In the quarter, we repurchased $45 million of our shares, leaving us with $822 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our latest program. 
Now on to guidance. We're raising our full year 2021 revenue guidance by $275 million at the midpoint, reflecting the strong second quarter and the continued operational momentum that we see in the business. Our new revenue guidance is $13.550 billion to $13.700 billion, which is year-over-year growth of 19.3% to 20.6%. I would note there's no FX impact versus our previous guidance. Compared to prior year, FX continues to be a tailwind of 150 basis points to full year revenue growth. 
Looking at the segments. We continue to expect full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue to grow low to mid-teens and R&D Solutions revenue to grow mid- to high 20s, while we now expect the CSMS business to be up low single digit. 
You saw that we also raised our profit guidance as a result of the stronger revenue outlook. We've increased our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance by $43 million at the midpoint. Our new full year guidance is $2.950 billion to $3 billion, which represents growth of 23.7% to 25.8%. 
Moving to EPS. We adjusted our -- excuse me, we increased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.18 at the midpoint. Our new guidance range is $8.70 to $8.90, which is growth year-over-year of 35.5% to 38.6%. 
Our full year 2021 guidance assumes that June 30 foreign currency rates remain in effect for the second half. 
Now to review the revenue guidance for the third quarter. Third quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.290 billion and $3.365 billion, representing growth of 18.1% to 20.8%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $710 million and $730 million, up 17.5% to 20.9%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.06 and $2.13, growing 26.4% to 30.7%. And again, our third quarter 2021 guidance assumes June 30 foreign currency rates remain in effect for the quarter. 
So to summarize, we delivered very strong second quarter results. We had double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. We posted revenue growth of over 20% in our TAS segment and over 50% in R&DS segment. R&DS backlog improved again to $23.9 billion, up 16.7% year-over-year. Next 12 months' revenue from that backlog increased to $6.6 billion. That's up 19.6% year-over-year. We reported another strong quarter of free cash flow. And given the momentum that we see in the business and our strong second quarter results, we're once again raising our full year guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. 
So with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for questions and answers."

The first, of course, would be our earnings growth, which was quite good. But beyond that, we've made substantial progress and continue to make progress in reducing our days sales outstanding. We've had a real focus on that over the past year, bringing down past dues, improving our billing terms with customers, billing sooner because we have substantial unbilled amounts. And all of that has contributed to strong collections. 
The one caveat I would say is that some of the COVID-related work does come with some advances that will burn off over time. So we're still targeting to have cash flow in any given year in the range of 80% to 90% of adjusted net income. Now obviously, substantially stronger than that so far this year; I think it's probably about 125% for the first half. And if we can beat that 80% to 90% range, great, but I think that's a good kind of medium-term sort of target for cash flow in a normal environment. But we're very happy with the progress we've made on cash flow and expect cash flow to continue to be strong for the future."

As you know, we were not happy with our cash flow performance. Back in, I guess, '18, our total yearly free cash flow was $600 million. So just barely half of what the first half performance was this year. In '19, I think it was around $800 million. And last year, in 2020, we bumped that up to $1.3 billion or thereabouts. So we're very, very pleased with our performance, and just for the reasons that Ron highlighted, especially grateful to the finance team for focusing on the management of our receivables, collections and generally bill-to-cash type of process improvements. That took a lot of efforts but we think will continue to pay dividends. 
We also, remember, had committed to investors that we would reduce our leverage ratio from the mid to high 4s on a net basis to 4 or less by the end of 2022. And I would note that for 2 quarters in a row, we are below that for probably a year earlier. Now again, we might see the average ratio move up and down depending on circumstances and our spend on M&A and share repurchases. But that's where we are, and we're very pleased with that performance. 
The second question you had was on COVID work and how much it represents. I think it's always probably best to look at how much COVID work is in our backlog. And I just want to say that the total -- the large COVID vaccine trials, which have represented the bulk of our work in COVID, represent less -- actually much less than 5% of our total backlog. And so that gives you a sense. 
And in terms of -- now having said that, we expect COVID work to continue to remain part of our business for the foreseeable future. We expect COVID studies to have a long tail through 2021, well into 2022 and perhaps 2023. There will be a need for vaccines for multiple manufacturers. We still have, in our pipeline, RFPs for vaccine work from different companies around the world. There are new vaccines being developed for the variants. There are alternative vaccines that are being needed for adverse safety events, quality issues, manufacturing delays. And then there are a bunch of novel treatment programs that are targeted at specific populations and conditions. So all of that is still in our pipeline. But again, the large vaccine work is less -- way less than 5 percentage points of our total backlog including pass-throughs.  So any other commentary you want to make on revenue or impact are really not significant."

In particular, when you get into the fourth quarter, the compare to last year's fourth quarter when we had a substantial amount of it is going to be negative. But you see overall, for our implied fourth quarter guidance, that it remains very strong for the company as a whole."

Look, it's no secret that given the strength of the industry backdrop, there's obviously strong competition for talent. And it's also no secret that when people need highly qualified talent, they come after IQVIA talent because they know we train people well, and we've got a broad range of skills and training programs.  So -- however, we are confident that we'll continue to be able to attract and retain the talent, simply because we are the premier company in the industry and also, frankly, because we've been investing in our employees, especially during the pandemic. We've been looking after our employees. We didn't restructure. We continued to pay our people well. 
Now does it cause a certain amount of anxiety in the industry? And yes, it's true. And has it caused some level of wage inflation? Yes, that is true. There is also a little bit of an uptick in attrition levels as a consequence of all of that. All of that is true. But again, we feel confident. We do not anticipate this to cause any significant -- there will be some level of headwind to our margins, but we have so many programs and productivity measures and process improvement measures in place that we are confident we will overwhelm. And you could see that our margins have been performing very well and growing faster than we had anticipated."

But I think we've got a combination of a lot of factors: one, catch-up work. You're correct. I mean there's a lot of work that was done last year remotely. And we still need to have site document -- on-site document verification activities that need to take place. So that's another boost to our growth.
Thirdly, there is the simple fact that projects that were supposed to get started last year were pushed to the right. And so that also has a demand. Fourthly, we've been gaining market share. We've been saying it over and over again. And I think the numbers are pretty clear. Given our consistently higher book-to-bill ratios and the size of our revenues, I think the math clearly will indicate that we are gaining share. And we are now beginning to execute on all of these projects that started with some delay last year. And finally, there is the COVID work.  So all of that contributes to this very strong growth rates that we have reported. 
Your other question which were operational metrics, site access and so on. Look, we are essentially -- I think we could say about 80% or so or approaching 80% into the site access. Given all the flareups, infection grows in different parts of the world. But our guidance for 2021 takes a lot of factors into account, including site accessibility.
We also believe we are at a some kind -- at critical mass. In other words, at 80%, we can deliver, with a combination of different methods we have perfected in terms of remote visits and so on. It's good to monitor site access as a metric when it sets in the general recovery, but they don't correlate exactly with revenue recognition. There's many other metrics we track: the site startups, which have essentially returned to the baseline of 2019; patient recruitment, which are running at or above the 2019 averages; patient visits, which are essentially close to the pre-pandemic levels. 
So all of those -- bottom line, these metrics provide us with the confidence that the non-COVID trial pipeline is not only being awarded, as exemplified by -- as illustrated by our strong bookings, but also, it's starting to be delivered, meaning the sites are enrolling, the patients are enrolling and the patient visits are taking place. So I hope that clarifies where we are operationally in R&DS."

I talked about the top 20, but it's also true for the mid- and EVP. We have demands for multiple products within the digital patient suite. Some of that is driving some of the growth that you saw on the TAS business.
The CDAS suite, which I talked about in my introductory remarks, is -- the Clinical Data Analytics Suite connects structured and nonstructured data from clinical trials into a central repository that creates one version of the truth that allows predictive analytics to be run, et cetera. It's a key benefit for clients, which, as you know, the big vexing issue in health care is the interoperability of data between customers, between the people who run the trials, like IQVIA in this case, and various competitive applications and data sources.
So the CDAS product eliminates the need to reconnect individual applications to each other. And instead, these applications, they connect directly to CDAS and enables to harmonize the data and provide an intuitive and scalable solution to map multiple clinical data sources, enables us to use AI/ML layers of analytics using this single-data ecosystem. So we are very pleased with the progress. Our clients are beginning to understand the value, and we are beginning to penetrate that customer base. Thank you."

We talked about it before. We used to call it virtual trials, hybrid trials. We talked about it and we felt we were making great progress. And then the pandemic happened, and we saw how critical those capabilities were, and that accelerated the development.
Basically, it's a combination of remote technologies and digital -- the part of the clinical trial that can be digitized. So the suite, for us, combined eConsent, which you're familiar with, telemedicine, modules, eCOA, and of course, a lot of digital communication. It basically optimizes and virtualizes the relationships between local labs, health care providers when it's necessary. It sort of establishes a virtual network of investigators and care professionals. And what we do is that we agree on preset terms with the investigators that agreed to participate.
We have internally operationalized this business and we have a separate team, a decentralized trial team. For example, we've got decentralized clinical trial, clinical research coordinator that can support the sites in a remote way, help navigate technology. This is new for all of the investigators and certainly for the patients. So we need -- we figured out during the pandemic that we needed a centralized team to assist sort of, kind of a help desk, if you will. There are -- there's also -- so there's kind of a sort of a wide growth service to help patients and sites through the decentralized trial process.
We also have research nurses and phlebotomy solutions team that build on our global network to support the decentralized studies. So again, we are moving to from -- we moved from the pre-2020 piloting phase where we had, I believe, at the time sort of 60-or-so small trials that essentially were experimental in nature and people wanted to sort of try it out to a maturing phase.
We have added many wins. We've -- so far in 2021, I think we have more than a dozen larger decentralized clinical trials that were won. We added new therapeutic areas. We are working with 5 of the top 10 large pharma clients. And I would note that one of the reasons we were able to win so many -- a bigger proportion than anyone else of the COVID work, whether it's therapeutic trials or vaccine trial, was our more advanced decentralized trial capability.
And again, we cover probably 10-or-so therapeutic areas, nephrology, oncology, psychiatry, CNS, dermatology, et cetera. And it's moving to a more mature phase, and we will speak more about that in the future. Again, in the context of the very large R&DS business we have, it's still not something that's kind of moving the needle in the numbers.

I mean there are opportunities to complement capabilities, whether it's therapeutic-wise or geographic-wise, that could be areas of the business, preclinical Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, complementary strengths. So again, these are the 3 dimensions: geography, therapy areas or stage in the drug development process that could lend themselves to more or less complementarity or overlap.
Now the consolidation that has taken place [ that ] provide opportunities. As you know, I said before, we have been, like, gaining share significantly so we don't need to do that. It is a fact that when there is a large merger or large acquisition, there is disruption. We believe it ourselves. So there is generally a loss of talent. We are seeing it for -- coming from others. And there is generally a desire by customers to keep 2, 3 or 4 providers. And so if providers overlap when they serve the same customer, you can expect that the sponsor will look to further diversify their provider base. So all of this is true.
Look, we -- both talent and customers are -- present opportunities, but we're not so focused on this. We just -- we're focused on executing on our strategy. It's worked so far, and we're confident it will continue to work.
Other acquisitions, obviously we're looking at things. As always, there is a rich pipeline always. You've noted we haven't done much last year. We haven't done much this year so far, save for the Q2 minority acquisition. But we are looking at other things, always in the technology space. And we have a rich pipeline. It's just -- it's a binary thing. Acquisition happen or they don't happen. So I can't really talk much about that."

I mean, look, a lot of clients did not cancel contracts last year because they didn't know how long this was going to last. And while our field reps weren't able to actually be in the field, but many of them remained on the bench with contracts kind of suspended or renegotiated. That caused some disruption. And as we have begun turning the business around but -- so it slipped and went back into the red in terms of revenue growth.
But now we're seeing that we are going back -- and I mean, look, this is never going to be a double-digit grower, I don't think. So this is the best it's going to be, single-digit growth. And we are managing it. It's becoming less of a flash point, simply because in the size of our company and the growth of the rest of the business, this is becoming relatively small.
Now look, you will recall that we -- shortly after the merger, nearly 5 years ago, we tried to sell it as a whole. We then found that it wouldn't fetch much of a value. And therefore we pulled the business, integrated it into our regions. It's very integrated now into our commercial operations. There are contracts which is very useful. In fact, I've mentioned before, the decentralized trial business where we are using nurses from that -- from the CSMS business to help with the virtual aspects for the -- going to visit patients at home and so on. So there's kind of an added value. It's not going to move the needle one way or the other as it used to be in the old Quintiles days or in the early IQVIA days.
Okay. Last question, Nick?"

This morning, we reported second quarter results with outstanding double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. Following the strong performance, we've once again raised our guidance for the year. As you recall, we're tracking ahead of our pre-COVID V22 financial plan. 
The health of the life sciences industry continues to strengthen. New clinical trial starts are trending well above recent historical figures. They are up 22% versus 2020 levels and up 7% compared to 2019. The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand to record numbers, indicating a large backlog of potential launches, some of which have been pushed to the right during the pandemic last year. 
And finally, biotech funding continues to increase significantly. According to the National Venture Capital Association, funding totaled $25 billion in the first half of 2021. This represents an increase of 64% compared to the first half of 2020, which itself was already a record first half year. 
During 2020, the pandemic disrupted execution of clinical trials and businesses requiring face-to-face interactions. But at the same time, it accelerated change in the industry. It created new demand for new services. And IQVIA is uniquely positioned to deliver based on the differentiated capabilities such as data analytics, advanced technology offerings, and of course, our deep scientific and therapeutic expertise, all of which capabilities were highlighted to our clients during the pandemic. 
We are confident that these capabilities will continue to drive strong demand for both our clinical and commercial offerings in 2021 into 2022 and beyond. 
As we begin thinking about our plans during 2022, I am pleased to announce that we will be hosting an investor conference in New York City on November 16, where we will update you on our V22 progress and share our plans for the next phase in IQVIA's evolution. Nick and the team will, of course, provide more details once all the logistics are set and available. 
With that, let's review the second quarter in more detail. Revenue for the second quarter grew 36.4% on a reported basis and 33.2% at constant currency. This represents growth that was $176 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. About 40% of this beat came from strong operational performance, and the remainder was from higher pass-throughs. 
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 49.5%, reflecting the revenue growth drop-through as well as productivity measures. The $20 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger operational performance. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.13 grew 80.5%. That was 8% above the midpoint of our guidance range and was driven entirely by the adjusted EBITDA drop-through. 
Let me provide a little more update and color on the business during the quarter. Starting with our real-world evidence business, it once again performed well, strengthening its leadership position. This included a recent win with a top 20 pharma client to develop an ophthalmology evidence platform for upcoming product launches. The platform integrates primary and secondary data and layers on AI/ML tools to monitor patient safety in real time. This will allow this client to add new products and indications to the platform without initiating new studies. This, of course, will save critical amounts of time and money while also reducing the burden on patients and sites. 
Turning to our commercial technology business. It continues to increase penetration among top 10 life science companies and emerging biopharma clients. A top 5 pharma client entered during the quarter into a commercial agreement to leverage the IQVIA human data science cloud as part of their core data and digital strategy for one of their large therapeutic areas. This client plans to roll out this platform in over 50 countries to centralize all of their fragmented data assets, resolve data management complexities and improve speed to insights. 
Our orchestrated customer engagement offering, OCE, gained additional ground this quarter as 9 new clients adopted the platform for commercial operations, including 2 wins with large biotech clients. One of these OCE biotech clients has the potential for a global rollout to over 20 countries. The other large biotech win represents a competitive win back of the customer-facing team in the U.S. To date, we have 159 client wins for OCE. 
Our clinical technology solutions team continued our path to innovation in decentralized clinical trials with the introduction of IQVIA's Clinical Data Analytics Suite or CDAS. This solution builds on our human data science cloud platform, provides life science companies with new approaches to data use and harmonization as well as producing AI/ML and analytics-based insights. As an open scalable cloud platform, CDAS seamlessly works with sponsors' existing data archive and systems. We now have all of the top 10 and 18 out of the top 20 pharma clients using at least one of the several modules within our clinical technology suite. 
By connecting the right technology with the right data sources, IQVIA is enabling customers to identify new opportunities to maximize product value, get to market faster, improve departmental and business alignment, and reduce costs. 
Switching to our R&DS business. During the quarter, it continued to build on its strong momentum, with over $2.5 billion of net new bookings on a 606 basis. In the quarter, we achieved a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.34 including pass-throughs and 1.37 excluding pass-throughs. As of June 30, our LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.45 including pass-throughs and 1.40 excluding pass-throughs. 
Our contracted backlog in R&DS including pass-throughs grew 16.7% year-over-year to $23.9 billion as of June 30, 2021. As a result, our next 12 months' revenue from backlog increased to $6.6 billion, which is up 19.6% year-over-year. 
I want to highlight the lab business, which continues to be a key driver of growth and, therefore, will remain an area of strong investment for IQVIA. You'll recall that on April 1, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in Q2 Solutions from Quest Diagnostics. Following this transaction, we announced our plans to expand our laboratory operation in Scotland to bolster our investment in cutting-edge technology, including next-generation genomic sequencing and testing. 
Also in the quarter, we agreed to acquire Myriad RBM, adding to our capabilities in the lab. RBM specializes in biomarker detection and quantification testing that supports early and late-phase drug development in key therapeutic areas such as oncology, CNS and immunology. This acquisition fits nicely into our strategy to develop specialized testing and precision medicine to help support drug development with state-of-the-art solutions. These actions further demonstrate our commitment to advancing outcomes in this space, and we are excited to continue to grow and innovate in the lab business. The Myriad RBM transaction is expected to close sometime in the third quarter. 
I'll now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance in the quarter. Ron?"

Let me first start with revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3.438 billion grew 36.4% on a reported basis and 33.2% at constant currency. First half revenue was $6.847 billion, growing at 29.8% reported and 27%",876,"Yes. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let me first start with revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3.438 billion grew 36.4% on a reported basis and 33.2% at constant currency. First half revenue was $6.847 billion, growing at 29.8% reported and 27% at constant currency. 
Our Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the second quarter was $1.353 billion. That was up 22% reported and 17.9% at constant currency. For the first half, Tech & Analytics Solutions revenue was $2.701 billion, up 21.3% reported and 17.5% at constant currency. 
R&D Solutions second quarter revenue of $1.891 billion was up 53.1% at actual FX rate and 50.7% at constant currency. Now excluding the impact of pass-through, second quarter R&DS revenue grew 44.6% year-over-year. For the first half, revenue in R&D Solutions was up 40.5% reported and 38.5% at constant currency. 
CSMS revenue of $194 million in the quarter grew 9.6% reported and 7.3% on a constant currency basis. And that brings the first half CSMS revenue to $387 million, up 3.8% reported and 1.3% at constant currency. 
And moving down the P&L and going to adjusted EBITDA. That was $722 million in the second quarter, which represented growth of 49.5%, bringing first half adjusted EBITDA to $1.466 billion, up 40.3% year-over-year. Second quarter GAAP net income was $175 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.90. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $387 million or $1.99 per diluted share.  Adjusted net income was $416 million for the second quarter. And adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 80.5% to $2.13. For the first half, adjusted net income was $841 million or $4.32 per share. 
Let's turn briefly to R&D Solutions. As Ari mentioned, we delivered another outstanding quarter of net new business. We see backlog grew 16.7% year-over-year to $23.9 billion at June 30. And next 12 months' revenue from backlog at June 30 stood at $6.6 billion, up 19.6% year-over-year. 
Okay. Now on to the balance sheet. At June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 billion, and debt was $12.3 billion, which results in net debt of $10.5 billion. Our net leverage ratio at June 30 came in at 3.74x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. 
Cash flow was again strong in the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $539 million and CapEx was $145 million, resulting in free cash flow of $394 million. This brought our free cash flow for the first half of 2021 to over $1.1 billion, which is a material improvement over our 2019 and 2020 results. 
In the quarter, we repurchased $45 million of our shares, leaving us with $822 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our latest program. 
Now on to guidance. We're raising our full year 2021 revenue guidance by $275 million at the midpoint, reflecting the strong second quarter and the continued operational momentum that we see in the business. Our new revenue guidance is $13.550 billion to $13.700 billion, which is year-over-year growth of 19.3% to 20.6%. I would note there's no FX impact versus our previous guidance. Compared to prior year, FX continues to be a tailwind of 150 basis points to full year revenue growth. 
Looking at the segments. We continue to expect full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue to grow low to mid-teens and R&D Solutions revenue to grow mid- to high 20s, while we now expect the CSMS business to be up low single digit. 
You saw that we also raised our profit guidance as a result of the stronger revenue outlook. We've increased our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance by $43 million at the midpoint. Our new full year guidance is $2.950 billion to $3 billion, which represents growth of 23.7% to 25.8%. 
Moving to EPS. We adjusted our -- excuse me, we increased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.18 at the midpoint. Our new guidance range is $8.70 to $8.90, which is growth year-over-year of 35.5% to 38.6%. 
Our full year 2021 guidance assumes that June 30 foreign currency rates remain in effect for the second half. 
Now to review the revenue guidance for the third quarter. Third quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.290 billion and $3.365 billion, representing growth of 18.1% to 20.8%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $710 million and $730 million, up 17.5% to 20.9%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.06 and $2.13, growing 26.4% to 30.7%. And again, our third quarter 2021 guidance assumes June 30 foreign currency rates remain in effect for the quarter. 
So to summarize, we delivered very strong second quarter results. We had double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. We posted revenue growth of over 20% in our TAS segment and over 50% in R&DS segment. R&DS backlog improved again to $23.9 billion, up 16.7% year-over-year. Next 12 months' revenue from that backlog increased to $6.6 billion. That's up 19.6% year-over-year. We reported another strong quarter of free cash flow. And given the momentum that we see in the business and our strong second quarter results, we're once again raising our full year guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. 
So with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for questions and answers."

The first, of course, would be our earnings growth, which was quite good. But beyond that, we've made substantial progress and continue to make progress in reducing our days sales outstanding. We've had a real focus on that over the past year, bringing down past dues, improving our billing terms with customers, billing sooner because we have substantial unbilled amounts. And all of that has contributed to strong collections. 
The one caveat I would say is that some of the COVID-related work does come with some advances that will burn off over time. So we're still targeting to have cash flow in any given year in the range of 80% to 90% of adjusted net income. Now obviously, substantially stronger than that so far this year; I think it's probably about 125% for the first half. And if we can beat that 80% to 90% range, great, but I think that's a good kind of medium-term sort of target for cash flow in a normal environment. But we're very happy with the progress we've made on cash flow and expect cash flow to continue to be strong for the future."

Back in, I guess, '18, our total yearly free cash flow was $600 million. So just",454,"Yes. I mean, Eric, this is -- thank you for highlighting that aspect of our performance in the second quarter. As you know, we were not happy with our cash flow performance. Back in, I guess, '18, our total yearly free cash flow was $600 million. So just barely half of what the first half performance was this year. In '19, I think it was around $800 million. And last year, in 2020, we bumped that up to $1.3 billion or thereabouts. So we're very, very pleased with our performance, and just for the reasons that Ron highlighted, especially grateful to the finance team for focusing on the management of our receivables, collections and generally bill-to-cash type of process improvements. That took a lot of efforts but we think will continue to pay dividends. 
We also, remember, had committed to investors that we would reduce our leverage ratio from the mid to high 4s on a net basis to 4 or less by the end of 2022. And I would note that for 2 quarters in a row, we are below that for probably a year earlier. Now again, we might see the average ratio move up and down depending on circumstances and our spend on M&A and share repurchases. But that's where we are, and we're very pleased with that performance. 
The second question you had was on COVID work and how much it represents. I think it's always probably best to look at how much COVID work is in our backlog. And I just want to say that the total -- the large COVID vaccine trials, which have represented the bulk of our work in COVID, represent less -- actually much less than 5% of our total backlog. And so that gives you a sense. 
And in terms of -- now having said that, we expect COVID work to continue to remain part of our business for the foreseeable future. We expect COVID studies to have a long tail through 2021, well into 2022 and perhaps 2023. There will be a need for vaccines for multiple manufacturers. We still have, in our pipeline, RFPs for vaccine work from different companies around the world. There are new vaccines being developed for the variants. There are alternative vaccines that are being needed for adverse safety events, quality issues, manufacturing delays. And then there are a bunch of novel treatment programs that are targeted at specific populations and conditions. So all of that is still in our pipeline. But again, the large vaccine work is less -- way less than 5 percentage points of our total backlog including pass-throughs.

But I think we've got a combination of a lot of factors: one, catch-up work. You're correct. I mean there's a lot of work that was done last year remotely. And we still need to have site document -- on-site document verification activities that need to take place. So that's another boost to our growth.
Thirdly, there is the simple fact that projects that were supposed to get started last year were pushed to the right. And so that also has a demand. Fourthly, we've been gaining market share. We've been saying it over and over again. And I think the numbers are pretty clear. Given our consistently higher book-to-bill ratios and the size of our revenues, I think the math clearly will indicate that we are gaining share. And we are now beginning to execute on all of these projects that started with some delay last year. And finally, there is the COVID work.  So all of that contributes to this very strong growth rates that we have reported. 
Your other question which were operational metrics, site access and so on. Look, we are essentially -- I think we could say about 80% or so or approaching 80% into the site access. Given all the flareups, infection grows in different parts of the world. But our guidance for 2021 takes a lot of factors into account, including site accessibility.
We also believe we are at a some kind -- at critical mass. In other words, at 80%, we can deliver, with a combination of different methods we have perfected in terms of remote visits and so on. It's good to monitor site access as a metric when it sets in the general recovery, but they don't correlate exactly with revenue recognition. There's many other metrics we track: the site startups, which have essentially returned to the baseline of 2019; patient recruitment, which are running at or above the 2019 averages; patient visits, which are essentially close to the pre-pandemic levels. 
So all of those -- bottom line, these metrics provide us with the confidence that the non-COVID trial pipeline is not only being awarded, as exemplified by -- as illustrated by our strong bookings, but also, it's starting to be delivered, meaning the sites are enrolling, the patients are enrolling and the patient visits are taking place. So I hope that clarifies where we are operationally in R&DS."

It's a key benefit for clients, which, as you know, the big vexing issue in health care is the interoperability of data between customers, between the people who run the trials, like IQVIA in this case, and various competitive applications and data sources.
So the CDAS product eliminates the need to reconnect individual applications to each other. And instead, these applications, they connect directly to CDAS and enables to harmonize the data and provide an intuitive and scalable solution to map multiple clinical data sources, enables us to use AI/ML layers of analytics using this single-data ecosystem.

We talked about it before. We used to call it virtual trials, hybrid trials. We talked about it and we felt we were making great progress. And then the pandemic happened, and we saw how critical those capabilities were, and that accelerated the development.
Basically, it's a combination of remote technologies and digital -- the part of the clinical trial that can be digitized. So the suite, for us, combined eConsent, which you're familiar with, telemedicine, modules, eCOA, and of course, a lot of digital communication. It basically optimizes and virtualizes the relationships between local labs, health care providers when it's necessary. It sort of establishes a virtual network of investigators and care professionals. And what we do is that we agree on preset terms with the investigators that agreed to participate.
We have internally operationalized this business and we have a separate team, a decentralized trial team. For example, we've got decentralized clinical trial, clinical research coordinator that can support the sites in a remote way, help navigate technology. This is new for all of the investigators and certainly for the patients. So we need -- we figured out during the pandemic that we needed a centralized team to assist sort of, kind of a help desk, if you will. There are -- there's also -- so there's kind of a sort of a wide growth service to help patients and sites through the decentralized trial process.
We also have research nurses and phlebotomy solutions team that build on our global network to support the decentralized studies. So again, we are moving to from -- we moved from the pre-2020 piloting phase where we had, I believe, at the time sort of 60-or-so small trials that essentially were experimental in nature and people wanted to sort of try it out to a maturing phase.
We have added many wins. We've -- so far in 2021, I think we have more than a dozen larger decentralized clinical trials that were won. We added new therapeutic areas. We are working with 5 of the top 10 large pharma clients. And I would note that one of the reasons we were able to win so many -- a bigger proportion than anyone else of the COVID work, whether it's therapeutic trials or vaccine trial, was our more advanced decentralized trial capability.
And again, we cover probably 10-or-so therapeutic areas, nephrology, oncology, psychiatry, CNS, dermatology, et cetera. And it's moving to a more mature phase, and we will speak more about that in the future. Again, in the context of the very large R&DS business we have, it's still not something that's kind of moving the needle in the numbers.

And soon enough, we're going to be the only one standing here that's independent. But we -- look, generally, the clinical trial business is an attractive area. It's a high-growth area. It's something that's well into the long term. Going to deliver superior returns, we believe, as an industry, and that is attracting a lot of interest from buyers, whether it's private equity or other large entities that want to -- are in search of accelerate -- opportunities to accelerate their revenue or profit growth. So that -- all of that is good news for our industry.
In terms of what are the consequences strategically, operationally, I think it's pretty clear that first of all, we don't need to ""participate."" Obviously, we look every time, and most of these companies have been shopped to us obviously. We look at these companies. And in cases, we've passed because we think the valuations or our ability to gain share does not require us to buy or to participate in this M&A trend.
It's hard to gain a lot when you -- for a CRO to acquire another CRO. I mean there are opportunities to complement capabilities, whether it's therapeutic-wise or geographic-wise, that could be areas of the business, preclinical Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, complementary strengths. So again, these are the 3 dimensions: geography, therapy areas or stage in the drug development process that could lend themselves to more or less complementarity or overlap.
Now the consolidation that has taken place [ that ] provide opportunities. As you know, I said before, we have been, like, gaining share significantly so we don't need to do that. It is a fact that when there is a large merger or large acquisition, there is disruption. We believe it ourselves. So there is generally a loss of talent. We are seeing it for -- coming from others. And there is generally a desire by customers to keep 2, 3 or 4 providers. And so if providers overlap when they serve the same customer, you can expect that the sponsor will look to further diversify their provider base. So all of this is true.
Look, we -- both talent and customers are -- present opportunities, but we're not so focused on this. We just -- we're focused on executing on our strategy. It's worked so far, and we're confident it will continue to work.
Other acquisitions, obviously we're looking at things. As always, there is a rich pipeline always. You've noted we haven't done much last year. We haven't done much this year so far, save for the Q2 minority acquisition. But we are looking at other things, always in the technology space. And we have a rich pipeline. It's just -- it's a binary thing. Acquisition happen or they don't happen. So I can't really talk much about that."

I mean, look, a lot of clients did not cancel contracts last year because they didn't know how long this was going to last. And while our field reps weren't able to actually be in the field, but many of them remained on the bench with contracts kind of suspended or renegotiated. That caused some disruption. And as we have begun turning the business around but -- so it slipped and went back into the red in terms of revenue growth.
But now we're seeing that we are going back -- and I mean, look, this is never going to be a double-digit grower, I don't think. So this is the best it's going to be, single-digit growth. And we are managing it. It's becoming less of a flash point, simply because in the size of our company and the growth of the rest of the business, this is becoming relatively small.
Now look, you will recall that we -- shortly after the merger, nearly 5 years ago, we tried to sell it as a whole. We then found that it wouldn't fetch much of a value. And therefore we pulled the business, integrated it into our regions. It's very integrated now into our commercial operations. There are contracts which is very useful. In fact, I've mentioned before, the decentralized trial business where we are using nurses from that -- from the CSMS business to help with the virtual aspects for the -- going to visit patients at home and so on. So there's kind of an added value. It's not going to move the needle one way or the other as it used to be in the old Quintiles days or in the early IQVIA days.

Our strong momentum from earlier in the year has continued despite the resurgence of COVID-19 due to the Delta variant. This has not had an impact on our operations as we have learned to manage through these disruptions. Our outlook for the longer term remains unchanged. The backdrop for the life science industry continues to be very strong. Biotech funding continues to run at record levels according to the National Venture Capital Association. Funding total of $35.8 billion through September 2021, already exceeding the full year of 2020. 
The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand and is at an all-time high with almost 3,000 molecules in active Phase II or Phase III development. Clinical trial starts are trending well ahead of recent years with the year-to-year date starts up 23% over 2020 and 13% over 2019. And finally, new drug approvals by the FDA are keeping pace with the historically high levels of 2020, with 40 new drugs approved year-to-date, which set the stage for a strong volume of upcoming commercial launches. The bottom line is the dynamics in the industry are strong, and we remain bullish on our outlook for our end markets and for IQVIA in particular. 
As we think about our longer-term plans, I want to remind you of our upcoming analyst and investor conference on November 16 in New York City. At that meeting, we will provide financial guidance for 2022, ahead of our usual time line which is normally coinciding with the end of year results in early February. And we will share as well our midterm outlook and plans for the next phase of our QES growth. We look forward to seeing everyone and hope you can join us then. 
With that, let's review the third quarter. Revenue for the third quarter grew 21.7% on a reported basis and 21.1% at constant currency and was $64 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. The beat was driven primarily by higher pass-throughs, which, as you know, dilutes our margins somewhat as well as by stronger organic revenue growth. 
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 20.5%, reflecting our revenue growth as well as productivity measures. The $8 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger operational performance. 
Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.17 grew 33.1%. That was $0.07 above the midpoint of our guidance, with the beat coming from the adjusted EBITDA drop-through as well as favorability in below-the-line items. 
Let me now provide an update on the business. Our real-world evidence business continues to take a leading role in informing health care. In late September, the FDA released their draft guidance on how electronic health records and medical claims data can support regulatory decision-making, and it cited several IQVIA publications. 
With the growth of rare disease therapies and personalized medicine driven trials, the number of single-arm clinical trials increases every year and external competitors provide important context for these studies for both regulators and payers. Our clients recognize our leading expertise in this area. For example, we had a recent major win to deliver an external comparator in a cardiovascular study for a top 20 pharma clients. In another example, we were awarded a 15-year follow-up study to demonstrate the long-term effectiveness and safety of a newly launched gene therapy. Regulatory guidance requires extended follow-up for patients exposed to cell and gene therapy. And IQVIA's innovative real-world capabilities combining direct-to-patient solutions as well as IQVIA technology platforms to capture secondary data was pivotal in this award. 
On the technology front, our suite of offerings continue to be adopted in the marketplace. You are familiar with our OCE platform and other commercial technology applications. And we have, of course, continued to expand our footprint here. We have 10 new client wins in the quarter, bringing the total number of OCE  wins to date to 169 customers. 
But we are also very excited to see increased adoption of our orchestrated clinical trial suite, OCT. This quarter, for example, a leading biotechnology company in Asia selected our site portal module within OCT to power site engagement across all of their trials. We now have 165 customers that have bought the site portal module, representing 155,000 sites and 1,716 active studies that are using our site portal module. 
Similarly, our award-winning eCOA platform continues to experience strong demand. We have successfully deployed over 150 projects across 35 different therapeutic areas. To date, we have over 70 customers using this platform, including 8 of the top 10 pharma clients. The platform has processed over 10 million unique patient responses in 65 countries and across 28 languages. 
Now I want to say a few words about a fast-growing part of our industry. You're familiar with decentralized trials or DCT. The IQVIA decentralized trial offering combined several tech modules within our OCT suite including eCOA, eConsent, telemedicine and connected devices as well as other service capabilities, including home nurses and phlebotomists along with our decentralized trial patient cancers and study coordinators, all organized around our decentralized trial platform. 
Importantly, we've developed innovative clinical patient engagement offerings, including direct-to-patient services to accelerate recruitment and improve patient diversity and inclusion in clinical trials. When we step back and look at the growing importance of DCT in our own portfolio, we find that up to 30% of our active full-service trials utilize one or more components of our DCT offering. Incidentally, when our competitors speak about their own DCT offerings, this is often with the report as their DCT business. 
When we look at trials that actually fully utilize our DCT capabilities, meaning they are fully run on our decentralized trial platform, we've been awarded 89 trials to date totaling over $1 billion. These awards are with 34 unique sponsors, of which 10 have multiple decentralized trials ongoing with us. These trials span 12 different therapeutic areas, 32 unique indications and have recruited over 200,000 patients in 40 countries. Our ability to combine advanced clinical technology with an extensive network of investigators and care professionals differentiates us in this space and makes us a partner of chose for decentralized trials and utilize the full capabilities. 
Our overall R&DS business continues to build on its strong momentum. We had approximately $2.6 billion of net new bookings in the quarter, bringing our LTM net new bookings for the first time to over $10 billion including pass-throughs. This resulted in a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.39 including pass-throughs, and 1.28 excluding pass-throughs. At September 30, our LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.38, including pass-throughs; and 1.37, excluding pass-throughs. 
Our contracted backlog in R&D, including pass-throughs, grew 12.7% year-over-year to $24.4 billion at September 30, 2021. As a result, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $6.9 billion, up $300 million sequentially versus the second quarter. 
As we have signaled several times in the past, we've ramped up investments in our lab capabilities. We recently announced the opening of our new 160,000 square foot innovation laboratories in North Carolina. This facility provides customers with access to cutting-edge bioanalytical, vaccine and genomics capabilities, along with an expansion into exploratory human biomarker discovery services. 
These new services will enable us to partner closely with sponsors in the development of essential biomarkers to support new molecules moving into clinical development and throughout the life cycle. And this expansion, of course, comes on top of the investment we announced last quarter in our 130,000 square foot facility in Scotland. 
I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance."
137473239,1684952957,2408848,"IQVIA Holdings Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","IQVIA Holdings Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Third quarter revenue of $3.391 billion grew 21.7% on a reported basis and 21.1% at constant currency. Year-to-date revenue was $10.238 billion, growing at 27% reported and",965,"Okay. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. 
Third quarter revenue of $3.391 billion grew 21.7% on a reported basis and 21.1% at constant currency. Year-to-date revenue was $10.238 billion, growing at 27% reported and 25% at constant currency. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the third quarter was $1.337 billion, which was up 10.8% reported and 9.9% at constant currency. Year-to-date, Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $4.38 billion, which was up 17.6% reported and 14.9% at constant currency. 
In the third quarter, R&D Solutions had revenue of $1.853 billion, up 32.4% at actual FX rates and 31.9% at constant currency. Excluding the impact of pass-throughs, third quarter R&DS revenue grew 24.7% year-over-year. Year-to-date, revenue in R&D Solutions was $5.612 billion, up 37.7% reported and 36.2% at constant currency. 
Finally, contract sales in Medical Solutions or CSMS revenue of $201 million was up 12.3% reported and 12.8% at constant currency. Year-to-date, CSMS revenue was $588 million, growing 6.5% reported and 5.1% at constant currency. 
Now let's move down the P&L to adjusted EBITDA, which was $728 million in the third quarter, up 20.5%. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $2.194 billion, growing 33.1% year-over-year. Third quarter GAAP net income was $261 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.34. Year-to-date, we had GAAP net income of $648 million or $3.32 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $423 million for the third quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 33.1% to $2.17. Year-to-date, adjusted net income was $1.264 billion or $6.48 per share. 
Turning now to the R&D Solutions backlog. As already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter of net new business. Backlog now stands at $24.4 billion. In the last 12 months, net new bookings, including pass-throughs, rose to over $10 billion. 
Okay. Turning to the balance sheet. At September 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.5 billion and debt was $12.2 billion. This resulted in net debt of $10.7 billion. Our net leverage ratio at September 30 came in at 3.65x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. 
Our cash flow was again quite strong in the third quarter. Cash flow from operations was $844 million, and with CapEx of $162 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $682 million. This third quarter performance brought our free cash flow year-to-date, that is through the first 3 quarters, to almost $1.8 billion which continues the strong improvement trend we've had over the past 3 years. 
In the quarter, we repurchased $125 million of our shares, which leaves us with $697 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our latest program 
Okay. Let's turn to guidance. As you saw, we're raising our full year 2021 revenue guidance by $188 million at the midpoint. This reflecting the third quarter strength in the continued operational momentum in our business. Our new revenue guidance is $13.775 billion to $13.850 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 21.3% to 21.9%. I'll note that included in this guidance is a $30 million headwind from FX versus our previous guidance. 
Now looking at the comparison to the prior year, FX is a tailwind of about 120 basis points to full year revenue growth. We're also raising our profit guidance as a result of a stronger revenue outlook, we've increased our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance by $20 million at the midpoint. Our new full year guidance is $2.980 billion to $3 billion -- $3.010 billion, rather, which represents year-over-year growth of 25% to 26.3%.  
Moving down to EPS. We're increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint. The new guidance range is now $8.85 to $8.95, ,which represents year-over-year growth of 37.9% to 39.4%. Now our full year 2021 guidance assumes that September 30 foreign currency rates remain in fact for the balance of the year. 
Of course, the full year guidance implies a fourth quarter guidance, which we show here. And before getting to the numbers, I'll say, for context, you'll probably recall that last year's fourth quarter was unusual due to a snapback in the general business as we rebounded from the effects of COVID-19, picked up incremental demand from meta vaccine studies in R&DS and government-related COVID work within TAS. 
Fourth quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.537 billion and $3.612 billion, representing growth of 7.2% to 9.5%. FX in the quarter is a headwind to growth of about 100 basis points. We expect fourth quarter TAS revenue growth to be mid-single digits reflecting the expected year-over-year decline in government COVID-related work and the FX drag. I'll note though that underlying constant currency organic growth for TAS will be in the high single digits, which is the level that TAS has recently accelerated. 
R&DS revenue growth will be in the low teens with services growth in the mid-teens despite last year's difficult comparison due to the COVID vaccine work. CSMS will be slightly down. 
Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter is expected to be between $786 million and $816 million, up 6.9% to 11%, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.37 and $2.47, growing 12.3% to 17.1%. 
So in summary, we delivered a very strong third quarter with strong results on both the top and bottom line. R&DS backlog improved to $24.4 billion. That's up 12.7% year-over-year. Next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $6.9 billion, up $300 million sequentially versus the second quarter. We reported another strong quarter of free cash flow, which at $1.8 million through the first 3 quarters of the year, is a marked improvement over prior year. And finally, we are once again raising our full year guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. 
And with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for questions and answers."

So I think operationally, we are just adapting to this. 
Now again, the full productivity only comes when the trial is fully decentralized trial that I explained because there's a lot of confusion in this space. As soon as someone uses a digital platform, they say, well, we've had a [indiscernible] DCT award here, but that's not the case. Now if we do that, as I mentioned, about 30% of our full clinical trials, which is just -- probably we have a little bit under 1,000 trials that are full-service clinical trials ongoing. So it's a larger number that already utilize one or several of our DCT modules, eConsent or eCOA or other connected devices. 
Our clients are experimenting with smaller trials and trying the full DCT platform, which puts together all of the capabilities and the maximum utilization of the digital tools that we have at our disposal. I think hands down, I believe we are leader in this space."

But as you well know, by now, hopefully, you know that when you look at our overall results, you see that there has been margin expansion despite these cost headwinds. In fact, even when you see in this past, in this Q3 results, that our operating margins are flat to slightly declining. When you actually take out the pass-throughs, you actually see that our margin -- the operating margins expanded quite nicely and this is despite the cost headwinds that we have.

As you know, the largest acquisitions we've done is simply the consolidation of our joint venture request in the lab business, and that was a $760 million transaction we did in the second quarter. So that represents really a very large portion, almost half of the spend to date. 
In the quarter, we were very active. We were -- we actually closed only a handful of transactions. The 2 largest accounts for the vast majority, let's say, almost 90% in sales, something like that ,80% to 90% of the spend. It's 2 transactions only. One is the Myriad RBM Lab, which we had announced during our second quarter earnings and it actually closed in the third quarter. It's a lab that performs sophisticated biomarker detection and testing. It supports early- and late-stage drug development in very specific therapeutic areas, oncology, CNS and immunology. 
We also purchased DMD. DMD is a leading provider of analytics and digital marketing solutions to health care professionals. It brings advanced tech-enabled analytics and insights for intelligent omnichannel marketing, and we consider that acquisition to be a strategic asset. And yes, it did come with a lot of -- it costs quite a bit. So these 2 transactions, again, is basically the bulk of the spend."

But when you -- and I think people like to look at '19 to '21 to kind of try to eliminate COVID. I don't think that's fair because the whole COVID effect is not gone yet because you still have these disruptions that I just talked about. I think it's important to look at the 3-year '19 to '22 time frame. And if you go back to the targets we gave, we certainly are running ahead, actually well ahead of the growth rates we predicted for 2022. We are ahead of that.

But even if you strip that out, we're still ahead on every single one of the metrics.

We don't have inventory, as you would have in a manufacturing firm receivables are really where we have a lot of our assets other than our deferred software investment.

And that's just kind of focused to go and collect what's due from us. 
The next is billing on time. I mean, we had a large amount of unbilled receivables. And that comes down to internal processes about billing more quickly, more -- in a more timely fashion. So we get paid in a more timely fashion. And of course, the third that you mentioned is the deferred revenue that the customer advances that we get.

But look, the outperformance was just not good. and we said that and was on us, and we work on it, and we will continue to pay attention and have the right metrics and the right incentives and the team focused on it. And as always, when you shine the light on something, it improves. And that's what will happen here. And where we are now is the normal, not unusual."

He asked around operational. Ari, I wanted to ask around financial. It seems like you now have a pretty substantial number of trials where you're running pretty fully on your DCT platform. I'm wondering if you could relate to us what -- how that changes the dollar value of a trial? And does that give you the opportunity to garner more margin in that trial because of the technology-enabled efficiency?"

I mean, look, there's a high degree of interest from clients, okay, around how to operational DCT, and it's not like it's going to overwhelm and all of sudden become 100% overnight.

I mean, look, there's a high degree of interest from clients, okay, around how to operational DCT, and it's not like it's going to overwhelm and all of sudden become 100% overnight. As I said, large pharma, in particular, is experimenting. A lot of trials are using one composite or the other. So it's going to take time. So this is not next year or the year after that we're going to have to face the issue that you're raising.  
Our experience, customers are striving with how to make various point solutions fit together. So we are actually very -- being very aggressive here. We want to move to DCT. We've said this since the merger got 5 years ago, we want to accelerate and not slow down technology introduction and changing the model. Now obviously, your question you asked is a question what I asked of us many years ago, which is as you seek to replace labor in a model that where pricing is largely based on labor inputs, then aren't you lowering the value of the trial and the -- and et cetera, what are implications on the margin. 
So we don't believe so. We have -- as you know, we've had a long run effort to switch pricing to value and deliverables and outputs. That's number one, and that has made substantial progress. Our clients are not really looking at saving a couple of pennies here or there. They're looking at getting what they need -- the answers that they want faster, more efficiently with less error and with higher quality. And they are willing to pay a premium for that. 
Now they're not going to pay more than what they were paying before, but they're not going to pay less than what they're paying before. And so now the margin implication is correct. Over time, the more we deploy technology, the less we need people, the more there's going to be margin accretion. But again, this is going to take time. There are also new delivery roles, which offset some of the reduced CRA visit activity. 
So I think it's too early to comment on the exact margin impact for this overall. We are monitoring -- we do not anticipate this to disrupt our margin performance. R&DS is a very long-cycle business. We have -- I mentioned 89 fully decentralized trial ongoing that we won. But we're working on -- if you look at, as I said, just under maybe 900 to also full-service trials. So it's a fraction of that. 
If you look at the total trials we're involved with, this over 2,500 clinical trials that we're involved in globally. So it does take some time to penetrate. It's a slow-moving business. But it's a good point. We are totally focused on it. We do not anticipate a margin -- I'm sorry, a value deterioration. We do anticipate a margin accretion over the long term."

So some of those mergers will have an impact on market share. I think it's favorable to us. Maybe we remain the last CRO standing, I don't know. 
But we feel that -- and we know from experience what a merger and a large acquisition does to the underlying business. There's all of disruptions, there's -- people lose their jobs, people who don't like the new arrangement, and that's just life. And the result of that is some market share. We had that problem after our merger in '16. Let's be honest about it, then we have some market share issues which we rebounded once we put together the company and integrated. 
I think we are -- the future is very bright for us. We continue to gain new customers. And the biotech environment in particular, is extremely, extremely hot right now. We are gaining new clients.

Our strong momentum from earlier in the year has continued despite the resurgence of COVID-19 due to the Delta variant. This has not had an impact on our operations as we have learned to manage through these disruptions.
Our outlook for the longer term remains unchanged. The backdrop for the life science industry continues to be very strong. Biotech funding continues to run at record levels. According to the National Venture Capital Association, funding totaled $35.8 billion through September 2021, already exceeding the full year of 2020.
The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand and is at an all-time high with almost 3,000 molecules in active Phase II or Phase III development. Clinical trial starts are trending well ahead of recent years, with the year-to-year date starts up 23% over 2020 and 13% over 2019. And finally, new drug approvals by the FDA are keeping pace with the historically high levels of 2020, with 40 new drugs approved year-to-date, which set the stage for a strong volume of upcoming commercial launches. The bottom line is the dynamics in the industry are strong, and we remain bullish on our outlook for our end markets and for IQVIA in particular.
As we think about our longer-term plans, I want to remind you of our upcoming analyst and investor conference on November 16 in New York City. At that meeting, we will provide financial guidance for 2022, ahead of our usual time line, which is normally coinciding with the end of year results in early February, and we will share as well our midterm outlook and plans for the next phase of IQVIA's growth. We look forward to seeing everyone and hope you can join us then.
With that, let's review the third quarter. Revenue for the third quarter grew 21.7% on a reported basis and 21.1% at constant currency and was $64 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. The beat was driven primarily by higher pass-throughs, which, as you know, dilutes our margins somewhat, as well as by stronger organic revenue growth.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 20.5%, reflecting our revenue growth as well as productivity measures. The $8 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger operational performance.
Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.17 grew 33.1%. That was $0.07 above the midpoint of our guidance, with the beat coming from the adjusted EBITDA drop-through as well as favorability in below-the-line items.
Let me now provide an update on the business. Our real-world evidence business continues to take a leading role in informing health care. In late September, the FDA released their draft guidance on how electronic health records and medical claims data can support regulatory decision-making, and it cited several IQVIA publications.
With the growth of rare disease therapies and personalized medicine-driven trials, the number of single-arm clinical trials increases every year, and external competitors provide important context for these studies for both regulators and payers. Our clients recognize our leading expertise in this area. For example, we had a recent major win to deliver an external comparator in a cardiovascular study for a top 20 pharma client. In another example, we were awarded a 15-year follow-up study to demonstrate the long-term effectiveness and safety of a newly launched gene therapy. Regulatory guidance requires extended follow-up for patients exposed to cell and gene therapies. And IQVIA's innovative real-world capabilities combining direct-to-patient solutions as well as IQVIA's technology platforms to capture secondary data was pivotal in this award.
On the technology front, our suite of offerings continue to be adopted in the marketplace. You are familiar with our OCE platform and other commercial technology applications. And we have, of course, continued to expand our footprint here. We have 10 new client wins in the quarter, bringing the total number of OCE wins to date to 169 customers.
But we are also very excited to see increased adoption of our Orchestrated Clinical Trials suite, OCT. This quarter, for example, a leading biotechnology company in Asia selected our site portal module within OCT to power site engagement across all of their trials. We now have 165 customers that have bought the site portal module, representing 155,000 sites and 1,716 active studies that are using our site portal module.
Similarly, our award-winning eCOA platform continues to experience strong demand. We have successfully deployed over 150 projects across 35 different therapeutic areas. To date, we have over 70 customers using this platform, including 8 of the top 10 pharma clients. The platform has processed over 10 million unique patient responses in 65 countries and across 28 languages.
Now I want to say a few words about a fast-growing part of our industry. You're familiar with Decentralized Trials or DCT. The IQVIA Decentralized Trial offering combines several tech modules within our OCT suite, including eCOA, eConsent, telemedicine and connected devices as well as other service capabilities, including home nurses and phlebotomists, along with our Decentralized Trial patient concierge and study coordinators, all organized around our Decentralized Trial platform. Importantly, we've developed innovative clinical patient engagement offerings, including direct-to-patient services, to accelerate recruitment and improve patient diversity and inclusion in clinical trials.
When we step back and look at the growing importance of DCT in our own portfolio, we find that up to 30% of our active full-service trials utilize one or more components of our DCT offering. Incidentally, when our competitors speak about their own DCT offerings, this is often what they report as their DCT business.
When we look at trials that actually fully utilize our DCT capabilities, meaning they are fully run on our Decentralized Trial platform, we've been awarded 89 trials to date totaling over $1 billion. These awards are with 34 unique sponsors, of which 10 have multiple decentralized trials ongoing with us. These trials span 12 different therapeutic areas, 32 unique indications and have recruited over 200,000 patients in 40 countries. Our ability to combine advanced clinical technology with an extensive network of investigators and care professionals differentiates us in this space and makes us a partner of choice for decentralized trials that utilize the full capabilities.
Our overall R&DS business continues to build on its strong momentum. We had approximately $2.6 billion of net new bookings in the quarter, bringing our LTM net new bookings for the first time to over $10 billion including pass-throughs. This resulted in a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.39, including pass-throughs; and 1.28, excluding pass-throughs. At September 30, our LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.38, including pass-throughs; and 1.37, excluding pass-throughs.
Our contracted backlog in R&DS, including pass-throughs, grew 12.7% year-over-year to $24.4 billion at September 30, 2021. As a result, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $6.9 billion, up $300 million sequentially versus the second quarter.
As we have signaled several times in the past, we've ramped up investments in our lab capabilities. We recently announced the opening of our new 160,000 square foot Innovation Laboratories in North Carolina. This facility provides customers with access to cutting-edge bioanalytical, vaccine and genomics capabilities, along with an expansion into exploratory human biomarker discovery services. These new services will enable us to partner closely with sponsors in the development of essential biomarkers to support new molecules moving into clinical development and throughout the life cycle. And this expansion, of course, comes on top of the investment we announced last quarter in our 130,000 square foot facility in Scotland.
I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance."

I will start by reviewing revenue. Third quarter revenue of $3.391 billion grew 21.7% on a reported basis and 21.1% at constant currency. Year-to-date revenue was $10.238 billion, growing at 27% reported and",967,"Okay. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. I will start by reviewing revenue. Third quarter revenue of $3.391 billion grew 21.7% on a reported basis and 21.1% at constant currency. Year-to-date revenue was $10.238 billion, growing at 27% reported and 25% at constant currency.
Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the third quarter was $1.337 billion, which was up 10.8% reported and 9.9% at constant currency. Year-to-date, Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $4.38 billion, which was up 17.6% reported and 14.9% at constant currency.
In the third quarter, R&D Solutions had revenue of $1.853 billion, up 32.4% at actual FX rates and 31.9% at constant currency. Excluding the impact of pass-throughs, third quarter R&DS revenue grew 24.7% year-over-year. Year-to-date, revenue in R&D Solutions was $5.612 billion, up 37.7% reported and 36.2% at constant currency.
Finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions, or CSMS, revenue of $201 million was up 12.3% reported and 12.8% at constant currency. Year-to-date, CSMS revenue was $588 million, growing 6.5% reported and 5.1% at constant currency.
Now let's move down the P&L to adjusted EBITDA, which was $728 million in the third quarter, up 20.5%. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $2.194 billion, growing 33.1% year-over-year. Third quarter GAAP net income was $261 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.34. Year-to-date, we had GAAP net income of $648 million or $3.32 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $423 million for the third quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 33.1% to $2.17. Year-to-date, adjusted net income was $1.264 billion or $6.48 per share.
Turning now to the R&D Solutions backlog. As already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter of net new business. Backlog now stands at $24.4 billion. In the last 12 months, net new bookings include -- including pass-throughs, rose to over $10 billion.
Okay. Turning to the balance sheet. At September 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.5 billion and debt was $12.2 billion. This resulted in net debt of $10.7 billion. Our net leverage ratio at September 30 came in at 3.65x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.
Cash flow was again quite strong in the third quarter. Cash flow from operations was $844 million. And with CapEx of $162 million, this resulted in free cash flow of $682 million. This third quarter performance brought our free cash flow year-to-date, that is through the first 3 quarters, to almost $1.8 billion, which continues the strong improvement trend we've had over the past 3 years. In the quarter, we repurchased $125 million of our shares, which leaves us with $697 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our latest program.
Okay. Let's turn to guidance. As you saw, we're raising our full year 2021 revenue guidance by $188 million at the midpoint, this reflecting the third quarter strength in the continued operational momentum in our business. Our new revenue guidance is $13.775 billion to $13.850 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 21.3% to 21.9%. I'll note that included in this guidance is a $30 million headwind from FX versus our previous guidance. Now looking at the comparison to the prior year, FX is a tailwind of about 120 basis points to full year revenue growth.
We're also raising our profit guidance as a result of a stronger revenue outlook. We've increased our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance by $20 million at the midpoint. Our new full year guidance is $2.980 billion to $3 billion -- $3.010 billion rather, which represents year-over-year growth of 25% to 26.3%.
Moving down to EPS. We're increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint. The new guidance range is now $8.85 to $8.95, which represents year-over-year growth of 37.9% to 39.4%. Now our full year '21 guidance assumes that September 30 foreign currency rates remain in effect for the balance of the year.
Of course, the full year guidance implies a fourth quarter guidance, which we show here. And before getting to the numbers, I'll say, for context, you'll probably recall that last year's fourth quarter was unusual due to a snapback in the general business as we rebounded from the effects of COVID-19, picked up incremental demand from mega vaccine studies in R&DS and government-related COVID work within TAS.
Fourth quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.537 billion and $3.612 billion, representing growth of 7.2% to 9.5%. FX in the quarter is a headwind to growth of about 100 basis points. We expect fourth quarter TAS revenue growth to be mid-single digits, reflecting the expected year-over-year decline in government COVID-related work and the FX drag. I'll note though that underlying constant currency organic growth for TAS will be in the high single digits, which is the level that TAS has recently accelerated. R&DS revenue growth will be in the low teens, with services growth in the mid-teens despite last year's difficult comparison due to the COVID vaccine work. CSMS will be slightly down.
Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter is expected to be between $786 million and $816 million, up 6.9% to 11%, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.37 and $2.47, growing 12.3% to 17.1%.
So in summary, we delivered a very strong third quarter with strong results on both the top and bottom line. R&DS backlog improved to $24.4 billion. That's up 12.7% year-over-year. Next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $6.9 billion, up $300 million sequentially versus the second quarter. We reported another strong quarter of free cash flow, which at $1.8 million through the first 3 quarters of the year, is a marked improvement over prior year. And finally, we are once again raising our full year guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS.
And with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for questions and answers."

And so this is a great development because what DCT does is it kind of increased productivity, reduces labor and enables us to essentially execute more efficiently. So I think operationally, we are just adapting to this.
Now again, the full productivity only comes when the trial is fully a decentralized trial as I explained because there's a lot of confusion in this space. As soon as someone uses a digital platform, they say, well, we've got a decentralized -- a DCT award here, but that's not the case. Now if we do that, as I mentioned, about 30% of our full clinical trials, which is just -- probably we have a little bit under 1,000 trials that are full-service clinical trials ongoing. So it's a larger number that already utilize one or several of our DCT modules, eConsent or eCOA or other connected devices.
Our clients are experimenting with smaller trials and trying the full DCT platform, which puts together all of the capabilities and the maximum utilization of the digital tools that we have at our disposal. I think hands down, I believe we are leader in this space."

We recruit dozens of employees every year. So we've got whole talent acquisition capability that's global and that's active. Does it create cost pressure? Yes. And it's already included in our guidance. That's certainly a headwind.
But as you well know by now, hopefully, you know that when you look at our overall results, you see that there has been margin expansion despite these cost headwinds. In fact, even when you see in this past -- in this Q3 results, that our operating margins are flat to slightly declining. When you actually take out the pass-throughs, you actually see that our margin -- operating margins expanded quite nicely, and this is despite the cost headwinds that we have. So yes, it is a headwind, and we are dealing with it and offsetting with the usual productivity and efficiency programs that I hope we've been demonstrating we're good at. Thank you very much."

And there are quarters where we spent $10 million or $50 million. And this quarter and this year, actually, we spent quite a bit more money.
As you know, the largest acquisitions we've done is simply the consolidation of our joint venture request in the lab business, and that was a $760 million transaction we did in the second quarter. So that represents really a very large portion, almost half of the spend to date.
In the quarter, we were very active. We were -- we actually closed only a handful of transactions. The 2 largest account for the vast majority, let's say, almost 90% in sales, something like that, 80% to 90% of the spend. It's 2 transactions only. One is the Myriad RBM lab, which we had announced during our second quarter earnings, and it actually closed in the third quarter. It's a lab that performs sophisticated biomarker detection and testing. It supports early- and late-stage drug development in very specific therapeutic areas, oncology, CNS and immunology.
We also purchased DMD. DMD is a leading provider of analytics and digital marketing solutions to health care professionals. It brings advanced tech-enabled analytics and insights for intelligent omnichannel marketing, and we consider that acquisition to be a strategic asset.

The TAS underlying organic growth rate is in the high single digits.

If you take out the large, fast-burning COVID work, you were in the high 20s for R&DS revenue growth. And even if you take out all COVID-related work, you were still strong teens growth.

But when you -- and I think people like to look at '19 to '21 to kind of try to eliminate COVID. I don't think that's fair because the whole COVID effect is not gone yet because you still have these disruptions that I just talked about. I think it's important to look at the 3-year '19 to '22 time frame. And if you go back to the targets we gave, we certainly are running ahead, actually well ahead of the growth rates we predicted for 2022. We are ahead of that.

But even if you strip that out, we're still ahead on every single one of the metrics. Now I don't know if you were at that conference, but as you're doing now and as your colleagues are doing, trying to push me for even more precision on what the numbers would be, I said then that I was hoping to exit 2022 at a 10% growth rate for the company. Now I've said before, earlier this year, that we reached our end of '22 targets in '21. And I believe that, that momentum will continue into '22. So that's all I can say, and I have to wait for more precision in 2, 3 weeks. But I totally seated here, feel very, very confident that we will certainly exceed those numbers that we gave you 2 years ago and set the stage for further acceleration beyond."

We don't have inventory like you would in a manufacturing firm. Receivables are really where we have a lot of our assets other than our deferred software investment.
And that's been -- our efforts have been on several fronts. First off is collecting on time. We had a -- go back a little while, we had a large amount of overdue receivables. And that's just kind of focus, to go and collect what's due from us.
The next is billing on time. I mean we had a large amount of unbilled receivables. And that comes down to internal processes about billing more quickly, more -- in a more timely fashion. So we get paid in a more timely fashion.
And of course, the third that you mentioned is the deferred revenue that the customer advances that we get. We again made an effort internally to negotiate contracts with our customers so we get paid more upfront so we're not out of pocket, and this has helped substantially. And I expect all 3 of those to continue to be a driver of strong cash flow in the future.
Now of course, having said that, cash flow is lumpy. Quarter-to-quarter, it's difficult to predict. And you do get instances where you'll get an unusual amount of advances because of some of the work you're doing that will burn out off over time and then rebuild up. So I would urge you not to focus too much on the quarter-to-quarter. But yes, what you're saying is that fundamentally, we've improved our collections processes and improved our underlying free cash flow generation as a result."

I mean, look, there's a high degree of interest from clients, okay, around how to operationalize DCT, and it's not like it's going to overwhelm and all of a sudden become 100% overnight. As I said, large pharma, in particular, is experimenting. A lot of trials are using one composite or the other. So it's going to take time. So this is not next year or the year after that we're going to have to face the issue that you're raising.
In our experience, customers are struggling with how to make various point solutions fit together. So we are actually very -- being very aggressive here. We want to move to DCT. We've said this since the merger we got 5 years ago, we want to accelerate and not slow down technology introduction and changing the model.
Now obviously, the question you asked is the question people asked of us many years ago, which is as you seek to replace labor in a model that -- where pricing is largely based on labor inputs, then aren't you lowering the value of the trial and the -- and et cetera? What are the implications on margin?
So we don't believe so. We have -- as you know, we've had a long-run effort to switch pricing to value and deliverables and outputs. That's number one, and that has made substantial progress. Our clients are not really looking at saving a couple of pennies here or there. They're looking at getting what they need -- the answers that they want faster, more efficiently with less error and with higher quality. And they are willing to pay a premium for that. Now they're not going to pay more than what they were paying before, but they're not going to pay less than what they're paying before.
And so now the margin implication is correct. Over time, the more we deploy technology, the less we need people, the more there's going to be margin accretion. But again, this is going to take time. There are also new delivery roles, which offset some of the reduced CRA visit activity.
So I think it's too early to comment on the exact margin impact for this overall. We are monitoring -- we do not anticipate this to disrupt our margin performance. R&DS is a very long-cycle business. We have -- I mentioned 89 fully decentralized trial ongoing that we won. But we're working on -- if you look at, as I said, just under maybe 900 to -- or so full-service trials. So it's a fraction of that.
As you look at the total trials we are involved in, it's over 2,500 clinical trials that we're involved in globally. So it does take some time to penetrate. It's a slow-moving business. But it's a good point. We are totally focused on it. We do not anticipate a margin -- I'm sorry, a value deterioration. We do anticipate a margin accretion over the long term."

But we feel that -- and we know from experience what a merger and a large acquisition does to the underlying business. There's a lot of disruptions.
