Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. I trust that everyone is staying healthy and safe.
So before getting into the results for the quarter and the full year, let me take a few moments to reflect on last year. 2020 will be remembered as one of the most challenging business environments that we have ever had to navigate. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made decisions that are focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, and I could not be more proud of the way our team responded to the challenges. While enduring the difficulties and uncertainties of the pandemic, we demonstrated an uncompromising commitment to safety, quality, cost and schedule that allowed us to achieve significant milestones on our programs and continue making meaningful contributions to national security.
Specifically, during 2020, we delivered 3 ships. The amphibious assault ship, USS EEE; the guided missile destroyer, USS Delaware D Black; and the National Security Cutter Stone. We also christened Virginia class attack submarine, Montana, and we laid the Keel for Massachusetts.
Now consistent with the strategy outlined during our Investor Day meeting last February, we continue to invest in unmanned and autonomy capabilities. We acquired hydroid and established a strategic alliance with Kongsberg Maritime. We broke ground on the unmanned system center of excellence in Hampton. And closed the year by acquiring the autonomy business of Spatial Integrated systems, an industry leader in unmanned surface vessel solutions.
Now let me share some highlights from the quarter and the full year, starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. Sales of $2.8 billion for the quarter and $9.4 billion for the full year were approximately 14% and 5% higher than 2019, respectively, and they represent record highs for the company. The diluted EPS was $6.15 for the quarter and $17.14 for the full year. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $3.5 billion, resulting in backlog of approximately $46 billion at the end of the year, of which approximately $20 billion is funded.
Now shifting to activities in Washington for a moment, we were very pleased at the fiscal year 2021 budget cycle ultimately concluded with the passage and enactment of defense authorization and defense appropriations measures. Both pieces of legislation strongly supported shipbuilding, including funding and authority for an additional Virginia class submarine, the bundled purchase of LHA 9 with LPD 32 and 33, and long lead material for an additional DDG 51 class destroyer. The final bills will also continued support for the dual purchase of CVN 80 enterprise and CVN 81 Doris Miller, as well as the refueling and complex overhaul of CVN 74 USS John C. Stennis.
Regarding the fiscal year 2022 budget cycle, we look forward to working closely with the new administration and Congress to best maintain the current fleet and build a future fleet that our nation requires.
Now let me share a few business segment highlights from the quarter. At Ingalls, NSC 9 stone was delivered and sailed away from the shipyard in December. The DDG program remains focused on completion of production and test activities planned for this year, including sea trials for DDG 121, Frank E. Peterson, Jr., major machinery write off events for DDG 123 Lenah H. Sutcliffe, and the launch of DDG 125 Jack H. Lucas, the first flight III destroyer.
In addition, LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale is on track to complete sea trials later this year, while LPD 29, Richard M. McCool, Jr., and LPD 30, Harrisburg continue to achieve their planned production milestones. And in Newport News, CVN 79 Kennedy is approximately 78% complete, and the team is aligning plans with a single phase delivery requirements while continuing to focus on compartment completion and key propulsion plant milestones.
CVN 73, USS George Washington, is approximately 85% complete, and the team remains focused on final outfitting and test activities to support redelivery to the Navy planned for next year.
On the VCS program, both SSN 794 Montana and SSN 796 New Jersey, achieved key milestones this week. Montana achieved a float off milestone and will continue its test program activities at the pier. This submarine is approximately 91% complete and still expected to deliver to the Navy in late '21.
New Jersey achieved the pressure haul complete milestone as approximately 72% complete. The next significant milestone is scheduled for this submarine is flowed off in the second half of this year.
In our Technical Solutions business, this was another busy quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we acquired the autonomy business of Spatial Integrated Systems at the end of the year. This acquisition complements our current unmanned capabilities with proven autonomy, sensor fusion and perception capabilities, including multi-vehicle control. These combined capabilities will help us serve our customers' growing needs for unmanned undersea and surface autonomy solutions.
Now other significant milestones in unmanned systems included the delivery of new remus 100 unmanned underwater vehicles to the German Navy and opening of the first of 2 planned buildings on the 20-acre unmanned system center of excellence campus. These facilities will be used to assemble whole structures for the U.S. Navy's Orca extra-large unmanned undersea vehicle program.
Our nuclear and environmental business continues to leverage HII's nuclear operations D&A to take advantage of opportunities within the DOE and commercial nuclear decontamination and decommissioning markets.
And finally, our defense and Federal Solutions business continues to receive very positive customer feedback under our persistent multi-role operations contract. Under this contract vehicle, we provide support for U.S. Air Force intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance requirements in the European and the African theaters of operation.
Now as I prepare to close, let me thank our more than 42,000 employees for their sacrifices, hard work, creativity and determination during a very difficult year. From the very beginning, we view COVID-19 as a human capital crisis, and we made the decision to give our workforce the flexibility they needed to deal with the disruption in their personal lives. This, in turn, allowed us to preserve the significant investment we have made over the past 5 years, hiring, training and qualifying our workforce so that they would be available to execute our record backlog as we emerge from the pandemic.
After finishing 2020 with 2 consecutive strong quarters, I am convinced more than ever that we have a very solid foundation and a bright future for our business. The key attributes that support this foundation include a historic $46 billion backlog, a strong management team, a well-trained workforce, a significantly recapitalized and more efficient shipyards expanded unmanned capabilities and a very strong balance sheet. We enter 2021 as a stronger and more agile company with positive momentum and enormous opportunity to leverage our historic backlog, to generate strong free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees.
Now before I turn the call over to Chris, let me make a few comments about his transition to the newly-created role of Chief Operating Officer. Chris will oversee the company's 3 operating divisions and work closely with the division presidents to drive execution on our historic backlog. And I see this as the next step in the maturation of HII. Our governance model has typically been very federated, pushing as many decisions as far away from the center of the company as possible. But what we are hearing from our customers is that they are looking for us to be able to bring different parts of our business together in order to solve their complex problems. They actually see us as more of an integrated hole that has a collection of businesses and it's up to us to find ways to create value from this opportunity set by smartly collaborating across our Shipbuilding and Technical Solutions segments.
And let me also welcome Tom Steeley to the role of CFO. Tom has done a fantastic job as the CFO at Ingalls, and I am confident that his strong financial and operational background make him the right choice for this position.
And now I will turn the call over to Chris for some remarks on the financials. Chris?"

Today, I will briefly review our fourth quarter and full year results and also provide some additional information on how we view 2021 and our longer-term outlook.Beginning with our consolidated fourth quarter results on",945,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Today, I will briefly review our fourth quarter and full year results and also provide some additional information on how we view 2021 and our longer-term outlook.
Beginning with our consolidated fourth quarter results on Slide 4 of the presentation. Our fourth quarter revenues of $2.8 billion, increased 14.3% and compared to the same period last year, primarily due to growth in Newport News, driven by increased material volume for CVN 80 and CVN 81. And higher volumes for the planning effort for the RCOH of CVN 74, as well as higher volumes for the Columbia and Virginia class submarine programs.
Operating income for the quarter of $305 million increased by $119 million from the fourth quarter of 2019, an operating margin of 11.1% increased 335 basis points. These increases were primarily driven by higher risk retirement across numerous Ingalls programs and improved performance in technical solutions, primarily due to fourth quarter 2019 results that included an asset impairment related to our oil and gas business as well as a loss on the fleet support contract.
Fourth quarter 2020 results also included a more favorable operating FAS/CAS Adjustment.
Moving on to consolidated results for the full year on Slide 5. Revenues were $9.4 billion for the year, an increase of 5.2% from 2019. The increase was driven by growth across all segments, including higher aircraft carrier, submarine and fleet support revenues at Newport News, higher surface combatant and amphibious of sold ship revenues at Ingalls and the inclusion of Hydroid and technical solution results.
Operating income for the year was $799 million, and operating margin was 8.5%. This compares to operating income of $736 million, and operating margin of 8.3% in 2019. The increases were primarily due to a more favorable operating FAS/CAS Adjustment compared to 2019, partially offset by lower segment operating income, including the impacts of the second quarter reset to the Virginia-class submarine program cost and schedule expectations.
Our effective income tax rate was 17.8% for the quarter and 14.1% for the full year. This compares to 13.4% and 19.6% and for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, respectively.
Turning to cash flow on Slide 6 of the presentation, we ended the year with a cash balance of $512 million. During the fourth quarter, as previously noted, we did delever by redeeming $600 million of our senior notes that were due in 2025. As a reminder, that call premium added approximately $15 million of incremental interest expense in 2020.
Cash from operations was $602 million in the quarter, and free cash flow was $469 million. For the full year, cash from operations was $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was $757 million. 2020 free cash flow benefited significantly from the receipt of approximately $160 million of net accelerated progress payments and a deferral of approximately $130 million for the employer portion of payroll taxes in 2021 and 2022. Cash contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans were $246 million in the year, of which, $205 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans.
During the fourth quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or $46 million, bringing total dividends paid for the year to $172 million. Prior to pausing share repurchases in mid-March, we had repurchased 391,000 shares at a cost of $84 million. While we did not repurchase any shares during the fourth quarter of 2020, we did reinitiate repurchases earlier this year and continue to view share repurchases as an integral part of our capital allocation strategy over the long term.
On Slide 7, we have provided an updated 5-year pension outlook. And on Slide 8 of our presentation, we have provided details on our 2021 outlook. In that regard, we expect 2021 shipbuilding revenue to be between $8.2 billion and $8.4 billion, and shipbuilding operating margin to be between 7% and 8%. Additionally, in 2022, we expect shipbuilding operating margin to be in the low 8% range, with steady improvement in subsequent years as Newport News programs mature.
For Technical Solutions, we expect 2021 revenue to be approximately $1 billion. We expect operating margin to be between 3% and 5%, and EBITDA margin to be between 7% and 9%. And with the expected year-over-year improvement, driven by improved performance in our portfolio shaping actions. Following the normal cadence for Technical Solutions, we expect that first quarter operating and EBITDA margin will be below the low end of the annual guidance range.
Next, I'd like to provide some additional context on the long-term free cash flow outlook, which you'll find on Slide 9. We expect that 2020 and 2021 will generate between $900 million and $1 billion in free cash flow cumulatively. And that over the 5-year window from 2020 through 2024, we continue to expect to generate approximately $3 billion of free cash flow. As indicated on Slide 9, our 2020 through 2024 free cash flow forecast is supported by long-term average annual revenue growth in shipbuilding of approximately 3%, as well as Technical Solutions top line growth of 4% to 5% annually, combined with margin expansion in both Shipbuilding and Technical Solutions.
Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to decline from approximately 3.5% of sales in 2021 to approximately 2.5% of sales in 2022 and beyond. And we expect continued strong working capital management.
Finally, on Slide 10, we have provided an updated view of anticipated major shipbuilding program milestones for 2021 and 2022. As you can see, 2022 includes more deliveries in 2021 and supports our expectation for incremental margin expansion and free cash flow generation in 2022.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A."

We believe that our Energy business, our Department of Energy business and our Nuclear Operations business is finding its stride very well. And we think that there's great opportunity there, especially in environmental management moving forward. So we're kind of watching that very closely right now.
And the support for the federal government across all the rest of our solutions with cyber and IT. We're -- we've demonstrated now we know how to run that business, and so we're watching that. That's a pretty dynamic space right now and valuations are kind of challenging.

It's pension and the Care Act working capital. Capital is about the same. And then when you go to '21 to '22, it just simply reverses. The pension actually is a bit of a tailwind. And then you get some working capital help. I don't want to cite a specific number, but we've done very well in working capital, and we'll continue to do that. Remember, we do have significant deliveries in 2022. We have 4 ships that are going to deliver. So it will be helped there.

Since the pandemic started, I guess, in March, we still hired about 3,000 people. And so we believe and have a lot of confidence in our ability to expand our workforce where we need to. We're pretty good at throttling the pace of that, and we're actually exceptional, I believe, at training that workforce.
So I think that there will be workforce expansion that coincides with the growth in the business. But we think that's well within our capacity to do that. And frankly, we're probably ahead of many folks in the industry right now in terms of having already hired a lot of those folks. So we're on our way."

But I think we're starting from a place where the previous administration was looking at what's going on in the world and had come to the conclusion that the Navy needed some priority in terms of budget allocation and resources. If anything, I think what's going on in the world, probably, since the election, probably just reinforces that view. New players will look at that differently, and they may have a different set of priorities. But at the end of the day, our principal role here is to support the Navy and whatever it is that they need to go to deal and support our national security. So that's what we'll do.
Particularly around the aircraft carriers, I think I think the value of the carrier and the capability of the carrier is well understood by everybody in the industry, and we'll see how that all plays out. But we like the work that we're doing. We're very proud of the ships that we're producing. Ford is a tremendous ship right now, where it's been providing training support and demonstrating all the new technologies. I believe the Navy could tell you that it's been at sea as much as any other ship in the Navy last year.
And so I think the carrier is in a good place right now relative to how the Navy is thinking about what they need for our national security needs going forward.
But that doesn't mean anything about the rest of our portfolio. I mean we really have strong offerings and strong parts of our portfolio that supports the broad range of Navy requirements, whether it's submarines or amphibs or destroyers. If the Navy is going to be a priority in our national security posture going forward, then we're going to be right in there with them."

But the whole point of the way the Navy worked with us to make those transitions has been to try to do that as gracefully as possible. Yes, DDG 125 -- it's the first Flight III ship. But they've been actually incrementally inserting Flight III technologies into the ships ahead of that. And so trying to make that as graceful as possible as, I think, will pay big dividends.
And as far as the LPDs goes and go into Flight II, there's -- I mean, just the fact that we're doing LPD Flight II is a punctuation on that statement that they made it graceful. Instead of going off and doing a whole new class design and starting all over, you just basically took the LPD Flight I, and then you rescoped it to do Flight II, and that's definitely in our wheelhouse. And so we feel pretty good about both of those.
We actually think it was very thoughtful on the Navy's part to do it that way with the LPDs, it was the Navy and the marine Corps that did that. And we think that's the advantage of -- that's the Navy's understanding of taking advantage of serial production as opposed to going back to the blackboard and starting all over and trying to redesign it from the ground up. In both of those cases, you're going to get significantly improved capability at significantly reduced or significantly better affordability in a lot faster time frame. I mean I think that's the wave of the future. And in some ways, it's a pro back to the past because that's how we used to do it. So I think we're going to be fine there."

It's sort of -- it's more like the -- there were several of those that when they added together, it just made it -- made more sense for us to start thinking about it in terms of an integration and not as a straight up customer directly facing the particular customers.

This has been something that we've been kicking around.

And fast forward to where we are today, we have strong offerings in every size and capacity and capability in the unmanned undersea space today. That includes the work that Hydroid does. That includes the work that we're doing in support of Boeing on the Orca program. And we've done that in, say, 5 or 6 years. That shows that the business itself is accelerating, and that shows our commitment to it.
So we're going to remain committed to it. We think that the unmanned undersea space is conceptually ahead. It's a challenging space. But from a con ops perspective, I think it's conceptually ahead of the surface, the unmanned surface space.
We do have a contract to work with the Navy in that area as do several other companies. But we're going to continue to invest in the auto and build the capability. And frankly, I think this is going to be 1 of those where it's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. As we demonstrate more capability and capacity in this space, it's going to become -- as we, Huntington ingalls and as we, the industry, demonstrate that it's going to become a bigger and bigger part of the Navy's plan. What's the limit of that? I don't know. Where does it go? I don't know. But that's the mission in front of us right now is to mature that."

They're always looking for ways to accomplish their mission in turn -- they're always looking at trying to figure out ways to do that in a more affordable way. And so the question of on",412,"Well, I think, first of all, I think let's give the Navy some credit. They're always looking for ways to accomplish their mission in turn -- they're always looking at trying to figure out ways to do that in a more affordable way. And so the question of once we decided 50 years ago, almost 60 years ago now, to create a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, you always had to kind of compete -- that always was in the competition with the conventional carrier in terms of affordability. And on the one hand, the budget folks can look at it and say, ""well, it's cheaper to build a ship without reactors."" And over the last several decades, this analysis has been done. You're right. It was done back when limits happened. It was done, frankly, when enterprise was done, and it's being -- and it's done all the time. The cheapest thing that we do in the carrier business is build volume. And so if you want to take a carrier that's 100,000 tons, and you want to drop it to pick a number, 60,000 or 70,000 tons, and you want to take the reactors off of it, you just completely changed the capability set, and you're still going to spend a lot of money building that 60,000-ton ship.
So I think that it's a serious look. I think every look is serious. We stand ready to support the Navy and whatever their mission is and wherever they need to go. We're very proud of the Ford. And I would tell you that as a lead ship for the Ford cost, the Ford cost was too high. We made significant capital investment to drive that cost down inside the shipyard, and we've taken a 15% of the man hours out of the Kennedy and between Ford and Kennedy, and we've streamlined the supply chain. And so we're taking cost out of that ship.
The next 2 ships were bought on a single contract, and the Navy advertises that not just including our savings, but all of their savings, when they bought it smarter, they saved $4 billion. So as the Ford becomes more affordable, that makes that comparison even tougher.
Having said that, if the Navy chooses to go down that path, and they think that that's the way that they can meet their mission requirements most affordably. We're their partner, and we will -- we're going to support them all the way."

But we do think there's opportunity in unmanned from a margin standpoint, especially with international content. Traditionally, you earn more on international products. So yes, we do think there's opportunity there. But remember, TS is a blended margin story. So we think that 3% to 5% return on sales right now is the right way to think about it, but it could grow from here."

First, that you touched on a key issue is that we are keeping the unmanned business separate from shipbuilding for exactly -- almost exactly the reason that you said, that unmanned customers are very different than the shipbuilding customers. And so we want to have customer-facing organizations that respond appropriately. And so that's been very successful for every business inside of TS, including unmanned. When we created TS, we've seen significant improvement in terms of being able to respond to customers and understand what their capabilities are by getting that -- either acquiring that business or getting it out of shipbuilding.
The second thing is that I would argue that the TS story is -- it is about margin, but it's also about growth. I think the unmanned area for growth is going to be pretty significant. Pick your multiple. But over the next 5 years, I think that what we're spending in unmanned today as a nation is going to be small compared to what we're spending 5 years from now. And so that's the -- that's at least as much relative to unmanned. That's as much as an important part of the story as it is about the margin."

And we believe that those are pretty well understood, and that's what drove our piece of that contract. So -- and now you -- what do the shareholders get from that? They get a workforce that's not building the last carrier. They're moving from 1 to the next. And so you're not having to go retrain them and get all of that sort of stuff.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. I trust that everyone is staying healthy and safe. 
So before getting into the results for the quarter and the full year, let me take a few moments to reflect on last year. 2020 will be remembered as one of the most challenging business environments that we have ever had to navigate. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made decisions that are focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, and I could not be more proud of the way our team responded to the challenges. While enduring the difficulties and uncertainties of the pandemic, we demonstrated an uncompromising commitment to safety, quality, cost and schedule that allowed us to achieve significant milestones on our programs and continue making meaningful contributions to national security.
Specifically, during 2020, we delivered 3 ships. The amphibious assault ship, USS Tripoli; the guided missile destroyer, USS Delbert D. Black; and the National Security Cutter Stone. We also christened Virginia class attack submarine, Montana, and we laid the Keel for Massachusetts. 
Now consistent with the strategy outlined during our Investor Day meeting last February, we continue to invest in unmanned and autonomy capabilities. We acquired hydroid and established a strategic alliance with Kongsberg Maritime. We broke ground on the unmanned system center of excellence in Hampton. And closed the year by acquiring the autonomy business of Spatial Integrated Systems, an industry leader in unmanned surface vessel solutions. 
Now let me share some highlights from the quarter and the full year, starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. Sales of $2.8 billion for the quarter and $9.4 billion for the full year were approximately 14% and 5% higher than 2019, respectively, and they represent record highs for the company. The diluted EPS was $6.15 for the quarter and $17.14 for the full year. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $3.5 billion, resulting in backlog of approximately $46 billion at the end of the year, of which approximately $20 billion is funded. 
Now shifting to activities in Washington for a moment, we were very pleased at the fiscal year 2021 budget cycle ultimately concluded with the passage and enactment of defense authorization and defense appropriations measures. Both pieces of legislation strongly support shipbuilding, including funding and authority for an additional Virginia class submarine, the bundle purchase of LHA 9 with LPD 32 and 33, and long lead material for an additional DDG 51 class destroyer. The final bills also continued support for the dual purchase of CVN 80 enterprise and CVN 81 Doris Miller, as well as the refueling and complex overhaul of CVN 74 USS John C. Stennis. 
Regarding the fiscal year 2022 budget cycle, we look forward to working closely with the new administration and Congress to best maintain the current fleet and build a future fleet that our nation requires. 
Now let me share a few business segment highlights from the quarter. At Ingalls, NSC 9 Stone was delivered and sailed away from the shipyard in December. The DDG program remains focused on completion of production and test activities planned for this year, including sea trials for DDG 121, Frank E. Peterson, Jr., major machinery write off events for DDG 123 Lenah H. Sutcliffe, and the launch of DDG 125 Jack H. Lucas, the first Flight III destroyer. 
In addition, LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale is on track to complete sea trials later this year, while LPD 29, Richard M. McCool, Jr., and LPD 30, Harrisburg continue to achieve their planned production milestones. And in Newport News, CVN 79 Kennedy is approximately 78% complete, and the team is aligning plans with a single phase delivery requirements while continuing to focus on compartment completion and key propulsion plant milestones. 
CVN 73, USS George Washington, is approximately 85% complete, and the team remains focused on final outfitting and test activities to support redelivery to the Navy planned for next year. 
On the VCS program, both SSN 794 Montana and SSN 796 New Jersey, achieved key milestones this week. Montana achieved a float off milestone and will continue its test program activities at the pier. This submarine is approximately 91% complete and still expected to deliver to the Navy in late '21. 
New Jersey achieved the pressure haul complete milestone as approximately 72% complete. The next significant milestone is scheduled for this submarine is float off in the second half of this year. 
In our Technical Solutions business, this was another busy quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we acquired the autonomy business of Spatial Integrated Systems at the end of the year. This acquisition complements our current unmanned capabilities with proven autonomy, sensor fusion and perception capabilities, including multi-vehicle control. These combined capabilities will help us serve our customers' growing needs for unmanned undersea and surface autonomy solutions. 
Now other significant milestones in unmanned systems included the delivery of new REMUS 100 Unmanned Underwater Vehicles to the German Navy and opening of the first of 2 planned buildings on the 20-acre unmanned system center of excellence campus. These facilities will be used to assemble hull structures for the U.S. Navy's Orca extra-large unmanned undersea vehicle program. 
Our nuclear and environmental business continues to leverage HII's nuclear operations D&A to take advantage of opportunities within the DOE and commercial nuclear decontamination and decommissioning markets. 
And finally, our defense and Federal Solutions business continues to receive very positive customer feedback under our persistent multi-role operations contract. Under this contract vehicle, we provide support for U.S. Air Force intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance requirements in the European and the African theaters of operation. 
Now as I prepare to close, let me thank our more than 42,000 employees for their sacrifices, hard work, creativity and determination during a very difficult year. From the very beginning, we viewed COVID-19 as a human capital crisis, and we made the decision to give our workforce the flexibility they needed to deal with the disruption in their personal lives. This, in turn, allowed us to preserve the significant investment we have made over the past 5 years, hiring, training and qualifying our workforce so that they would be available to execute our record backlog as we emerge from the pandemic. 
After finishing 2020 with 2 consecutive strong quarters, I am convinced more than ever that we have a very solid foundation and a bright future for our business. The key attributes that support this foundation include a historic $46 billion backlog, a strong management team, a well-trained workforce, a significantly recapitalized and more efficient shipyards, expanded unmanned capabilities and a very strong balance sheet. 
We enter 2021 as a stronger and more agile company with positive momentum and enormous opportunity to leverage our historic backlog, to generate strong free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. 
Now before I turn the call over to Chris, let me make a few comments about his transition to the newly-created role of Chief Operating Officer. Chris will oversee the company's 3 operating divisions and work closely with the division presidents to drive execution on our historic backlog. And I see this as the next step in the maturation of HII. 
Our governance model has typically been very federated, pushing as many decisions as far away from the center of the company as possible. But what we are hearing from our customers is that they are looking for us to be able to bring different parts of our business together in order to solve their complex problems. They actually see us as more of an integrated whole that has a collection of businesses and it's up to us to find ways to create value from this opportunity set by smartly collaborating across our Shipbuilding and Technical Solutions segments. 
And let me also welcome [Tom Steeley] to the role of CFO. Tom has done a fantastic job as the CFO at Ingalls, and I am confident that his strong financial and operational background make him the right choice for this position. 
And now I will turn the call over to Chris for some remarks on the financials. Chris?"

Today, I will briefly review our fourth quarter and full year results and also provide some additional information on how we view 2021 and our longer-term outlook. Beginning with our consolidated fourth quarter results on",940,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Today, I will briefly review our fourth quarter and full year results and also provide some additional information on how we view 2021 and our longer-term outlook. 
Beginning with our consolidated fourth quarter results on Slide 4 of the presentation. Our fourth quarter revenues of $2.8 billion, increased 14.3% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to growth in Newport News, driven by increased material volume for CVN 80 and CVN 81. And higher volumes for the planning effort for the RCOH of CVN 74, as well as higher volumes for the Columbia and Virginia-class submarine programs. 
Operating income for the quarter of $305 million increased by $119 million from the fourth quarter of 2019, an operating margin of 11.1% increased 335 basis points. These increases were primarily driven by higher risk retirement across numerous Ingalls programs and improved performance in technical solutions, primarily due to fourth quarter 2019 results that included an asset impairment related to our oil and gas business as well as a loss on the fleet support contract. 
Fourth quarter 2020 results also included a more favorable operating FAS/CAS Adjustment. 
Moving on to consolidated results for the full year on Slide 5. Revenues were $9.4 billion for the year, an increase of 5.2% from 2019. The increase was driven by growth across all segments, including higher aircraft carrier, submarine and fleet support revenues at Newport News, higher surface combatant and amphibious assault ship revenues at Ingalls and the inclusion of Hydroid in Technical Solutions results. 
Operating income for the year was $799 million, and operating margin was 8.5%. This compares to operating income of $736 million, and operating margin of 8.3% in 2019. The increases were primarily due to a more favorable operating FAS/CAS Adjustment compared to 2019, partially offset by lower segment operating income, including the impacts of the second quarter reset to the Virginia-class submarine program cost and schedule expectations. 
Our effective income tax rate was 17.8% for the quarter and 14.1% for the full year. This compares to 13.4% and 19.6% for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, respectively. 
Turning to cash flow on Slide 6 of the presentation, we ended the year with a cash balance of $512 million. During the fourth quarter, as previously noted, we did delever by redeeming $600 million of our senior notes that were due in 2025. As a reminder, that call premium added approximately $15 million of incremental interest expense in 2020. 
Cash from operations was $602 million in the quarter, and free cash flow was $469 million. For the full year, cash from operations was $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was $757 million. 2020 free cash flow benefited significantly from the receipt of approximately $160 million of net accelerated progress payments and a deferral of approximately $130 million for the employer portion of payroll taxes in 2021 and 2022. Cash contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans were $246 million in the year, of which, $205 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans. 
During the fourth quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or $46 million, bringing total dividends paid for the year to $172 million. Prior to pausing share repurchases in mid-March, we had repurchased 391,000 shares at a cost of $84 million. While we did not repurchase any shares during the fourth quarter of 2020, we did reinitiate repurchases earlier this year and continue to view share repurchases as an integral part of our capital allocation strategy over the long term. 
On Slide 7, we have provided an updated 5-year pension outlook. And on Slide 8 of our presentation, we have provided details on our 2021 outlook. In that regard, we expect 2021 shipbuilding revenue to be between $8.2 billion and $8.4 billion, and shipbuilding operating margin to be between 7% and 8%. Additionally, in 2022, we expect shipbuilding operating margin to be in the low 8% range, with steady improvement in subsequent years as Newport News programs mature. 
For Technical Solutions, we expect 2021 revenue to be approximately $1 billion. We expect operating margin to be between 3% and 5%, and EBITDA margin to be between 7% and 9%. With the expected year-over-year improvement, driven by improved performance in our portfolio shaping actions. Following the normal cadence for Technical Solutions, we expect that first quarter operating and EBITDA margin will be below the low end of the annual guidance range. 
Next, I'd like to provide some additional context on the long-term free cash flow outlook, which you'll find on Slide 9. We expect that 2020 and 2021 will generate between $900 million and $1 billion in free cash flow cumulatively. And that over the 5-year window from 2020 through 2024, we continue to expect to generate approximately $3 billion of free cash flow. As indicated on Slide 9, our 2020 through 2024 free cash flow forecast is supported by long-term average annual revenue growth in shipbuilding of approximately 3%, as well as Technical Solutions top line growth of 4% to 5% annually, combined with margin expansion in both Shipbuilding and Technical Solutions. 
Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to decline from approximately 3.5% of sales in 2021 to approximately 2.5% of sales in 2022 and beyond. And we expect continued strong working capital management. 
Finally, on Slide 10, we have provided an updated view of anticipated major shipbuilding program milestones for 2021 and 2022. As you can see, 2022 includes more deliveries in 2021 and supports our expectation for incremental margin expansion and free cash flow generation in 2022. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A."

We believe that our Energy business, our Department of Energy business and our Nuclear Operations business is finding its stride very well. And we think that there's great opportunity there, especially in environmental management moving forward. So we're kind of watching that very closely right now. 
And the support for the federal government across all the rest of our solutions with cyber and IT. We're -- we've demonstrated now we know how to run that business, and so we're watching that. That's a pretty dynamic space right now and valuations are kind of challenging.

It's pension and the CARES Act working capital. Capital is about the same. And then when you go to '21 to '22, it just simply reverses. The pension actually is a bit of a tailwind. And then you get some working capital help. I don't want to cite a specific number, but we've done very well in working capital, and we'll continue to do that. Remember, we do have significant deliveries in 2022. We have 4 ships that are going to deliver. 
So it will be helped there.

But I think we're starting from a place where the previous administration was looking at what's going on in the world and had come to the conclusion that the Navy needed some priority in terms of budget allocation and resources. If anything, I think what's going on in the world, probably, since the election, probably just reinforces that view. New players will look at that differently, and they may have a different set of priorities. But at the end of the day, our principal role here is to support the Navy in whatever it is that they need to go to deal and support our national security. So that's what we'll do.
Particularly around the aircraft carriers, I think, I think the value of the carrier and the capability of the carrier is well understood by everybody in the industry, and we'll see how that all plays out. But we like the work that we're doing. We're very proud of the ships that we're producing. Ford is a tremendous ship right now, where it's been providing training support and demonstrating all the new technologies. I believe the Navy could tell you that it's been at sea as much as any other ship in the Navy last year.
And so I think the carrier is in a good place right now relative to how the Navy is thinking about what they need for our national security needs going forward.
But that doesn't mean anything about the rest of our portfolio. I mean we really have strong offerings and strong parts of our portfolio that support the broad range of Navy requirements, whether it's submarines or amphibs or destroyers. If the Navy is going to be a priority in our national security posture going forward, then we're going to be right in there with them."

But the whole point of the way the Navy worked with us to make those transitions has been to try to do that as gracefully as possible. Yes, DDG 125 -- it's the first Flight III ship. But they've been actually incrementally inserting Flight III technologies into the ships ahead of that. And so trying to make that as graceful as possible has -- I think, will pay big dividends.
And as far as the LPDs goes and going to Flight II, there's -- I mean, just the fact that we're doing LPD Flight II is a punctuation on that statement that they made it graceful. Instead of going off and doing a whole new class design and starting all over, you just basically took the LPD Flight I, and then you rescoped it to do Flight II, and that's definitely in our wheelhouse. And so we feel pretty good about both of those.
We actually think it was very thoughtful on the Navy's part to do it that way with the LPDs, it was the Navy and the Marine Corps that did that. And we think that's the advantage of -- that's the Navy's understanding of taking advantage of serial production as opposed to going back to the blackboard and starting all over and trying to redesign it from the ground up. In both of those cases, you're going to get significantly improved capability at significantly reduced or significantly better affordability in a lot faster time frame. I mean I think that's the wave of the future. And in some ways, it's a throwback to the past because that's how we used to do it. So I think we're going to be fine there."

It's sort of -- it's more like the -- there were several of those that when they added together, it just made it -- made more sense for us to start thinking about it in terms of an integration and not as a straight up customer directly facing the particular customers.
And I actually have kind of been leaning towards this for the past couple of years as we've kind of evolved. So this was not a I woke up one morning, and we just need to go do this. This has been something that we've been kicking around. Because we've had great success with governance that said, ""push and delegate as much authority and accountability as far away from the center of the organization as you can."" And that creates business units that are very focused on their particular customers. 
What we're seeing, though, is that our customers are starting to -- they're starting to become a little bit more integrated. And the problems they're facing are becoming more complex. And so as a result, we need to bring a more integrated approach to solving that. And I look forward to having Chris in that role because I think it's going to be -- we were doing some of it.

The first question, I don't know how to answer that because we -- you can answer that in terms of numbers of platforms. You could answer that in terms of capability and regions that you can handle from an unmanned. So there's sort of a mission kind of thing. So I'm not exactly sure how to answer that directly.
The way we think about it is really about the capability set, where the technology is, what are the kinds of things that we think are going to be useful and applicable to the mission of the Navy. And at this point, if you kind of look at the time line, I think if you go back to before we acquired the Columbia Group down in Panama City, our presence in the unmanned space, the Huntington Ingalls presence in the unmanned space was 0. We were cold ironed in that space. 
We started with acquiring a little bit of capability and a little bit of technology. We got to know the customers. We got to understand who they were and what they were trying to get done. And fast forward to where we are today, we have strong offerings in every size and capacity and capability in the unmanned undersea space today. That includes the work that Hydroid does. That includes the work that we're doing in support of Boeing on the Orca program. And we've done that in, say, 5 or 6 years. That shows that the business itself is accelerating, and that shows our commitment to it.
So we're going to remain committed to it. We think that the unmanned undersea space is conceptually ahead. It's a challenging space. But from a con ops perspective, I think it's conceptually ahead of the surface, the unmanned surface space.
We do have a contract to work with the Navy in that area as do several other companies. But we're going to continue to invest in the auto and build the capability. And frankly, I think this is going to be 1 of those where it's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. As we demonstrate more capability and capacity in this space, it's going to become -- as we, Huntington Ingalls and as we, the industry, demonstrate that it's going to become a bigger and bigger part of the Navy's plan. What's the limit of that? I don't know. Where does it go? I don't know. But that's the mission in front of us right now is to mature that."

They're always looking for ways to accomplish their mission in turn -- they're always looking at trying to figure out ways to do that in a more affordable way. And so the question of",491,"Well, I think, first of all, I think let's give the Navy some credit. They're always looking for ways to accomplish their mission in turn -- they're always looking at trying to figure out ways to do that in a more affordable way. 
And so the question of once we decided 50 years ago, almost 60 years ago now, to create a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, you always had to kind of compete -- that always was in the competition with the conventional carrier in terms of affordability. And on the one hand, the budget folks can look at it and say, ""well, it's cheaper to build a ship without reactors in it."" But on the other hand you look at the set of capabilities that brings to the carrier. And over the last several decades, this analysis has been done. 
You're right. It was done back when Nimitz happened. It was done, frankly, when Enterprise was done, and it's being -- and it's done all the time. But what it comes down to essentially, it kind of -- again and this is a conversation that could go on for a week, but what it usually comes down to is that can you get 80% of the capability for 80% of the cost. And the answer is almost always no. Because it turns out that we  -- the cheapest thing that we do in the carrier business is build volume. And so if you want to take a carrier that's 100,000 tons, and you want to drop it to -- pick a number, 60,000 or 70,000 tons, and you want to take the reactors off of it, you just completely changed the capability set, and you're still going to spend a lot of money building that 60,000-ton ship.
So I think that it's a serious look. I think every look is serious. We stand ready to support the Navy and whatever their mission is and wherever they need to go. We're very proud of the Ford. And I would tell you that as a lead ship for the Ford cost -- the Ford cost was too high. We made significant capital investment to drive that cost down inside the shipyard, and we've taken 15% of the man hours out of the Kennedy -- between Ford and Kennedy, and we've streamlined the supply chain. And so we're taking cost out of that ship.
The next 2 ships were bought on a single contract, and the Navy advertised that not just including our savings, but all of their savings, when they bought it smarter, they saved $4 billion. So as the Ford becomes more affordable, that makes that comparison even tougher.
Having said that, if the Navy chooses to go down that path, and they think that that's the way that they can meet their mission requirements most affordably. We're their partner, and we will -- we're going to support them all the way."

So yes, we do think there's opportunity there. But remember, TS is a blended margin story. So we think that 3% to 5% return on sales right now is the right way to think about it, but it could grow from here."

First, that you touched on a key issue is that we are keeping the unmanned business separate from shipbuilding for exactly -- almost exactly the reason that you said, that unmanned customers are very different than the shipbuilding customers. And so we want to have customer-facing organizations that respond appropriately. And so that's been very successful for every business inside of TS, including unmanned. When we created TS, we've seen significant improvement in terms of being able to respond to customers and understand what their capabilities are by getting that -- either acquiring that business or getting it out of shipbuilding.
The second thing is that I would argue that the TS story is -- it is about margin, but it's also about growth. I think the unmanned area for growth is going to be pretty significant. Pick your multiple. But over the next 5 years, I think that what we're spending in unmanned today as a nation is going to be small compared to what we're spending 5 years from now. And so that's the -- that's at least as much relative to unmanned. That's as much as an important part of the story as it is about the margin."

And we believe that those are pretty well understood, and that's what drove our piece of that contract. 
So -- and now you -- what do the shareholders get from that? They get a workforce that's not building the last carrier. They're moving from 1 to the next. And so you're not having to go retrain them and get all of that sort of stuff. So it allows for, over time, better performance on the program. And that's where we're headed. It's not better performance in '19 -- or in 2020 or 2021, because that's the very beginning of the program. But we see these as they mature, they're going to become very important to us."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. I trust that everyone is staying healthy and safe. 
Now let me share some highlights from the quarter, starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. Sales of $2.3 billion for the quarter were slightly higher than 2020. Diluted EPS was $3.68 for the quarter and pension adjusted EPS was $3.56, up from $2.43 in 2020. 
New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $5.3 billion, resulting in a record backlog of approximately $49 billion, of which approximately $25 billion is funded. Chris will provide some color on a few of the key awards for the quarter during his remarks. 
Shifting to activities in Washington. We were pleased that the recently released summary of the fiscal year 2022 President's budget request affirm that maintaining U.S. naval power is critical to reassuring allies and signaling U.S. resolved to potential adversaries. Of note, the budget summary cited continued recapitalization of the nation's strategic ballistic missile submarine fleet, investment in remotely operated and autonomous systems and funding for the next-generation attack submarine program. And we look forward to understanding budget details for these and other national security priorities when that information becomes available as well as funding levels requested for the Department of Energy and the Department of Homeland Security. We also look forward to working closely with the Congress as the FY '22 President's budget request is considered during the current legislative cycle. 
Regarding portfolio shaping actions during the quarter, we completed the previously announced sale of our oil and gas business and also completed the contribution of the San Diego Shipyard to Titan Acquisition Holdings in exchange for a noncontrolling interest in this leading provider of ship repair and fleet sustainment services. Completion of these transactions sharpens the focus of our Technical Solutions business into areas where we believe our unique capabilities and close customer relationships will drive strong organic revenue growth and margin expansion. 
And as I prepare to close, I'm very pleased with the operating rhythm the team is achieving, which led to the third consecutive quarter of solid program execution and financial results. And I am very confident that our strength, agility and positive momentum resulting from enduring the impacts of COVID-19 will serve as key catalyst to help us leverage our historic backlog, to generate strong free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, customers and employees. 
Now before I turn the call over to Chris, let me make a few comments about our recent leadership change. After serving as President of Ingalls since 2014 and with more than 40 years of service, Brian Cuccias retired on April 1. Brian's career at Ingalls has been remarkable, and HII has truly benefited from his leadership. Effective April 1, Kari Wilkinson succeeded Brian as the new President of Ingalls and will report to Chris. Kari has proven herself to be a strategic and visionary leader that is focused on operational excellence, and I am extremely confident that Ingalls is in very capable hands. 
And now I will turn the call over to Chris for some remarks on the operations. Chris?"

Operationally, we had a solid quarter, making consistent progress across our shipbuilding and Technical Solutions programs. 
With that, let me share a few key contract awards and programmatic highlights from the business segments for the quarter. At Ingalls, the team was awarded a life-cycle engineering and support services contract for the LPD program with a cumulative value of approximately $214 million. The scope of work includes engineering change management, supply chain management, training for new shipboard systems and the execution of post-delivery availabilities. 
Regarding program status, LHA 8 Bougainville achieved a 25% complete milestone during the quarter, and the team remains focused on maintaining strong cost and schedule performance in support of their planned production milestones. 
On the DDG program, the team remains focused on preparations for launch of DDG 125 Jack H. Lucas and sea trials for DDG 121 Frank E. Peterson, Jr., both planned for the second half of this year. And on the LPD program, LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale remains on track to complete sea trials later this year. And LPD 29, Richard M. McCool, Jr., remains on schedule for launch early next year. 
The team at Ingalls is also working closely with the Navy to put LPD 32 and 33, along with LHA 9 under contract. This bundle acquisition approach is the most affordable method to buy these ships. And when complete, affords predictable savings for the Navy. 
At Newport News, the team was awarded a $3 billion contract for the refueling and complex overhaul of CVN 74 USS John C. Stennis, and also received a contract modification for construction of the 10th Virginia-class Block V submarine. These key awards are additional building blocks for a record backlog, which now stands at nearly $49 billion. 
Shifting to program status, CVN 79 Kennedy is approximately 81% complete. The team is finalizing plans to support the single phase delivery requirements while continuing to focus on compartment completion and key initial test milestones. CVN 73 USS George Washington is approximately 87% complete and continues to make progress with the crew recently beginning to move back aboard the ship. This is another key milestone is supported redelivery to the Navy planned for next year. 
On the VCS program, SSN 794 Montana continues test program activities in preparation for delivery to the Navy planned for later this year. In addition, SSN 796 New Jersey remains on track to achieve the float off milestone as planned in the second half of this year. 
At Technical Solutions, the team booked several key awards during the quarter. This included a $175 million fleet to statement recompete and a position on a Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific, ISR and cybersecurity IDIQ contract. Additionally, production of the first Orca XLUUV modules is now underway at our unmanned systems center of excellence. Approximately 75% of all structural components have been fabricated, and assembly has commenced with final unit delivery to Boeing plan later this year. 
And finally, our Nuclear and Environmental Services business continues to perform very well with strong performance across our Department of Energy contracts at Los Alamos, Nevada and Savannah River. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on the financials. Tom?"
363263,710703874,2272555,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I will briefly review our first quarter results. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website.Beginning with our consolidated results o",936,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I will briefly review our first quarter results. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website.
Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 4 of the presentation, our first quarter revenues of $2.3 billion increased less compared to the same period last year. This was primarily due to growth in Newport News and Ingalls that was largely offset by a decline of Technical Solutions due to divestitures associated with the portfolio-shaping actions we have taken.
Segment operating income for the quarter of $191 million increased $35 million from the first quarter of 2020 and segment operating margin of 8.4%, increased 149 basis points. The improvement was driven by higher retirement at angles and improved performance to Technical Solutions.
Operating income for the quarter of $147 million decreased by $68 million from the first quarter of 2020, and operating margin of 6.5% decreased 35 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by a less favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment, partially offset by the stronger segment operating results compared to the prior year.
The tax rate in the quarter was approximately 15% compared to approximately 20% in the first quarter of 2020. The decline in tax rate was primarily due to the divestiture of our oil and gas business. as well as the recognition of R&D tax credits for the current year and prior periods. Net earnings in the quarter were $148 million, compared to $172 million in the first quarter of 2020. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.68 compared to $4.23 in the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact of pension, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.56 compared to $2.43 in the first quarter of 2020.
Turning to Slide 5 of the presentation. Cash from operations was $43 million in the quarter, and net capital expenditures were $59 million or 2.6% of revenues, resulting in free cash of negative $16 million. This compares to cash from operations of $68 million and net capital expenditures of $66 million and free cash flow of $2 million in the first quarter of 2020. Cash contribution to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were $72 million in the quarter, of which $60 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans.
During the first quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or $46 million. As noted on our fourth quarter earnings call, we did reinitiate share repurchases earlier this year and continue to view the return of excess free cash flow via share repurchases as an integral part of our capital allocation strategy over the long term. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 292,000 shares at a cost of approximately $50 million.
Moving on to pension. With the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, we have reviewed the 5-year pension outlook that we provided on our last earnings call and continue to believe that remains the most appropriate view. Due to the limited nature of our projected contributions and the impact of lower cash sensitivity with safe harbor implementation, the passage of the legislation does not have a meaningful impact on our outlook. We plan to provide an update to near-term pension expectations on our Q3 call, consistent with our product cadence.
Moving on to Slide 6 of the presentation. Ingalls revenues of $649 million in the quarter increased $20 million or 3.2% from the same period last year, driven primarily by higher revenues on the DDG program. Ingalls operating income of $91 million and margin of 14% in the quarter were up from the first quarter of 2020, mainly due to higher risk retirement on LHA, which was related to the 25% completion milestone that Chris mentioned earlier.
Turning to Slide 7 of the presentation. Newport News revenues of $1.4 billion in the quarter increased to $66 million or 4.9% from the same period last year due to higher revenues in both aircraft carrier and submarine construction as well as support services. Newport News operating income of $93 million and margin 6.6% in the quarter were down slightly year-over-year primarily due to lower risk retirement on CVN 73 RCOH, partially offset by higher risk assignment on VCS lot 4 votes.
Now to Technical Solutions on Slide 8 of the presentation. Technical Solutions revenues of $259 million in the quarter decreased 18.3% from the same period last year, mainly due to the divestitures of both our oil and gas business in the San Diego shipyard on February 1 of this year, partially offset by a full quarter of results from Hydroid, which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of 2020.
Technical Solutions operating income of $7 million in the quarter compares to a loss in the first quarter of 2020. This was driven primarily by improved performance in Defense and Federal Solutions and Nuclear Environmental Services as well as a gain related to the sale of our oil and gas business.
Turning to Slide 9. We continue to expect we will finish the year with strict building operating margin in the 7% to 8% range with the significant remaining risk retirement events weighted towards the end of the year. In addition, we expect shipbuilding margin for the first half of 2021 to be around the midpoint of our annual guidance range.
We continue to view the remainder of our 2021 guidance as appropriate, with the exception of the effective tax rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A."

We've had -- we've got a lot of stuff thrown at us in the last 12 months. And we took a pretty good body blow back a year ago with attendance relative to the pandemic. And the impact that had on our ability to retire risk, we recognize that in Q2.
But what came out of that was we've stabilized our employment levels. We've stabilized our scheduling. We've actually created the mechanisms in our risk registers so that we know where we are and where we're going and where we need to get. It helps a lot that we have this backlog that we're working off of. And where we are now is that when you come through a crisis like this as a leadership team, the connectivity, the tools that you've put in place, the innovation that has happened, you're taking advantage of all of that. And as you move forward, you start to look at what have we actually accomplished.
When we started at the beginning of the pandemic thinking that we needed to preserve the 25,000 people we had just hired over the last 5 years in our workforce. We've done that. We actually have hired between 5,000 and 6,000 people since the pandemic started. That's pretty creative and innovative, if you will. And that's the -- and we still have pretty robust hiring plans going forward.
Our case rates today are lower than they have been since last summer. That's inside of our yard. And the quarantine volume today is lower than it's been really since this began. We have actually administered vaccines to -- we've administered vaccines to about 1/3 of our workforce on top of where they're widely available to the rest of the employees who are getting them not through us. And so we're seeing a pretty steady rhythm now our folks are at work. They're engaged. We understand what needs to be done, and we're actually getting stuff done.
I think the change where we moved Chris over to be the Chief Operating Officer and really create more management bandwidth on how do we manage that risk going forward and how do we make sure that we're doing what we said we were going to do has really helped. And so I don't know, I guess I've been around it for a long time, but I feel really good about where we are right now in terms of doing what we said we're going to do."

We're not seeing a tremendous amount of inflation across the purchases that we have. And with not having a problem feeding the yards from a material perspective. We do see going forward as we're getting new quotes that the stand of the validity of the quotes is short. I think the subcontractors are staying light on their feet as far as what they're committing to. But relative to our contracts and our performance, we don't see an impact right now."

It's 1 we actually kind of kick around a lot is are we thinking about this the right way? I think at a macro kind of at the higher level, what we see is that the shipbuilding execution plan is on a much longer rhythm than the shipbuilding theoretical plans. Like a 30-year plan comes out, I don't know, every couple of years. But the contracts, we have ships right now that are under contract to deliver -- I mean, Dory Miller delivers in 2032. So what is that, like 4 30-year plans between now and then? So we look at those plans, not so much as the precision of the plan, but more about what's the intent of the plan.
And what we're seeing in the intent of the plan, you've acknowledged that they move around a little bit, but what we see in those movements is maybe wants to move to a Navy that has many ships faster ships, maybe smaller ships, cheaper ships. So our investments are aimed in that direction. Now that doesn't mean they're not going to build aircraft carriers or submarines because I think they are, but they're going to want to build aircraft carriers more efficiently. They're going to want to build submarines more efficiently. They may want to build more submarines more efficiently.
When it comes to the nonnuclear ships, amphibs destroyers, frigates, Those kinds of platforms go -- they either go through class change or block changes. And our challenge is to be agile enough to respond to the customers' requirements and do that as effectively and efficiently as we can.
So the investments we make in our facilities are designed to be able to do that. They're multipurpose, multiproduct kinds of investments. We'll do a capital investment at Ingalls that will apply to 4 classes of ships. We'll do capital investments at Newport News that you can use for carriers or submarines. And so that's kind of the way we think about that as opposed to we need to go make a big investment for pick your program that 3 years from now may evaporate. We don't do that. So that's kind of the way we sized and thought about this generational investment we made over the past 5 years or so, a couple of billion dollars in our shipyards. We think that positions us very, very well for the direction that the -- that we think the Navy is going to end up going. And we'll probably have lots of discussion about whether it's 1 more submarine or 1 less destroyer, and all that sort of thing, but it means our investments were still the right thing to do."

I think that If there's an expansion of a product line, say -- and there has been some discussion about what's the industry's ability to support expansion of, say, the submarine product line, we certainly want to be able to take full advantage of that.
In the same way, if the Navy wants to expand in the frigate space, we want to be able to assist that if we need to be able to go and do that. And then I think it's engagement on the planning and design piece for. So what happens in the -- to the future of amphibs, probably that's mid- to long term, probably not near to midterm. And what happens with the carrier is are there going to be the CVN 82 going to have some design for affordability put to it and are we going to engage in that? I mean, frankly, CVN 82 is a shift that starts to show up here. I mean it's -- you go to contract in '27 or '28. So making sure that, that stays on track. That's kind of the way we think about it in shipbuilding.
In the Technical Solutions space, we've made a big investment in unmanned and expansion of the unmanned business, I think, is something that now that we've made that investment and we have the portfolio, it's up to us to make sure that we capture that expansion. Of all the budget items that I see out there, the unmanned budget item is probably going to have the largest percentage growth over the next 5 years, in my view.
We've established our -- as Chris kind of alluded to a minute ago, we've established our position as a Department of Energy Prime, and there's a lot of work over there that needs to be done And we are pursuing all of that very aggressively. We think that's a really great spot for us to be in, takes advantage of capability that we have in our shipbuilding business, but it gives access to another customer, and we've done very well with that, and we look to continue to expand that.
And then ISR space where we've really actually done well, and we expect to do well going forward. So we kind of look at that. It's kind of a capability dependent based on what our customers' needs for capability are, but that's kind of how we think about it. Where do we think our customers are going to want to be in 3 to 5 years? And how do we make sure we get there and help them get there?"

We still have EPA indices and pricing bands with the customer that we share in both the potential underrun on the overrun in that.

Chris alluded to my ancient history of being a program manager. I was actually a program manager for [indiscernible] and Truman, which was the last time we built 2 ships at the same time. I can tell you that the second ship absolutely benefits from the first ship in that -- in the way that the teams move from 1 platform to the next. The learning curves are there. It's kind of hard to think about learning curves on ships that deliver 4 or 5 years apart, but they actually -- it's real. And as you get to the second ship, you have well-trained crews who have been through this, who are working through it, who are capturing the lessons that are carrying lessons learned with them into that platform.
Then the trick will be how do you take what we've learned at 81 and make sure that you do that with 82. And what that means is 82 has got to be on time. If you delay 82 and we've -- and I've seen this over my whole career, you start spreading these things back out, you start breaking those learning curves. So what 80, 81 means is that you're going to get great efficiency there. I think they may be advertised $4 billion of efficiency across the enterprise, which that's pretty significant. If you spread that out and you delay 82 and you push it out, you're going to start to cut into that efficiency pretty dramatically. That's what happened after Stennis and Truman with 74 and 75 really came together very nicely, then we kind of pushed 76 out to the right a little bit. And then we pushed 77 out to the right a little bit. And then we pushed 78 out to the right a little bit. And so all of that, we're trying to capture that back. And I would -- no surprise, I would argue that the next carrier contract should also be a 2-shift buy, 82 and 83. So -- but that's just me."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. I trust that everyone is staying healthy and safe. 
Now let me share some highlights from the quarter, starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. Sales of $2.3 billion for the quarter were slightly higher than 2020. Diluted EPS was $3.68 for the quarter and pension adjusted EPS was $3.56, up from $2.43 in 2020. 
New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $5.3 billion, resulting in a record backlog of approximately $49 billion, of which approximately $25 billion is funded. Chris will provide some color on a few of the key awards for the quarter during his remarks. 
Shifting to activities in Washington. We were pleased that the recently released summary of the fiscal year 2022 President's budget request affirm that maintaining U.S. naval power is critical to reassuring allies and signaling U.S. resolved to potential adversaries. Of note, the budget summary cited continued recapitalization of the nation's strategic ballistic missile submarine fleet, investment in remotely operated and autonomous systems and funding for the next-generation attack submarine program. And we look forward to understanding budget details for these and other national security priorities when that information becomes available as well as funding levels requested for the Department of Energy and the Department of Homeland Security. We also look forward to working closely with the Congress as the FY '22 President's budget request is considered during the current legislative cycle. 
Regarding portfolio shaping actions during the quarter, we completed the previously announced sale of our oil and gas business and also completed the contribution of the San Diego Shipyard to Titan Acquisition Holdings in exchange for a noncontrolling interest in this leading provider of ship repair and fleet sustainment services. Completion of these transactions sharpens the focus of our Technical Solutions business into areas where we believe our unique capabilities and close customer relationships will drive strong organic revenue growth and margin expansion. 
And as I prepare to close, I'm very pleased with the operating rhythm the team is achieving, which led to the third consecutive quarter of solid program execution and financial results. And I am very confident that our strength, agility and positive momentum resulting from enduring the impacts of COVID-19 will serve as key catalyst to help us leverage our historic backlog, to generate strong free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, customers and employees. 
Now before I turn the call over to Chris, let me make a few comments about our recent leadership change. After serving as President of Ingalls since 2014 and with more than 40 years of service, Brian Cuccias retired on April 1. Brian's career at Ingalls has been remarkable, and HII has truly benefited from his leadership. Effective April 1, Kari Wilkinson succeeded Brian as the new President of Ingalls and will report to Chris. Kari has proven herself to be a strategic and visionary leader that is focused on operational excellence, and I am extremely confident that Ingalls is in very capable hands. 
And now I will turn the call over to Chris for some remarks on the operations. Chris?"

Operationally, we had a solid quarter, making consistent progress across our shipbuilding and Technical Solutions programs. 
With that, let me share a few key contract awards and programmatic highlights from the business segments for the quarter. At Ingalls, the team was awarded a life-cycle engineering and support services contract for the LPD program with a cumulative value of approximately $214 million. The scope of work includes engineering change management, supply chain management, training for new shipboard systems and the execution of post-delivery availabilities. 
Regarding program status, LHA 8 Bougainville achieved a 25% complete milestone during the quarter, and the team remains focused on maintaining strong cost and schedule performance in support of their planned production milestones. 
On the DDG program, the team remains focused on preparations for launch of DDG 125 Jack H. Lucas and sea trials for DDG 121 Frank E. Peterson, Jr., both planned for the second half of this year. And on the LPD program, LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale remains on track to complete sea trials later this year. And LPD 29, Richard M. McCool, Jr., remains on schedule for launch early next year. 
The team at Ingalls is also working closely with the Navy to put LPD 32 and 33, along with LHA 9 under contract. This bundle acquisition approach is the most affordable method to buy these ships. And when complete, affords predictable savings for the Navy. 
At Newport News, the team was awarded a $3 billion contract for the refueling and complex overhaul of CVN 74 USS John C. Stennis, and also received a contract modification for construction of the 10th Virginia-class Block V submarine. These key awards are additional building blocks for a record backlog, which now stands at nearly $49 billion. 
Shifting to program status, CVN 79 Kennedy is approximately 81% complete. The team is finalizing plans to support the single phase delivery requirements while continuing to focus on compartment completion and key initial test milestones. CVN 73 USS George Washington is approximately 87% complete and continues to make progress with the crew recently beginning to move back aboard the ship. This is another key milestone is supported redelivery to the Navy planned for next year. 
On the VCS program, SSN 794 Montana continues test program activities in preparation for delivery to the Navy planned for later this year. In addition, SSN 796 New Jersey remains on track to achieve the float off milestone as planned in the second half of this year. 
At Technical Solutions, the team booked several key awards during the quarter. This included a $175 million fleet to statement recompete and a position on a Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific, ISR and cybersecurity IDIQ contract. Additionally, production of the first Orca XLUUV modules is now underway at our unmanned systems center of excellence. Approximately 75% of all structural components have been fabricated, and assembly has commenced with final unit delivery to Boeing plan later this year. 
And finally, our Nuclear and Environmental Services business continues to perform very well with strong performance across our Department of Energy contracts at Los Alamos, Nevada and Savannah River. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on the financials. Tom?"

Today, I will briefly review our first quarter results. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated results",940,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I will briefly review our first quarter results. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. 
Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 4 of the presentation, our first quarter revenues of $2.3 billion increased less than 1% compared to the same period last year. This was primarily due to growth at Newport News and Ingalls that was largely offset by a decline of Technical Solutions due to divestitures associated with the portfolio-shaping actions we have taken.
Segment operating income for the quarter of $191 million increased $35 million from the first quarter of 2020 and segment operating margin, 8.4%, increased 149 basis points. The improvement was driven by higher risk retirement at Ingalls and improved performance to Technical Solutions. 
Operating income for the quarter of $147 million decreased by $68 million from the first quarter of 2020 and operating margin of 6.5% decreased 35 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by a less favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment, partially offset by the stronger segment operating results compared to the prior year.
The tax rate in the quarter was approximately 15% compared to approximately 20% in the first quarter of 2020. The decline in tax rate was primarily due to the divestiture of our oil and gas business as well as the recognition of R&D tax credits for the current year and prior periods. 
Net earnings in the quarter were $148 million compared to $172 million in the first quarter of 2020. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.68 compared to $4.23 in the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact of pension, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.56 compared to $2.43 in the first quarter of 2020.
Turning to Slide 5 of the presentation. Cash from operations was $43 million in the quarter and net capital expenditures were $59 million or 2.6% of revenues, resulting in free cash flow of negative $16 million. This compares to cash from operations of $68 million and net capital expenditures of $66 million and free cash flow of $2 million in the first quarter of 2020.
Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plan were $72 million in the quarter, of which $60 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans.
During the first quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or $46 million. As noted on our fourth quarter earnings call, we did reinitiate share repurchases earlier this year and continue to view the return of excess free cash flow via share repurchases as an integral part of our capital allocation strategy over the long term. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 292,000 shares at a cost of approximately $50 million.
Moving on to pension. With the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, we have reviewed the 5-year pension outlook that we provided on our last earnings call and continue to believe that remains the most appropriate view. Due to the limited nature of our projected contributions and the impact of lower cash sensitivity with safe harbor implementation, the passage of the legislation does not have a meaningful impact on our outlook. We plan to provide an update to near-term pension expectations on our Q3 call, consistent with our prior cadence.
Moving on to Slide 6 of the presentation. Ingalls revenues of $649 million in the quarter increased $20 million or 3.2% from the same period last year, driven primarily by higher revenues on the DDG program. Ingalls operating income of $91 million and margin of 14% in the quarter were up from the first quarter of 2020, mainly due to higher risk retirement on LHA, which was related to the 25% completion milestone that Chris mentioned earlier.
Turning to Slide 7 of the presentation. Newport News revenues of $1.4 billion in the quarter increased to $66 million or 4.9% from the same period last year due to higher revenues in both aircraft carrier and submarine construction as well as fleet support services. Newport News operating income of $93 million and margin 6.6% in the quarter were down slightly year-over-year, primarily due to lower risk retirement on CVN 73 RCOH, partially offset by higher risk retirement on VCS Block IV boats.
Now to Technical Solutions on Slide 8 of the presentation. Technical Solutions revenues of $259 million in the quarter decreased 18.3% from the same period last year, mainly due to the divestitures of both our oil and gas business in the San Diego shipyard on February 1 of this year, partially offset by a full quarter of results from Hydroid, which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of 2020.
Technical Solutions operating income of $7 million in the quarter compares to a loss in the first quarter of 2020. This was driven primarily by improved performance in Defense and Federal Solutions and Nuclear Environmental Services as well as a gain related to the sale of our oil and gas business.
Turning to Slide 9. We continue to expect we will finish the year with strict building operating margin in the 7% to 8% range with the significant remaining risk retirement events weighted towards the end of the year. In addition, we expect shipbuilding margin for the first half of 2021 to be around the midpoint of our annual guidance range.
We continue to view the remainder of our 2021 guidance as appropriate with the exception of the effective tax rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Dwayne for Q&A."

We've had a lot of stuff thrown at us in the last 12 months, and we took a pretty good body blow back a year ago with attendance relative to the pandemic. And the impact that had on our ability to retire risk, we recognize that in Q2.
But what came out of that was we've stabilized our employment levels. We've stabilized our scheduling. We've actually created the mechanisms in our risk registers so that we know where we are and where we're going and where we need to get. It helps a lot that we have this backlog that we're working off of. And where we are now is that when you come through a crisis like this as a leadership team, the connectivity, the tools that you've put in place, the innovation that has happened, you're taking advantage of all of that. And as you move forward, you start to look at what have we actually accomplished.
When we started at the beginning of the pandemic thinking that we needed to preserve the 25,000 people we had just hired over the last 5 years in our workforce, we've done that. We actually have hired between 5,000 and 6,000 people since the pandemic started. That's pretty creative and innovative, if you will. And that's the -- and we still have pretty robust hiring plans going forward.
Our case rates today are lower than they have been since last summer. That's inside of our yard. And the quarantine volume today is lower than it's been really since this began. We have actually administered vaccines to -- we've administered vaccines to about 1/3 of our workforce on top of where they're widely available to the rest of the employees who are getting them not through us. And so we're seeing a pretty steady rhythm now. Our folks are at work. They're engaged. We understand what needs to be done, and we're actually getting stuff done.
I think the change where we moved Chris over to be the Chief Operating Officer and really create more management bandwidth on how do we manage that risk going forward and how do we make sure that we're doing what we said we were going to do has really helped. And so I don't know, I guess I've been around it for a long time, but I feel really good about where we are right now in terms of doing what we said we're going to do."

So we have a site as far as the materials that we need. Additionally, when we put together proposals and the contracts that we bring home, we generally want to see those POs in place, the backstop by proposals and commitment shortly thereafter the award. So what we're seeing, and I've talked about yards just this week as a matter of fact on that point.
We're not seeing a tremendous amount of inflation across the purchases that we have, and we're not having a problem feeding the yards from a material perspective. We do see going forward as we're getting new quotes that the stand of the validity of the quotes is short. I think the subcontractors are staying light on their feet as far as what they're committing to. But relative to our contracts and our performance, we don't see an impact right now."

It's when we actually kind of kick around a lot is are we thinking about this the right way? I think at a macro kind of at the higher level, what we see is that the shipbuilding execution plan is on a much longer rhythm than the shipbuilding theoretical plans. Like a 30-year plan comes out, I don't know, every couple of years. But the contracts, we have ships right now that are under contract to deliver -- I mean, Doris Miller delivers in 2032. So what is that, like 4 30-year plans between now and then? So we look at those plans not so much as the precision of the plan, but more about what's the intent of the plan.
And what we're seeing in the intent of the plan, you've acknowledged that they move around a little bit, but what we see in those movements is maybe wants to move to a Navy that has many ships, faster ships, maybe smaller ships, cheaper ships. So our investments are aimed in that direction. Now that doesn't mean they're not going to build aircraft carriers or submarines because I think they are, but they're going to want to build aircraft carriers more efficiently. They're going to want to build submarines more efficiently. They may want to build more submarines more efficiently.
When it comes to the nonnuclear ships, amphibs destroyers, frigates, those kinds of platforms go -- they either go through class change or block changes. And our challenge is to be agile enough to respond to the customers' requirements and do that as effectively and efficiently as we can. So the investments we make in our facilities are designed to be able to do that. They're multipurpose, multiproduct kinds of investments. We'll do a capital investment at Ingalls that will apply to 4 classes of ships. We'll do capital investments at Newport News that you can use for carriers or submarines. 
And so that's kind of the way we think about that as opposed to we need to go make a big investment for pick your program that 3 years from now may evaporate. We don't do that. So that's kind of the way we sized and thought about this generational investment we made over the past 5 years or so, a couple of billion dollars in our shipyards. We think that positions us very, very well for the direction that the -- that we think the Navy is going to end up going. And we'll probably have lots of discussion about whether it's one more submarine or one less destroyer, and all that sort of thing, but it means our investments were still the right thing to do."

Most of the shipyards in this country build a product. Our shipyards build classes -- several classes. We build 4 classes of ships at Ingalls. We build carriers and submarines at Newport News and refueling and all that sort of things. So we do multiple classes of ships in our shipyard.

I think that if there's an expansion of a product line, say -- and there has been some discussion about what's the industry's ability to support expansion of, say, the submarine product line, we certainly want to be able to take full advantage of that.
In the same way, if the Navy wants to expand in the frigate space, we want to be able to assist that if we need to be able to go and do that. And then I think it's the engagement on the planning and design piece for. So what happens in -- to the future of amphibs? Probably that's mid- to long term, probably not near to mid-term. And what happens with the carrier? Is -- are there going to be -- the CVN 82 going to have some design for affordability put to it and are we going to engage in that? I mean, frankly, CVN 82 is a ship that starts to show up here. I mean, it's -- you go to contract in '27 or '28. So making sure that, that stays on track. That's kind of the way we think about it in shipbuilding.
In the Technical Solutions space, we've made a big investment in unmanned. And expansion of the unmanned business, I think, is something that now that we've made that investment and we have the portfolio, it's up to us to make sure that we capture that expansion. Of all the budget items that I see out there, the unmanned budget item is probably going to have the largest percentage growth over the next 5 years, in my view.
We've established our -- as Chris kind of alluded to a minute ago, we've established our position as a Department of Energy prime, and there's a lot of work over there that needs to be done. And we are pursuing all of that very aggressively. We think that's a really great spot for us to be in. It takes advantage of capability that we have in our shipbuilding business, but it gives access to another customer. And we've done very well with that, and we look to continue to expand that.
And then ISR space, where we've really actually done well and we expect to do well going forward. So we kind of look at that. It's kind of a capability-dependent based on what our customers' needs for capability are, but that's kind of how we think about it. Where do we think our customers are going to want to be in 3 to 5 years? And how do we make sure we get there and help them get there?"

One of the first things I learned at the Academy 40 years ago was that there's countermeasures, and then there's counter-countermeasures, and there's counter-counter-countermeasures. And what happens is the technology races ahead at a speed that's a lot different than the build cycle of a ship. And so the question is what kind of platform are you going to need to work the technology? If you look at the Type 3 destroyer and you look at what they're trying to do with it, that ship is pretty full. 
And so is there a -- if the technology is going to require that kind of space and weight, then it probably needs something different to carry it forward. How we get there as an industry to design that and create the platform that has the margin, if you will, for future technological upgrades? I think the Navy is -- and the industry are having a pretty robust discussion about that right now. And I'm not sure I'm ready to handicap how it's going to turn out."

But on the whole, material is being flown into the yard at the expected times and expectation of costs that the contracts are centered around. So I hope that hit the S&C question."

Chris alluded to my ancient history of being a program manager. I was actually a program manager for the Stennis and Truman, which was the last time we built 2 ships at the same time. I can tell you that the second ship absolutely benefits from the first ship in that -- in the way that the teams move from one platform to the next. The learning curves are there. It's kind of hard to think about learning curves on ships that deliver 4 or 5 years apart, but they actually -- it's real. And as you get to the second ship, you have well-trained crews who have been through this, who are working through it, who are capturing lessons that are carrying lessons learned with them into that platform.
Then the trick will be how do you take what we've learned at 81 and make sure that you do that with 82. And what that means is 82 has got to be on time. If you delay 82, and we've -- and I've seen this over my whole career, you start spreading these things back out. You start breaking those learning curves. So what 80, 81 means is that you're going to get great efficiency there. I think they may be advertised $4 billion of efficiency across the enterprise, which that's pretty significant. If you spread that out and you delay 82 and you push it out, you're going to start to cut into that efficiency pretty dramatically. That's what happened after Stennis and Truman, with 74 and 75 really came together very nicely. Then we kind of pushed 76 out to the right a little bit. And then we pushed 77 out to the right a little bit. And then we pushed 78 out to the right a little bit. And so all of that, we're trying to capture that back. And I would -- no surprise, I would argue that the next carrier contract should also be a 2-ship buy, 82 and 83. So -- but that's just me."

This morning, we released strong second quarter 2021 financial results driven by another quarter of solid operational performance. So let me share some highlights from the quarter starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. 
Sales of $2.2 billion were up from $2.0 billion in the second quarter of 2020. Diluted EPS of $3.20 was up significantly from $1.30 in the second quarter of last year and pension adjusted EPS for the quarter was $3.05. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $1.2 billion, resulting in a backlog of approximately $48 billion, of which approximately $24 billion is funded. And Chris will provide some color on a few of the key awards for the quarter during his remarks. 
Shifting to activities in Washington, we are pleased that the congressional markup process for fiscal year 2022 has begun in earnest, following the release of the President's budget request in May. Of note, the budget requests continued recapitalization of the nation's strategic ballistic missile submarine fleet and supported funding for CVN-80 and CVN-81 forward class aircraft carriers, 2 Virginia-class submarines, 1 DDG 51 Orly Burke-class destroyer and LHA 9. We were also pleased that a second DDG 51 class destroyer was included as the #1 priority on the Navy's unfunded requirements list for fiscal year 2022, and we look forward to working closely with the Congress during the FY '22 markup process to urge support for the second DDG and other critical priorities, including the efficient production of amphibious warships. 
In closing, Slide 4 provides some key takeaways from the recently announced agreement to acquire Alion Science and Technology. The team is preparing for closing of the transaction, and we are very excited about the addition of Alion to the HII family. Alion is a perfect complement to our existing capabilities in the technology-driven defense and federal solutions space. The solutions and products they provide are directly in line with the strategic focus that we have articulated for our Technical Solutions business and it enhances our technical capabilities and customer access in high-growth national security markets, including C5ISR, military training and simulation and next-generation technologies and solutions. We firmly believe that Alion offers significant growth potential and represents an investment in capabilities that support the evolving DoD national security requirements, which, in turn, are expected to generate significant long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. 
Now I will turn the call over to Chris for some remarks on the operations. Chris?"

This was another solid operational quarter, and I'm very pleased with the consistent progress being achieved across our shipbuilding and technical solutions programs. With that, let me share a few key contract awards and programmatic highlights from the business segments for the quarter. 
At Ingalls, the team received a contract modification from the U.S. Navy for $107 million to provide additional long-lead time material and advanced procurement activities for amphibious to sold ship LHA 9, which increases current funding on this ship to approximately $490 million. Regarding the potential bundled acquisition of LHA 9 with LPD 32 and 33, discussions are ongoing with the customer. We believe that a bundled acquisition continues to be the most cost-effective method, a procurement of these critically important ships. 
In addition, Ingalls was awarded a contract with a potential total value of $724 million over 7 years for planning yard services in support of a variety of in-service amphibious class ships, including the LPD 17 San Antonio class and LHA 6 America class. Shifting to program status, LHA 8 Bougainville is making steady progress to the structural erection and initial outfitting phases of construction with cost and schedule performance in line with our expectations. 
On the DDG program, the team successfully launched the first Flight III hourly bird class guided missile destroyer, DDG 125, Jack H Lucas in June. And DDG 121, Frankie Peterson Jr. is expected to conduct sea trials later this year. On the LPD program, LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale is on track to conduct sea trials during the fourth quarter and LPD 29 Richard M. McCool Jr. continues to achieve production milestones in support of launch early next year. 
At Newport News, there were no significant contract awards to highlight for the quarter, so I will go right on to program status. CVN-79 Kennedy is approximately 83% complete, and the team remains focused on compartment completion and key propulsion plant milestones. CVN 73 USS George Washington is approximately 90% complete, and the team remains focused on achieving key test program milestones to support redelivery to the Navy, which is planned for next year. On the DCS program, the team completed shipment of the final module of SSN 797 Iowa during the quarter. In addition, SSN 794 Montana remains on track for delivery to the Navy later this year, and SSN 796 New Jersey remains on track to achieve the float-off milestones as planned in the second half of this year. 
And finally, on the submarine fleet support program, SSN 725 Helena is on track for redelivery to the Navy later this year. At Technical Solutions, contract awards of REMUS 300 unmanned underwater vehicles during the quarter to the U.S. Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy affirmed the flexibility and modularity of these units. [indiscernible] was also recently awarded a $273 million cost plus fixed fee indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract to support maintenance and planning for the overhaul and repair of equipment and systems associated with the Navy aircraft carriers and West Coast Navy surface ships. 
In addition, TS was awarded a contract with a 1-year base period and 4 1-year options with a total potential value of $346 million to provide a variety of aircraft and operational support services for US [indiscernible], included planning, management, maintenance, logistics and airlift airdrop services and emergency medical care. Execution within Technical Solutions remains consistent with expectations except for delays in awards in our unmanned business for critical new programs, which we expect to be resolved by the end of the year. 
As I close, note that we have included upcoming key program milestones on Slide 5. There are no changes from what we have previously provided other than designated those milestones that have been completed with the checkmark. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Tom for his remarks on the financials. Tom?"

Today, I'll briefly review our second quarter results. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated results on",898,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I'll briefly review our second quarter results. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 6 of the presentation, our second quarter revenues of $2.2 billion increased approximately 10% compared to the same period last year. This was primarily due to the growth of Newport News and Ingalls and was partially offset by a decline at Technical Solutions due to the portfolio shaping actions we have taken. 
Segment operating income for the quarter of $169 million increased $174 million compared to the second quarter of 2020 and segment operating margin of 7.6% compared to a segment operating margin of negative 0.2% of the second quarter of 2020. The prior year results were negatively impacted by the Virginia-class submarine program performance as well as impacts related to COVID-19. Operating income for the quarter of $128 million increased by $71 million from the second quarter of 2020 and operating margin of 5.7% increased 293 basis points. These increases were primarily driven by the segments I just mentioned, partially offset by a less favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment. 
The tax rate in the quarter was approximately 19.9% compared to 18.5% in the second quarter of 2020. The increase in the tax rate was primarily due to adjustments related to research and development tax credits recorded in the second quarter of 2020. Net earnings in the quarter were $129 million compared to $53 million in the second quarter of 2020. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.20 compared to $1.30 in the second quarter of 2020. Excluding the impacts of pension, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.05 compared to a loss of $0.49 per share in the second quarter of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 7 of the presentation. Cash from operations was $96 million in the quarter, and net capital expenditures were $73 million or 3.3% of revenues resulting in free cash flow of $23 million. This compares to cash from operations of $201 million and $75 million of net capital expenditures or free cash flow of $126 million in the second quarter of 2020. Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were $12 million in the quarter, principally related to postretirement benefits. During the second quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or $46 million and repurchased approximately 95,000 shares at a cost of $20 million. 
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. Ingalls revenues in the quarter of $670 million increased $48 million or 7.7% from the same period last year, driven primarily by higher revenues on the DDG program and amphibious assault ships partially offset by lower revenues on the net program. Angel's operating income of $80 million and margin of 11.9% in the quarter were up from the second quarter of 2020, driven by the recognition of a capital investment related incentive for the DDG program that was recognized in DDG-125 as well as higher risk retirement on the LHA 8, LP 28 and LP 29 ships. 
Turning to Slide 9 of the presentation. Newport News revenues of $1.4 billion in the quarter increased $241 million or 21.5% from the same period last year due to higher revenues in both the submarine and aircraft carry construction. Newport News operating income of $76 million and margin of 5.6% in the quarter were up year-over-year, primarily due to the impacts related to the Virginia class performance and COVID in the prior year period. 
Now to Technical Solutions on Slide 10. Technical Solutions revenues of $237 million in the quarter decreased 25.9% from the same period last year mainly due to the divestiture of the oil and gas business and the contribution of the San Diego shipyard to a joint venture in the first quarter of this year as well as lower volumes in unmanned systems, partially offset by increases in volumes in the Defense and Federal Solutions. Technical Solutions operating income of $13 million in the quarter compares to income of $9 million in the second quarter of 2020. This increase was primarily driven by higher equity income related to our ship repair partnership at Titan as well as improved performance at Defense and Federal Solutions and Nuclear Environmental Services, partially offset by lower volumes in the unmanned systems. 
Finally, a perspective on the outlook of the shipbuilding for the remaining part of the year. We continue to see limited opportunities for risk retirements in the third quarter with the remainder of the milestones weighted towards the end of the year. Given the strong performance in the first half of the year, we now expect that the shipbuilding margin for the full year will be in the 7.5% to 8% range. We continue to expect the Alion acquisition will close in the coming weeks and that we will incur approximately $25 million of onetime pretax transaction and financing-related expenses in 2021. We completed the syndication of the term loan component of the acquisition funding earlier this week, and more details of the specifics are available in the 10-Q. We will provide a more comprehensive update on our 2021 outlook for Technical Solutions on our third quarter call following the closing of the acquisition.

On the Ingalls award, it's a long term services type contract. Obviously, as the claims and the years get funded in the out years, we'll see that revenue mature down there. The services contract they have is the oversight and the services aspect of the LPD LHA program. So that was anticipated as far as our revenue projections that we had to be there. It's not a large portion of the Ingalls portfolio as you see it today. There are potentials going forward, depending on how the landscape plays out, both from a construction and future services and our type work to play out. We'll have to see how that goes forward. 
From a Newport News perspective, as you mentioned, we took on the overall right now. So those were anticipated in our plans also. That was an overflow from where the Navy was I think medium to long term, we'd like to see ourselves get into a cadence of getting an overhaul on the sub side going forward. And as we work with our Navy partner and what that kind of looks like, we'll provide additional guidance on that front."

So I guess the first part is kind of given this list for the second half, why wouldn't we expect a stronger shipbuilding margin than we saw in first half? 
And then second, I guess when we look at 2022 and we see sort of fewer milestones for for Newport News, how do we think about what that means for profitability there?

I think between the onetime events and the incentives that we talked about, we'll see that come down. So I wouldn't really read that because we're giving you a 7.5% to 8% that's somehow the margins are dropping up from a performance or operational standpoint at Ingalls. It's just that we won't see those onetime events in Q3 and Q4. 
From the question on the Newport News perspective, right now, if you look at it, they have a lot of new ships in their portfolio, right? So 80, 81 is coming online. There's CD74 that just popped in here. And nearing the end from a revenue perspective and they have less weight on the portfolio there. So it's the mix of the ships that are in at Newport News.

So if the government wants to move ahead with a higher rate of submarine production in a sustained way, not just doing it once in a while, but in some sort of sustained way, they want to go to 3 submarines a year or 3 Virginia class here or 2 Virginia class and Columbia a year, and they're going to sustain that for a period of time, we can absolutely have the workforce and the physical plant and the supply chain set up to go execute that. 
If you said that it's a light switch and starting in the FY '22 budget, we're going to expand to buy from 2 to 4, well, we probably have some startup things there.

This morning, we released strong second quarter 2021 financial results driven by another quarter of solid operational performance. So let me share some highlights from the quarter starting on Slide 3 of the presentation.  
Sales of $2.2 billion were up from $2.0 billion in the second quarter of 2020. Diluted EPS of $3.20 was up significantly from $1.30 in the second quarter of last year and pension adjusted EPS for the quarter was $3.05. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $1.2 billion, resulting in a backlog of approximately $48 billion, of which approximately $24 billion is funded. And Chris will provide some color on a few of the key awards for the quarter during his remarks.  
Shifting to activities in Washington, we are pleased that the congressional markup process for fiscal year 2022 has begun in earnest, following the release of the President's budget request in May. Of note, the budget requests continued recapitalization of the nation's strategic ballistic missile submarine fleet and supported funding for CVN 80 and CVN 81 forward class aircraft carriers, 2 Virginia-class submarines, 1 DDG 51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyer and LHA 9. We were also pleased that a second DDG 51 class destroyer was included as the #1 priority on the Navy's unfunded requirements list for fiscal year 2022, and we look forward to working closely with the Congress during the FY '22 markup process to urge support for the second DDG and other critical priorities, including the efficient production of amphibious warships.  
In closing, Slide 4 provides some key takeaways from the recently announced agreement to acquire Alion Science and Technology. The team is preparing for closing of the transaction, and we are very excited about the addition of Alion to the HII family. Alion is a perfect complement to our existing capabilities in the technology-driven defense and federal solutions space. The solutions and products they provide are directly in line with the strategic focus that we have articulated for our Technical Solutions business and it enhances our technical capabilities and customer access in high-growth national security markets, including C5ISR, military training and simulation and next-generation technologies and solutions. We firmly believe that Alion offers significant growth potential and represents an investment in capabilities that support the evolving DoD national security requirements, which, in turn, are expected to generate significant long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees.  
Now I will turn the call over to Chris for some remarks on the operations. Chris?"

This was another solid operational quarter, and I'm very pleased with the consistent progress being achieved across our shipbuilding and technical solutions programs. With that, let me share a few key contract awards and programmatic highlights from the business segments for the quarter.  
At Ingalls, the team received a contract modification from the U.S. Navy for $107 million to provide additional long-lead time material and advanced procurement activities for amphibious assault ship LHA 9, which increases current funding on this ship to approximately $490 million. Regarding the potential bundled acquisition of LHA 9 with LPD 32 and 33, discussions are ongoing with the customer. We believe that a bundled acquisition continues to be the most cost-effective method, a procurement of these critically important ships.  
In addition, Ingalls was awarded a contract with a potential total value of $724 million over 7 years for planning yard services in support of a variety of in-service amphibious class ships, including the LPD 17 San Antonio class and LHA 6 America class. Shifting to program status, LHA 8 Bougainville is making steady progress through the structural erection and initial outfitting phases of construction with cost and schedule performance in line with our expectations.  
On the DDG program, the team successfully launched the first Flight III Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer, DDG 125, Jack H Lucas in June. And DDG 121, Frankie Peterson Jr. is expected to conduct sea trials later this year. On the LPD program, LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale is on track to conduct sea trials during the fourth quarter and LPD 29 Richard M. McCool Jr. continues to achieve production milestones in support of launch early next year.  
At Newport News, there were no significant contract awards to highlight for the quarter, so I will go right on to program status. CVN-79 Kennedy is approximately 83% complete, and the team remains focused on compartment completion and key propulsion plant milestones. CVN 73 USS George Washington is approximately 90% complete, and the team remains focused on achieving key test program milestones to support redelivery to the Navy, which is planned for next year. On the DCS program, the team completed shipment of the final module of SSN 797 Iowa during the quarter. In addition, SSN 794 Montana remains on track for delivery to the Navy later this year, and SSN 796 New Jersey remains on track to achieve the float-off milestones as planned in the second half of this year.  
And finally, on the submarine fleet support program, SSN 725 Helena is on track for redelivery to the Navy later this year. At Technical Solutions, contract awards of REMUS 300 unmanned underwater vehicles during the quarter to the U.S. Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy affirmed the flexibility and modularity of these units. TS was also recently awarded a $273 million cost plus fixed fee indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract to support maintenance and planning for the overhaul and repair of equipment and systems associated with the Navy aircraft carriers and West Coast Navy surface ships.  
In addition, TS was awarded a contract with a 1-year base period and 4 1-year options with a total potential value of $346 million to provide a variety of aircraft and operational support services for USAFRICOM, included planning, management, maintenance, logistics and airlift airdrop services and emergency medical care. Execution within Technical Solutions remains consistent with expectations except for delays in awards in our unmanned business for critical new programs, which we expect to be resolved by the end of the year.  
As I close, note that we have included upcoming key program milestones on Slide 5. There are no changes from what we have previously provided other than designated those milestones that have been completed with the checkmark.  
Now I'll turn the call back over to Tom for his remarks on the financials. Tom?"
363263,1673363544,2364666,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I'll briefly review our second quarter results. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated results on",897,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I'll briefly review our second quarter results. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 6 of the presentation, our second quarter revenues of $2.2 billion increased approximately 10% compared to the same period last year. This was primarily due to the growth of Newport News and Ingalls and was partially offset by a decline at Technical Solutions due to the portfolio shaping actions we have taken.  
Segment operating income for the quarter of $169 million increased $174 million compared to the second quarter of 2020 and segment operating margin of 7.6% compared to a segment operating margin of negative 0.2% of the second quarter of 2020. The prior year results were negatively impacted by the Virginia-class submarine program performance as well as impacts related to COVID-19. Operating income for the quarter of $128 million increased by $71 million from the second quarter of 2020 and operating margin of 5.7% increased 293 basis points. These increases were primarily driven by the segments I just mentioned, partially offset by a less favorable operating FAS/CAS Adjustment.  
The tax rate in the quarter was approximately 19.9% compared to 18.5% in the second quarter of 2020. The increase in the tax rate was primarily due to adjustments related to research and development tax credits recorded in the second quarter of 2020. Net earnings in the quarter were $129 million compared to $53 million in the second quarter of 2020. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.20 compared to $1.30 in the second quarter of 2020. Excluding the impacts of pension, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.05 compared to a loss of $0.49 per share in the second quarter of 2020.  
Turning to Slide 7 of the presentation. Cash from operations was $96 million in the quarter, and net capital expenditures were $73 million or 3.3% of revenues resulting in free cash flow of $23 million. This compares to cash from operations of $201 million and $75 million of net capital expenditures or free cash flow of $126 million in the second quarter of 2020. Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were $12 million in the quarter, principally related to postretirement benefits. During the second quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or $46 million and repurchased approximately 95,000 shares at a cost of $20 million.  
Moving on to Slide 8 of the presentation. Ingalls revenues in the quarter of $670 million increased $48 million or 7.7% from the same period last year, driven primarily by higher revenues on the DDG program and amphibious assault ships partially offset by lower revenues on the NSC program. Ingalls operating income of $80 million and margin of 11.9% in the quarter were up from the second quarter of 2020, driven by the recognition of a capital investment related incentive for the DDG program that was recognized in DDG-125 as well as higher risk retirement from the LHA 8, LP 28 and LP 29 ships.  
Turning to Slide 9 of the presentation. Newport News revenues of $1.4 billion in the quarter increased $241 million or 21.5% from the same period last year due to higher revenues in both the submarine and aircraft carry construction. Newport News operating income of $76 million and margin of 5.6% in the quarter were up year-over-year, primarily due to the impacts related to the Virginia class performance and COVID in the prior year period.  
Now to Technical Solutions on Slide 10. Technical Solutions revenues of $237 million in the quarter decreased 25.9% from the same period last year mainly due to the divestiture of the oil and gas business and the contribution of the San Diego shipyard through a joint venture in the first quarter of this year as well as lower volumes in unmanned systems, partially offset by increases in volumes in the Defense and Federal Solutions. Technical Solutions operating income of $13 million in the quarter compares to income of $9 million in the second quarter of 2020. This increase was primarily driven by higher equity income related to our ship repair partnership with Titan as well as improved performance at Defense and Federal Solutions and Nuclear Environmental Services, partially offset by lower volumes in the unmanned systems.  
Finally, a perspective on the outlook of the shipbuilding for the remaining part of the year. We continue to see limited opportunities for risk retirements in the third quarter with the remainder of the milestones weighted towards the end of the year. Given the strong performance in the first half of the year, we now expect that the shipbuilding margin for the full year will be in the 7.5% to 8% range. We continue to expect the Alion acquisition will close in the coming weeks and that we will incur approximately $25 million of onetime pretax transaction and financing-related expenses in 2021. We completed the syndication of the term loan component of the acquisition funding earlier this week, and more details of the specifics are available in the 10-Q. We will provide a more comprehensive update on our 2021 outlook for Technical Solutions on our third quarter call following the closing of the acquisition.

I tell you, on the back half of the year, with COVID understood right now, the labor force is stable, the contracts that we have in place right now, the run rate that we see is going to play out pretty consistent to the back half of the year.

The services contract they have is the oversight and the services aspect for the LPD LHA program. So that was anticipated as far as our revenue projections that we had to be there. It's not a large portion of the Ingalls portfolio as you see it today. There are potentials going forward, depending on how the landscape plays out, both from a construction and future services and our type work to play out. We'll have to see how that goes forward. 
From a Newport News perspective, as you mentioned, we took on the LHA overhaul right now. So those were anticipated in our plans also. That was an overflow right from where the Navy was, I think medium to long term, we'd like to see ourselves get into a cadence of getting an overhaul on the sub side going forward. And as we work with our Navy partner and what that kind of looks like, we'll provide additional guidance on that front."

So it's a foundational piece of predictability from a cost structure, a rate structure perspective.

I've been asked at Ingalls to keep this up at 14% and now 11.9%, and I keep providing the guidance down that that's not a run rate that's sustainable. I think between the onetime events and the incentives that we talked about, we'll see that come down. So I wouldn't really read that because we're giving you a 7.5% to 8% that's somehow the margins are dropping up from a performance or operational standpoint at Ingalls. It's just that we won't see those onetime events in Q3 and Q4. 
From the question on the Newport News perspective, right now, if you look at it, they have a lot of new ships in their portfolio, right? So 80, 81 is coming online. There's CD74 that just popped in here. And CVN 73 is nearing the end from a revenue perspective and they have less weight on the portfolio there. So it's the mix of the ships that are in at Newport News.

The answer is no. We don't have enough people in the plant today to do that. The fact is that we've -- since COVID began last March, we hired 6,000 people and trained them. And I will be forever remembered for saying that we can build capacity in the industry faster than the government can appropriate funding for it. So if the government wants to move ahead with a higher rate of submarine production in a sustained way, not just doing it once in a while, but in some sort of sustained way, they want to go to 3 submarines a year or 3 Virginia class here or 2 Virginia class and a Columbia a year, and they're going to sustain that for a period of time, we can absolutely have the workforce and the physical plant and the supply chain set up to go execute that. 
If you said that it's a light switch and starting in the FY '22 budget, we're going to expand to buy from 2 to 4, well, we probably have some startup things there. But we don't believe that's the way that's going to go. We believe that this is going to be the concept that the history of it. And so I think -- I guess my own experience is that when you hear budget people talking about lack of capacity, what they really mean is that they don't have funding. And that's kind of the way the industry looks at it. So I think we can expand capacity if that's the plan, if there is sustained demand."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. This morning, we released third quarter 2021 financial results that included another quarter of consistent shipbuilding program execution. 
Let me share some highlights from the quarter starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. Sales of $2.3 billion were up 1% from the third quarter of 2020. And diluted EPS was $3.65, down from $5.45 in the third quarter of 2020. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $600 million, resulting in backlog of approximately $50 billion at the end of the quarter, of which approximately $24 billion is funded. 
Shifting to activities in Washington. The federal government -- the federal government began the new fiscal year under a continuing resolution, which funds government operations through December 3. Now we continue to urge Congress to proceed expeditiously and remain optimistic that the defense appropriations and authorization processes will be completed in the months ahead. As Bill's progressed through both chambers of Congress, we continue to see bipartisan support for our programs reflected in the defense appropriations and authorization bills in the House and the Senate. We are pleased that the 4 defense oversight committees have shown strong support for shipbuilding to include adding a second Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, which is a -- a top Navy priority for fiscal year 2022. The appropriations bills also include language in support of a DDG 51 follow-on multiyear procurement contract in FY '23. 
So as I prepare to close, let me give a quick update on COVID-19. We continue to work with our customers to satisfy the requirement for federal contractors to have their workforce vaccinated against COVID-19 by December 8, 2021. At HII, we remain committed to promoting and protecting the health and safety of our employees, their families and their communities and continuing to serve our customers and the vital national security interests of our country without disruption as an essential contributor to the nation's critical infrastructure. We view our workforce of approximately 44,000 employees as critical partners in this effort and continue to help our unvaccinated employees meet this requirement as safely and efficiently as possible. We will continue to evaluate how the vaccine mandate and delta variant impact our workforce as well as material availability from our supply chain and we expect to have more to share during the fourth quarter earnings call in February. 
And finally, let me recap what HII has done from a portfolio shaping perspective over the past 20 months. In short, we have done exactly what we said we would do during our February 2020 Investor Day. First, we have positioned the Technical Solutions business in growth markets that support the constantly evolving requirements of our customers. And second, we have demonstrated the financial flexibility to pursue these critical growth opportunities while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings and continuing to return capital to shareholders. Following the closing of the Alion transaction during the quarter, our team is laser focused on a successful integration in order to produce the financial returns we expect. We are also ensuring that our core shipbuilding programs are achieving key production milestones in order to generate strong free cash flow, which will enable deleveraging of the balance sheet while continuing to return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. We firmly believe that these are the appropriate steps to generate significant long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees.

LHA 8 Bougainville continues to achieve cost and schedule performance in line with our expectations while making steady progress through the structural erection and initial outfitting phases of construction. On the DDG program, the team successfully completed acceptance trials for guided missile destroyer DDG 121, Frank E. Petersen Jr. and expects to deliver the ship to the Navy by the end of this year. In addition, DDG's 123 and 125 remain on track to complete sea trials next year as planned. On the LPD program, LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale was christened in August. This shift remains on track to complete sea trials during the fourth quarter with delivery to the Navy planned in the first quarter of next year. At Newport News, CVN 79 Kennedy is approximately 84% complete and the focus remains on compartment completion and key initial propulsion plant milestones. 
Regarding definitization of the single-phase delivery contract modification, we have reached agreement on the cost and schedule impacts with the Navy and expect to execute the contract modification late this year or early next year. On the RCOH program, CVN 73 USS George Washington continues to achieve key propulsion plant milestones and is approximately 92% complete. In CVN 78, USS Gerald R. Ford returned to Newport News in August to begin a planned incremental availability following successful completion of full ship shock trials. On the VCS program, SSN 794 Montana remains on track for delivery to the Navy later this year. And the SSN 796 New Jersey float-off milestone has moved to early next year to ensure that we achieve the optimum build sequence from float off to delivery, planned in 2022. And finally, on the submarine fleet support program, SSN 725 Helena, remains on track for redelivery to the Navy later this year. At Technical Solutions, the Alion transaction closed in mid-August, and the team announced new business groups and executive appointments that directly align with the strategic focus that we have previously articulated. We expect this very talented team to execute a successful integration of Alion and deliver unparalleled national security solutions to our customers while growing the business and producing returns in line with our expectations. Delays in contract awards in our unmanned business for critical new programs remains a watch item. We're expecting this to be resolved by the end of the year, but it appears that these awards are not likely until early to mid-2022. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom for some remarks on the financials. Tom?"
363263,1684610523,2425361,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I will briefly review our third quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for 2021. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our websi",1410,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I will briefly review our third quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for 2021. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. 
Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 4 of the presentation, our third quarter revenues of $2.3 billion increased approximately 1% compared to the same period last year. This is due to growth at Technical Solutions driven by the Alion acquisition which was largely offset by a decline in revenue at Ingalls, primarily due to lower volumes on the NSC, DDG and LHA programs. Segment operating income for the quarter of $163 million increased [indiscernible] compared to the third quarter of 2020. And segment operating margin of 7% was in line with the results from the prior year period. Operating income for the quarter of $118 million decreased by $104 million from the third quarter of 2020, an operating margin of 5% decreased 455 basis points. These decreases were almost entirely due to a less favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment compared to the prior year period. The tax rate in the quarter was a negative 4.3% compared to 1.8% in the third quarter of 2020. The decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to additional research and development tax credits for tax years 2016 through 2020 recorded in the third quarter of 2021. Net earnings in the quarter were $147 million compared to $222 million in the third quarter of 2020. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.65 compared to $5.45 in the prior year period. Third quarter 2021 results include approximately $15 million of nonrecurring pretax transaction expenses related to the acquisition of Alion. Excluding the impacts of pension, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.58 compared to $3.73 per share in the third quarter of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 5. Cash from operations was $350 million in the quarter and net capital expenditures were $73 million or 3.1% of revenues, resulting in free cash flow of $277 million. This compares to cash from operations of $222 million and $62 million of net capital expenditures or free cash flow of $160 million in the prior year period. Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were $10 million in the quarter, principally related to postretirement benefits. During the third quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or $46 million. Our Board of Directors recently approved a 3.5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.18 per share, and this will take effect in the fourth quarter of this year. We also repurchased approximately 83,000 shares during the quarter at an aggregate cost of approximately $17 million. 
Moving on to Slide 6. Ingalls revenues in the quarter of $628 million decreased $47 million or 7% from the same period last year, driven primarily by lower revenues on the NSE, DDG and LHA programs. Ingalls operating income of $62 million and margin of 9.9% in the quarter compared to operating income of $62 million and margin of 9.2% in the third quarter of 2020. The operating margin improvement was driven by an incentive on the DDG program and higher risk retirement for the LPD program, partially offset by lower risk retirement on the NSE program. 
Turning to Slide 7. Newport News revenues of approximately $1.4 billion in the quarter decreased $4 million or less than 1% from the same period last year, driven by lower revenues in Naval Nuclear support services partially offset by higher revenues in submarines and aircraft carriers. [ Naval Nuclear support services revenues decreased primarily as a result of lower volumes in submarine fleet support services and facility maintenance services partially offset by higher volumes in carrier fleet support services. Submarine revenues increased due to higher volumes in Block V boats of the Virginia Class Submarine program, and submarine support services and Columbia class submarine program, partially offset by lower volumes on Block IV of the Virginia-class submarine program. Aircraft carrier revenues increased primarily as a result of higher volumes on the RCOH of USS John C. Stennis CVN 74 and the construction of Doris Miller CVN 81 and enterprise CVN 80, partially offset by lower volumes on the RCOH of USS George Washington, CVN 73 and the construction of John F. Kennedy CVN 79. Newport News operating income of $88 million and margin of 6.5% in the quarter compares to operating income of $79 million and margin of 5.8% in the third quarter of 2020. The improvement was primarily due to higher risk retirement on the RCOH of the USS George Washington CVN 73 and Block 4 boats of the VCS program, partially offset by lower risk retirement on the naval nuclear support services. 
Now to Technical Solutions on Slide 8 of the presentation. Technical Solutions revenues of $394 million in the quarter increased 23% from the same period last year, mainly due to revenue attributable to the acquisition of Alion in mid-August, partially offset by the divestiture of our oil and gas business and contribution of the Santa Diego shipyard to a joint venture in the first quarter of this year. The acquisition of Alion closed on August 19, and third quarter results included approximately $163 million of revenue attributable to Alion. Technical Solutions operating income of $13 million and operating margin of 3.3% in the quarter compares to an operating income of $21 million and operating margin of 6.6% in the third quarter of 2020. These decreases were primarily driven by the inclusion of approximately $8 million of Alion related purchase intangible amortization as well as lower performance in San [indiscernible] solutions. The divestiture of our oil and gas business and the contribution of the San Diego shipyard to a joint venture I previously mentioned. Third quarter 2021 results include approximately $4 million of operating income attributable to Alion. Third quarter Technical Solutions EBITDA was approximately $30.3 million or an EBITDA margin of 7.7%. 
Moving on to Slide 9 of the presentation. We've updated our outlook for 2021 and 2022 pension and postretirement benefits. For 2022, FAS is now projected to be a benefit rather than an expense, primarily due to higher asset returns. Consequently, the fast cash adjustment has increased from the prior outlook and is now projected to total $52 million in 2022. Please remember that pension-related numbers are subject to year-end performance and measurement criteria. We will provide a multiyear update of pension estimates on our fourth quarter earnings call in February. 
Finally, on Slide 10, a perspective on the outlook for the remainder of the year for both shipbuilding and Technical Solutions inclusive of Alion. Regarding shipbuilding, we now expect 2021 revenue to be approximately $8.2 billion at the low end, but within our initial guidance range. Third quarter shipbuilding revenue was modestly impacted by material timing, which may persist in the near term. Additionally, we continue to navigate through a challenging labor market as well as the potential impact of COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Given all of that, we think it's best to be prudent and temper near-term expectations. We continue to expect that shipbuilding operating margin will finish the year in the 7.5% to 8% range. We expect that the fourth quarter shipbuilding operating margin will be roughly consistent with the third quarter results as we were able to recognize some key retirement events in the third quarter, including the completion of sea trials for DDG 121. Regarding Technical Solutions, I've noted that Alion acquisition closed in mid-August and our updated expectations for 2021 now include Alion from the date of acquisition, inclusive of incremental purchase intangible amortization that impacts our segment operating margin expectation. 
Turning to free cash flow. We now expect 2021 free cash flow to be between $300 million and $350 million as the repayment of the accelerated progress payments which was initially expected in 2021 has now moved out to 2022. Additionally, on Slide 10, we have provided an updated outlook for a number of other discrete items to assist with your modeling. Regarding our longer-term targets, we continue to believe that the 3% CAGR for shipbuilding revenue is appropriate. Additionally, we remain comfortable with our free cash flow target of $3.2 billion from 2020 through 2024. We plan to provide a more detailed view of 2022 on our fourth quarter call in February.

As you recall, we gave you [indiscernible] at the beginning of the year. As we see how the quarter played out right now, what's left in front of us right now. We now move the shipbuilding revenue expectation at $8.2 billion. A couple of points on that right now. We're a little light on material, specifically at Ingalls. If you look from a Newport News perspective, net revenues were flat. Obviously, a little look back from a [indiscernible] perspective. But when we're talking about shipbuilding, the material lag behind roughly about $40 million in the quarter. And as we look forward into Q4, that could persist. We don't see significant labor pressures at this time that's going to impact our revenue. We have a key nog right now with the EO and the mandate and how that's changing very dynamic situation there as well as keeping an eye on our supply chain to see how the material flows here. But it's just timing right now as we see the outlook. And as I said, it's still in the range that we gave you at the beginning of the year."

I mean the executive order is -- we have been -- from a policy standpoint, we have been directly aligned with what the White House put out. But as you -- as you kind of hinted out there, the executive order is not contractual. And so working with our customers on all of our contracts to figure out how best to implement that executive orders, what we're doing, and we're doing that across the board. So we're continuing to move ahead. Our ambition is to get as many of our employees vaccinated as we possibly can because we are committed to a safe workplace, and we think that's the best way to do it.

Both the initial guidance we gave you in the July timeframe of Alion supported that. As we sit today after the close in August, and now we've closed the quarter with Alion cranked into our financials, they're hovering on the low end of the range right now. So that's good news because that's more than 50% of that portfolio. And I think kind of going forward, as we see those purchase intangibles get burned off in the next 3, 4, 5 years going forward. Obviously, that's going to be an improvement. I would tell you that the PI is baked into the [indiscernible] although the [indiscernible] for this quarter at [ CSD ] is 2.6%, with $8 million of purchased intangibles. When you roll that out, it's a 5.3% [indiscernible] quarter and the EBITDA is at 77% right now. So that's a new term perspective and how I see it kind of evolving in the out years."

I think general principles are, it's really hard to pin down the development path and time line for a new program like this, this early in the process. They're trying to work through how do they fund the design, how they fund the project, when are they going to have it? What are the requirements going to be. That's a pretty dynamic thing. And so trying to pin that down precisely is a bit of a challenge. And our general view is that you don't really want to stop production of a line until you're ready to move to a mature design product going forward. So as that product matures, it will interact. The construction work that's going on, on the DDGs today, the Flight III ships will -- my -- we certainly will advocate and believe that the best prudent course ahead will be to continue to build Flight IIIs until that design is maturing and you're ready to go into production on that. And if that happens to be 20 something else, then it's 20 something else and then we'll be ready. As far as the competition for that goes, that will just lay in. As that program matures, we'll get more visibility into what the competition, when it might be, what it would look like and that sort of thing. I think it would be a mistake, though, for there to be any sort of curtailment into the Shroyer program, anticipating some kind of maturation path. We kind of went down that path in a couple of programs during my career. We've done that with submarines. We did that actually, DDGs and trying to transition over to the 1,000s and then transition back. So we had a gap in the Shroyer program. Our industry is full of people who have seen gaps in production become tremendous problems for restart of production. So let's keep the production line moving. And when the production line when they decides to turn off the transition, we will transition it."

So for the first part, from a shipbuilding perspective, I highlighted a little bit earlier, I didn't hit the backlog piece of the outlook, right? So unlike, say, requiring the new awards or funding, we have a line of sight of the work that we have in-house. So I look at it from an outlook perspective from shipbuilding, still the 3% CAGR is good. I would tell you that although it looks like we're at the same point we were through the first 3 quarters of this year compared to last year, was an exceptional year, '18 to '19 with a 6% growth and then '19 to '20 was another 6% growth. And even specifically, Q4 last year, was a 19% growth over the quarter previously there. So some material, as I highlighted, actually, Chris highlighted, moved into the end of Q4 of 2020 and made that year look kind of big, which now makes 2021 look flat. So I'm not concerned right now because we have the backlog, we have the work. We have the labor force right now. We are watching material, as I said, and we're watching a video mandate impacts our work thoughts. But I don't -- I'm not concerned with how 2021 is shaking out from a revenue perspective. And I would think kind of going forward that it's pretty linear in 2022 for shipbuilding. Relative to your Alion question, I don't see, obviously, their contracts are different, more service oriented. We're excited with them on board. Andy's put his leadership team in play. As Chris had mentioned earlier, the initial assessments that we had going into the purchase and now to close, we've had a good week run rate in the financial that look under the hood there. So we're comfortable with what's in front of them, the items that they're bidding and how they're executing on the existing contracts. We're evaluating the revenue synergies between Alion making us better, the DFS and MDIS and vice versa. So I feel comfortable with that going forward there. I don't see today again, the EL mandate significantly impacting our revenue expectations from a Alion perspective. We have highlighted from a [ TFD ] perspective, we're eager to watch the funding come about and the unmanned portfolio evolving growth kind of going forward, so that's a watch on price."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. This morning, we released third quarter 2021 financial results that included another quarter of consistent shipbuilding program execution. 
Let me share some highlights from the quarter starting on Slide 3 of the presentation. Sales of $2.3 billion were up 1% from the third quarter of 2020 and diluted EPS was $3.65, down from $5.45 in the third quarter of 2020. New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $600 million, resulting in backlog of approximately $50 billion at the end of the quarter, of which approximately $24 billion is funded. 
Shifting to activities in Washington. The federal government began the new fiscal year under a continuing resolution, which funds government operations through December 3. Now we continue to urge Congress to proceed expeditiously and remain optimistic that the defense appropriations and authorization processes will be completed in the months ahead. As bills progressed through both chambers of Congress, we continue to see bipartisan support for our programs reflected in the defense appropriations and authorization bills in the House and the Senate. We are pleased that the 4 defense oversight committees have shown strong support for shipbuilding to include adding a second Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, which is a Navy -- a top Navy priority for fiscal year 2022. The appropriations bills also include language in support of a DDG 51 follow-on multiyear procurement contract in FY '23. 
So as I prepare to close, let me give a quick update on COVID-19. We continue to work with our customers to satisfy the requirement for federal contractors to have their workforce vaccinated against COVID-19 by December 8, 2021. At HII, we remain committed to promoting and protecting the health and safety of our employees, their families and their communities and continuing to serve our customers and the vital national security interests of our country without disruption as an essential contributor to the nation's critical infrastructure. 
We view our workforce of approximately 44,000 employees as critical partners in this effort and continue to help our unvaccinated employees meet this requirement as safely and efficiently as possible. We will continue to evaluate how the vaccine mandate and delta variant impact our workforce as well as material availability from our supply chain and we expect to have more to share during the fourth quarter earnings call in February. 
And finally, let me recap what HII has done from a portfolio shaping perspective over the past 20 months. In short, we have done exactly what we said we would do during our February 2020 Investor Day. First, we have positioned the Technical Solutions business in growth markets that support the constantly evolving requirements of our customers. And second, we have demonstrated the financial flexibility to pursue these critical growth opportunities while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings and continuing to return capital to shareholders. 
Following the closing of the Alion transaction during the quarter, our team is laser focused on a successful integration in order to produce the financial returns we expect. We are also ensuring that our core shipbuilding programs are achieving key production milestones in order to generate strong free cash flow, which will enable deleveraging of the balance sheet while continuing to return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. We firmly believe that these are the appropriate steps to generate significant long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. 
And now I will turn the call over to Chris for some remarks on the operations. Chris?"

I'm very pleased to report another solid operational quarter. With that, let me share a few highlights. At Ingalls, let me first provide a brief update on the pending contracts awards of LHA 9, LPD 32 and 33. We still believe that a bundled acquisition of these critically important ships is the most cost-effective method of procurement and are pleased that the Navy and Congress have protected the ship schedules with a contract for long-lead material on LHA 9 coupled with continued support for LPD 32 and 33. 
Shifting to program status. LHA 8 Bougainville continues to achieve cost and schedule performance in line with our expectations while making steady progress through the structural erection and initial outfitting phases of construction. 
On the DDG program, the team successfully completed acceptance trials for guided missile destroyer DDG 121 Frank E. Petersen Jr. and expects to deliver the ship to the Navy by the end of this year. In addition, DDG's 123 and 125 remain on track to complete sea trials next year as planned. On the LPD program, LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale was christened in August. This ship remains on track to complete sea trials during the fourth quarter with delivery to the Navy planned in the first quarter of next year. At Newport News, CVN 79 Kennedy is approximately 84% complete and the focus remains on compartment completion and key initial propulsion plant milestones. 
Regarding definitization of the single-phase delivery contract modification, we have reached agreement on the cost and schedule impacts with the Navy and expect to execute the contract modification late this year or early next year. On the RCOH program, CVN 73 USS George Washington continues to achieve key propulsion plant milestones and is approximately 92% complete. In CVN 78 USS Gerald R. Ford returned to Newport News in August to begin a planned incremental availability following successful completion of full-ship shock trials. 
On the VCS program, SSN 794 Montana remains on track for delivery to the Navy later this year. And the SSN 796 New Jersey float-off milestone has moved to early next year to ensure that we achieve the optimum build sequence from float-off to delivery, planned in 2022. And finally, on the submarine fleet support program, SSN 725 Helena, remains on track for redelivery to the Navy later this year. 
At Technical Solutions, the Alion transaction closed in mid-August, and the team announced new business groups and executive appointments that directly align with the strategic focus that we have previously articulated. We expect this very talented team to execute a successful integration of Alion and deliver unparalleled national security solutions to our customers while growing the business and producing returns in line with our expectations. Delays in contract awards in our unmanned business for critical new programs remains a watch item. We're expecting this to be resolved by the end of the year, but it appears that these awards are not likely until early to mid-2022.

Today, I will briefly review our third quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for 2021. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our websi",1409,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Today, I will briefly review our third quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for 2021. For more detail on the segment results, please refer to the earnings release issued this morning and posted to our website. 
Beginning with our consolidated results on Slide 4 of the presentation, our third quarter revenues of $2.3 billion increased approximately 1% compared to the same period last year. This is due to growth at Technical Solutions driven by the Alion acquisition which was largely offset by a decline in revenue at Ingalls, primarily due to lower volumes on the NSC, DDG and LHA programs. 
Segment operating income for the quarter of $163 million increased $1 million compared to the third quarter of 2020. And segment operating margin of 7% was in line with the results from the prior year period. Operating income for the quarter of $118 million decreased by $104 million from the third quarter of 2020, and operating margin of 5% decreased 455 basis points. These decreases were almost entirely due to a less favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment compared to the prior year period. 
The tax rate in the quarter was a negative 4.3% compared to 1.8% in the third quarter of 2020. The decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to additional research and development tax credits for tax years 2016 through 2020 recorded in the third quarter of 2021. 
Net earnings in the quarter were $147 million compared to $222 million in the third quarter of 2020. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.65 compared to $5.45 in the prior year period. Third quarter 2021 results include approximately $15 million of nonrecurring pretax transaction expenses related to the acquisition of Alion. Excluding the impacts of pension, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.58 compared to $3.73 per share in the third quarter of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 5. Cash from operations was $350 million in the quarter and net capital expenditures were $73 million or 3.1% of revenues, resulting in free cash flow of $277 million. This compares to cash from operations of $222 million and $62 million of net capital expenditures or free cash flow of $160 million in the prior year period. Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were $10 million in the quarter, principally related to postretirement benefits. 
During the third quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or $46 million. Our Board of Directors recently approved a 3.5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.18 per share, and this will take effect in the fourth quarter of this year. We also repurchased approximately 83,000 shares during the quarter at an aggregate cost of approximately $17 million. 
Moving on to Slide 6. Ingalls revenues in the quarter of $628 million decreased $47 million or 7% from the same period last year, driven primarily by lower revenues on the NSE, DDG and LHA programs. Ingalls operating income of $62 million and margin of 9.9% in the quarter compared to operating income of $62 million and margin of 9.2% in the third quarter of 2020. The operating margin improvement was driven by an incentive on the DDG program and higher risk retirement for the LPD program, partially offset by lower risk retirement on the NSC program. 
Turning to Slide 7. Newport News revenues of approximately $1.4 billion in the quarter decreased $4 million or less than 1% from the same period last year, driven by lower revenues in naval nuclear support services partially offset by higher revenues in submarines and aircraft carriers. 
Naval nuclear support services revenues decreased primarily as a result of lower volumes in submarine fleet support services and facility maintenance services partially offset by higher volumes in carrier fleet support services. Submarine revenues increased due to higher volumes in Block V boats of the Virginia-class submarine program, and submarine support services and Columbia-class submarine program, partially offset by lower volumes on Block IV boats of the Virginia-class submarine program. 
Aircraft carrier revenues increased primarily as a result of higher volumes on the RCOH of USS John C. Stennis CVN 74 and the construction of Doris Miller CVN 81 and enterprise CVN 80, partially offset by lower volumes on the RCOH of USS George Washington CVN 73 and the construction of John F. Kennedy CVN 79. 
Newport News operating income of $88 million and margin of 6.5% in the quarter compares to operating income of $79 million and margin of 5.8% in the third quarter of 2020. The improvement was primarily due to higher risk retirement on the RCOH of the USS George Washington CVN 73 and Block IV boats of the VCS program, partially offset by lower risk retirement on the naval nuclear support services. 
Now to Technical Solutions on Slide 8 of the presentation. Technical Solutions revenues of $394 million in the quarter increased 23% from the same period last year, mainly due to revenue attributable to the acquisition of Alion in mid-August, partially offset by the divestiture of our oil and gas business and contribution of the San Diego shipyard to a joint venture in the first quarter of this year. The acquisition of Alion closed on August 19, and third quarter results included approximately $163 million of revenue attributable to Alion. 
Technical Solutions operating income of $13 million and operating margin of 3.3% in the quarter compares to an operating income of $21 million and operating margin of 6.6% in the third quarter of 2020. These decreases were primarily driven by the inclusion of approximately $8 million of Alion related purchase intangible amortization as well as lower performance in Defense and Federal Solutions, the divestiture of our oil and gas business and the contribution of the San Diego shipyard to a joint venture I previously mentioned. Third quarter 2021 results include approximately $4 million of operating income attributable to Alion. Third quarter Technical Solutions EBITDA was approximately $30.3 million or an EBITDA margin of 7.7%. 
Moving on to Slide 9 of the presentation. We've updated our outlook for 2021 and 2022 pension and postretirement benefits. For 2022, FAS is now projected to be a benefit rather than an expense, primarily due to higher asset returns. Consequently, the FAS/CAS adjustment has increased from the prior outlook and is now projected to total $52 million in 2022. Please remember that pension-related numbers are subject to year-end performance and measurement criteria. We will provide a multiyear update of pension estimates on our fourth quarter earnings call in February. 
Finally, on Slide 10, a perspective on the outlook for the remainder of the year for both shipbuilding and Technical Solutions inclusive of Alion. Regarding shipbuilding, we now expect 2021 revenue to be approximately $8.2 billion at the low end, but within our initial guidance range. Third quarter shipbuilding revenue was modestly impacted by material timing, which may persist in the near term. Additionally, we continue to navigate through a challenging labor market as well as the potential impact of COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Given all of that, we think it's best to be prudent and temper near-term expectations. 
We continue to expect that shipbuilding operating margin will finish the year in the 7.5% to 8% range. We expect that the fourth quarter shipbuilding operating margin will be roughly consistent with the third quarter results as we were able to recognize some key retirement events in the third quarter, including the completion of sea trials for DDG 121. 
Regarding Technical Solutions, I've noted that Alion acquisition closed in mid-August and our updated expectations for 2021 now include Alion from the date of acquisition, inclusive of incremental purchase intangible amortization that impacts our segment operating margin expectation. 
Turning to free cash flow. We now expect 2021 free cash flow to be between $300 million and $350 million as the repayment of the accelerated progress payments which was initially expected in 2021 has now moved out to 2022. Additionally, on Slide 10, we have provided an updated outlook for a number of other discrete items to assist with your modeling. 
Regarding our longer-term targets, we continue to believe that the 3% CAGR for shipbuilding revenue is appropriate. Additionally, we remain comfortable with our free cash flow target of $3.2 billion from 2020 through 2024. We plan to provide a more detailed view of 2022 on our fourth quarter call in February.

We now move the shipbuilding revenue expectation at $8.2 billion. A couple of points on that right now. We're a little light on material, specifically at Ingalls. If you look from a Newport News perspective, net revenues were flat. Obviously, I'll look back from a TSD perspective. But when we're talking about shipbuilding, the material lag behind roughly about $40 million in the quarter. And as we look forward into Q4, that could persist. 
We don't see significant labor pressures at this time that's going to impact our revenue. We have a keynote right now with the [ DEO ] and the mandate and how that's changing very dynamic situation there as well as keeping an eye on our supply chain to see how the material flows here. But it's just timing right now as we see the outlook. And as I said, it's still in the range that we gave you at the beginning of the year."

I regularly touch base with the supply chain offices that we have at each of the yards, some of to be exactly on where they stand right now. As we've given in the past, because of the nature of our long-term contracts, long-term material orders that start ahead of the construction of these contracts. And then obviously, with the backlog that we have to spend on contract, and we have line of sight of the work that's going to be performed in the yards. A significant amount of those requirements have already been put on order, and we're managing them aggressively to make sure that the material flows in and it hits the [ in-yard need dates ]. The preponderance of the material is coming in on time and meeting the contractual needs that we have within the yard. 
I would tell you that recently, the last 3 to 6 months that as we have spot orders, what we're seeing is a little bit of volatility in pricing and the validity dates are shrinking a little bit on things that we have to spot by. But from a perspective of execution of the existing contracts we have, we don't see a significant impact at this time. Obviously, we're watching how the [ DEO ] mandate impacts the supply chain. And the pressures that we do hear our second and third tier who are dependent on the raw materials. So copper cabling, things of that nature. But again, as you stand here today, the supply chain that we need because of how we've contracted that work in advance has us maintaining schedule at this time."

So because of how we put that division together with the acquisitions, the purchase intangibles and things of that nature, if you noticed we've been guiding and driving towards an EBITDA relationship against the performance and where we see. You've noticed from the announcement we had in the July time frame and then with the Alion close in August, we've guided you on how that was going to cause a lift there. From a RCOH perspective, we were at 4% to 5%. We dialed in from an EBITDA perspective to be in the 8% to 10% range by 2024. Both the initial guidance we gave you in the July timeframe of Alion supported that. As we sit today after the close in August, and now we've closed the quarter with Alion cranked into our financials, they're hovering on the low end of the range right now. So that's good news because that's more than 50% of that portfolio. 
And I think kind of going forward, as we see those purchase intangibles get burned off in the next 3, 4, 5 years going forward, obviously, that's going to be an improvement. I would tell you that the [ PI ] is baked into the ROS, although the ROS even for this quarter at TSD is 2.6%, with $8 million of purchased intangibles. When you roll that out, it's a 5.3% ROS quarter and the EBITDA is at 7.7% right now. So that's a new term perspective and how I see it kind of evolving in the out years."

I think general principles are, it's really hard to pin down the development path and time line for a new program like this, this early in the process. They're trying to work through how do they fund the design, how they fund the project, when are they going to have it? What are the requirements going to be? That's a pretty dynamic thing. And so trying to pin that down precisely is a bit of a challenge. 
And our general view is that you don't really want to stop production of a line until you're ready to move to a mature design product going forward. So as that product matures, it will interact. The construction work that's going on, on the DDGs today, the Flight III ships will -- my -- we certainly will advocate and believe that the best prudent course ahead will be to continue to build Flight IIIs until that design is maturing and you're ready to go into production on that. And if that happens to be 20 something else, then it's 20 something else and then we'll be ready. 
As far as the competition for that goes, that will just lay in. As that program matures, we'll get more visibility into what the competition, when it might be, what it would look like and that sort of thing. I think it would be a mistake, though, for there to be any sort of curtailment in the destroyer program, anticipating some kind of maturation path. We kind of went down that path in a couple of programs during my career. We've done that with submarines. We did that actually with DDGs and trying to transition over to the 1,000s and then transition back. So we had a gap in the destroyer program. Our industry is full of people who have seen gaps in production become tremendous problems for restart of production. So let's keep the production line moving. And when the production line -- when they decided to turn off the transition, we will transition it."

Should we be thinking of next year the shipbuilding growth rate being fairly back-end loaded versus the first half? And then just following up on that Alion discussion there, are you seeing -- we've seen those headwinds across hardware. And outside of hardware, are you seeing some of those same challenges outside of the business in Alion or not as much?"

So for the first part, from a shipbuilding perspective, I highlighted a little bit earlier, I didn't hit the backlog piece of the outlook, right? So unlike, say, requiring the new awards or funding, we have a line of sight of the work that we have in-house. So I look at it from an outlook perspective from shipbuilding, still the 3% CAGR is good. I would tell you that although it looks like we're at the same point we were through the first 3 quarters of this year compared to last year, last year was an exceptional year, '19 to -- '18 to '19 with a 6% growth and then '19 to '20 was another 6% growth. And even specifically, Q4 last year, was a 19% growth over the quarter previously there. 
So some material, as I highlighted -- actually, Chris highlighted, moved into the end of Q4 of 2020 and made that year look kind of big, which now makes 2021 look flat. So I'm not concerned right now because we have the backlog. We have the work. We have the labor force right now. We are watching material, as I said, and we're watching [ DEO ] mandate impacts our workforce. But I don't -- I'm not concerned with how 2021 is shaking out from a revenue perspective. And I would think kind of going forward that it's pretty linear in 2022 for shipbuilding. 
Relative to your Alion question, I don't see, obviously, their contracts are different, more service oriented. We're excited with them on board. Andy's put his leadership team in play. As Chris had mentioned earlier, the initial assessments that we had going into the purchase and now to close, we've had a good 6 weeks run rate in the financial that look under the hood there. So we're comfortable with what's in front of them, the items that they're bidding and how they're executing on the existing contracts. 
We're evaluating the revenue synergies between Alion making us better, the DFS and MDIS and vice versa. So I feel comfortable with that going forward there. I don't see today again, the [ DEO ] mandate significantly impacting our revenue expectations from Alion perspective. We have highlighted from a TSD perspective. We're eager to watch the funding come about and the unmanned portfolio evolving growth kind of going forward, so that's a watch on for us."
