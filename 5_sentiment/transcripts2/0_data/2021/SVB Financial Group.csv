And if we look at the cheapest way to be able to fund that Tier 1 leverage, and at the same time, the way that we've done it in the recent past is really through preferred issuance that we downstream to the bank as well as senior debt.
We have a recent history of doing that, and we've got the flexibility to be able to do it. So I think that allows, especially as we look at the Tier 1 leverage ratio, the flexibility for us to be able to manage that.
In terms of the capacity at the holding company, if we look at the amount of liquidity that remains there, we're sitting right now roughly $700 million. And that's after downstreaming, close to $700 million to the bank in order to support the Tier 1 leverage ratio.
So we believe that we've got the flexibility to manage through preferred, through senior debt to that 7% to 8% leverage ratio."

And Dan will walk through the positives and negatives in how we think about it. There's a couple of things that drove higher expenses at the end of the year with SVB Leerink being one of those components, clearly, their incredible results in 2020 and just a higher payout ratio.
So you look at that and say, that's a big number. So if you pull back a little bit on the revenue forecast, that will have an impact on expenses. We had a real estate write-down on some leases that we looked at. And the other, the fees that we're donating for PPP. So you add up all those things, but actually is a pretty big number.
So if you normalize all that, we actually do have nice growth built in for '21. And so we are investing in the same places that were -- have been in the past. We're actually increasing the investments we're making and have been making infrastructure.
And the one thing I would say, if you look at the last part is if the performance of the bank or if SVB learning outperforms those expenses will be on the higher end. So we do have capacity in there to invest in the business, and we're investing more than we did last year. And so we feel good about the level that you have in there. But Dan, do you want to give any additional color?"

Greg, the only additional color would be just numbers wise, we had $20 million of incremental expenses in the fourth quarter just for the PPP donation. Real estate was another $30 million. And if you look at just the performance in the year in the fourth quarter, that was over $85 million of incremental expense.
So yes, the year-over-year guide looks low. But to Greg's point, when you strip all of that out, the investment levels much more along the lines of our traditional high single digits investment pace from an operating expense perspective on a much bigger number. And I think that's really the key. We are clearly investing heavily in opportunity. It's there."

It's -- I haven't gone through and done the analysis to say exactly what contributed to the growth and you dis split out between the 2 things, the way I think about your question. One is the markets that we serve and then our ability to execute.
There's no question that the markets that we serve. When you look at Slide 8, where we try to describe the level of enter capital activity, PE activity, and you can look at public markets, as you know, all of those have been incredibly strong. So that's the kind of the tailwind that we have based on the success of the market that we're in.
But I would also say, when I think about what we've been doing to build out our capabilities, so you can look at health care and life sciences with SVB Leerink. We get a benefit from having that being on our platform because we're able to do more with health care life science companies, so our market share is going up.
You can look at the quality of deals that we're doing in later stage, winning more syndications than we have in the past. And so working with later stage companies and keeping our market share, in fact, increasing our market share.
And the final point is the market share we're having with what I would say is the best or the highest quality companies. All 3 of those things have improved. And so when you think about that and you add to that, the global presence that we have, all those things combined really are about execution.
So when you see the results that we're delivering, we delivered in 2020 and what we certainly expect in '21 is a combination of an incredibly strong market and then secondly, the execution that we've had and the share improvement that we've seen as well."

So when I think about where the risks are. So you got a public market that is very strong. Valuations are high, and that's trickling down into private markets.
You have very few places globally for investment dollars to flow, right? Fixed income is really difficult because rates are so low. Real estate and other investments that would historically be places that money would be deployed, there's so much uncertainty around that, that you're not seeing money deployed there.
So you look at those things and you see where is growth coming from? It's the innovation economy, both tech and life sciences. So that's what's driving it. So what could derail it? Well, if public markets all of a sudden valuations dropped substantially in tech and health care companies and IPO slow down dramatically and valuations take a hit, that will trickle down into private markets.
Now as I said, why don't I believe that will happen? I believe it won't happen because there are a very few places for that money to be deployed. Growth is being driven in these markets, and I expect that to continue.
And then the final piece is our strategy about taking out kind of the 4 pillars; commercial bank, the private bank, SCB, capital and investment banking are all part of that strategy. So I believe from a market perspective, the market is healthy. And while it may soften a little bit, I certainly believe that it's the best place in the long run to invest.
And so I don't think you're going to see a slowdown in the long run. It's more about could there be volatility in the short run or medium term, that's clearly a possibility."

So if I look at tangible book value, it grew almost 30% in 2020, helped by roughly $630 million of investment in warrant gains. If you look at the investment warrant gains, the growth rate of those is accelerated, right?
And it was a good year for IPOS, but it wasn't 2.5x better than 2019. What are these larger gains going to you guys attributable to? Are you positioning better in the winners? Like what have you guys observed on that front because this is a material driver of book value."

And the quality of companies that were winning are the higher quality companies. So our market share with the best companies is improving.
And as you know, if you're in the best companies, the returns that are being driven by the top companies are greatly outsized compared to average or below average companies. So our ability to be in the best companies helps to drive those gains, number one. Number 2 is the product set. So when you think about the breadth of product set that we have, where it's mezzanine debt, it's acquisition financing. It's early stage. It's late stage, it's across the board.
There's a variety of different ways where you can participate in the upside, and the team has done an excellent job of delivering on that. And again, these games aren't coming from deals that were done this year. These gains are what was being derived from deals that were done 3 years, 4 years and 5 years ago or longer. And now those benefits are being realized.
So from that standpoint, again, we think about the number of warrants that we're taking in companies, we think about the new products we're offering. We're trying to work as hard as we can to come up with new products, new solutions that allow us to continue to build on those equity positions that we have had over a period of time.
And then finally, in SVB capital, the amount of money that we're putting under management, raising new funds, direct funds and fund to funds has also been substantial. And while those take a while to realize the carried interest and the other benefits, we certainly expect that to continue over time.
So just like the last question, we'll see some volatility but we certainly feel good about the long-term return of those investments and the loans we're making in the innovation economy."

Can you just talk about like how sustainable some of that is? I get the stimulus and everything, and there's just a lot of cash out there, but it just feels like there's been such a meaningful step-up in the level of deposit growth.
And then the expectation is that you keep all that and continues to grow. Can you just help us understand why that's the case?"

I'll start and Dan or Mike Descheneaux may want to add to it. I'll start with just almost repeating what I had said to Ibrahim and with Steve, which is the market share that we have on the best companies is really driving that. And those companies are able to raise money at higher and higher valuations because it is the ones that are performing. And while their burn rates may increase, right? When their burn rates may increase, we don't believe it will have a substantial impact.
So part of it is the starting point of where we finished the year, and we do have growth built into it. But as we talk to our teams, as we talk to venture capitalists, we remain optimistic about how '21 will play out.
And if you look at public markets, I know we're early in the new year, but they have remained robust. You can look at, again, the activity levels that SCB Leerink has in their public offerings in the press releases. I always reference that as a way to gauge how well they're doing. They've had incredible number of deals already this year. And what I've heard from the technology investment banks in the market is their pipeline is incredibly strong. 
So we certainly believe, at least as far as we can see that the momentum will continue, maybe not at the same pace, but probably not at the same pace we saw in the fourth quarter, but it's still going to be healthy. Dan or Mike, do you guys want to add anything to that?"

I think as we look at just the overall liquidity that's in the market, especially with COVID and with the incremental liquidity that's been added to the market. And the fact that we're going to see additional investments in the space, private equity, venture capital, the liquidity is clearly there and in the market. We -- for our guidance, didn't forecast an identical 2020, we are looking at something that's closer to a 2019. But since we're in a lower rate environment, more of that is going to find its way on the balance sheet than off the balance sheet.
So I think when we look at all of those things, there's plentiful liquidity. We think it will be invested in the space. And when we look at lower rates and compare that back to where we were in 2019, we think we're at the jumping-off point in that this is a reasonable guide."

And now it's also being accelerated here. And it's opening up and creating a lot of new investment opportunities.

Had a significant provision in the first half of the year, significant reserve build against what we expected. I think everybody expected to happen what economic forecast we're suggesting would happen.
And as you see the economic forecast that are a key driver of the CECL reserve methodology. Improve in Q3 and Q4, you see some of those reserves come down. And so just going to our funded reserve, we were at 99 basis points in the fourth quarter.
And that compares to the fourth quarter of '19 in basis points terms, pretty accurately. Having said that, if our portfolio composition was consistent with where we were at the end of 2019, then yes, apples-to-apples, we still have a reserve that's higher than pre COVID.
And I think the presumption is that if things continue to be stable in credit, the economy continues to improve, then like others, we, too, would get back to where we were pre COVID, not quite there yet. All right."

We -- when I think about pipeline, it's hard to think about, at least from my standpoint. But I would say the best way to gage how they're doing is, again, just look at the press releases they're giving out. And again, through the first few weeks of the year, you're going to see that the press releases are pretty darn robust.
So I think it's a good indication. Predicting what's going to happen in the balance of the year isn't easy. I would say that we were expecting or going to be forecasting a lower number than what we have in here. But again, as we talk about the leadership team of SVB Leerink, feeling good about the first half of the year. So I would say that, that is the accurate forecast of where we are. Clearly, if we see the continued high level of activity that we're already seeing in January, and we see that play out in the year, just by definition, the numbers are going to be very strong. 
But again, just to put it in context, last year, I would encourage anyone that has a question about the activity levels in the health care market, we issued a report on the robustness of the public markets for the health care sector.
And there's no question last year was the best year, period, end of story. And so it is really hard to predict and maybe impossible to predict that you're going to have back-to-back record years because some of that equity is really a pull forward of raises that we would expected to see in '21.
So now some of these companies have 3 or 4 years' worth of cash on their balance sheet, public biotech companies. Could they go out and do more? It's possible, but unlikely. So I would say the forecast that we have in there is what we expect in that range. But again, you'll be able to see it kind of on a weekly basis as you look at the activity levels that are being published by the team."

So between that, and the incremental deployment of cash and these cash balances that we expect throughout the rest of next year, you're going to see the NIM compression come through.
If we look at the other factors -- if we look at lending, if we look at the deposit side of the equation, those will roughly stay flat. You might see up to 10 basis point reduction from a lending perspective, just mostly because of loan mix.
But overall, it's really this liquidity going to work -- going to work at lower rates and pay downs in the investment securities portfolio, obviously, translating to a good improvement in NII."

But here's a couple of ways to think about it. One is first of all, it's a competitive market. So let's -- we'll acknowledge that.
And as banks feel more comfortable with their results, they're leaning in and asking where growth can come from. And clearly, we're -- our market, as evidenced by our performance is a place where people are looking. But it's been that way for a long time that this has been the market that people are looking at.
And so what have we tried to do to compete against that? Well there's a lot of things. One is just strategically, and I said this in earlier in answer to a question, is that the more that we can provide one-stop shopping across all the needs of our clients and not just doing an okay job, they're doing exceptional job why would you go in a other place?
So you think about it from a commercial bank perspective and what Mike and his whole team is doing, it is exceptional. And there's ways that we can even improve it and make it better. You can look at what we're doing in SVB capital. And it's not just the investments we're making, but it's also the new capabilities they have with the acquisition that we did with West River Group and the debt capabilities that expands our capacity to lend money to those commercial bank clients.
You've got the investment bank with SVB Leerink, and they have done as well as they have done, and they've done an unbelievable job. The team is not resting on its laurels. We're looking at bringing on new teams, new capabilities, which we'll be announcing shortly.
And thinking about technology investment banking. So I think about expanding in those areas, again, it goes back to being able to help our clients in all their needs. And finally, is the private banking and wealth.
And with the acquisition of Boston Private, again, if we can add value to our clients in all 4 of those areas and do an exceptional job for them, right, that's competitive differentiation. And that's why we're so focused on executing on that strategy.
So is it competitive absolutely. But we've shown that we can deliver for our clients. And to be honest, we're just getting started in building out the full platform. And that, I think, is going to be, as I said, the biggest competitive differentiator over time. I'll turn it over to Mike to add some additional color."

Maybe just a few things, John, just to think about it, well, you mentioned global Funds banking specifically. As you saw here in this quarter, we had basically a record quarter for the team, so the team is the best platform in the business. And so they continue to do extraordinary well, extraordinarily well, and there's a lot of opportunities in front of us as well, no doubt.
When you start to think about the tech and life sciences, a lot of the competition is comes in the form of debt funds as well to. And Greg mentioned, our acquisition of West River Group extends our capabilities for off-balance sheet activities like that from the debt funds as well, too. But the teams are doing extraordinarily well as well there.
But then shifting to -- we don't talk about a lot, but the deposit franchise as well, too, is incredibly strong. Our client acquisitions essentially another record quarter in Q4 and the quality that we're getting just continues to improve. And it's not at the early stage, but it's also the accelerator states that we're making really great progress as well, too.
So we feel very good about client acquisition. And that really is the key, and we just do a lot of things right and being relevant to our clients. And then you mentioned kind of in the fee areas, maybe just touch upon a little bit of that as well, too. But it really gets back to the capabilities that we have to deliver to our clients, the expansion of our product set as well, too, which we've been very focused on over the last couple of years.
And so I know some of the fee income items took a bit of hit during COVID, but you saw FX had another record quarter. Again, a lot of that is with some -- a lot of our -- as we expand our private equity clients as well to as we extend our global reach as well, whether it's in London or Asia as well, too, that just continues to be strong.
And similarly, on the card side as well, too, again, enhancements in some of the product set and putting it in the hands of our clients as well as we acquire them when they come on board here. As well, again, we're going to -- we're starting to get back to cover levels, excluding travel, but we are starting to get back and see some of that volume come back significantly as well. 
So we feel pretty good where we're at in terms of the competitive front and look for more to come."

The trend of 1,500 has been consistent with the last few quarters and has been at near-record levels. So we are thrilled with the level of new client growth that we have. Now kind of peeling that the onion and understanding of a little bit more where it's coming from, I'd break it into 2 different ways.
First of all, it's our start-up banking team. These are the companies that are just being formed pre venture capital backed. And we have an absolutely exceptional team there. And what to me is so impressive about what they have done and what they're building is it's all about how you add value to these companies, how can you be a mentor, how can you be a coach, how can you get the advice to, as we like to say, increase their probability of success.
And what they're working on is making sure the companies are working with are -- have the highest potential of getting that next round of -- our first round of equity financing. So I think that the team that is coming together to do that is really the quality is really -- the quality of the team is driving the quality of the results.
So that is a big portion of those 1,500 clients. But what we've seen in the last couple of quarters, quite honestly, gets me even more excited, which is we've had an uptick in wins in what I'll call venture-backed mid state -- early mid-stage and even later stage companies, just new wins.
And the only way that happens, again, it goes back to what I said earlier, an incredible team but it's also how we come together to deliver for them across our product set. And so while the 1,500 clients is a very high level, again, what excites me is the quality of companies that exist in that 1,500.
And do I think that's going to continue? I certainly expect it to, from a quality perspective, the number of companies will certainly be a function of how the markets, the activity levels and so forth. But to me, there's no reason that we would see that slow down, at least as I see it. So feeling really good about that number and feeling really good about the quality.

And that's where, if you look at the liquidity that we're generating, absent the loans that we're putting to work, we're putting investment securities to work.
So that's where if we see curve steepening in 2021, we'll start to see those benefits really pushed through at least in the short term. Obviously, we still remain asset sensitivity -- asset sensitive to short rate movements.
But at this point, obviously, aren't expecting a change in Fed funds. So really paying attention to that 3 to 5-year range. That's where we're putting the investment securities portfolio to work.

So first, on the lending side, since the majority of the loan portfolio is variable rate, and it is really tied -- the majority of that is tied to prime rate, the resets there have really occurred. So that's really all priced through the majority of the loan book at this point. The only exception being the mortgage portfolio and obviously, we have been seeing good and new activity there and some pretty decent yield stability.
So I think when I look at loans on an overall basis, we feel good over the next year, maybe you'll see, on average, a 10 -- 5 to 10 basis point decline in overall yields. The investment securities portfolio is another story. That's where we are seeing paydowns in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion a quarter range. And obviously, that money is being reinvested at today's rates.
So that's being reinvested in this, let's call it, $110 million to $130 million type of range. So that's going to continue to be a drag on the overall yield from the investment portfolio perspective. And that's going to take, if you just look at the duration of the book, another couple of years to price all the way through.
So that's the way to think about it. We're still not done, and we've reflected all of the repricing activity that we expect and the new purchases into the net interest income and the NIM guidance for the year."

We have a recent history of doing that, and we've got the flexibility to be able to do it. So I think that allows, especially as we look at the Tier 1 leverage ratio, the flexibility for us to be able to manage that. 
In terms of the capacity as the holding company, if we look at the amount of liquidity that remains there, we're sitting right now roughly $700 million. And that's after downstreaming close to $700 million to the bank in order to support the Tier 1 leverage ratio. 
So we believe that we've got the flexibility to manage through preferred, through senior debt to that 7% to 8% leverage ratio."

And Dan will walk through the positives and negatives and how we think about it. There's a couple of things that drove higher expenses at the end of the year with SVB Leerink to being one of those components, clearly, their incredible results in 2020 and just a higher payout ratio. 
So you look at that and say, that's a big number. So if you pull back a little bit on the revenue forecast, that will have an impact on expenses. We had a real estate write down on some leases that we looked at. And the other the fees that we're donating for PPP. So when you add up all those things that actually is a pretty big number. 
So if you normalize all that, we actually do have nice growth built in for '21. And so we are investing in the same places that were -- have been in the past. We're actually increasing the investments we're making and have been making in infrastructure. 
And the one thing I would say, if you look at the last part is if the performance of the bank or if SVB Leerink outperforms those expenses will be on the higher end. So we do have capacity in there to invest in the business, and we're investing more than we did last year. And so we feel good about the level that you have in there. But Dan, do you want to give any additional color?"

And if you look at just the performance in the year in the fourth quarter, that was over $85 million of incremental expense. 
So yes, the year-over-year guide looks low. But to Greg's point, when you strip all of that out, the investment levels much more along the lines of our traditional high single digits investment pace from an operating expense perspective on a much bigger number. And I think that's really the key. We are clearly investing heavily in opportunity. It's there."

It's -- I haven't gone through and done the analysis to say exactly what contributed to the growth and [indiscernible] out between the 2 things the way I think about your question. One is the markets that we serve and then our ability to execute. 
There's no question that the markets that we serve, when you look at Slide 8, where we try to describe the level of venture capital activity, PE activity, and you can look at public markets, as you know, all of those have been incredibly strong. So that's the kind of the tailwind that we have based on the success of the market that we're in. 
But I would also say, when I think about what we've been doing to build out our capabilities, so you can look at health care and life sciences with SVB Leerink, we get a benefit from having that being on our platform because we're able to do more with health care, life science companies, so our market share is going up. 
You can look at the quality of deals that we're doing in later stage, winning more syndications than we have in the past. And so working with later stage companies and keeping our market share, in fact, increasing our market share. 
And the final point is the market share we're having with what I would say is the best or the highest quality companies. All 3 of those things have improved. And so when you think about that and you add to that, the global presence that we have, all those things combined really are about execution. 
So what you see the results that we're delivering, or we delivered in 2020 and what we certainly expect in '21 is a combination of an incredibly strong market and then secondly the execution that we've had and the share improvement that we've seen as well."

So when I think about where the risks are, so you got a public market that is very strong. Valuations are high, and that's trickling down into private markets. 
You have very few places globally for investment dollars to flow, right? Fixed income is really difficult because rates are so low. Real estate and other investments that would historically be places that money would be deployed, there's so much uncertainty around that, that you're not seeing money deployed there. 
So you look at those things and you see where is growth coming from? It's the innovation economy, both tech and life sciences. So that's what's driving it. So what could derail it? Well, if public markets all of a sudden valuations dropped substantially in tech and health care companies and IPO slow down dramatically and valuations take a hit, that will trickle down into private markets. 
Now as I said, why don't I believe that will happen. I believe it won't happen because there are a very few places for that money to be deployed. Growth is being driven in these markets and I expect that to continue. 
And then the final piece is our strategy about taking out kind of the 4 pillars; commercial bank, the private bank, SVB Capital and investment banking are all part of that strategy. So I believe from a market perspective, the market is healthy. And while it may soften a little bit, I certainly believe that it's the best place in the long run to invest. 
And so I don't think you're going to see a slowdown in the long run. It's more about could there be volatility in the short run or medium term, that's clearly a possibility."

And the quality of companies that we're winning are the higher-quality companies. So our market share with the best companies is improving. 
And as you know, if you're in the best companies, the returns that are being driven by the top companies are greatly outsized compared to average or below average companies. So our ability to be in the best companies helps to drive those gains, number one. Number two is the product set. So when you think about the breadth of product set that we have, where it's mezzanine debt, it's acquisition financing, it's early stage, it's late stage, it's across the board, there's a variety of different ways where you can participate in the upside, and the team has done an excellent job of delivering on that. And again, these gains aren't coming from deals that were done this year, these gains are what was being derived from deals that were done 3 years, 4 years and 5 years ago or longer. And now those benefits are being realized. 
So from that standpoint, again, we think about the number of warrants that we're taking in companies, we think about the new products we're offering. We're trying to work as hard as we can to come up with new products, new solutions that allow us to continue to build on those equity positions that we have had over a period of time. 
And then finally, in SVB Capital, the amount of money that we're putting under management, raising new funds, direct funds and fund to funds has also been substantial. And while those take a while to realize the carried interest and the other benefits, we certainly expect that to continue over time. 
So just like the last question, we'll see some volatility but we certainly feel good about the long-term return of those investments and the loans we're making in the innovation economy."

And while their burn rates may increase, right? when their burn rates may increase, we don't believe it will have a substantial impact. 
So part of it is the starting point of where we finished the year, and we do have growth built into it. But as we talk to our teams, as we talk to venture capitalists, we remain optimistic about how '21 will play out. 
And if you look at public markets, I know we're early in the new year, but they have remained robust. You can look at, again, the activity levels that SVB Leerink has and their public offerings in the press releases as I always reference that as a way to gauge how well they're doing, they've had incredible number of deals already this year. And what I've heard from the technology investment banks in the market is their pipeline is incredibly strong.  
So we certainly believe, at least as far as we can see, that the momentum will continue, maybe not at the same pace, but probably not at the same pace we saw in the fourth quarter, but it's still going to be healthy. Dan or Mike, do you guys want to add anything to that?"

We, for our guidance, didn't forecast an identical 2020, we are looking at something that's closer to a 2019. But since we're in a lower rate environment, more of that is going to find its way on the balance sheet than off the balance sheet. 
So I think when we look at all of those things, there's plentiful liquidity, we think it will be invested in the space. And when we look at lower rates and compare that back to where we were in 2019, we think we're at the jumping-off point and that this is a reasonable guide."

And as you see the economic forecast that are a key driver of the CECL reserve methodology, improve in Q3 and Q4, you see some of those reserves come down. And so just going to our funded reserve, we were at 99 basis points in the fourth quarter. 
And that compares to the fourth quarter of '19 in basis points terms, pretty accurately. Having said that, if our portfolio composition was consistent with where we were at the end of 2019, then yes, apples-to-apples, we still have a reserve that's higher than pre-COVID. 
And I think the presumption is that if things continue to be stable in credit, the economy continues to improve, then like others, we, too, would get back to where we were pre-COVID, not quite there yet."

So I think it's a good indication. Predicting what's going to happen in the balance of the year isn't easy. I would say that we were expecting or going to be forecasting a lower number than what we have in here. But again, as we talk with the leadership team of SVB Leerink, feeling good about the first half of the year. So I would say that, that is the accurate forecast of where we are. Clearly, if we see the continued high level of activity that we're already seeing in January, and we see that play out in the year, just by definition, the numbers are going to be very strong.  
But again, just to put it in context, last year, I would encourage anyone that has a question about the activity levels in the health care market, we issued a report on the robustness of the public markets for the health care sector. 
And there's no question last year was the best year, period, end of story. And so it is really hard to predict and maybe impossible to predict that you're going to have back-to-back record years because some of that equity is really a pull forward of raises that we would expect to see in '21. 
So now some of these companies have 3 or 4 years' worth of cash on their balance sheet, public biotech companies. Could they go out and do more? It's possible, but unlikely. So I would say the forecast that we have in there is what we expect in that range. But again, you'll be able to see it kind of on a weekly basis as you look at the activity levels that are being published by the team."

The guidance and the NIM compression is largely just driven by the liquidity deployment as well as the continued paydowns in the investment securities portfolio. So on a quarterly basis, we're getting about $2.5 billion to $3 billion worth of paydowns in the investment securities portfolio. So between that, and the incremental deployment of cash and these cash balances that we expect throughout the rest of next year, you're going to see the NIM compression come through. 
If we look at the other factors, we look at lending, we look at the deposit side of the equation, those will roughly stay flat. You might see up to 10 basis point reduction from a lending perspective, just mostly because of loan mix. 
But overall, it's really this liquidity going to work at lower rates and paydowns in the investment securities portfolio obviously translating to a good improvement in NII."

But here's a couple of ways to think about it. One is -- first of all, it's a competitive market. So let's -- we'll  acknowledge that. 
And as banks feel more comfortable with their results, they're leaning in and asking where growth can come from. And clearly, we're -- our market, as evidenced by our performance is a place where people are looking. But it's been that way for a long time that this has been the market that people are looking at. 
And so what have we tried to do to compete against that? Well there's a lot of things. One is just strategically, and I said this in -- earlier in answer to a question, is that the more that we can provide one-stop shopping across all the needs of our clients and not just doing an okay job but doing exceptional job why would you go any other other place.
So you think about it from a commercial bank perspective and what Mike and his whole team is doing, it is exceptional. And there's ways that we can even improve it and make it better. You can look at what we're doing in SVB Capital. And it's not just the investments we're making, but it's also the new capabilities they have with the acquisition that we did with West River Group and the debt capabilities that expands our capacity to lend money to those commercial bank clients. 
You've got the investment bank with SVB Leerink, and they have done -- as well as they have done, and they've done an unbelievable job. The team is not resting on its laurels. We're looking at bringing on new teams, new capabilities, which we'll be announcing shortly. 
And thinking about technology investment banking. So I think about expanding in those areas, again, it goes back to being able to help our clients in all their needs. And finally is the private banking and wealth. 
And with the acquisition of Boston Private, again, if we can add value to our clients in all 4 of those areas and do an exceptional job for them, right, that's competitive differentiation. And that's why we're so focused on executing on that strategy. 
So is it competitive? Absolutely. But we've shown that we can deliver for our clients. And to be honest, we're just getting started in building out the full platform. And that, I think, is going to be, as I said, the biggest competitive differentiator over time. I'll turn it over to Mike to add some additional color."

Maybe just a few things, John, just to think about it. Well,  you mentioned global funds banking specifically. As you saw here in this quarter, we had basically a record quarter for the team, so the team is the best platform in the business. And so they continue to do extraordinary well, extraordinarily well, and there's a lot of opportunities in front of us as well, no doubt. 
When you start to think about the tech and life sciences, a lot of the competition is -- comes in the form of debt funds as well. And Greg mentioned, our acquisition of West River Group extends our capabilities for off-balance sheet activities like that from the debt funds as well, too. 
But the teams are doing extraordinarily well as well there. But then shifting to, we don't talk about a lot, but the deposit franchise as well, too, is incredibly strong. Our client acquisitions essentially another record quarter in Q4 and the quality that we're getting just continues to improve. And it's not at the early stage, but it's also at the accelerated stage that we're making really great progress as well, too. 
So we feel very good about client acquisition. And that really is the key, and we just do a lot of things right and being relevant to our clients. And then you mentioned kind of in the fee areas,  let me just touch upon a little bit of that as well, too. But it really gets back to the capabilities that we have to deliver to our clients, the expansion of our product set as well, too, which we've been very focused on over the last couple of years. 
And so I know some of the fee income items took a bit of hit during COVID, but you saw FX had another record quarter. Again, a lot of that is with some -- a lot of our -- as we expand our private equity clients as well to as we extend our global reach as well, whether it's in London or Asia as well, too, that just continues to be strong. 
And similarly, on the [ card ] side as well, too, again, enhancements in some of the product set and putting it in the hands of our clients as well as we acquire them when they come on board here. As well, again, we're going to -- we're starting to get back to COVID levels, excluding travel, but we are starting to get back and see some of that volume come back significantly as well.  
So we feel pretty good where we're at in terms of the competitive front and look for more to come."

The trend of 1,500 has been consistent with the last few quarters and has been at near-record levels. So we are thrilled with the level of new client growth that we have. 
Now kind of peeling that the onion and understanding of a little bit more where it's coming from, I'd break it down into 2 different ways. First of all, it's our start-up banking team. These are the companies that are just being formed, pre venture capital backed. And we have an absolutely exceptional team there. And what to me is so impressive about what they have done and what they're building is it's all about how you add value to these companies, how can you be a mentor, how can you be a coach, how can you give them advice to, as we like to say, increase their probability of success. 
And what they're working on is making sure the companies are working with are -- have the highest potential of getting that next round of -- or first round of equity financing. So I think that the team that is coming together to do that is really -- the quality is really -- the quality of the team is driving the quality of the results. 
So that is a big portion of those 1,500 clients. But what we've seen in the last couple of quarters, quite honestly, gets me even more excited, which is we've had an uptick in wins in what I'll call venture-backed mid -- early mid-stage and even later-stage companies, just new wins. 
And the only way that happens, again, it goes back to what I said earlier, an incredible team but it's also how we come together to deliver for them across our product set. And so while the 1,500 clients is a very high level, again, what excites me is the quality of companies that exist in that 1,500. 
And do I think that's going to continue? I certainly expect it to from a quality perspective, the number of companies will certainly be a function of how -- the markets, the activity levels and so forth. But to me, there's no reason that we would see that slow down, at least as I see it. So feeling really good about that number and feeling really good about the quality. Mike, I don't know if you have anything to add to it?"

So that's where -- if we see curve steepening in 2021, we'll start to see those benefits really push through at least in the short term. Obviously, we still remain asset sensitivity -- asset sensitive to short rate movements.  But at this point, obviously, aren't expecting a change in Fed funds. So really paying attention to that 3- to 5-year range. That's where we're putting the investment securities portfolio to work.

So first, on the lending side, since the majority of the loan portfolio is variable rate, and is really tied -- the majority of that is tied to prime rate, the resets there have really occurred. So that's really all priced through the majority of the loan book at this point. The only exception being the mortgage portfolio, and obviously, we have been seeing new -- good and new activity there and some pretty decent yield stability. 
So I think when I look at loans on an overall basis, we feel good. Over the next year, maybe you'll see, on average, a 10 -- 5 to 10 basis point decline in overall yields. The investment securities portfolio is another story. That's where we are seeing paydowns in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion a quarter range. And obviously, that money is being reinvested at today's rates. 
So that's being reinvested in this, let's call it, 110 to 130 type of range. So that's going to continue to be a drag on the overall yield from the investment portfolio perspective. And that's going to take, if you just look at the duration of the book, another couple of years to price all the way through. 
So that's the way to think about it. We're still not done, and we've reflected all of the repricing activity that we expect and the new purchases into the net interest income and the NIM guidance for the year."

And Dan will walk through the positives and negatives and how we think about it. There's a couple of things that drove higher expenses at the end of the year with SVB Leerink to being one of those components, clearly, their incredible results in 2020 and just a higher payout ratio. 
So you look at that and say, that's a big number. So if you pull back a little bit on the revenue forecast, that will have an impact on expenses. We had a real estate write down on some leases that we looked at. And the other the fees that we're donating for PPP. So when you add up all those things that actually is a pretty big number. 
So if you normalize all that, we actually do have nice growth built in for '21. And so we are investing in the same places that were -- have been in the past. We're actually increasing the investments we're making and have been making in infrastructure. 
And the one thing I would say, if you look at the last part is if the performance of the bank or if SVB Leerink outperforms those expenses will be on the higher end. So we do have capacity in there to invest in the business, and we're investing more than we did last year. And so we feel good about the level that you have in there. But Dan, do you want to give any additional color?"

And if you look at just the performance in the year in the fourth quarter, that was over $85 million of incremental expense. 
So yes, the year-over-year guide looks low. But to Greg's point, when you strip all of that out, the investment levels much more along the lines of our traditional high single digits investment pace from an operating expense perspective on a much bigger number. And I think that's really the key. We are clearly investing heavily in opportunity. It's there."

It's -- I haven't gone through and done the analysis to say exactly what contributed to the growth and [indiscernible] out between the 2 things the way I think about your question. One is the markets that we serve and then our ability to execute. 
There's no question that the markets that we serve, when you look at Slide 8, where we try to describe the level of venture capital activity, PE activity, and you can look at public markets, as you know, all of those have been incredibly strong. So that's the kind of the tailwind that we have based on the success of the market that we're in. 
But I would also say, when I think about what we've been doing to build out our capabilities, so you can look at health care and life sciences with SVB Leerink, we get a benefit from having that being on our platform because we're able to do more with health care, life science companies, so our market share is going up. 
You can look at the quality of deals that we're doing in later stage, winning more syndications than we have in the past. And so working with later-stage companies and keeping our market share, in fact, increasing our market share. 
And the final point is the market share we're having with what I would say is the best or the highest quality companies. All 3 of those things have improved. And so when you think about that and you add to that, the global presence that we have, all those things combined really are about execution. 
So what you see the results that we're delivering, or we delivered in 2020 and what we certainly expect in '21 is a combination of an incredibly strong market and then secondly the execution that we've had and the share improvement that we've seen as well."

So when I think about where the risks are, so you got a public market that is very strong. Valuations are high, and that's trickling down into private markets. 
You have very few places globally for investment dollars to flow, right? Fixed income is really difficult because rates are so low. Real estate and other investments that would historically be places that money would be deployed, there's so much uncertainty around that, that you're not seeing money deployed there. 
So you look at those things and you see where is growth coming from? It's the innovation economy, both tech and life sciences. So that's what's driving it. So what could derail it? Well, if public markets all of a sudden valuations dropped substantially in tech and health care companies and IPO slow down dramatically and valuations take a hit, that will trickle down into private markets. 
Now as I said, why don't I believe that will happen. I believe it won't happen because there are a very few places for that money to be deployed. Growth is being driven in these markets and I expect that to continue. 
And then the final piece is our strategy about taking out kind of the 4 pillars; commercial bank, the private bank, SVB Capital and investment banking are all part of that strategy. So I believe from a market perspective, the market is healthy. And while it may soften a little bit, I certainly believe that it's the best place in the long run to invest. 
And so I don't think you're going to see a slowdown in the long run. It's more about could there be volatility in the short run or medium term, that's clearly a possibility."

And the quality of companies that we're winning are the higher-quality companies. So our market share with the best companies is improving. 
And as you know, if you're in the best companies, the returns that are being driven by the top companies are greatly outsized compared to average or below-average companies. So our ability to be in the best companies helps to drive those gains, number one. Number two is the product set. So when you think about the breadth of product set that we have, where it's mezzanine debt, it's acquisition financing, it's early stage, it's late stage, it's across the board, there's a variety of different ways where you can participate in the upside, and the team has done an excellent job of delivering on that. And again, these gains aren't coming from deals that were done this year, these gains are what was being derived from deals that were done 3 years, 4 years and 5 years ago or longer. And now those benefits are being realized. 
So from that standpoint, again, we think about the number of warrants that we're taking in companies, we think about the new products we're offering. We're trying to work as hard as we can to come up with new products, new solutions that allow us to continue to build on those equity positions that we have had over a period of time. 
And then finally, in SVB Capital, the amount of money that we're putting under management, raising new funds, direct funds and fund to funds has also been substantial. And while those take a while to realize the carried interest and the other benefits, we certainly expect that to continue over time. 
So just like the last question, we'll see some volatility but we certainly feel good about the long-term return of those investments and the loans we're making in the innovation economy."

And those companies are able to raise money at higher and higher valuations because those are the ones that are performing. And while their burn rates may increase, right? when their burn rates may increase, we don't believe it will have a substantial impact. 
So part of it is the starting point of where we finished the year, and we do have growth built into it. But as we talk to our teams, as we talk to venture capitalists, we remain optimistic about how '21 will play out. 
And if you look at public markets, I know we're early in the new year, but they have remained robust. You can look at, again, the activity levels that SVB Leerink has and their public offerings in the press releases as I always reference that as a way to gauge how well they're doing, they've had incredible number of deals already this year. And what I've heard from the technology investment banks in the market is their pipeline is incredibly strong.  
So we certainly believe, at least as far as we can see, that the momentum will continue, maybe not at the same pace, but probably not at the same pace we saw in the fourth quarter, but it's still going to be healthy. Dan or Mike, do you guys want to add anything to that?"

We, for our guidance, didn't forecast an identical 2020, we are looking at something that's closer to a 2019. But since we're in a lower rate environment, more of that is going to find its way on the balance sheet than off the balance sheet. 
So I think when we look at all of those things, there's plentiful liquidity, we think it will be invested in the space. And when we look at lower rates and compare that back to where we were in 2019, we think we're at the jumping-off point and that this is a reasonable guide."

And as you see the economic forecast that are a key driver of the CECL reserve methodology, improve in Q3 and Q4, you see some of those reserves come down. And so just going to our funded reserve, we were at 99 basis points in the fourth quarter. 
And that compares to the fourth quarter of '19 in basis points terms, pretty accurately. Having said that, if our portfolio composition was consistent with where we were at the end of 2019, then yes, apples-to-apples, we still have a reserve that's higher than pre-COVID. 
And I think the presumption is that if things continue to be stable in credit, the economy continues to improve, then like others, we, too, would get back to where we were pre-COVID, not quite there yet."

So I think it's a good indication. Predicting what's going to happen in the balance of the year isn't easy. I would say that we were expecting or going to be forecasting a lower number than what we have in here. But again, as we talk with the leadership team of SVB Leerink, feeling good about the first half of the year. So I would say that, that is the accurate forecast of where we are. Clearly, if we see the continued high level of activity that we're already seeing in January, and we see that play out in the year, just by definition, the numbers are going to be very strong.  
But again, just to put it in context, last year, I would encourage anyone that has a question about the activity levels in the health care market, we issued a report on the robustness of the public markets for the health care sector. 
And there's no question last year was the best year, period, end of story. And so it is really hard to predict and maybe impossible to predict that you're going to have back-to-back record years because some of that equity is really a pull forward of raises that we would expect to see in '21. 
So now some of these companies have 3 or 4 years' worth of cash on their balance sheet, public biotech companies. Could they go out and do more? It's possible, but unlikely. So I would say the forecast that we have in there is what we expect in that range.

I mean, clearly, we see a lot of other banks that are active now in capital call lending. 
So would love to get your thoughts on that front as well as your other lending areas. But -- and then maybe even maybe a competitive assessment on where you stand in general in some of your other [indiscernible] areas."

But here's a couple of ways to think about it. One is -- first of all, it's a competitive market. So let's -- we'll acknowledge that. 
And as banks feel more comfortable with their results, they're leaning in and asking where growth can come from. And clearly, we're -- our market, as evidenced by our performance is a place where people are looking. But it's been that way for a long time that this has been the market that people are looking at. 
And so what have we tried to do to compete against that? Well, there's a lot of things. One is just strategically, and I said this in -- earlier in answer to a question, is that the more that we can provide one-stop shopping across all the needs of our clients and not just doing an okay job but doing exceptional job why would you go any other place.
So you think about it from a commercial bank perspective and what Mike and his whole team is doing, it is exceptional. And there's ways that we can even improve it and make it better. You can look at what we're doing in SVB Capital. And it's not just the investments we're making, but it's also the new capabilities they have with the acquisition that we did with West River Group and the debt capabilities that expands our capacity to lend money to those commercial bank clients. 
You've got the investment bank with SVB Leerink, and they have done -- as well as they have done, and they've done an unbelievable job. The team is not resting on its laurels. We're looking at bringing on new teams, new capabilities, which we'll be announcing shortly. 
And thinking about technology investment banking. So I think about expanding in those areas, again, it goes back to being able to help our clients in all their needs. And finally is the private banking and wealth. 
And with the acquisition of Boston Private, again, if we can add value to our clients in all 4 of those areas and do an exceptional job for them, right, that's competitive differentiation. And that's why we're so focused on executing on that strategy. 
So is it competitive? Absolutely. But we've shown that we can deliver for our clients. And to be honest, we're just getting started in building out the full platform. And that, I think, is going to be, as I said, the biggest competitive differentiator over time. I'll turn it over to Mike to add some additional color."

Maybe just a few things, John, just to think about it. Well,  you mentioned global funds banking specifically. As you saw here in this quarter, we had basically a record quarter for the team, so the team is the best platform in the business. And so they continue to do extraordinary well, extraordinarily well, and there's a lot of opportunities in front of us as well, no doubt. 
When you start to think about the tech and life sciences, a lot of the competition is -- comes in the form of debt funds as well. And Greg mentioned, our acquisition of West River Group extends our capabilities for off-balance-sheet activities like that from the debt funds as well, too. 
But the teams are doing extraordinarily well as well there. But then shifting to, we don't talk about a lot, but the deposit franchise as well, too, is incredibly strong. Our client acquisitions essentially another record quarter in Q4 and the quality that we're getting just continues to improve. And it's not at the early stage, but it's also at the accelerated stage that we're making really great progress as well, too. 
So we feel very good about client acquisition. And that really is the key, and we just do a lot of things right and being relevant to our clients. And then you mentioned kind of in the fee areas,  let me just touch upon a little bit of that as well, too. But it really gets back to the capabilities that we have to deliver to our clients, the expansion of our product set as well, too, which we've been very focused on over the last couple of years. 
And so I know some of the fee income items took a bit of hit during COVID, but you saw FX had another record quarter. Again, a lot of that is with some -- a lot of our -- as we expand our private equity clients as well to as we extend our global reach as well, whether it's in London or Asia as well, too, that just continues to be strong. 
And similarly, on the [ card ] side as well, too, again, enhancements in some of the product set and putting it in the hands of our clients as well as we acquire them when they come on board here. As well, again, we're going to -- we're starting to get back to COVID levels, excluding travel, but we are starting to get back and see some of that volume come back significantly as well.  
So we feel pretty good where we're at in terms of the competitive front and look for more to come."

The trend of 1,500 has been consistent with the last few quarters and has been at near-record levels. So we are thrilled with the level of new client growth that we have. 
Now kind of peeling that the onion and understanding of a little bit more where it's coming from, I'd break it down into 2 different ways. First of all, it's our start-up banking team. These are the companies that are just being formed, pre-venture capital backed. And we have an absolutely exceptional team there. And what to me is so impressive about what they have done and what they're building is it's all about how you add value to these companies, how can you be a mentor, how can you be a coach, how can you give them advice to, as we like to say, increase their probability of success. 
And what they're working on is making sure the companies are working with are -- have the highest potential of getting that next round of -- or first round of equity financing. So I think that the team that is coming together to do that is really -- the quality is really -- the quality of the team is driving the quality of the results. 
So that is a big portion of those 1,500 clients. But what we've seen in the last couple of quarters, quite honestly, gets me even more excited, which is we've had an uptick in wins in what I'll call venture-backed mid -- early mid-stage and even later-stage companies, just new wins. 
And the only way that happens, again, it goes back to what I said earlier, an incredible team but it's also how we come together to deliver for them across our product set. And so while the 1,500 clients is a very high level, again, what excites me is the quality of companies that exist in that 1,500. 
And do I think that's going to continue? I certainly expect it to from a quality perspective, the number of companies will certainly be a function of how -- the markets, the activity levels and so forth. But to me, there's no reason that we would see that slow down, at least as I see it. So feeling really good about that number and feeling really good about the quality. Mike, I don't know if you have anything to add to it?"

So that's where -- if we see curve steepening in 2021, we'll start to see those benefits really push through at least in the short term. Obviously, we still remain asset sensitivity -- asset sensitive to short rate movements.  But at this point, obviously, aren't expecting a change in Fed funds. So really paying attention to that 3- to 5-year range. That's where we're putting the investment securities portfolio to work.

So first, on the lending side, since the majority of the loan portfolio is variable rate, and is really tied -- the majority of that is tied to prime rate, the resets there have really occurred. So that's really all priced through the majority of the loan book at this point. The only exception being the mortgage portfolio, and obviously, we have been seeing new -- good and new activity there and some pretty decent yield stability. 
So I think when I look at loans on an overall basis, we feel good. Over the next year, maybe you'll see, on average, a 10 -- 5 to 10 basis point decline in overall yields. The investment securities portfolio is another story. That's where we are seeing paydowns in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion a quarter range. And obviously, that money is being reinvested at today's rates. 
So that's being reinvested in this, let's call it, 110 to 130 type of range. So that's going to continue to be a drag on the overall yield from the investment portfolio perspective. And that's going to take, if you just look at the duration of the book, another couple of years to price all the way through. 
So that's the way to think about it. We're still not done, and we've reflected all of the repricing activity that we expect and the new purchases into the net interest income and the NIM guidance for the year."

We have a recent history of doing that, and we've got the flexibility to be able to do it. So I think that allows, especially as we look at the Tier 1 leverage ratio, the flexibility for us to be able to manage that. 
In terms of the capacity as the holding company, if we look at the amount of liquidity that remains there, we're sitting right now roughly $700 million. And that's after downstreaming close to $700 million to the bank in order to support the Tier 1 leverage ratio.

There's a couple of things that drove higher expenses at the end of the year with SVB Leerink to being one of those components, clearly, their incredible results in 2020 and just a higher payout ratio. 
So you look at that and say, that's a big number. So if you pull back a little bit on the revenue forecast, that will have an impact on expenses. We had a real estate write down on some leases that we looked at. And the other the fees that we're donating for PPP. So when you add up all those things that actually is a pretty big number. 
So if you normalize all that, we actually do have nice growth built in for '21. And so we are investing in the same places that were -- have been in the past. We're actually increasing the investments we're making and have been making in infrastructure. 
And the one thing I would say, if you look at the last part is if the performance of the bank or if SVB Leerink outperforms those expenses will be on the higher end. So we do have capacity in there to invest in the business, and we're investing more than we did last year. And so we feel good about the level that you have in there.

So yes, the year-over-year guide looks low. But to Greg's point, when you strip all of that out, the investment levels much more along the lines of our traditional high single digits investment pace from an operating expense perspective on a much bigger number.

It's -- I haven't gone through and done the analysis to say exactly what contributed to the growth and [indiscernible] out between the 2 things the way I think about your question. One is the markets that we serve and then our ability to execute. 
There's no question that the markets that we serve, when you look at Slide 8, where we try to describe the level of venture capital activity, PE activity, and you can look at public markets, as you know, all of those have been incredibly strong. So that's the kind of the tailwind that we have based on the success of the market that we're in. 
But I would also say, when I think about what we've been doing to build out our capabilities, so you can look at health care and life sciences with SVB Leerink, we get a benefit from having that being on our platform because we're able to do more with health care, life science companies, so our market share is going up. 
You can look at the quality of deals that we're doing in later stage, winning more syndications than we have in the past. And so working with later-stage companies and keeping our market share, in fact, increasing our market share. 
And the final point is the market share we're having with what I would say is the best or the highest quality companies. All 3 of those things have improved. And so when you think about that and you add to that, the global presence that we have, all those things combined really are about execution. 
So what you see the results that we're delivering, or we delivered in 2020 and what we certainly expect in '21 is a combination of an incredibly strong market and then secondly the execution that we've had and the share improvement that we've seen as well."

So when I think about where the risks are, so you got a public market that is very strong. Valuations are high, and that's trickling down into private markets. 
You have very few places globally for investment dollars to flow, right? Fixed income is really difficult because rates are so low. Real estate and other investments that would historically be places that money would be deployed, there's so much uncertainty around that, that you're not seeing money deployed there. 
So you look at those things and you see where is growth coming from? It's the innovation economy, both tech and life sciences. So that's what's driving it. So what could derail it? Well, if public markets all of a sudden valuations dropped substantially in tech and health care companies and IPO slow down dramatically and valuations take a hit, that will trickle down into private markets. 
Now as I said, why don't I believe that will happen. I believe it won't happen because there are a very few places for that money to be deployed. Growth is being driven in these markets and I expect that to continue. 
And then the final piece is our strategy about taking out kind of the 4 pillars; commercial bank, the private bank, SVB Capital and investment banking are all part of that strategy. So I believe from a market perspective, the market is healthy. And while it may soften a little bit, I certainly believe that it's the best place in the long run to invest. 
And so I don't think you're going to see a slowdown in the long run. It's more about could there be volatility in the short run or medium term, that's clearly a possibility."

And the quality of companies that we're winning are the higher-quality companies. So our market share with the best companies is improving. 
And as you know, if you're in the best companies, the returns that are being driven by the top companies are greatly outsized compared to average or below-average companies. So our ability to be in the best companies helps to drive those gains, number one. Number two is the product set. So when you think about the breadth of product set that we have, where it's mezzanine debt, it's acquisition financing, it's early stage, it's late stage, it's across the board, there's a variety of different ways where you can participate in the upside, and the team has done an excellent job of delivering on that. And again, these gains aren't coming from deals that were done this year, these gains are what was being derived from deals that were done 3 years, 4 years and 5 years ago or longer. And now those benefits are being realized. 
So from that standpoint, again, we think about the number of warrants that we're taking in companies, we think about the new products we're offering. We're trying to work as hard as we can to come up with new products, new solutions that allow us to continue to build on those equity positions that we have had over a period of time. 
And then finally, in SVB Capital, the amount of money that we're putting under management, raising new funds, direct funds and fund to funds has also been substantial. And while those take a while to realize the carried interest and the other benefits, we certainly expect that to continue over time. 
So just like the last question, we'll see some volatility but we certainly feel good about the long-term return of those investments and the loans we're making in the innovation economy."

And while their burn rates may increase, right? when their burn rates may increase, we don't believe it will have a substantial impact. 
So part of it is the starting point of where we finished the year, and we do have growth built into it. But as we talk to our teams, as we talk to venture capitalists, we remain optimistic about how '21 will play out. 
And if you look at public markets, I know we're early in the new year, but they have remained robust. You can look at, again, the activity levels that SVB Leerink has and their public offerings in the press releases as I always reference that as a way to gauge how well they're doing, they've had incredible number of deals already this year. And what I've heard from the technology investment banks in the market is their pipeline is incredibly strong.  
So we certainly believe, at least as far as we can see, that the momentum will continue, maybe not at the same pace, but probably not at the same pace we saw in the fourth quarter, but it's still going to be healthy. Dan or Mike, do you guys want to add anything to that?"

We, for our guidance, didn't forecast an identical 2020, we are looking at something that's closer to a 2019. But since we're in a lower rate environment, more of that is going to find its way on the balance sheet than off the balance sheet. 
So I think when we look at all of those things, there's plentiful liquidity, we think it will be invested in the space. And when we look at lower rates and compare that back to where we were in 2019, we think we're at the jumping-off point and that this is a reasonable guide."

And as you see the economic forecast that are a key driver of the CECL reserve methodology, improve in Q3 and Q4, you see some of those reserves come down. And so just going to our funded reserve, we were at 99 basis points in the fourth quarter. 
And that compares to the fourth quarter of '19 in basis points terms, pretty accurately. Having said that, if our portfolio composition was consistent with where we were at the end of 2019, then yes, apples-to-apples, we still have a reserve that's higher than pre-COVID. 
And I think the presumption is that if things continue to be stable in credit, the economy continues to improve, then like others, we, too, would get back to where we were pre-COVID, not quite there yet."

But I would say the best way to gauge how they're doing is, again, just look at the press releases they're giving out.

So I think it's a good indication. Predicting what's going to happen in the balance of the year isn't easy. I would say that we were expecting or going to be forecasting a lower number than what we have in here. But again, as we talk with the leadership team of SVB Leerink, feeling good about the first half of the year. So I would say that, that is the accurate forecast of where we are. Clearly, if we see the continued high level of activity that we're already seeing in January, and we see that play out in the year, just by definition, the numbers are going to be very strong.  
But again, just to put it in context, last year, I would encourage anyone that has a question about the activity levels in the health care market, we issued a report on the robustness of the public markets for the health care sector. 
And there's no question last year was the best year, period, end of story. And so it is really hard to predict and maybe impossible to predict that you're going to have back-to-back record years because some of that equity is really a pull forward of raises that we would expect to see in '21. 
So now some of these companies have 3 or 4 years' worth of cash on their balance sheet, public biotech companies. Could they go out and do more? It's possible, but unlikely. So I would say the forecast that we have in there is what we expect in that range.

If we look at the other factors, we look at lending, we look at the deposit side of the equation, those will roughly stay flat. You might see up to 10 basis point reduction from a lending perspective, just mostly because of loan mix.

And as banks feel more comfortable with their results, they're leaning in and asking where growth can come from. And clearly, we're -- our market, as evidenced by our performance is a place where people are looking. But it's been that way for a long time that this has been the market that people are looking at. 
And so what have we tried to do to compete against that? Well, there's a lot of things. One is just strategically, and I said this in -- earlier in answer to a question, is that the more that we can provide one-stop shopping across all the needs of our clients and not just doing an okay job but doing exceptional job why would you go any other place.
So you think about it from a commercial bank perspective and what Mike and his whole team is doing, it is exceptional. And there's ways that we can even improve it and make it better. You can look at what we're doing in SVB Capital. And it's not just the investments we're making, but it's also the new capabilities they have with the acquisition that we did with West River Group and the debt capabilities that expands our capacity to lend money to those commercial bank clients. 
You've got the investment bank with SVB Leerink, and they have done -- as well as they have done, and they've done an unbelievable job. The team is not resting on its laurels. We're looking at bringing on new teams, new capabilities, which we'll be announcing shortly. 
And thinking about technology investment banking. So I think about expanding in those areas, again, it goes back to being able to help our clients in all their needs. And finally is the private banking and wealth. 
And with the acquisition of Boston Private, again, if we can add value to our clients in all 4 of those areas and do an exceptional job for them, right, that's competitive differentiation. And that's why we're so focused on executing on that strategy. 
So is it competitive? Absolutely. But we've shown that we can deliver for our clients. And to be honest, we're just getting started in building out the full platform. And that, I think, is going to be, as I said, the biggest competitive differentiator over time. I'll turn it over to Mike to add some additional color."

When you start to think about the tech and life sciences, a lot of the competition is -- comes in the form of debt funds as well. And Greg mentioned, our acquisition of West River Group extends our capabilities for off-balance-sheet activities like that from the debt funds as well, too. 
But the teams are doing extraordinarily well as well there. But then shifting to, we don't talk about a lot, but the deposit franchise as well, too, is incredibly strong. Our client acquisitions essentially another record quarter in Q4 and the quality that we're getting just continues to improve. And it's not at the early stage, but it's also at the accelerated stage that we're making really great progress as well, too. 
So we feel very good about client acquisition. And that really is the key, and we just do a lot of things right and being relevant to our clients. And then you mentioned kind of in the fee areas,  let me just touch upon a little bit of that as well, too. But it really gets back to the capabilities that we have to deliver to our clients, the expansion of our product set as well, too, which we've been very focused on over the last couple of years. 
And so I know some of the fee income items took a bit of hit during COVID, but you saw FX had another record quarter. Again, a lot of that is with some -- a lot of our -- as we expand our private equity clients as well to as we extend our global reach as well, whether it's in London or Asia as well, too, that just continues to be strong. 
And similarly, on the [ card ] side as well, too, again, enhancements in some of the product set and putting it in the hands of our clients as well as we acquire them when they come on board here. As well, again, we're going to -- we're starting to get back to COVID levels, excluding travel, but we are starting to get back and see some of that volume come back significantly as well.  
So we feel pretty good where we're at in terms of the competitive front and look for more to come."

This quarter in your CEO letter, you talked about the 1,500 clients that you guys added during the quarter.  Can you give some color on how those new client wins came about?

Bill, I'll start, and my guess is Michael want to add to it. The trend of 1,500 has been consistent with the last few quarters and has been at near-record levels.

The trend of 1,500 has been consistent with the last few quarters and has been at near-record levels. So we are thrilled with the level of new client growth that we have. 
Now kind of peeling that the onion and understanding of a little bit more where it's coming from, I'd break it down into 2 different ways. First of all, it's our start-up banking team. These are the companies that are just being formed, pre-venture capital backed. And we have an absolutely exceptional team there. And what to me is so impressive about what they have done and what they're building is it's all about how you add value to these companies, how can you be a mentor, how can you be a coach, how can you give them advice to, as we like to say, increase their probability of success. 
And what they're working on is making sure the companies are working with are -- have the highest potential of getting that next round of -- or first round of equity financing. So I think that the team that is coming together to do that is really -- the quality is really -- the quality of the team is driving the quality of the results. 
So that is a big portion of those 1,500 clients. But what we've seen in the last couple of quarters, quite honestly, gets me even more excited, which is we've had an uptick in wins in what I'll call venture-backed mid -- early mid-stage and even later-stage companies, just new wins. 
And the only way that happens, again, it goes back to what I said earlier, an incredible team but it's also how we come together to deliver for them across our product set. And so while the 1,500 clients is a very high level, again, what excites me is the quality of companies that exist in that 1,500. 
And do I think that's going to continue? I certainly expect it to from a quality perspective, the number of companies will certainly be a function of how -- the markets, the activity levels and so forth. But to me, there's no reason that we would see that slow down, at least as I see it. So feeling really good about that number and feeling really good about the quality. Mike, I don't know if you have anything to add to it?"

So that's where -- if we see curve steepening in 2021, we'll start to see those benefits really push through at least in the short term. Obviously, we still remain asset sensitivity -- asset sensitive to short rate movements.  But at this point, obviously, aren't expecting a change in Fed funds. So really paying attention to that 3- to 5-year range. That's where we're putting the investment securities portfolio to work.

So first, on the lending side, since the majority of the loan portfolio is variable rate, and is really tied -- the majority of that is tied to prime rate, the resets there have really occurred. So that's really all priced through the majority of the loan book at this point. The only exception being the mortgage portfolio, and obviously, we have been seeing new -- good and new activity there and some pretty decent yield stability. 
So I think when I look at loans on an overall basis, we feel good. Over the next year, maybe you'll see, on average, a 10 -- 5 to 10 basis point decline in overall yields. The investment securities portfolio is another story. That's where we are seeing paydowns in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion a quarter range. And obviously, that money is being reinvested at today's rates. 
So that's being reinvested in this, let's call it, 110 to 130 type of range. So that's going to continue to be a drag on the overall yield from the investment portfolio perspective. And that's going to take, if you just look at the duration of the book, another couple of years to price all the way through. 
So that's the way to think about it. We're still not done, and we've reflected all of the repricing activity that we expect and the new purchases into the net interest income and the NIM guidance for the year."

But obviously, as part of our discussions, we're talking about what's going to be -- what's the -- when we close the deal, like, what's going to happen and how long it will take. We're spending a lot of time talking about the go-to-market strategy and how that will work, and we're optimistic. But let's just assume for the second that the deal closed as we expected to. 
We're looking at making sure we've got the right teams focused on the right opportunities and making sure that those referrals are going to come from the commercial bank. You'll see that in mortgages, which we expect to expand clearly from where we are and where Boston Private is. So that's one big area. We look to expand in specialty lending. That's lending to these high net worth individuals in the innovation economy. 
And then there's obviously the wealth opportunity, and that's one of the key reasons this fee income around wealth. How fast that will come, even we're not ready yet to kind of share that plan. But clearly, at the next earnings call, we'll take a more focused approach in rolling that out as we get closer to the announcement date and the final close. Again, assuming everything goes well."

And so this has been what we have been working on for quite a while. It's just gotten accelerated given the growth that we have seen over the last 12 months. 
And so it's -- if you were to say, could we get to $600 billion on what we have right now today, the answer is no, probably not. But we know that, which is why we're making investments. So we've upped our guidance on expenses. Part of that is going to, again, building out infrastructure, supporting growth. And on Slide 11, you see all the areas that we're investing in, and those are important. But there's both what our capabilities are and what the market opportunity. And the market opportunity over time, clearly, is substantial. 
You can -- you guys read this every day. The attention that's being given to the broad innovation economy, both domestically and globally, has never been this high. And while it may be volatile, I'm certainly betting, we're betting on it continuing to go up and to the right over the long run. It's a huge market.

But then globally, there's also different requirements when you hit certain thresholds. In the U.K., 1 of those thresholds is the amount of deposits you have to smaller companies. And that definition is there's a revenue definition. There's other definitions. And as you know, we have companies that are both substantial in size but actually have very low revenue. And so that still contributes to crossing that threshold. So as we head down a path to create a subsidiarization in the U.K. that is also building our capabilities. And so we have LFI domestically, and we have the subsidiarization in the U.K., all of which is building infrastructure to support our longer-term growth."

But the pipeline, and you know this and many other people do as well, is still incredibly strong. And so we expect the exit market to still be healthy for the balance of the year. Could it be bumpy? Probably, we would expect it to. But my view is then the other part of the market may pick up more than the capital markets. It could be M&A, and it probably will be M&A. So when we think about growing the business from an exit perspective, it is M&A and capital markets, equity capital markets. And if it slows down, maybe we'll see greater loan growth in the technology and life science portfolio. That's usually what happens. We're competing right now as much with liquidity coming from public markets and large private rounds as we are anything else. And so a slowdown in that would expectedly show some pickup in loan outstanding. So we feel -- whichever way it goes, we're positioned well to take advantage of those opportunities."

The answer is absolutely. So there is no slowdown in our desire to drive more loan growth in those segments. And maybe one other point that you've seen and maybe this is driving the question is the percentage of early-stage lending relative to total lending, it's down to 3%. It's still been growing. It's just the rest of the portfolio is growing at such a rapid pace that it becomes a lower percentage of the overall loan portfolio.

Obviously, it's not necessarily a huge piece of the loan portfolio. But certainly, it will get the boats there. 
Moving on to kind of the fee income. When we start to see more pent-up demand opening the economy, you're going to start to see credit card fees, right? So people spending and traveling and moving around, so we should potentially benefit from the credit card activity as well as potentially some of the FX and deal activities as well. As people start to move around, there are certain groups of people that maybe been holding back in terms of deal activity. Maybe they'll start to do more deals, cross-border deals as well, too. So again, since there's been some limitations on travel international. So I think that could certainly open up some cross-border deal activity. 
So again, I think the opening of the economy, the pent-up demand is a net-net positive to us overall."

So could there be some softness in deposits on a quarterly basis or maybe in a few quarters? Possibly if the market really started to soften. But I'll go back to what I said in answering a few other questions, which is just about the innovation economy, and how you really do look at this innovation market domestically and globally.

And I think what we would continue to do is take the practice that we have and put that excess liquidity to work. Again, understanding that we've got about $3 billion of cash flow coming off of that portfolio. At the same time, we've got enough short-term in not AFS available for sale portfolio. That's to the extent that we need to dip into that liquidity. We can certainly do it. So we're protecting at least on the short-term with what we've got in available for sale, and we're certainly investing both in the longer duration and health to maturity and what we're doing in the available for sale portfolio. Now to your question on how do we look at deployment, we've certainly added more to the municipal bond portfolio that's close to a $3.5 billion book at least at this point. And I think we have continued room to grow that, especially with the potential for tax reform coming here in the coming year or so. So we're going to continue to deploy. We've got the room to do it.

And so while we have, of course, in the wake of something like this, taking a look at everything we do, the conclusion we've ultimately come to is it's a good opportunity to reinforce through training and awareness that we need to be on guard against this kind of thing. And that really is the extent of it. I'll stop there and invite anybody else to chime in and wish okay. All right. And I promise, my last one is just on the operating efficiency ratio. I know it's a 58.5% here for the first quarter. Can you give us maybe your expectation on how we should think about the full year and maybe long-term for that ratio, what your expectations are? Yes. John, I think the best way to look at it is we are clearly going to continue to invest in the franchise. We're a growth company, and it absolutely makes sense for us to put the money to work to be able to drive that. And I think in the first quarter, us paying for performance across the banking activity as well as the excellent performance of Svein, you see us investing in our initiatives, and that's certainly driving higher operating efficiency ratio. 
So I think as we look for the rest of the year, we'll certainly see continued the higher operating efficiency just because we're going to continue to invest because we see this growth opportunity ahead. Exactly where that's going to end up is so dependent upon what happens with more investment gains as well as what happens within the Leerink business, that it's hard to say exactly what that long run operating efficiency ratio should look like. 
But again, the focus here is on investment. We're a growth company, and it makes sense for us to put that money to work."

First of all, it starts with the client and what makes sense for the client. What we've said in the -- what we've done is built a much broader product set in allowing clients to choose options that make sense for them. If you look at last quarter, we're kind of in that 50-50 on and off balance sheet. And we have said in the past, that's a good -- that's a good place to be. That being said, could we see more of it move off balance sheet, just given where yields are. And so clearly, that's a possibility. But it starts with client preferences, and what they're looking for. Then secondly, it's the product set that we have, making sure we give those options to our clients. And then the third is we can look in a very small way change a little bit of behavior by moving some spreads around. 
But that's hard to do when rates are 0. And so it really does boil down to product set and client preference. So Dan or Mike, anything to add?"

When we think about capital, we're really thinking about 2 things. One is profitability and to it growth. What's really clear is that our profitability remains strong, and that could support strong balance sheet growth. The leverage ratios have been under pressure from exceptional growth in the last 2 quarters, and we obviously see that on the balance sheet. That exceptional deposit growth we saw in the first quarter continues to put pressure on the Tier 1 leverage ratio at the bank. So as Greg was talking about, we certainly are -- and you see it because 50% of the client inflows for the quarter went off balance sheet. So we're certainly we can and where it makes sense for the clients, moving deposits off the balance sheet to help buffer some of that impact. 
Our common equity transaction also this quarter helps free up additional capacity to support our growth. In the ways that we've done it in the past. So that includes preferred debt issuance to support the Tier 1 leverage ratio. And the markets have been open to us to do those transactions. And that provides very low cost, regulatory capital to us to be able to continue the growth. 
So when we look at all of those things, that's the way we're thinking about capital. And our risk-based capital measures remain very strong. If you look at CET1 at the holding company, we closed the quarter at about 12.2%. So all in, that's how we're thinking about capital."

So obviously, we've seen just incredible liquidity growth coming through the end of last year and continuing through the quarter. Based on [ review ] of that liquidity and the overall market conditions and how much incremental liquidity remains in the market, we are comfortable being able to put some of that money to work in longer duration in the held-to-maturity category, so think in the 3- to 5-year range. One of the things that gives us comfort with being able to do that is that in our available-for-sale maturity, we're also targeting a much shorter duration, think about something along the lines of a 2-year duration.

One -- and this is realistically post-Boston Private integration and the deal closing, assuming everything goes as we expect it will go. So looking at wealth management teams that fit into our strategy either from both cultural fit and a targeted market perspective. So that's one area that we'd be looking at. And the second area, we've talked about this for quite a while, is in technology investment banking. So we executed this past quarter on bringing in a health care services, med -- digital health team with Barry Blake leading that, and you've seen the announcements that we made about those hires. So that would be an example. But 2 other things that could happen are, one, in the wealth space, and the second one in technology investment banking. Outside of that, it's mostly targeted hires in many areas across the platform, but it really isn't what I would call a team-based approach."

We're looking at making sure we've got the right teams focused on the right opportunities and making sure that those referrals are going to come from the commercial bank. You'll see that in mortgages, which we expect to expand clearly from where we are and where Boston Private is. So that's one big area. We look to expand in specialty lending. That's lending to these high net worth individuals in the innovation economy. And then there's obviously the wealth opportunity, and that's one of the key reasons is fee income around wealth. How fast that will come, Ebrahim, we're not ready yet to kind of share that plan.

So this has been what we have been working on for quite a while. It's just gotten accelerated given the growth that we have seen over the last 12 months.
And so it's -- if you were to say, could we get to $600 billion on what we have right now today, the answer is no, probably not. But we know that, which is why we're making investments. So we've upped our guidance on expenses. Part of that is going to, again, building out infrastructure, supporting growth. And on Slide 11, you see all the areas that we're investing in, and those are important. But there's both what our capabilities are and what the market opportunity, and the market opportunity over time, clearly, is substantial.
You can -- you guys read this every day. The attention that's being given to the broad innovation economy, both domestically and globally, has never been this high. And while it may be volatile, I'm certainly betting -- we're betting on it continuing to go up and to the right over the long run.

But then globally, there's also different requirements when you hit certain thresholds. In the U.K., one of those thresholds is the amount of deposits you have to smaller companies, and that definition is -- there's a revenue definition. There's other definitions. And as you know, we have companies that are both substantial in size but actually have very low revenue. And so that still contributes to you crossing that threshold. So as we head down a path to create a subsidiarization in the U.K., that is also building our capabilities.

Could it be bumpy? Probably. We would expect it to. But my view is then the other part of the market may pick up more than the capital markets. It could be M&A, and it probably will be M&A. So when we think about growing the business from an exit perspective, it is M&A and capital markets, equity capital markets. And if it slows down, maybe we'll see greater loan growth in the technology and life science portfolio. That's usually what happens. We're competing right now as much with liquidity coming from public markets and large private rounds as we are anything else. And so a slowdown in that would expectedly show some pickup in loan outstanding. So we feel whichever way it goes, we're positioned well to take advantage of those opportunities."

The answer is absolutely. So there is no slowdown in our desire to drive more loan growth in those segments.
And maybe one other point that you've seen, and maybe this is driving the question, is the percentage of early-stage lending relative to total lending, it's down to 3%. It's still been growing. It's just the rest of the portfolio is growing at such a rapid pace that it becomes a lower percentage of the overall loan portfolio.

Obviously, it's not necessarily a huge piece of the loan portfolio. But certainly, it will lift the boats there.
Moving on to kind of the fee income. When we start to see more pent-up demand, more opening of the economy, you're going to start to see credit card fees, right? So people spending and traveling and moving around. So we should potentially benefit from the credit card activity as well as potentially some of the FX deal activity as well. As people start to move around, there are certain groups of people that maybe been holding back in terms of deal activity.

So could there be some softness in deposits on a quarterly basis or maybe in a few quarters? Possibly if the market really started to soften.

And I think what we would continue to do is take the practice that we have and put that excess liquidity to work, again, understanding that we've got about $3 billion of cash flow coming off of that portfolio. At the same time, we've got enough short-term liquidity in that AFS, available for sale, portfolio. That's to the extent that we need to dip into that liquidity, we can certainly do it. So we're protecting at least on the short term with what we've got in available for sale, and we're certainly investing both in the longer duration and held to maturity and what we're doing in the available-for-sale portfolio.
Now to your question on how do we look at deployment, we've certainly added more to the municipal bond portfolio. That's close to a $3.5 billion book at least at this point. And I think we have continued room to grow that, especially with the potential for tax reform coming here in the coming year or so. So we're going to continue to deploy. We've got the room to do it, and that benefit of liquidity coming back to us every quarter give us a lot of flexibility to be able to do it."

So we're going to opportunistically deploy that. There was certainly a substantial amount of deployment in the first quarter, and that was occurring on the back of a very strong deposit growth quarter.
And obviously, you've seen the deposit trends into the first quarter. We thought that we had the ability to be able to put that to work faster than we otherwise would. Based on our forecast for the remainder of the year, I think you'll see us more progressively put that money to work over the coming quarters. So that -- there's no perfect answer to it, but I think it's going to be more progressive based on the forecast of liquidity and what we saw here in the first quarter."

What we've said in the past year is that what we've done is built a much broader product set in allowing clients to choose options that make sense for them. If you look at last quarter, we're kind of in that 50-50 on and off balance sheet. And we have said in the past that that's a good place to be. That being said, could we see more of it move off-balance sheet just given where yields are and so forth?
Clearly, that's a possibility, but it starts with client preferences and what they're looking for. Then secondly, it's the product set that we have, making sure we give those options to our clients. And then the third is we can look in a very small way change a little bit of behavior by moving some spreads around. But that's hard to do when rates are 0.

When we think about capital, we're really thinking about 2 things. One is profitability, and two is growth. What's really clear is that our profitability remains strong, and that could support strong balance sheet growth. The leverage ratios have been under pressure from exceptional growth in the last 2 quarters, and you obviously see that on the balance sheet. That exceptional deposit growth we saw in the first quarter continues to put pressure on the Tier 1 leverage ratio at the bank. So as Greg was talking about, we certainly are -- and you see it because 50% of the client inflows for the quarter went off-balance sheet. So we're certainly, where we can and where it makes sense for the clients, moving deposits off the balance sheet to help buffer some of that impact.
Our common equity transaction also this quarter helps free up additional capacity to support our growth in the ways that we've done in the past. So that includes preferred debt issuance to support the Tier 1 leverage ratio, and the markets have been open to us to do those transactions. And that provides very low-cost regulatory capital to us to be able to continue the growth. So when we look at all of those things, that's the way we're thinking about capital. And our risk-based capital measures remain very strong. If you look at CET1 at the holding company, we closed the quarter at about 12.2%. So all in, that's how we're thinking about capital."

I'd say on a regular basis, both internally and externally, I'm confident I have the best CEO job in banking and believe I probably have one of the best CEO jobs in any industry because of who I get to work with every day and our clients who are changing the world in a way that is incredibly inspiring. I get more energy and excitement from engaging with our clients and talking to our teams than almost anything. And so I feel incredibly fortunate. So I really want to thank the exec team, thank the Board of Directors, thank the entire SVB team and our clients for allowing me to have such a great job, and I couldn't be more excited about where we're going.
So thank you, everyone, for joining us, and we will talk next quarter. Take care."

So obviously, we've seen just incredible liquidity growth coming through the end of last year and continuing through the quarter. Based on the view of that liquidity and the overall market conditions and how much incremental liquidity remains in the market, we are comfortable being able to put some of that money to work in longer duration in the held-to-maturity category, so think in the 3- to 5-year range. One of the things that gives us comfort with being able to do that is that in our available-for-sale maturity, we're also targeting a much shorter duration, think about something along the lines of a 2-year duration. So that helps us reduce the other comprehensive income risk, also frees up liquidity for us to the extent that we need it. But based on the trends that we continue to see and the stability of the liquidity in the market, we're comfortable putting that type of money to work.
Now what are we investing in? We continue to invest in agency securities. This is also a mix of agency mortgage backs as well as agency CMOs in that 3- to 5-year maturity range."

But when you look at the portfolio, is there any reason not to assume that this continues? Because I think both ourselves and probably the rest of the Street has been sort of caught a little bit flat flipped quarter after quarter after quarter, just the amazing growth that you guys have been able to put up or gains in that portfolio.

So net-net, we're still going to be able to invest new money at anywhere between, let's call it, 135 and 145 while protecting against that OCI risk.

We're looking at making sure we've got the right teams focused on the right opportunities and making sure that those referrals are going to come from the commercial bank. You'll see that in mortgages, which we expect to expand clearly from where we are and where Boston Private is. So that's one big area. We look to expand in specialty lending. That's lending to these high net worth individuals in the innovation economy. And then there's obviously the wealth opportunity, and that's one of the key reasons is fee income around wealth. How fast that will come, Ebrahim, we're not ready yet to kind of share that plan. But clearly, at the next earnings call, we'll take a more focused approach and rolling that out as we get closer to the announcement date and the final close, again, assuming everything goes well."

We continue to add capabilities, and we do kind of every quarter look to reinforce and add to it. The growth that we've seen over the last 12 months, once we started seeing it, we started to really, I'll call it, start to double down on more infrastructure, thinking about getting ready for LFI, large financial institution, improving our risk management infrastructure across the board from a technology perspective. So this has been what we have been working on for quite a while. It's just gotten accelerated given the growth that we have seen over the last 12 months.
And so it's -- if you were to say, could we get to $600 billion on what we have right now today, the answer is no, probably not. But we know that, which is why we're making investments. So we've upped our guidance on expenses. Part of that is going to, again, building out infrastructure, supporting growth. And on Slide 11, you see all the areas that we're investing in, and those are important. But there's both what our capabilities are and what the market opportunity, and the market opportunity over time, clearly, is substantial.
You can -- you guys read this every day. The attention that's being given to the broad innovation economy, both domestically and globally, has never been this high. And while it may be volatile, I'm certainly betting -- we're betting on it continuing to go up and to the right over the long run.

And we saw that coming and we started preparing for it last year, and that will be things that we're doing that Dan can give you more perspective on or a better perspective on over the next quarters and years to make sure that we're compliant with all the LFI requirements.
But then globally, there's also different requirements when you hit certain thresholds. In the U.K., one of those thresholds is the amount of deposits you have to smaller companies, and that definition is -- there's a revenue definition. There's other definitions. And as you know, we have companies that are both substantial in size but actually have very low revenue. And so that still contributes to you crossing that threshold. So as we head down a path to create a subsidiarization in the U.K., that is also building our capabilities. And so we have LFI domestically, and we have the subsidiarization in the U.K., all of which is building infrastructure to support our longer-term growth."

But the pipeline, and you know this and many other people do as well, is still incredibly strong. And so we expect the exit market, Steve, to still be healthy for the balance of the year. Could it be bumpy? Probably. We would expect it to. 
But my view is then the other part of the market may pick up more than the capital markets. It could be M&A, and it probably will be M&A. So when we think about growing the business from an exit perspective, it is M&A and capital markets, equity capital markets. And if it slows down, maybe we'll see greater loan growth in the technology and life science portfolio. That's usually what happens. We're competing right now as much with liquidity coming from public markets and large private rounds as we are anything else. And so a slowdown in that would expectedly show some pickup in loan outstanding. So we feel whichever way it goes, we're positioned well to take advantage of those opportunities."

And so the team is doing a great job. In fact, our win rates are incredibly strong. The pipeline is incredibly strong. They're doing truly an amazing job. Is it being [ crowded up at ] liquidity? The answer is absolutely. So there is no slowdown in our desire to drive more loan growth in those segments.
And maybe one other point that you've seen, and maybe this is driving the question, is the percentage of early-stage lending relative to total lending, it's down to 3%. It's still been growing. It's just the rest of the portfolio is growing at such a rapid pace that it becomes a lower percentage of the overall loan portfolio. And so it's just -- it's a matter of our growth, and it's a matter of liquidity being incredibly strong out there."

Clearly, the pent-up demand, I think, is the real factor, and I think that is excellent in terms of potential going forward.

I mean when you think of ad tech industries, when you think of hospitality and travel and the innovative companies that we had that [ center ] and serve those areas, again, I think you could certainly see some pickup. Obviously, it's not necessarily a huge piece of the loan portfolio. But certainly, it will lift the boats there.
Moving on to kind of the fee income. When we start to see more pent-up demand, more opening of the economy, you're going to start to see credit card fees, right? So people spending and traveling and moving around. So we should potentially benefit from the credit card activity as well as potentially some of the FX deal activity as well. As people start to move around, there are certain groups of people that maybe been holding back in terms of deal activity. Maybe they'll start to do more deals -- cross-border deals as well, too, so again, since there's been some limitations on travel international. So I think that could certainly open up some cross-border deal activity. So again, I think the opening of the economy, the pent-up demand is a net-net positive to us overall."

And during that period of time, we only had one year where client funds dropped a little bit, and that was a minor drop from '08 to '09. But other than that, through cycles, we've been up and to the right. It's more of a question of what pace of growth that we have seen.
So could there be some softness in deposits on a quarterly basis or maybe in a few quarters? Possibly if the market really started to soften. But I'll go back to what I said in answering a few other questions, which is just about the innovation economy and how you really do look at this innovation market domestically and globally. And my view is this market is the place to be. It is going to continue to be -- to outpace most, if not all, other markets. And that, in turn, will drive liquidity and deposits, balance sheet funds.

I think as we take a look at the deployment of liquidity, our past practice and our continued objective is to continue to progressively put that excess liquidity to work. And you continue to see us put it to work and at the same time, you see now every quarter close to $3 billion of that portfolio of cash flow coming off. And I think that creates a lot of flexibility for us to be able to just continuously deploy the excess cash into investment securities.
In terms of a hard limit of how we'd go, we don't have one. And I think what we would continue to do is take the practice that we have and put that excess liquidity to work, again, understanding that we've got about $3 billion of cash flow coming off of that portfolio. At the same time, we've got enough short-term liquidity in that AFS, available for sale, portfolio. That's to the extent that we need to dip into that liquidity, we can certainly do it. So we're protecting at least on the short term with what we've got in available for sale, and we're certainly investing both in the longer duration and held to maturity and what we're doing in the available-for-sale portfolio.
Now to your question on how do we look at deployment, we've certainly added more to the municipal bond portfolio. That's close to a $3.5 billion book at least at this point. And I think we have continued room to grow that, especially with the potential for tax reform coming here in the coming year or so. So we're going to continue to deploy. We've got the room to do it, and that benefit of liquidity coming back to us every quarter give us a lot of flexibility to be able to do it."

When we think about capital, we're really thinking about 2 things. One is profitability, and two is growth. What's really clear is that our profitability remains strong, and that could support strong balance sheet growth. The leverage ratios have been under pressure from exceptional growth in the last 2 quarters, and you obviously see that on the balance sheet. That exceptional deposit growth we saw in the first quarter continues to put pressure on the Tier 1 leverage ratio at the bank. So as Greg was talking about, we certainly are -- and you see it because 50% of the client inflows for the quarter went off-balance sheet. So we're certainly, where we can and where it makes sense for the clients, moving deposits off the balance sheet to help buffer some of that impact.
Our common equity transaction also this quarter helps free up additional capacity to support our growth in the ways that we've done in the past. So that includes preferred debt issuance to support the Tier 1 leverage ratio, and the markets have been open to us to do those transactions. And that provides very low-cost regulatory capital to us to be able to continue the growth. So when we look at all of those things, that's the way we're thinking about capital. And our risk-based capital measures remain very strong. If you look at CET1 at the holding company, we closed the quarter at about 12.2%. So all in, that's how we're thinking about capital."

And in effect, the actions that we're taking with held to maturity, you can almost think of bit as a barbell. What we're doing is extending the duration in the held-to-maturity book in that 3- to 5-year range and shortening the duration on available for sale into that less than 2 years. But net-net, the overall position of the investment securities portfolio remains about the same. So you're thinking in the 3- to 4-year range on an all-in basis.
Obviously, that's going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on what's going on with the rates. But all-in, the intent is not to change the position of the total portfolio, but to protect against sudden rate movements in the available-for-sale portfolio. So if we look at the asset sensitivity we've got that included within our slide deck, we're still in a good place from a sensitivity perspective. And to the extent that we see rate movements, we would still benefit in a strong way from it."

Obviously, incredibly proud of what the institution has built over the last 10 years. I'd say on a regular basis, both internally and externally, I'm confident I have the best CEO job in banking and believe I probably have one of the best CEO jobs in any industry because of who I get to work with every day and our clients who are changing the world in a way that is incredibly inspiring. I get more energy and excitement from engaging with our clients and talking to our teams than almost anything. And so I feel incredibly fortunate. So I really want to thank the exec team, thank the Board of Directors, thank the entire SVB team and our clients for allowing me to have such a great job, and I couldn't be more excited about where we're going.

And especially during the pandemic, what we thought was going to be an issue ended up being -- really being a catalyst for growing the innovation economy. It slowed down for a brief period of time.

And then going back to what Greg was talking about earlier on in terms of this unpreceded flow of activities, I mean you're seeing, again, as you know, the dry powder is just sensational, but what you're also seeing is people crossing over and more going into the B.C. They're seeing the great returns. You see the STACK phenomenas as well that started to pick back up again. I know it dropped down in April. 
I mean you have nontraditional investors, the corporate venturing ones, the sovereign wealth funds, there's just a lot of funds going into it. And going back to what Greg is saying as well, too, is this acceleration phenomenon because of COVID, you have a lot of good ideas and business models that are being formed.

And so it's a pretty broad portfolio. You asked specifically about 2 areas. One is investment banking. And so I would say a couple of things about that. 
One is the existing business is doing exceptionally well. They're moving up the lead tables there they're getting incredible accolades, and I would say they're definitely a world-class investment bank in the life sciences area. And we basically said, we -- and we said this from the day that we brought Leerink onto the platform that we didn't want to just stay in health care, we wanted to actually build it out across other areas. Healthcare services and health tech, which we brought Barry Blake and a bunch of other people. And again, building out health care services into a world-class team. And now and as I've said this many times over the last 12 months, building out our technology investment banking side. So we're, I would say, expect to hear announcements from us formally in middle of August or around the middle of August to give you a lot more clarity on that. But there's no question we believe this is a big opportunity. 
And it really stems from the core business, which is the commercial bank and how deep those relationships are, the market share that we have, the relationships we have with those clients. And it's just a natural fit to then leverage and technology investment banking. So -- and that's going to be brought. It's going to be sponsor, finance being a big driver of it. It's going to be traditional M&A. It's also going to be ECM. And so we expect all those businesses to be built out and be built out later this year. 
Now from a return perspective, we expect that we're going to be continuing to make money this year on investment banking. And next year, as revenues start to pick back up or pick up, from both our core business, the health care business, technology and health care services that we would expect that to see very nice growth. 
What could it look like? I think we would expect, although it's early, that on the low end, maybe roughly $100 million of additional revenue from the new initiatives up to maybe $150 million. But again, it's very early, and the market is really going to dictate that along with how fast the teams get up to speed. But more to come on the investment banking side. 
Your second question was on private banking. And I just would go back to the slide that really is about our strategy, and that's really on Slide 11, which really lays out where we're headed as a company and how important that is. And on 11, you can see -- but again, the strength of Silicon Valley Bank is really the catalyst to then take clients and introductions to the private bank to Leerink and into SVB Capital. And in the private bank with the closing of Boston Private, you've dramatically upsized what our capabilities are. So we were just having a conversation today at our Board meeting where really we have the entire product set now the entire product set to take care of our clients. And it's the first time in our history. 
So we expect nice growth in that business. That growth is built into our forecast for the balance of '21. And next quarter, as we always do, we'll then take those forecasts and then start to give you a first-hand look of what we expect in 2022. So more to come in the next 90 days, Ebrahim."

But one of the catalysts to allow companies to stay private longer is making sure that employees and investors have liquidity, have access to liquidity. And we believe NASDAQ private market and this consortium that's being built is going to be a great solution for that. So very excited to be it to be a solution for our clients. 
And as we've laid out in some of the other investments that we've made, we've kind of highlighted other groups that will benefit. So the private bank will benefit because they're going to have more liquidity being generated from these individuals who are clients of ours. SVB Leerink, we'll be able to provide investors to that platform who will then look to purchase the stock of the private companies who are looking to sell or the individuals.

If you look at our annual guidance, we increased that outlook by 10%, and that excludes Boston Private and those integration costs, and Greg went through where those areas are. There's clearly a lot going on in expenses. And for this quarter, we're going to at least give a little bit more detail on Q3 and Q4, just so everybody is on the same page. 
So in Q3, our expenses will likely be in a range of $725 million to $750 million. And that includes Boston Private but excludes the restructuring charges. And then I'll drop back into the $720 million to $740 million range in Q4, again, including Boston Private and excluding the restructuring. Q3 is going to be elevated because that's the quarter that we expect to recognize a significant amount of the tech investment banking team higher. So that at least would give you a sense of where that run rate is Q3 and Q4. 
When we look at the integration and the integration of restructuring costs, we think that's going to be roughly about $100 million pretax in 2021 with roughly 80% to 90% of that coming through in Q3. 
But back to your original question, largely speaking, excluding the restructuring costs, we should come pretty close to offsetting the increase in the investment within the guidance."

So that's where you're seeing the pickup, at least in the yield. And we also had a good quarter just in the acquisition of municipal bonds. 
When we're acquiring, we put about $2 billion to work in the available-for-sale portfolio. We're buying much shorter-dated treasury securities. So obviously not picking up a ton there from a yield perspective, just making sure that we're continuing to build out that highly liquid part of the investment securities book. 
But all in, looking ahead, Ken, when we put the money to work, we think the purchase yield on an all-in basis will be kind of $120 million to $130 million based on today's environment with a substantial or the vast majority of the purchases we're making in our held to maturity.

And the third part is, again, the reason for the acquisition of Boston Private, as we said many times, it wasn't about cost savings as the primary objective or even a secondary objective, it was building on what they had and then adding it to what we had in our private bank to kind of build something unique. 
And so when you -- if you were to sit down and talk to the employees that are coming over, they want to be part of this platform. There's a high level of excitement. I think the number that I saw, I think, from an employee retention perspective so far, I think it was 98% coming over. So we feel really good about it. And I even feel better about it as we closed and we're getting together and talking and spending more time together and engaging clients very optimistic that our cultures fit.

So that's really the strategy that's going to translate at least based on how rates look today at purchases in the, let's call it, $120 million to $130 million perspective. for the remainder of the year.

And that's a competitive space. What we bring to the table is a wealth creation group of individuals that is like no other one. 
And when you take care of them at a very early time in their wealth creation cycle and you add value to them, and you spend time understanding specifically what they need, we believe we're going to be able to add a lot of deal flow to the wealth team and the private banking team that exists now in the combined teams.

And we've got several slides in the deck that actually show the net interest income expansion as well as the fee-based expansion because of the size of the portfolio and the additional basis points, we would get those funds. So don't want to move past that too quickly. 
But where could there be risk? To me, one of the areas is in securities and warrants. You could see risk there. You could see a slowdown in the pace of investment, which has been very, very, very rapid as people start to think there may be an alternative to investing in high-growth stocks. 
Here's why I think it could happen. But I -- at least I think the benefits are going to greatly outweigh the negatives. I think one of the things that this last months have showed is that, again, to repeat this many times, the innovation space is the place to be. And although when you look at the number, the amount of money that's going into venture capital this year, over $180 billion in the first half, it is a massive number, and it's a big number compared to where it has been. 
So when you think about that number relative to the global market and fund flows, right? It's still a small number. So I still believe that while there will be bumps along the way, that the venture capital and funds flow into innovation is still going to be up and to the right. And as we get bigger, we can support companies longer, and that target market or the available market will only get bigger and is only getting bigger. 
And so the second part that is on the warrants and securities gains and things like that. And as we've said, I mean that's a volatile number. You do have to pay attention to IPOs. You do have to pay attention to M&A. But actually, I think if you saw IPO start to slow down, I believe you're going to start to see more M&A. And so what's nice about having business that on the investment banking side that does both M&A and ECM is that if ECM starts to be slow, M&A, hopefully, will pick up or we expect it to pick up. 
So I mean those are things to pay attention to, but I don't believe they'll be as significant if it's just in some level of inflation. And I guess then I'll get my final one, my bias, which is, if we do see inflation, I actually think it's going to be modest. I don't think it's going to be something that would be a fundamental change that would cause the market to get overly spooked. But again, something to pay attention to, and that's just my own opinion."

So when we think about capital, we really think about 2 things. And one, you saw it in the quarter. just a continued strong profitability that we're generating, north of 20% from an ROE perspective. So we're certainly with the strong growth clearing that cost of capital. And second, support strong balance sheet growth going forward. Now this exceptional growth that we've seen over the last 3 to 4 quarters continues to put pressure on the ratio that we pay attention to the most, which is our Tier 1 leverage ratio at the bank. 
If you think about it, holding a client liquidity for us is absolutely key. We've been talking about it all day about the profitability and the growth for us to deepen with our clients holding those deposits is really the key to our long-term profitability. So in the quarter, from a capital markets transaction perspective, we raised additional capital through preferred and senior debt and that really help support that Tier 1 leverage ratio. So the markets have been open to us, and those transactions have been providing very low cost of regulatory capital to allow us to continue that excellent growth. 
So overall, we're really confident with our capital ratios, the risk-based measures, at 12% at the quarter end are in really good shape. And considering the substantial liquidity and low-risk securities that we have on the balance sheet, we're really confident with the capital levels overall. That said, we're a growth company. And if growth continues at the pace or rate that we've seen over the last 4 quarters, all options would be open to us. We think that would be a good thing that, that growth continues, and we do what we need to do to support that growth. 
On to your second question on Boston Private, we determined at the deal that it was an accretive transaction from a capital perspective, and it is playing out that way. It is going to provide not a significant amount of support, but it is going to be accretive to Tier 1 leverage as well as to the core capital ratio based on their capitalization and ultimately, where the purchase accounting now played out. 
So it will be a small improvement, slightly accretive to the overall capital position."

And so it's a pretty broad portfolio. You asked specifically about 2 areas. One is investment banking. And so I would say a couple of things about that. 
One is the existing business is doing exceptionally well. They're moving up the lead tables. They're getting incredible accolades, and I would say they're definitely a world-class investment bank in the life sciences area. And we basically said, we -- and we said this from the day that we brought Leerink onto the platform that we didn't want to just stay in health care, we wanted to actually build it out across other areas. Health care services and health tech, which brought Barry Blake and a bunch of other people, and again, building out health care services into a world-class team. And now and as I've said this many times over the last 12 months, building out our technology investment banking side. So we're, I would say, expect to hear announcements from us formally in middle of August or around the middle of August to give you a lot more clarity on that. But there's no question, we believe, this is a big opportunity. 
And it really stems from the core business, which is the commercial bank and how deep those relationships are, the market share that we have, the relationships we have with those clients. And it's just a natural fit to then leverage into technology investment banking. So -- and that's going to be brought. It's going to be sponsored, financed. Being a big driver of it, it's going to be traditional M&A. It's also going to be ECM. And so we expect all those businesses to be built out and be built out later this year. 
Now from a return perspective, we expect that we're going to be continuing to make money this year on investment banking. And next year, as revenues start to pick back up or pick up, from both our core business, the health care business, technology and health care services that we would expect that to see very nice growth. 
What could it look like? I think we would expect, although it's early, that on the low end, maybe roughly $100 million of additional revenue from the new initiatives up to maybe $150 million. But again, it's very early, and the market is really going to dictate that along with how fast the teams get up to speed. But more to come on the investment banking side. 
Your second question was on private banking. And I just would go back to the slide that really is about our strategy, and that's really on Slide 11, which really lays out where we're headed as a company and how important that is. And on 11, you can see that, again, the strength of Silicon Valley Bank is really the catalyst to then take clients and introductions to the private bank to a Leerink and to the SVB Capital. And in the private bank with the closing of Boston Private, you've dramatically upsized what our capabilities are. So we were just having a conversation today at our Board meeting where really we have the entire product set now, the entire product set to take care of our clients. And it's the first time in our history. 
So we expect nice growth in that business. That growth is built into our forecast for the balance of '21. And next quarter, as we always do, we'll then take those forecasts and then start to give you a first-hand look of what we expect in 2022. So more to come in the next 90 days, Ebrahim."

But one of the catalysts to allow companies to stay private longer is making sure that employees and investors have liquidity, have access to liquidity. And we believe NASDAQ private market and this consortium that's being built is going to be a great solution for that. So very excited to be -- it to be a solution for our clients. 
And as we've laid out in some of the other investments that we've made, we've kind of highlighted other groups that will benefit. So the private bank will benefit because they're going to have more liquidity being generated from these individuals who are clients of ours. SVB Leerink, will be able to provide investors to that platform who will then look to purchase the stock of the private companies who are looking to sell or the individuals. And so again, we believe it's for our clients, but it services the whole platform."

If you look at our annual guidance, we increased that outlook by 10%, and that excludes Boston Private and those integration costs, and Greg went through where those areas are. There's clearly a lot going on in expenses. And for this quarter, we're going to at least give a little bit more detail on Q3 and Q4, just so everybody is on the same page. 
So in Q3, our expenses will likely be in a range of $725 million to $750 million. And that includes Boston Private but excludes the restructuring charges. And then I'll drop back into the $720 million to $740 million range in Q4, again, including Boston Private and excluding the restructuring. Q3 is going to be elevated because that's the quarter that we expect to recognize a significant amount of the tech investment banking team higher. So that at least would give you a sense of where that run rate is, Q3 and Q4. When we look at the integration and the integration of restructuring costs, we think that's going to be roughly about $100 million pretax in 2021 with roughly 80% to 90% of that coming through in Q3.

We spent most of the time adding out in that kind of 4- to 5-year duration in those products. So that's where you're seeing the pickup at least in the yield. And we also had a good quarter just in the acquisition of municipal bonds. 
When we're acquiring, we put about $2 billion to work in the available-for-sale portfolio. We're buying much shorter-dated treasury securities. So obviously not picking up a ton there from a yield perspective, just making sure that we're continuing to build out that highly liquid part of the investment securities book. 
But all in, looking ahead, Ken, when we put the money to work, we think the purchase yield on an all-in basis will be kind of $120 million to $130 million based on today's environment with a substantial or the vast majority of the purchases we're making in our held to maturity. So I think that 3- to 5-year duration just based on today's rates."

So one is rolling over the incentive options and things like that, that are part of that, that continue to invest and were -- would be in the money given the appreciation of the stock price, the other retention. 
And the third part is, again, the reason for the acquisition of Boston Private, as we said many times, it wasn't about cost savings as the primary objective or even a secondary objective. It was building on what they had and then adding it to what we had in our private bank to kind of build something unique. And so when you -- if you were to sit down and talk to the employees that are coming over, they want to be part of this platform. There's a high level of excitement. I think the number that I saw, I think, from an employee retention perspective so far, I think it was 98% coming over. So we feel really good about it. 
And I even feel better about it as we closed and we're getting together and talking and spending more time together and engaging clients very optimistic that our cultures fit.

So it's Dan. I think as we look at the investment securities portfolio, a much bigger part of the bank's balance sheet today than it was 12 months ago, we've been positioning and really haven't changed the thought about it since last quarter to continue to buy excess liquidity in safe agency mortgage-backs, CMBS, and municipal bonds in that, let's call it, for 3- to 5-year duration. And to continue to invest in shorter treasury securities and shorter securities and available for sale, that allows for us to continue to put money to work and as good of a yield as we can possibly get, and at the same time, protect the available-for-sale portfolio and the OCI risk there from a capital perspective. 
So that's really the strategy that's going to translate at least based on how rates look today at purchases in the, let's call it, [ 120 to 130 ] perspective for the remainder of the year. But let's hope to see -- that we see some improvement in rates from here. But at today's rates, we think [ 120 to 130 ] makes sense."

And that's a competitive space. What we bring to the table is a wealth-creation group of individuals that is like no other one. 
And when you take care of them at a very early time in their wealth-creation cycle and you add value to them, and you spend time understanding specifically what they need, we believe we're going to be able to add a lot of deal flow to the wealth team and the private banking team that exists now in the combined teams.

And we've got several slides in the deck that actually show the net interest income expansion as well as the fee-based expansion because of the size of the portfolio and the additional basis points we would get on those funds. So I don't want to move past that too quickly. But where could there be risk? To me, one of the areas is in securities and warrants. You could see risk there. You could see a slowdown in the pace of investment, which has been very, very, very rapid as people start to think there may be an alternative to investing in high-growth stocks. 
Here's why I think it could happen. But I -- at least I think the benefits are going to greatly outweigh the negatives. I think one of the things that this 18 last months have showed is that, again, I have to repeat this many times, the innovation space is the place to be. And although when you look at the number, the amount of money that's going into venture capital this year, over $180 billion in the first half, it is a massive number, and it's a big number compared to where it has been. So when you think about that number relative to the global market and fund flows, right? It's still a small number. So I still believe that while there will be bumps along the way, that the venture capital and funds flow into innovation is still going to be up and to the right. And as we get bigger, we can support companies longer, and that target market or that available market will only get bigger and is only getting bigger. 
And so the second part that is on the warrants and securities gains and things like that. And as we've said, I mean that's a volatile number. You do have to pay attention to IPOs. You do have to pay attention to M&A. But actually, I think if you saw IPO start to slow down, I believe you're going to start to see more M&A. And so what's nice about having business that, on the investment banking side that does both M&A and ECM is that, if ECM starts to be slow, M&A, hopefully, will pick up or we expect it to pick up. So I mean those are things to pay attention to, but I don't believe they'll be as significant if it's just in some level of inflation. 
And I guess then I'll give my final, my bias, which is, if we do see inflation, I actually think it's going to be modest. I don't think it's going to be something that would be a fundamental change that would cause the market to get overly spooked. But again, something to pay attention to, and that's just my own opinion."

So when we think about capital, we really think about 2 things. And one, you saw it in the quarter. Just a continued strong profitability that we're generating, north of 20% from an ROE perspective. So we're certainly with the strong growth clearing that cost of capital. And second, support strong balance sheet growth going forward. Now this exceptional growth that we've seen over the last 3 to 4 quarters continues to put pressure on the ratio that we pay attention to the most, which is our Tier 1 leverage ratio at the bank. 
If you think about it, holding a client liquidity for us is absolutely key. We've been talking about it all day about the profitability and the growth. For us to deepen with our clients, holding those deposits is really the key to our long-term profitability. So in the quarter, from a capital markets transaction perspective, we raised additional capital through preferred and senior debt and that really help support that Tier 1 leverage ratio. So the markets have been open to us, and those transactions have been providing very low cost of regulatory capital to allow us to continue that excellent growth. 
So overall, we're really confident with our capital ratios. The risk-based measures, 12% at the quarter end are in really good shape. And considering the substantial liquidity and low-risk securities that we have on the balance sheet, we're really confident with the capital levels overall. That said, we're a growth company. And if growth continues at the pace or rate that we've seen over the last 4 quarters, all options would be open to us. We think that would be a good thing that, that growth continues, and we do what we need to do to support that growth. 
On to your second question on Boston Private. We determined at the deal that it was an accretive transaction from a capital perspective, and it is playing out that way. It is going to provide not a significant amount of support, but it is going to be accretive to Tier 1 leverage as well as to the core capital ratio based on their capitalization and ultimately, where the purchase accounting played out. So there'll be a small improvement, slightly accretive to the overall capital position."

And so it's a pretty broad portfolio. You asked specifically about 2 areas. One is investment banking. And so I would say a couple of things about that. 
One is the existing business is doing exceptionally well. They're moving up the lead tables. They're getting incredible accolades, and I would say they're definitely a world-class investment bank in the life sciences area. And we basically said, we -- and we said this from the day that we brought Leerink onto the platform that we didn't want to just stay in health care, we wanted to actually build it out across other areas. Health care services and health tech, which brought Barry Blake and a bunch of other people, and again, building out health care services into a world-class team. And now and as I've said this many times over the last 12 months, building out our technology investment banking side. So we're, I would say, expect to hear announcements from us formally in middle of August or around the middle of August to give you a lot more clarity on that. But there's no question, we believe, this is a big opportunity.

And it's just a natural fit to then leverage into technology investment banking. So -- and that's going to be brought. It's going to be sponsored, financed. Being a big driver of it, it's going to be traditional M&A. It's also going to be ECM. And so we expect all those businesses to be built out and be built out later this year. 
Now from a return perspective, we expect that we're going to be continuing to make money this year on investment banking. And next year, as revenues start to pick back up or pick up, from both our core business, the health care business, technology and health care services that we would expect that to see very nice growth. 
What could it look like? I think we would expect, although it's early, that on the low end, maybe roughly $100 million of additional revenue from the new initiatives up to maybe $150 million. But again, it's very early, and the market is really going to dictate that along with how fast the teams get up to speed. But more to come on the investment banking side. 
Your second question was on private banking. And I just would go back to the slide that really is about our strategy, and that's really on Slide 11, which really lays out where we're headed as a company and how important that is. And on 11, you can see that, again, the strength of Silicon Valley Bank is really the catalyst to then take clients and introductions to the private bank to a Leerink and to the SVB Capital. And in the private bank with the closing of Boston Private, you've dramatically upsized what our capabilities are. So we were just having a conversation today at our Board meeting where really we have the entire product set now, the entire product set to take care of our clients. And it's the first time in our history. 
So we expect nice growth in that business. That growth is built into our forecast for the balance of '21. And next quarter, as we always do, we'll then take those forecasts and then start to give you a first-hand look of what we expect in 2022. So more to come in the next 90 days, Ebrahim."

But one of the catalysts to allow companies to stay private longer is making sure that employees and investors have liquidity, have access to liquidity. And we believe NASDAQ private market and this consortium that's being built is going to be a great solution for that. So very excited to be -- it to be a solution for our clients. 
And as we've laid out in some of the other investments that we've made, we've kind of highlighted other groups that will benefit. So the private bank will benefit because they're going to have more liquidity being generated from these individuals who are clients of ours. SVB Leerink, will be able to provide investors to that platform who will then look to purchase the stock of the private companies who are looking to sell or the individuals. And so again, we believe it's for our clients, but it services the whole platform."

If you look at our annual guidance, we increased that outlook by 10%, and that excludes Boston Private and those integration costs, and Greg went through where those areas are. There's clearly a lot going on in expenses. And for this quarter, we're going to at least give a little bit more detail on Q3 and Q4, just so everybody is on the same page. 
So in Q3, our expenses will likely be in a range of $725 million to $750 million. And that includes Boston Private but excludes the restructuring charges. And then I'll drop back into the $720 million to $740 million range in Q4, again, including Boston Private and excluding the restructuring. Q3 is going to be elevated because that's the quarter that we expect to recognize a significant amount of the tech investment banking team higher. So that at least would give you a sense of where that run rate is, Q3 and Q4. When we look at the integration and the integration of restructuring costs, we think that's going to be roughly about $100 million pretax in 2021 with roughly 80% to 90% of that coming through in Q3. 
But back to your original question, largely speaking, excluding the restructuring costs, we should come pretty close to offsetting the increase in the investment within the guidance."

We added a small amount of corporates as well. So generally speaking, that's where we're adding, duration-wise, in the quarter. We spent most of the time adding out in that kind of 4- to 5-year duration in those products. So that's where you're seeing the pickup at least in the yield. And we also had a good quarter just in the acquisition of municipal bonds. When we're acquiring, we put about $2 billion to work in the available-for-sale portfolio. We're buying much shorter-dated treasury securities. So obviously not picking up a ton there from a yield perspective, just making sure that we're continuing to build out that highly liquid part of the investment securities book. 
But all in, looking ahead, Ken, when we put the money to work, we think the purchase yield on an all-in basis will be kind of 1.20% to 1.30% based on today's environment with a substantial or the vast majority of the purchases we're making in our held to maturity. So I think that 3- to 5-year duration just based on today's rates."

So one is rolling over the incentive options and things like that, that are part of that, that continue to invest and were -- would be in the money given the appreciation of the stock price, the other retention. 
And the third part is, again, the reason for the acquisition of Boston Private, as we said many times, it wasn't about cost savings as the primary objective or even a secondary objective. It was building on what they had and then adding it to what we had in our private bank to kind of build something unique. And so when you -- if you were to sit down and talk to the employees that are coming over, they want to be part of this platform. There's a high level of excitement. I think the number that I saw, I think, from an employee retention perspective so far, I think it was 98% coming over. So we feel really good about it. 
And I even feel better about it as we closed and we're getting together and talking and spending more time together and engaging clients very optimistic that our cultures fit.

So it's Dan. I think as we look at the investment securities portfolio, a much bigger part of the bank's balance sheet today than it was 12 months ago, we've been positioning and really haven't changed the thought about it since last quarter to continue to buy excess liquidity in safe agency mortgage-backs, CMBS, and municipal bonds in that, let's call it, for 3- to 5-year duration. And to continue to invest in shorter treasury securities and shorter securities and available for sale, that allows for us to continue to put money to work and as good of a yield as we can possibly get. And at the same time, protect the available-for-sale portfolio and the OCI risk there from a capital perspective. So that's really the strategy that's going to translate at least based on how rates look today at purchases in the, let's call it, [ 1.20% to 1.30% ] perspective for the remainder of the year. But let's hope to see -- that we see some improvement in rates from here. But at today's rates, we think [ 1.20% to 1.30% ] makes sense."

And as I think about Boston Private, their target market, generally speaking, was the same target market that most traditional private banking groups we're going after. And that's a competitive space. What we bring to the table is a wealth-creation group of individuals that is like no other one. 
And when you take care of them at a very early time in their wealth-creation cycle and you add value to them, and you spend time understanding specifically what they need, we believe we're going to be able to add a lot of deal flow to the wealth team and the private banking team that exists now in the combined teams.

And we've got several slides in the deck that actually show the net inte",502,"So John, I appreciate the question, but I also don't want to dismiss the first part, the positive part of the question, which is we would benefit significantly from increasing rates. And we've got several slides in the deck that actually show the net interest income expansion as well as the fee-based expansion because of the size of the portfolio and the additional basis points we would get on those funds. So I don't want to move past that too quickly. But where could there be risk? To me, one of the areas is in securities and warrants. You could see risk there. You could see a slowdown in the pace of investment, which has been very, very, very rapid as people start to think there may be an alternative to investing in high-growth stocks. 
Here's why I think it could happen. But I -- at least I think the benefits are going to greatly outweigh the negatives. I think one of the things that this 18 last months have showed is that, again, I have to repeat this many times, the innovation space is the place to be. And although when you look at the number, the amount of money that's going into venture capital this year, over $180 billion in the first half, it is a massive number, and it's a big number compared to where it has been. So when you think about that number relative to the global market and fund flows, right? It's still a small number. So I still believe that while there will be bumps along the way, that the venture capital and funds flow into innovation is still going to be up and to the right. And as we get bigger, we can support companies longer, and that target market or that available market will only get bigger and is only getting bigger. 
And so the second part that is on the warrants and securities gains and things like that. And as we've said, I mean that's a volatile number. You do have to pay attention to IPOs. You do have to pay attention to M&A. But actually, I think if you saw IPO start to slow down, I believe you're going to start to see more M&A. And so what's nice about having business that, on the investment banking side that does both M&A and ECM is that, if ECM starts to be slow, M&A, hopefully, will pick up or we expect it to pick up. So I mean those are things to pay attention to, but I don't believe they'll be as significant if it's just in some level of inflation. 
And I guess then I'll give my final, my bias, which is, if we do see inflation, I actually think it's going to be modest. I don't think it's going to be something that would be a fundamental change that would cause the market to get overly spooked. But again, something to pay attention to, and that's just my own opinion."

So when we think about capital, we really think about 2 things. And one, you saw it in the quarter. Just a continued strong profitability that we're generating, north of 20% from an ROE perspective. So we're certainly with the strong growth clearing that cost of capital. And second, support strong balance sheet growth going forward. Now this exceptional growth that we've seen over the last 3 to 4 quarters continues to put pressure on the ratio that we pay attention to the most, which is our Tier 1 leverage ratio at the bank. 
If you think about it, holding a client liquidity for us is absolutely key. We've been talking about it all day about the profitability and the growth. For us to deepen with our clients, holding those deposits is really the key to our long-term profitability. So in the quarter, from a capital markets transaction perspective, we raised additional capital through preferred and senior debt and that really help support that Tier 1 leverage ratio. So the markets have been open to us, and those transactions have been providing very low cost of regulatory capital to allow us to continue that excellent growth. 
So overall, we're really confident with our capital ratios. The risk-based measures, 12% at the quarter end are in really good shape. And considering the substantial liquidity and low-risk securities that we have on the balance sheet, we're really confident with the capital levels overall. That said, we're a growth company. And if growth continues at the pace or rate that we've seen over the last 4 quarters, all options would be open to us. We think that would be a good thing that, that growth continues, and we do what we need to do to support that growth. 
On to your second question on Boston Private. We determined at the deal that it was an accretive transaction from a capital perspective, and it is playing out that way. It is going to provide not a significant amount of support, but it is going to be accretive to Tier 1 leverage as well as to the core capital ratio based on their capitalization and ultimately, where the purchase accounting played out. So there'll be a small improvement, slightly accretive to the overall capital position."

Clearly, the growth that we've had in 2021 so far and what we expect to finish the year based on the guidance that we've given creates a lot of momentum into 2022. So there's a huge amount of benefit to the expansion of the balance sheet, the growth of core fee income, the investments we're making in investment banking and headcount, private banking and wealth, all that momentum clearly carries forward. And so there's kind of a tailwind, number one. 
Number two, we certainly expect the markets that we serve in innovation economy to continue to perform well, although not quite at the accelerated pace that we see right now. Nothing that we're seeing is causing that point of view. It's more of just -- it's hard to fathom that it will stay at this pace. 
And maybe a third category is this. I'm more convinced than ever that the strategy that we've laid out over the last couple of years, these 4 pillar businesses, the commercial bank, the private bank, SVB Capital and the investment bank, all working together is incredibly compelling for our clients. I'm hearing that firsthand. Our teams are hearing that.

So I'm, again, going back to your first question, that caused me to be bullish. And what we always believed was the case, the reason that we wanted to bring Boston Private onto platform because the opportunity was so great. And that, I would say, has shown up in spades. The excitement, the energy from the teams on the commercial banking side and the private banking side and basically saying what the opportunity is, is truly incredible. So it's -- we haven't got to a place yet. We forecast exactly what that assets under management will be like for 2022. But you should expect to see when we get to January and we released our numbers there, that we're going to give you a lot more details as we usually do across our guidance levels, and that will be one of those things that we comment more.

So when Greg always describing it, you can kind of break it down into 2 areas, the macro features as well as what we're doing to execute. And so when you look at the macro picture, the fundamentals are still extraordinarily strong. I mean we see the flows of funds come in. You see the amount of dry powder that's out there, some accounts, it's $2 trillion, $2.5 billion, $3 trillion tremendous amount of money. The amount of money being deployed in into the space from BC continues to grow the sizes the funds are growing multiple sources. So that -- those things just have not changed. 
And then on the execution front, I mean if you look at our client acquisition count when you go into the deck that we have here, we continue to bring those on, increase record numbers of clients. And what happens is it takes some time for them to get funded, and so you're seeing us accumulating effect. So we all believe that the fundamentals are in place. But as Greg says, I mean what we've been growing at is just such an extraordinary high pace. But I'll tell you, I'm really, really happy with kind of what you implied there in terms of if we can grow $10 billion, $11 billion per quarter. I think that's just a sensational growth as well, too. So again, nothing's fundamentally changed in our outlook."

Now so that's the risk, but let's talk about what are the -- and Mike did a great job of describing the things that are kind of pushed against that risk. The one place that is we're out in the market, and it's both in the United States and it's also international. If you go to the U.K. and Europe and you're in South America or you're in Asia, there is such momentum around the innovation economy in every market. And that, to me, what we've seen, even when there is a slowdown. So even when you go back to '15 or '16 and there was a temporary slowdown, even when you saw it at the beginning of the COVID crisis last year, you saw a quick downturn, but the return was incredibly fast. And people looked at it as an opportunity to say, ""Gosh, I was hesitant to jump in at these valuations, and now I want to come in because I want to be in the innovation economy."" So there's -- that's the risk, but there are so many things that are tailwinds to offset that risk that we certainly see on a daily basis."

So it's really the combination. It's really -- that is the way it should have been worded. 
Now what you didn't ask and -- but I will answer is this, which is what we're really excited about is, at some point, we certainly believe that there will be some rate increases. And we have a slide in the deck that goes through and talks about how spring loaded the balance sheet actually is for additional NII if we do see rate increases in Slide 19, and you can go through that and look at every 25% increase in the balance sheet the way it is right now is $106 million, again, modeled in on an annualized pretax basis for each 25 basis point increase. 
But in addition to that, with the first 25 basis point increase, we also expect somewhere between $195 million and $225 million of increased core fee income generated from the large balance sheet funds that we have. So again, 125 basis point increase, you could see revenue growth of roughly $311 million to -- I'm sorry, yes, $311 million to roughly $325 million or $330 million. So normalize after this, when the second rate increase happens, but the balance sheet is clearly spring loaded. So we're happy that we can continue to grow NII in a low-rate environment, but we're even more bullish when we do start to see some rate increases."

As you can see on Slide 13, it kind of goes through the different categories we have in investment banking in the technology side. And while we have -- we expect to be making some near-term announcements on the fintech capabilities. But the payments business, the product is in one category, one area and then investment banking is another."

So we feel good about the numbers that we talked about in the deck as far as the guidance for 2022. You clearly see a significant uplift in those numbers, and it's a combination of we have a world-class biotech health care team, ECM and building out M&A capabilities. We have a world-class health care services team in health tech and now have and are building out even more of a world-class technology investment banking team or innovation investment banking team, and so they're hitting the ground running. 
We have hired 43 technology and 44 health care services and health tech investment bankers year-to-date, which is effectively doubling the number of investment bankers we had on the SVB Leerink platform, and they are already on the platform and winning mandates. Now those mandates, as you know, especially for M&A and even for some of the IPOs, they take a little while from a green on signing something up until it closes. So some will happen this year, but we'll start to see that rolling into 2022, but feel very good about the outlook for next year. 
As we said, we still expect that next year, we'll be adding somewhere between 35 and 50 additional hires in technology, equity capital markets, fintech, equity research, et cetera. So we are still looking to add to it. But by the end of next year, we'll be more doing what I'll call incremental adds as opposed to what we've done last year or this year and next year. So really feel good about where we are. I've been on some client calls with some of the investment bankers, and they're just being incredibly well received, landing new deals already and feel really good about the outlook."

So as we did in the previous quarter, a common equity raise. What we've done after those common equity raises to be able to support growth is to go back to preferred, go back to senior debt to be able to support Tier 1 leverage. So we did, obviously, in the third quarter, do a common equity raise and feel good to the extent that growth continues that we can go back to the market and potentially look to preferred, look to senior to the extent that we need to bolster the capital position.

And again, when we look at these targets, these are obviously not sitting in the annual guidance for the year ahead. These are just, more generally speaking, as we've seen the franchise over a long period of time be able to produce these returns. So when we think of a higher rate environment and when we think of the returns and the EPS growth, to the extent you see some less liquidity in the market, we've traditionally been able to continue to grow core fee income. And at the same time, we have these alternative businesses in what we have acquired in Boston Private Wealth Management and Private Banking as well as the investment bank to continue to support the earnings growth rate. 
So looking ahead, we think that we've got the earnings power and the balance sheet growth in a higher rate scenario to be able to continue to support the strong EPS growth and ROE target because of these tools that we've been able to generate in the past in terms of profitable growth and these additional capabilities to be able to support clients across private bank, wealth management as well as the investment bank. So that -- generally speaking, obviously, these are not forecasted targets. These are how we're thinking about the business over the long term."

That's the main reason why we've been pushing so hard to create all 4 of these businesses and build them out and have them scalable and competitive in the market. And when they all work together, that is hard to compete with. 
Now there's still competition. We wake up every day, realizing that, and it's only getting more competitive. But our ability to compete has never been stronger, and I think that's a really important message to deliver. And we're also spending more money, as we talked about earlier on the call earlier, in digital transformation, which is a requirement. We're spending more money on, again, helping our teams become more efficient. And we still have a long way to go, which is why we're continuing to accelerate that investment.

But again, having said all that, yes, there is competition in various segments where you have a lot of debt funds as well, too. People see it's a very attractive area to lend, too, as well, too. So no doubt, those have been proliferating as well. Some of these big box banks are coming down into trying to get smaller as well because they know that we are going even more upmarket in terms of size as well, too. So it's there.

It's great to be here with you to talk about another quarter of exceptional growth and profitability, marked by continued strong balance sheet growth, strong net interest income, robust fee and market-related income and solid credit. Our earnings release, presentation slides and CEO letter, which we filed this afternoon, are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.  
Before we start the Q&A, I want to call out that we raised our 2021 growth outlook for the third time this year. We also introduced our preliminary 2022 outlook, which calls for continued strong growth as well as further acceleration of key investments in our business. We believe the additional net interest income generated by our larger balance sheet will more than offset this additional investment, while the investments we're making will drive increased growth and improved operating leverage.  
And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the lines for questions."

Clearly, the growth that we've had in 2021 so far and what we'd expect to finish the year based on the guidance that we've given creates a lot of momentum into 2022. So there's a huge amount of benefit to the expansion of the balance sheet, the growth of core fee income, the investments we're making in investment banking and headcount, private banking and wealth, all that momentum clearly carries forward. And so there's kind of a tailwind, number one.  
Number two, we certainly expect the markets that we serve in innovation economy to continue to perform well, although not quite at the accelerated pace that we see right now. Nothing that we're seeing is causing that point of view. It's more of just -- it's hard to fathom that it will stay at this pace.  
And maybe a third category is this. I'm more convinced than ever that the strategy that we've laid out over the last couple of years, these 4 pillars of businesses: the commercial bank, the private bank, SVB Capital and the investment bank, all working together is incredibly compelling for our clients. I'm hearing that firsthand. Our teams are hearing that. And just having that broad product set just becomes really compelling and being the only player in the market who has kind of all 4 of those capabilities, exclusively focused on the innovation economy. So it's really -- it's a combination of those 3 things, Ebrahim, that's giving us kind of that optimistic view rolling into 2022."

And really, these last 90 days has been all about making sure that we're syncing up the teams. We have the right plans in place because, as you know, there's only so much you can do before the deal is actually closed to really sync up.  
But I will tell you what I have found, what the team has found is a lot of positive -- I would say -- I wouldn't call them surprises, but validation of what we assume was going to play out, both on people and technology and so many other things.  
So I'm, again, going back to your first question, that caused me to be bullish. And what we always believed was the case, the reason that we wanted to bring Boston Private onto platform because the opportunity was so great. And that, I would say, has shown up in spades. The excitement, the energy from the teams on the commercial banking side and the private banking side and basically saying what the opportunity is, is truly incredible. 
So it's -- we haven't got to a place yet. We forecast exactly what that assets under management will be like for 2022. But you should expect to see when we get to January and we released our numbers there, that we're going to give you a lot more details as we usually do across our guidance levels, and that will be one of those things that we comment more.

So when Greg always describing it, you can kind of break it down into 2 areas, the macro features as well as what we're doing to execute. And so when you look at the macro picture, the fundamentals are still extraordinarily strong. I mean we see the flows of funds come in. You see the amount of dry powder that's out there, some accounts, it's $2 trillion, $2.5 trillion, $3 trillion. It's tremendous amount of money. The amount of money being deployed in into the space from BCs continues to grow the sizes. The funds are growing multiple sources. So that -- those things just have not changed.  
And then on the execution front, I mean if you look at our client acquisition count when you go into the deck that we have here, we continue to bring those on, increase record numbers of clients. And what happens is it takes some time for them to get funded, and so you're seeing us accumulating effect. So we all believe that the fundamentals are in place.

But I'll tell you, I'm really, really happy with kind of what you implied there in terms of if we can grow $10 billion, $11 billion per quarter. I think that's just a sensational growth as well, too.

Now so that's the risk, but let's talk about what are the -- and Mike did a great job of describing the things that are kind of pushed against that risk. The one place that is we're out in the market, and it's both in the United States and it's also international. If you go to the U.K. and you're in Europe and you're in South America or you're in Asia, there is such momentum around the innovation economy in every market. And that, to me, what we've seen, even when there is a slowdown, so even when you go back to '15 or '16 and there was a temporary slowdown, even when you saw it at the beginning of the COVID crisis last year, you saw a quick downturn, but the return was incredibly fast. And people looked at it as an opportunity to say, ""Gosh, I was hesitant to jump in at these valuations, and now I want to come in because I want to be in the innovation economy.""

Here's how I would describe it, and Dan or Mike may want to add. Prior to, I would say, 2020 and 2021, where we've seen truly incredible growth, and I would say the second half of '20 was just going to start there, we have, as you know, had incredibly strong growth. It's just been outside the last really 5 quarters. So what I view is the outlook we have for next year is being somewhere in between the 2. So at a faster pace than what you'd historically see from an average but not quite as fast as you would see this year. And Mike went through and described the reasons why it could be at the same pace. 
We're trying to be, I would say, a little tempered in the sense of it's been so incredibly strong. Again, this quarter, $80 billion of venture capital flows. And if it stays at that pace or accelerates, you could clearly see higher deposits and total client funds growth. So I wouldn't call it conservatism. I would say it is a -- what our crystal ball says just based on how long that period of exceptional growth could continue at that pace and just the belief that it will temper."

I think an earlier comment or question is if you go back and look at the last several quarters, we were at about a $20 billion deposit growth rate, and now it's in that range that was articulated roughly $10 billion. So if we stay at the pace we are, clearly, there's going to be a material upside to what you see in the forecast. 
So we haven't seen anything that would cause us to, I just would say the belief -- I've been doing this a long time and so is Mike and others that it rarely stays at that pace for an indefinite period of time. Usually, it's 4 or 5 quarters and then it goes back to what I'd say is more of a normalized growth rate, but certainly hoping that it stays at this pace."

We're already at -- DCs are at $96 billion year-to-date, which is a record for a full year. It's already exceeding. Just the 9 months to date has already exceeded the record that we already have. 
So when we look at -- again, coming -- we talked about earlier, the fundamentals and the sources of capital going there, they're going to -- those are going to get deployed, and so the war chest are certainly there.

The growth rate of the balance sheet, and that's what's driving it. So to your point, if you just have a static-sized balance sheet and it doesn't grow in a low rate environment, you're not -- or flat rate environment, you're not going to get a lot of lift out of it. But I think the point is we've seen, and that's what's created the massive tailwind going into 2022 for net interest income, it is the acceleration of the growth of the balance sheet that we've seen. So it's really the combination. It's really -- that is the way it should have been worded. 
Now what you didn't ask and -- but I will answer is this which is what we're really excited about is, at some point, we certainly believe that there will be some rate increases. And we have a slide in the deck that goes through and talks about how spring loaded the balance sheet actually is for additional NII if we do see rate increases in Slide 19, and you can go through that and look at every 0.25% increase in the balance sheet the way it is right now is $106 million, again, modeled in on an annualized pretax basis for each 25 basis point increase. 
But in addition to that, with the first 25 basis point increase, we also expect somewhere between $195 million and $225 million of increased core fee income generated from the large balance sheet funds that we have. So again, 125 basis point increase, you could see revenue growth of roughly $311 million to -- I'm sorry, yes, $311 million to roughly $325 million or $330 million. So normalize after this, when the second rate increase happens, but the balance sheet is clearly spring loaded. So we're happy that we can continue to grow NII in a low-rate environment, but we're even more bullish when we do start to see some rate increases."

I think as we look at the business and you think about what we've been doing in adding world-class health care services team, adding technology investment banking, that's starting to shift the revenue more to advisory over the long term versus equity capital markets, and with that comes some better margin opportunities. So the way to think of the business, I think, over the long term is less from an ROE perspective, more thinking about it in pretax profit and thinking about it kind of range, 18% to 20%, maybe a bit more than that on a pretax basis for the business. And I think that's a good place to look, and we'll see how this continues to evolve with the addition of advisory business for Leerink."

So having the investment banking capabilities in health care, life sciences and technology, that technology investment banking allows us to retain clients longer, to add more value to existing clients, and it also generates additional client activity for the private bank. 
And so when you think about what we're building, and we're seeing it, we're seeing it's early, but you certainly see the power of where it's going is when all 4 of those businesses work together. And to me, that's -- I mean it's -- each one of these businesses on a stand-alone basis is exciting. They're all doing really well. But what really gets me excited over the long run is when they all work together, right?

And how I answered is a little bit differently, which is we have been going on offense of building out our capabilities to not play defense but to actually add more value to our clients. And I'll go back to what I just -- and I answered with. That's the main reason why we've been pushing so hard to create all 4 of these businesses and build them out and have them scalable and competitive in the market. And when they all work together, that is hard to compete with. 
Now there's still competition. We wake up every day, realizing that, and it's only getting more competitive. But our ability to compete has never been stronger. And I think that's a really important message to deliver. And we're also spending more money, as we talked about earlier on the call earlier, in digital transformation, which is a requirement. We're spending more money on, again, helping our teams become more efficient. And we still have a long way to go, which is why we're continuing to accelerate that investment.

But again, having said all that, yes, there is competition in various segments where you have a lot of debt funds as well, too. People see it's a very attractive area to lend, too, as well, too. So no doubt, those have been proliferating as well. Some of these big-box banks are coming down into trying to get smaller as well because they know that we are going even more upmarket in terms of size as well, too. So it's there.

So obviously, we've seen just incredible liquidity growth coming through the end of last year and continuing through the quarter. Based on the view of that liquidity and the overall market conditions and how much incremental liquidity remains in the market, we are comfortable being able to put some of that money to work in longer duration in the held-to-maturity category, so think in the 3- to 5-year range. One of the things that gives us comfort with being able to do that is that in our available-for-sale maturity, we're also targeting a much shorter duration, think about something along the lines of a 2-year duration. So that helps us reduce the other comprehensive income risk, also frees up liquidity for us to the extent that we need it. But based on the trends that we continue to see and the stability of the liquidity in the market, we're comfortable putting that type of money to work.

Again, net-net, investing at about 135 to 145."

We're spending a lot of time talking about the go-to-market strategy and how that will work, and we're optimistic. But let's just assume for a second that the deal close as we expect it to.
We're looking at making sure we've got the right teams focused on the right opportunities and making sure that those referrals are going to come from the commercial bank. You'll see that in mortgages, which we expect to expand clearly from where we are and where Boston Private is. So that's one big area. We look to expand in specialty lending. That's lending to these high net worth individuals in the innovation economy. And then there's obviously the wealth opportunity, and that's one of the key reasons is fee income around wealth. How fast that will come, Ebrahim, we're not ready yet to kind of share that plan. But clearly, at the next earnings call, we'll take a more focused approach and rolling that out as we get closer to the announcement date and the final close, again, assuming everything goes well."

So this has been what we have been working on for quite a while. It's just gotten accelerated given the growth that we have seen over the last 12 months.
And so it's -- if you were to say, could we get to $600 billion on what we have right now today, the answer is no, probably not. But we know that, which is why we're making investments. So we've upped our guidance on expenses. Part of that is going to, again, building out infrastructure, supporting growth. And on Slide 11, you see all the areas that we're investing in, and those are important. But there's both what our capabilities are and what the market opportunity, and the market opportunity over time, clearly, is substantial.

And while it may be volatile, I'm certainly betting -- we're betting on it continuing to go up and to the right over the long run.

But then globally, there's also different requirements when you hit certain thresholds. In the U.K., one of those thresholds is the amount of deposits you have to smaller companies, and that definition is -- there's a revenue definition. There's other definitions. And as you know, we have companies that are both substantial in size but actually have very low revenue. And so that still contributes to you crossing that threshold. So as we head down a path to create a subsidiarization in the U.K., that is also building our capabilities.

Could it be bumpy? Probably. We would expect it to. 
But my view is then the other part of the market may pick up more than the capital markets. It could be M&A, and it probably will be M&A. So when we think about growing the business from an exit perspective, it is M&A and capital markets, equity capital markets. And if it slows down, maybe we'll see greater loan growth in the technology and life science portfolio. That's usually what happens. We're competing right now as much with liquidity coming from public markets and large private rounds as we are anything else. And so a slowdown in that would expectedly show some pickup in loan outstanding. So we feel whichever way it goes, we're positioned well to take advantage of those opportunities."

The answer is absolutely. So there is no slowdown in our desire to drive more loan growth in those segments.
And maybe one other point that you've seen, and maybe this is driving the question, is the percentage of early-stage lending relative to total lending, it's down to 3%. It's still been growing. It's just the rest of the portfolio is growing at such a rapid pace that it becomes a lower percentage of the overall loan portfolio.

Obviously, it's not necessarily a huge piece of the loan portfolio. But certainly, it will lift the boats there.
Moving on to kind of the fee income. When we start to see more pent-up demand, more opening of the economy, you're going to start to see credit card fees, right? So people spending and traveling and moving around. So we should potentially benefit from the credit card activity as well as potentially some of the FX deal activity as well. As people start to move around, there are certain groups of people that maybe been holding back in terms of deal activity. Maybe they'll start to do more deals -- cross-border deals as well, too, so again, since there's been some limitations on travel international.

But other than that, through cycles, we've been up and to the right. It's more of a question of what pace of growth that we have seen.
So could there be some softness in deposits on a quarterly basis or maybe in a few quarters? Possibly if the market really started to soften. But I'll go back to what I said in answering a few other questions, which is just about the innovation economy and how you really do look at this innovation market domestically and globally.

And you continue to see us put it to work and at the same time, you see now every quarter close to $3 billion of that portfolio of cash flow coming off. And I think that creates a lot of flexibility for us to be able to just continuously deploy the excess cash into investment securities.
In terms of a hard limit of how we'd go, we don't have one. And I think what we would continue to do is take the practice that we have and put that excess liquidity to work, again, understanding that we've got about $3 billion of cash flow coming off of that portfolio. At the same time, we've got enough short-term liquidity in that AFS, available for sale, portfolio. That's to the extent that we need to dip into that liquidity, we can certainly do it. So we're protecting at least on the short term with what we've got in available for sale, and we're certainly investing both in the longer duration and held to maturity and what we're doing in the available-for-sale portfolio.
Now to your question on how do we look at deployment, we've certainly added more to the municipal bond portfolio. That's close to a $3.5 billion book at least at this point. And I think we have continued room to grow that, especially with the potential for tax reform coming here in the coming year or so. So we're going to continue to deploy.

So I think as we look for the rest of the year, we'll certainly see continued the higher operating efficiency just because we're going to continue to invest because we see this growth opportunity ahead. Exactly where that's going to end up is so dependent upon what happens with more investment gains as well as what happens within the Leerink business.

First of all, it starts with the client and what makes sense for the client. What we've said in the past year is that what we've done is built a much broader product set in allowing clients to choose options that make sense for them. If you look at last quarter, we're kind of in that 50-50 on and off balance sheet. And we have said in the past that that's a good place to be. That being said, could we see more of it move off-balance sheet just given where yields are and so forth?
Clearly, that's a possibility, but it starts with client preferences and what they're looking for. Then secondly, it's the product set that we have, making sure we give those options to our clients. And then the third is we can look in a very small way change a little bit of behavior by moving some spreads around. But that's hard to do when rates are 0. And so it really does boil down to product set and client preference. So Dan or Mike, anything to add?"

When we think about capital, we're really thinking about 2 things. One is profitability, and two is growth. What's really clear is that our profitability remains strong, and that could support strong balance sheet growth. The leverage ratios have been under pressure from exceptional growth in the last 2 quarters, and you obviously see that on the balance sheet. That exceptional deposit growth we saw in the first quarter continues to put pressure on the Tier 1 leverage ratio at the bank. So as Greg was talking about, we certainly are -- and you see it because 50% of the client inflows for the quarter went off-balance sheet. So we're certainly, where we can and where it makes sense for the clients, moving deposits off the balance sheet to help buffer some of that impact.
Our common equity transaction also this quarter helps free up additional capacity to support our growth in the ways that we've done in the past. So that includes preferred debt issuance to support the Tier 1 leverage ratio, and the markets have been open to us to do those transactions. And that provides very low-cost regulatory capital to us to be able to continue the growth. So when we look at all of those things, that's the way we're thinking about capital. And our risk-based capital measures remain very strong. If you look at CET1 at the holding company, we closed the quarter at about 12.2%. So all in, that's how we're thinking about capital."

Obviously, that's going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on what's going on with the rates. But all-in, the intent is not to change the position of the total portfolio, but to protect against sudden rate movements in the available-for-sale portfolio. So if we look at the asset sensitivity we've got that included within our slide deck, we're still in a good place from a sensitivity perspective.
