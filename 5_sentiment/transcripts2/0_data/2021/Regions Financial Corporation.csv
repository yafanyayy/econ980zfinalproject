Let me begin by saying that we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. We achieved a great deal despite a challenging interest rate and operating environment.Earlier this",403,"Thank you, Dana, and thank you for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying that we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. We achieved a great deal despite a challenging interest rate and operating environment.
Earlier this morning, we reported full year earnings of $991 million, reflecting our highest level of adjusted pretax pre-provision income in more than a decade, resulting in adjusted positive operating leverage of 2.6%.
Over the last 10-plus years, we've made significant strides toward our goal of positioning the company to generate consistent, sustainable long-term performance. We've enhanced our credit, interest rate and operational risk management processes and platforms. We've sharpened our focus on appropriate risk-adjusted returns and capital allocation. These actions position us well to weather the economic downturn caused by the pandemic and to serve as a strong foundation for growth.
Despite a year of unprecedented uncertainty, we remain focused on what we control and our efforts are paying off. During 2020, we grew consumer and small business checking accounts by 1.5%. We increased corporate loan production by 6%. We made investments in talent, target markets, technology and digital capabilities. And we expanded and enhanced products across the consumer and corporate bank incorporating changing customer preferences and learnings from the pandemic.
In 2021 and beyond, we will continue to focus on growing our business by investing in areas that allow us to make banking easier for our customers, and while continuing to provide our associates with the tools they need to be competitive. We will make incremental adjustments to our business by leveraging our strengths and investing in areas where we believe we can consistently win over time. We did this by adding mortgage loan originators when rates were still rising, positioning us to better capitalize on mortgage activity. We also expanded our small business platform through the Ascentium acquisition, as well as our enhanced SBA technology platform.
In closing, we're very proud of our achievements in 2020, but none of these would be possible without the hard work and dedication of our 20,000 associates. This year is posed a myriad of challenges. However, our associates took action, providing best-in-class customer service, successfully executing on our strategy, and maintaining strong risk management practices in the face of a rapidly evolving operating environment, all of which contributed to our success.
Now David will provide you with some details regarding the quarter."
271409,674325298,2179005,"Regions Financial Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2021",2021-01-22,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. While adjusted average loans were up for the year, they decreased 2% in the fourth quarter. New and renewed commercial loan production increased 25% compared to the third quarter. However, balances rema",1379,"Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. While adjusted average loans were up for the year, they decreased 2% in the fourth quarter. New and renewed commercial loan production increased 25% compared to the third quarter. However, balances remain negatively impacted by historically low utilization levels. As of year-end, commercial line utilization was just under 40% compared to historical average of 45%.
Commercial loan balances were further impacted by the company's active portfolio management efforts during the quarter. Approximately $408 million worth of commercial loans were either sold or transferred to held for sale. Additionally, PPP forgiveness began during the quarter, resulting in a $415 million reduction in average loan balances. Consumer loan growth again reflected strong mortgage production, offset by runoff portfolios. Overall, we expect 2021 adjusted average loan balances to be down by low single digits compared to 2020. However, after excluding the impact of this quarter's portfolio management efforts, we expect adjusted ending loans to grow by low single digits.
With respect to deposits, balances continued to increase this quarter to new record levels. Full year average deposits are 17% higher than 2019, with most of the growth coming in noninterest-bearing to core operating accounts across all 3 business segments. The increase is primarily due to higher balances. However, we are also experiencing new account growth. We expect near-term deposit balances will continue to increase, particularly as the second round of stimulus dispersed.
Let's shift to net interest income and margin, which remain a significant source of stability for Regions. Net interest income increased 2% during the quarter and as expected, remained relatively stable, excluding the benefit from PPP forgiveness. Similar to prior quarters, the impact from lower loan balances and low long-term rates was mostly offset by our cash management strategies, lower deposit costs and higher average notional values of active loan hedges. Net interest margin was stable linked quarter at 3.13%. Deposit growth drove cash we hold at the total reserve to record levels, averaging over $13 billion and reducing fourth quarter margin by 34 basis points. PPP benefited net interest income through the realization of approximately $24 million of fees related to forgiveness. In total, the PPP program contributed 7 basis points to the margin.
Excluding excess cash and PPP, our normalized net interest margin remained stable at 3.4%, evidencing our proactive balance sheet management despite a near 0 short-term rate environment.
Loan hedges added $97 million to net interest income and 30 basis points to the margin. Higher average hedged notional values drove a $3 million increase compared to the third quarter. Our last forward starting hedges began earlier this month. So going forward, we expect roughly $100 million of hedge-related interest income each quarter at current rate levels until hedges begin to mature in late 2023. Our hedges have a remaining life of 4 years and provide protection through 2026. 
We continue to look for opportunities to deploy excess cash, balancing risk and return. Of note, incremental securities currently come with larger premiums, which increase our quarterly premium amortization run rate, but that is factored into the overall net benefit. Total premium amortization was $51 million this quarter and would be in the low $40 million range, excluding book premium increases and elevated Ginnie Mae buyout activity.
Interest-bearing deposit costs fell 6 basis points in the quarter to 13 basis points, contributing $10 million to net interest income. Looking ahead to the first quarter, PPP-related net interest income is expected to be relatively stable with the fourth quarter. However, the timing of PPP loan forgiveness and participation in the second round of funding remains uncertain. Fewer days will reduce first quarter NII by roughly $12 million.
After level setting for days, net interest income is expected to be modestly lower quarter-over-quarter, mostly attributable to lower average loan balances. The impact of lower long-term rates will continue to be offset by the benefits from hedging, cash management strategies and lower deposit costs.
Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income increased 7% quarter-over-quarter. We achieved record capital markets income driven primarily by increased M&A activity. Mortgage delivered another solid quarter and for the full year, generated record production and related revenue. Looking ahead to 2021, we expect mortgage and capital markets to continue to be significant contributors to fee revenue.
Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA, we expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue in the $55 million to $65 million range on average. Service charges increased 5% but remained below prior year levels, while improving, we believe changes in customer behavior, as well as continued enhancements to our overdraft practices and transaction posting are likely to keep service charges below pre-pandemic levels. Although we expect the impact of these changes will be partially offset by continued account growth, we estimate 2021 service charges will grow, but remain approximately 10% to 15% below 2019 levels.
Card and ATM fees have recovered compared to the prior year driven primarily by increased debit card spend. And while credit card spend continues to improve, it remains slightly behind prior year levels. Given the timing of interest rate changes in 2020, combined with exceptionally strong fee income performance, we expect 2021 adjusted total revenue to be down modestly compared to the prior year. But this will be dependent on the timing and amount of PPP forgiveness and loan growth.
Let's move on to noninterest expense. Adjusted noninterest expenses increased 5% in the quarter, driven by higher incentive compensation related primarily to record capital markets activities. Of note, were 2% lower compared to the third quarter as we remain focused on our continuous improvement process. Associate headcount decreased 2% quarter-over-quarter and 1% year-over-year. And excluding the impact of our Ascentium acquisition, the associate headcount decreased over 3% 2020.
We will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology, products and people to grow our business. In 2021, we expect adjusted noninterest expenses to remain stable to down modestly compared to 2020. We remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time, but acknowledge 2021 will be challenging without a stronger economy than currently anticipated.
From an asset quality perspective, overall credit continues to perform better than expected. Annualized net charge-offs were 43 basis points, a 7 basis point improvement over the prior quarter, reflecting improvement primarily within our commercial portfolios. Nonperforming loans, total delinquencies and business services criticized loans all remained relatively stable.
Our allowance for credit losses declined 5 basis points to 2.69% of total loans and 308% of total nonaccrual loans. Excluding PPP loans, our allowance for credit losses was 2.81% of total loans. The decline in reserves reflects stabilization in our economic outlook and improved credit performance, charge-offs previously provided for and the impact of active portfolio management. The allowance reduction resulted in a net $38 million benefit to the provision.
Our year-end allowance remains one1 of the highest in our peer group as measured against period-end loans or stress losses as modeled by the Federal Reserve. As we look forward, we are mindful of the uncertainty that exists in the economy due to the pandemic. However, we are cautiously optimistic as we move beyond events which were the source of uncertainty in prior quarters. Further reductions in the allowance will depend on the timing of charge-offs, and greater certainty with respect to the economic recovery.
While charge-offs can be volatile quarter-to-quarter, we currently expect full year 2021 net charge-offs to range from 55 to 65 basis points. Additionally, based on what we know today, we continue to expect charge-offs to peak in mid-2021.
With respect to capital, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 50 basis points to an estimated 9.8% inside of our current operating range of 9.5 million to 10%. In the near term, we intend to operate at the higher end of this range.
So wrapping up on the next slide are our 2021 expectations which we have already addressed. So in summary, we are cautiously optimistic about 2021. Pretax pre-provision income remains strong, expenses are well controlled, credit quality is showing resilience, capital and liquidity are solid, and we are optimistic on the prospect for the economic recovery to continue in our markets.
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

So we originated about $5 billion worth of PPP loans this year. Now the rules were changing early on, as you know, and some of our customers actually gave us money back before we really earn much yield on it. So at the end of the year, as you can see on our Page 20 in the supplement, PPP loans amounted to $3.6 billion at December 31. We forgave approximately $1 billion worth of loans in 2020. And that was really in the fourth quarter, where we generated from the forgiveness piece alone, $24 million that we disclosed to you.
As we think about PPP 2.0, we estimate, at least at this time, that we'd originated approximately $2 billion in PPP loans. Now the timing and the ultimate amount of that is uncertain, as is the forgiveness with the existing $3.6 billion. So we've given you the pieces that you can do some scenario analysis in terms of how you think that may come into income. Clearly, loans that are forgiven quicker come into 2021 and would help from a revenue standpoint.
Your second piece of the question is on cash. So you're right, we do have quite a bit of cash. Our deposit growth was quite strong during the year, both in consumer and wealth, and also in the corporate Banking group. So all 3 of those had nice growth. We have deployed some of that cash in the securities book, as you've seen. And we have gotten a little bit of steepening off late. The problem is mortgage spreads have tightened other way, and therefore, you really don't have a great place to put the cash, and we're reluctant to take on duration risk at this time.
That being said, we are mindful of more stimulus, could steepen out even further, which would give us a better entry point to put that cash. But until we see that, we really are going to have that cash at the Fed, earning 10 basis points, which we understand does weigh on our revenue, but we think that's the most prudent path."

Ascentium Capital, we're excited about and what we think it can mean for the future. So that's our primary focus.
With respect to bank acquisitions, our view of that -- about that hasn't changed. We think we have a really solid plan.

We're still confronting a number of crises across the country, whether they be health related, the economy the political environment we're operating in, social unrest, all those things potentially impact our business. And so we can't take anything for granted. We've got to continue to focus on the risks in our business, make sure that we are executing well, that we're continuing to recruit our talent internally and externally every day to keep an engaged and active team. And I think if we do those things and stay focused on the things that we can control, which are how we take care of our customers? How we respond to each other? It's about the investments that we make in technology and in our business.

Let me begin by saying that we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. We achieved a great deal despite a challenging interest rate and operating environment.Earlier this",403,"Thank you, Dana, and thank you for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying that we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. We achieved a great deal despite a challenging interest rate and operating environment.
Earlier this morning, we reported full year earnings of $991 million, reflecting our highest level of adjusted pretax pre-provision income in more than a decade, resulting in adjusted positive operating leverage of 2.6%. Over the last 10-plus years, we've made significant strides toward our goal of positioning the company to generate consistent, sustainable long-term performance. We've enhanced our credit, interest rate and operational risk management processes and platforms. 
We've sharpened our focus on appropriate risk-adjusted returns and capital allocation. These actions position us well to weather the economic downturn caused by the pandemic and to serve as a strong foundation for growth. Despite a year of unprecedented uncertainty, we remain focused on what we control and our efforts are paying off. 
During 2020, we grew consumer and small business checking accounts by 1.5%. We increased corporate loan production by 6%. We made investments in talent, target markets, technology and digital capabilities. And we expanded and enhanced products across the consumer and corporate bank incorporating changing customer preferences and learnings from the pandemic.
In 2021 and beyond, we will continue to focus on growing our business by investing in areas that allow us to make banking easier for our customers, and while continuing to provide our associates with the tools they need to be competitive. We will make incremental adjustments to our business by leveraging our strengths and investing in areas where we believe we can consistently win over time. We did this by adding mortgage loan originators when rates were still rising, positioning us to better capitalize on mortgage activity. We also expanded our small business platform through the Ascentium acquisition, as well as our enhanced SBA technology platform.
In closing, we're very proud of our achievements in 2020, but none of these would be possible without the hard work and dedication of our 20,000 associates. This year has posed a myriad of challenges. However, our associates took action, providing best-in-class customer service, successfully executing on our strategy and maintaining strong risk management practices in the face of a rapidly evolving operating environment, all of which contributed to our success.
Now David will provide you with some details regarding the quarter."
271409,674325298,2179070,"Regions Financial Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2021",2021-01-22,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. While adjusted average loans were up for the year, they decreased 2% in the fourth quarter. New and renewed commercial loan production increased 25% compared to the third quarter. However, balances rema",1386,"Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. While adjusted average loans were up for the year, they decreased 2% in the fourth quarter. New and renewed commercial loan production increased 25% compared to the third quarter. However, balances remain negatively impacted by historically low utilization levels. As of year-end, commercial line utilization was just under 40% compared to historical average of 45%.
Commercial loan balances were further impacted by the company's active portfolio management efforts during the quarter. Approximately $408 million worth of commercial loans were either sold or transferred to held for sale. Additionally, PPP forgiveness began during the quarter, resulting in a $415 million reduction in average loan balances.
Consumer loan growth again reflected strong mortgage production, offset by runoff portfolios. Overall, we expect 2021 adjusted average loan balances to be down by low single digits compared to 2020. However, after excluding the impact of this quarter's portfolio management efforts, we expect adjusted ending loans to grow by low single digits.
With respect to deposits, balances continued to increase this quarter to new record levels. Full year average deposits are 17% higher than 2019, with most of the growth coming in noninterest-bearing core operating accounts across all 3 business segments. The increase is primarily due to higher balances. However, we are also experiencing new account growth. We expect near-term deposit balances will continue to increase, particularly as the second round of stimulus is dispersed.
Let's shift to net interest income and margin, which remain a significant source of stability for Regions. Net interest income increased 2% during the quarter and as expected, remained relatively stable, excluding the benefit from PPP forgiveness. Similar to prior quarters, the impact from lower loan balances and low long-term rates was mostly offset by our cash management strategies, lower deposit costs and higher average notional values of active loan hedges. Net interest margin was stable linked quarter at 3.13%. 
Deposit growth drove cash we hold at the Federal Reserve to record levels, averaging over $13 billion and reducing fourth quarter margin by 34 basis points. PPP benefited net interest income through the realization of approximately $24 million of fees related to forgiveness. In total, the PPP program contributed 7 basis points to the margin. Excluding excess cash and PPP, our normalized net interest margin remained stable at 3.4%, evidencing our proactive balance sheet management despite a near 0 short-term rate environment.
Loan hedges added $97 million to net interest income and 30 basis points to the margin. Higher average hedged notional values drove a $3 million increase compared to the third quarter. Our last forward starting hedges began earlier this month. So going forward, we expect roughly $100 million of hedge-related interest income each quarter at current rate levels until hedges begin to mature in late 2023. Our hedges have a remaining life of 4 years and provide protection through 2026.
We continue to look for opportunities to deploy excess cash, balancing risk and return. Of note, incremental securities currently come with larger premiums, which increase our quarterly premium amortization run rate, but that is factored into the overall net benefit. Total premium amortization was $51 million this quarter and would be in the low $40 million range, excluding book premium increases and elevated Ginnie Mae buyout activity.
Interest-bearing deposit costs fell 6 basis points in the quarter to 13 basis points, contributing $10 million to net interest income. Looking ahead to the first quarter, PPP-related net interest income is expected to be relatively stable with the fourth quarter. However, the timing of PPP loan forgiveness and participation in the second round of funding remains uncertain. Fewer days will reduce first quarter NII by roughly $12 million.
After level setting for days, net interest income is expected to be modestly lower quarter-over-quarter, mostly attributable to lower average loan balances. The impact of lower long-term rates will continue to be offset by the benefits from hedging, cash management strategies and lower deposit costs.
Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income increased 7% quarter-over-quarter. We achieved record capital markets income driven primarily by increased M&A activity. Mortgage delivered another solid quarter and for the full year, generated record production and related revenue. Looking ahead to 2021, we expect mortgage and capital markets to continue to be significant contributors to fee revenue.
Excluding the impact of CVA/BBVA, we expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue in the $55 million to $65 million range on average. Service charges increased 5% but remained below prior year levels. While improving, we believe changes in customer behavior as well as continued enhancements to our overdraft practices and transaction posting are likely to keep service charges below pre-pandemic levels. Although we expect the impact of these changes will be partially offset by continued account growth, we estimate 2021 service charges will grow, but remain approximately 10% to 15% below 2019 levels.
Card and ATM fees have recovered compared to the prior year driven primarily by increased debit card spend. And while credit card spend continues to improve, it remains slightly behind prior year levels. Given the timing of interest rate changes in 2020, combined with exceptionally strong fee income performance, we expect 2021 adjusted total revenue to be down modestly compared to the prior year. But this will be dependent on the timing and amount of PPP forgiveness and loan growth.
Let's move on to noninterest expense. Adjusted noninterest expenses increased 5% in the quarter, driven by higher incentive compensation related primarily to record capital markets activities. Of note, may salaries were 2% lower compared to the third quarter as we remain focused on our continuous improvement process. Associate head count decreased 2% quarter-over-quarter and 1% year-over-year. And excluding the impact of our Ascentium acquisition, the associate head count decreased over 3% in 2020. We will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology, products and people to grow our business. 
In 2021, we expect adjusted noninterest expenses to remain stable to down modestly compared to 2020. We remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time, but acknowledge 2021 will be challenging without a stronger economy than currently anticipated.
From an asset quality perspective, overall credit continues to perform better than expected. Annualized net charge-offs were 43 basis points, a 7 basis point improvement over the prior quarter, reflecting improvement primarily within our commercial portfolios. Nonperforming loans, total delinquencies and business services criticized loans all remained relatively stable.
Our allowance for credit losses declined 5 basis points to 2.69% of total loans and 308% of total nonaccrual loans. Excluding PPP loans, our allowance for credit losses was 2.81% of total loans. The decline in reserves reflects stabilization in our economic outlook and improved credit performance, charge-offs previously provided for and the impact of active portfolio management. The allowance reduction resulted in a net $38 million benefit to the provision. 
Our year-end allowance remains one1 of the highest in our peer group as measured against period-end loans or stress losses as modeled by the Federal Reserve. As we look forward, we are mindful of the uncertainty that exists in the economy due to the pandemic. However, we are cautiously optimistic as we move beyond events which were the source of uncertainty in prior quarters. Further reductions in the allowance will depend on the timing of charge-offs and greater certainty with respect to the path of the economic recovery. 
While charge-offs can be volatile quarter-to-quarter, we currently expect full year 2021 net charge-offs to range from 55 to 65 basis points. Additionally, based on what we know today, we continue to expect charge-offs to peak in mid-2021.
With respect to capital, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 50 basis points to an estimated 9.8% inside of our current operating range of 9.5% to 10%. In the near term, we intend to operate at the higher end of this range. 
So wrapping up on the next slide are our 2021 expectations which we have already addressed. So in summary, we are cautiously optimistic about 2021. Pretax pre-provision income remains strong, expenses are well controlled, credit quality is showing resilience, capital and liquidity are solid, and we are optimistic on the prospect for the economic recovery to continue in our markets.
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

So we originated about $5 billion worth of PPP loans this year. Now the rules were changing early on, as you know, and some of our customers actually gave us money back before we really earned much yield on it. So at the end of the year, as you can see on our Page 20 in the supplement, PPP loans amount to $3.6 billion at December 31. We forgave approximately $1 billion worth of loans in 2020. And that was really in the fourth quarter, where we generated from the forgiveness piece alone, $24 million that we disclosed to you.
As we think about PPP 2.0, we estimate, at least at this time, that we'd originated approximately $2 billion in PPP loans. Now the timing and the ultimate amount of that is uncertain as is the forgiveness with the existing $3.6 billion. So we've given you the pieces that you can do some scenario analysis in terms of how you think that may come into income. Clearly, loans that are forgiven quicker come into 2021 and would help from a revenue standpoint.
Your second piece of the question is on cash. So you're right, we do have quite a bit of cash. Our deposit growth was quite strong during the year, both in consumer and wealth, and also in the corporate banking group. So all 3 of those had nice growth. We have deployed some of that cash in the securities book, as you've seen. And we have gotten a little bit of steepening off late. The problem is mortgage spreads has tightened other way, and therefore, you really don't have a great place to put the cash, and we're reluctant to take on duration risk at this time.
That being said, we are mindful of more stimulus, could steepen out even further, which would give us a better entry point to put that cash. But until we see that, we really are going to have that cash at the Fed, earning 10 basis points, which we understand does weigh on our revenue, but we think that's the most prudent path."

We want to continue to look for opportunities to make nonbank acquisitions to expand our capabilities, to help us grow and diversify revenue. We think the acquisitions that we've made over the last few years have proven to be fruitful, as evidenced by, as an example, the great quarter that we had in capital markets, largely driven by M&A activity. We also had a good quarter in low-income housing tax credits and syndications of that business. Ascentium Capital, we're excited about and what we think it can mean for the future. So that's our primary focus.
With respect to bank acquisitions, our view of that -- about that hasn't changed. We think we have a really solid plan.

And so we can't take anything for granted.
We've got to continue to focus on the risks in our business, make sure that we are executing well, that we're continuing to recruit our talent internally and externally every day to keep an engaged and active team.

And now we're increasing that guidance because we think there's more recurring sustainable revenue, which will be complemented by the episodic revenue that things that happened that we weren't anticipating. That certainly was the case this quarter when we had a number of M&A transactions that got completed prior to the end of the year pulled forward as a result of customers being eager to get something done in 2020.

Our ability to continue to deliver value this quarter is a testament to both the investments we've made as well as our associates' unwavering commitment to our customers and communities. 
Our credit metrics continue to improve and reflect the good work we've done with our clients, coupled with the expected benefits from governments tiles. Based on this quarter's credit performance and the improving economic outlook, we reduced our allowance for credit losses by $142 million more than net charge-offs while still maintaining one of the strongest allowance to loan ratios in the industry at 2.44%. Although we continue to deal with the effects of the pandemic, our ongoing conversations with customers reflect optimism about further economic recovery and growth. 
Vaccine distribution is improving in our footprint and businesses in the most part, have reopened. A majority of our largest deposit states are experiencing unemployment rates significantly below those of the U.S. as a whole and our loan pipelines are improving as we are seeing more activity in the marketplace. 
We're increasingly optimistic this momentum will continue. Throughout this recovery and beyond, we will maintain our focus on deepening relationships with our customers by providing personalized financial guidance combined with excellent technology solutions that continue to make banking easier.

Let's start with the balance sheet. Average and ending adjusted loans declined 1% from the prior quarter. New and renewed commercial loan production increased 5% compared to the prior quarter. However, balances remained negatively impacte",1620,"Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average and ending adjusted loans declined 1% from the prior quarter. New and renewed commercial loan production increased 5% compared to the prior quarter. However, balances remained negatively impacted by excess liquidity in the market, resulting in historically low utilization levels. As of quarter end, commercial line utilization was 39% compared to our historical average of 45%. Just a reminder, each 1% of line utilization equates to approximately $600 million of loan growth. 
Commercial loan balances continue to be impacted by the company's ongoing portfolio management activities and PPP forgiveness timing. Average consumer loans again reflected strong mortgage production, offset by runoff portfolios. Overall, we expect full year 2021 adjusted average loan balances to be down by low single digits compared to 2020, although we expect adjusted ending loans to grow by low single digits. 
With respect to deposits, balances continued to increase this quarter to new record levels, led by growth in the consumer segment, reflecting recent government stimulus payments. The increase is primarily due to higher account balances. However, we are also experiencing new account growth. We expect near-term deposit balances will continue to increase, particularly as the recent stimulus is fully dispersed and corporate customers maintain higher cash levels. 
Let's shift to net interest income and margin, which remains a significant source of stability for regions. Net interest income decreased 4% on a reported basis or 1%, excluding the impact from day count and PP. PPP related NII declined $14 million from the prior quarter as the benefits from round 2 were offset by slower round 1 forgiveness. 2 fewer days also reduced NII by $12 million. The decline in core NII stems mostly from lower loan balances and remixing out of higher-yielding loan categories. 
Net interest margin declined during the quarter to 3.02%. Cash averaged over $16 billion during the quarter, and when combined with PPP, reduced first quarter margin by 38 basis points. Excluding excess cash and PPP, our normalized net interest margin remained stable at 3.40%, evidencing our proactive balance sheet management despite a near 0 short-term rate environment. 
Similar to prior quarters, the impact from historically long-term interest rates was offset by our cash management strategies, lower deposit costs and higher average notional values of active loan hedges. Cash management, mostly in the form of a December long-term debt call, contributed $6 million and 1 basis point of margin. Interest-bearing deposit costs fell 2 basis points in the quarter to 11 basis points, contributing $4 million and 1 basis point of margin. 
Loan hedges added $102 million to NII and 31 basis points to the margin. Higher average hedge notional values drove a $3 million increase compared to the fourth quarter. At current rate levels, we expect a little over $100 million of hedge related interest income each quarter until the hedges begin to mature in 2023. Within the quarter, we repositioned a total of $4.3 billion of cash flow swaps and floors targeting less protection in 2023 and 2024. While there may be additional adjustments in the future, we believe the resulting profile allows us to support our goal of consistent, sustainable growth. Specifically, we are positioned to benefit from the steepening yield curve and increases in short-term interest rates in the future, while protecting NII stability to the extent the Fed is on hold longer than the market currently expects. The potential for loan growth only enhances our participation in a recovering economy. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect NII, excluding cash in PPP to be relatively stable. While recent curve steepening has helped asset reinvestment levels, long-term rates will remain a modest near term headwind. Deposit cost reductions, one additional day and hedging benefits will support NII in the quarter, while loan balances are expected to remain relatively stable. Over the second half of the year and beyond, a strengthening economy, a relatively neutral impact from rates and the potential for balance sheet growth are expected to ultimately drive growth in NII. 
Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income decreased 2% from the prior quarter, but reflects a 32% increase compared to the first quarter of 2020. Capital markets delivered another strong quarter as customers continued to respond to interest rate changes and potential regulatory and tax headwinds. Fees generated from permanent financing for real estate customers and securities underwriting, both achieved record levels, and M&A advisory services also delivered solid results. While we expect capital markets revenue to remain solid over the remainder of the year, some activity was pulled forward. Looking ahead, we expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue in the $55 million to $65 million range on average, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. 
Mortgage delivered another strong quarter as we continue to focus on growing market share and improving our customer experience. Mortgage income increased 20% over the prior quarter, driven primarily by agency gain on sale and favorable MSR valuation. Production for the quarter was up 89% over the prior year, setting the stage for another strong year of mortgage income. 
Service charges were negatively impacted by both seasonal declines and increased deposit balances. While improving, we believe changes in customer behavior as well as customer benefits from enhancements to our overdraft practices and transaction posting are likely to keep service charges below pre-pandemic levels. Although we expect the impact of these changes will be partially offset by continued account growth, we estimate 2021 service charges will grow compared to 2020, but remained approximately 10% to 15% below 2019 levels. 
Card and ATM fees have recovered, up 10% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by increased debit card spend. Given the timing of interest rate changes in 2020, combined with exceptionally strong fee income performance, we expect 2021 adjusted total revenue to be down modestly compared to the prior year. But this will be dependent on the timing and amount of PPP loan forgiveness and loan growth. 
Let's move on to noninterest expense. Adjusted noninterest expenses decreased 1% in the quarter, driven by lower incentive compensation, primarily related to capital markets and mortgage, which was partially offset by a seasonal increase in payroll taxes. Of note, base salaries were 4% lower compared to the fourth quarter as we remain focused on our continuous improvement process. Associate head count decreased 2% quarter-over-quarter and 4% year-over-year. And excluding the impact of our Ascentium Capital acquisition that closed April 1, 2020, head count was down 6%. We will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology, products and people to grow business. In 2021, we expect adjusted noninterest expenses to remain stable compared to 2020, with quarterly adjusted noninterest expenses in the $880 million to $890 million range. And while we face uncertainty regarding the pace of economic recovery, we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time. 
From an asset quality perspective, overall credit continues to perform better than expected. Annualized net charge-offs were 40 basis points, a 3 basis point improvement over the prior quarter, reflecting broad-based improvement across most portfolios. Nonperforming loans, total delinquencies, business services criticized loans all declined modestly. Our allowance for credit losses declined 25 basis points to 2.44% of total loans and 280% of total nonaccrual loans. Excluding PPP loans, our allowance for credit losses was 2.57%. The decline in the allowance reflects charge-offs previously provided for, stabilization in our economic outlook, and improved credit performance, including the impact of the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill approved in March. 
The allowance reduction resulted in a net $142 million benefit to the provision. Our allowance remains 1 of the highest in our peer group as measured against period-end loans or stress losses as modeled by the Federal Reserve. Future levels of the allowance will depend on the timing of charge-offs and greater certainty with respect to the path of the economic recovery. As we look forward, we are cautiously optimistic regarding our credit performance for the year. While net charge-offs can be volatile quarter-to-quarter, based on current expectations, we believe the peak is behind us and we expect full year 2021 net charge-offs to range from 40 to 50 basis points. 
With respect to capital, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 50 basis points to an estimated 10.3% this quarter. As you are aware, the Federal Reserve extended their restrictions on capital distributions through the second quarter of 2021. The Federal Reserve also indicated these restrictions are expected to be lifted beginning in the third quarter, subject to capital remaining above required levels in the ongoing 2021 CCAR cycle for firms participating. We have opted into this year's CCAR and assuming capital levels remain above required levels in the Fed stress test, we should be back to managing capital distributions against the SCB requirements beginning in the third quarter. However, our plan is to begin share repurchases in the second quarter subject to defense earnings based restrictions. 
Based on our internal stress testing framework and the amount of capital we need to run our business, we are updating our operating range for common equity Tier 1 to 9.25% to 9.75%, with the goal of managing to the midpoint over time. 
So wrapping up on the next slide, our 2021 expectations, which we have already addressed. In summary, we feel really good about our first quarter results and anticipate carrying the momentum into the remainder of '21. Pretax pre-provision income remained strong. Expenses are well controlled. Credit quality is outperforming expectations. Capital and liquidity are solid, and we are optimistic about the prospect for the economic recovery to continue in our markets. 
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

As we think about the future, we obviously look at all the data points to try and figure out when the Fed may move and as we continue to have economic progress, we're thinking that there is more likelihood of an increase in short rates and probably loan rates to follow starting in the back half of '22 into '23 and '24.

That's been elusive for the industry thus far. And so some have deployed that in the securities book. We've done a little bit, but we're reluctant because I was talking to our Treasurer yesterday, there's no free lunch here. You just can't you can't hide from the risk that you take if you try to take duration risk right now and deploying that securities book will help you short-term in NII, but you will pay for that dearly down the road, and we're playing the long game. We're not about trying to generate short-term NII growth for that sake.

Obviously, continue to have pressure and reinvestment of fixed rate assets throughout the year. We do have some, obviously, protection on NII through our hedging program. So we're excited about that. 
From a loan growth standpoint, we are in some great markets, and we expect to benefit over time as our economies continue to open and we get some loan growth. We have some headwinds in terms of can we continue to have capital markets at $100 million every quarter. We guided you to $55 million to $65 million. So who knows, I mean, if we continue to have capital markets should be robust, M&A should be robust, and we might be able to outperform there. But we gave you the guide of 55% to 65%. We think mortgage will continue to be strong. Our teams are performing very well in terms of mortgage. And we think there could be some upside there. But who knows, we have to see what happens with the rate environment. 
I think in terms of PPP, we have $4.3 billion of PPP loans outstanding. We originated $1.5 billion under the PPP 2 program, and we forgave about $700 million in the first quarter. The timing of that forgiveness is a big determinant, Ryan, in terms of ultimate income for us. We think that's back-end loaded literally in the fourth quarter before you start seeing real forgiveness. As a matter of fact, we have a little bit of pressure on PPP generated revenue in -- from first to second quarter as we disclosed a little bit -- and that's only because of timing. The point is, if you got $4.3 billion, the fees and interest we earn off, that's a little over 3%, it's just timing. When is it coming in and your guess is as good as ours on that. But that will be -- that's a pretty big swing factor in terms of where we end up on our guide on revenue for the year."

So we believe that's an appropriate range and appropriate midpoint of that at 9.50% is the right place for regions at this time. As conditions get better, we'll -- we can adjust accordingly. Or if they get worse, we'll adjust out of the way. 
We are at 10.3% today. So that's 80 basis points from the middle. Round numbers, that's $800 million worth of capital. We'll continue to -- we didn't have buybacks in the first quarter. As I mentioned, we will have some in the second quarter. But let's go back and remember our capital, we want to use to grow our business. That's its priority. We'd love to have more loan growth out there. And to use it that way. We're going to pay a dividend in the 35% to 45% of our income, so that we have a sustainable dividend. We like to use that capital for nonbank acquisitions like we did on Ascentium Capital as a good example. So that's our preference. We will then -- the last effort, we will use buybacks to maintain and optimize our capital at that 9.5% common equity Tier 1. So we'll be restricted on how much we get to do in the second quarter.

Okay. So I think you should think about the contribution really is a stabilizing factor in terms of NII.

And this gives us an opportunity to show you and the rest of the world that, that our credit has continued to improve as a result of our derisking strategy, our capital allocation strategy. We feel very good about that. This gives an opportunity for an independent third party, in this case, the Federal reserve to show everybody what our losses are relative to fear.

And most of the states that we operate in were some of the first to reopen their economies. As a result, unemployment rates in states like Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida are better than national average. And so we see businesses expanding. Our pipelines today are 50% larger than they were this time last year. And that is broad-based across geography and sectors. And we expect to see growth as companies work through the excess liquidity they're holding, beginning to rebuild inventories, make investments in property, plant and equipment as their businesses expand. So I think there is opportunity to grow. The question will be the timing of that. And as David mentioned, we have we are experiencing historically low levels of line utilization. We expect our customers will get back into -- the credit. Once they work through the excess liquidity that they're holding, just don't know what the timing of that will be, it's largely a ton of, obviously, economic growth. We're confident that as the economy expands, we will grow loans. 
Separately, I think we'll continue to see good mortgage production on the consumer side, and we've got some other initiatives underway related to consumer lending that we think could have an impact as well. And finally, with small business, we're very pleased with our acquisition of Ascentium Capital. We think that equipment finance is an important part of of potential growth, particularly in late 2021 and 2022.

Obviously, that gets more challenging as the year goes as a low interest rate environment. And the reinvestment risk puts more pressure on revenue. 
You asked about '22. I haven't gotten to '22 yet, but if you think about the industry, I think we've got all work towards getting underneath that 55% in time and lower. But you can't do that until you get kind of normalized environment where you have normalized revenue. And if you did that, being under 55 is going to be, I think, expected. So in the interim, you get as efficient as you can. But you still have to make the investments to grow revenue, and that's what we're doing. So we've got a number of initiatives in our continuous improvement program that will continue to help us from a cost standpoint. And hopefully, those continuous improvement efforts also help us grow revenue. So I know I didn't give you a specific point, John.

There's a lot of pent-up demand. And as a result, we see hospitality sector, whether it be restaurants or hotels continuing to -- their performance continuing to improve. Probably the biggest challenge they face is workforce and hiring people to work. Heard a number of stories, sort of anecdotally over the last 2-plus weeks, about restaurant service being slow in so many places because restaurant owners are having difficulty bringing their workforce back. But people are getting out. And there's, I think, a significant indicators that people are going to be traveling a lot this summer. And so again, thinking about the markets we operate in, that bodes well for those economies. The energy sector is doing better for sure. So all in all, credit continues to improve. And based upon what we know today, we'd expect that trajectory to continue."

So I wouldn't say that, that gives us an opportunity to run our capital lower. We think our 9.5% in the middle of our range is the right number for us at this time based on the risk we see in our business.

Our credit metrics continue to improve and reflect the good work we've done with our clients, coupled with the expected benefits from government stimulus.

Although we continue to deal with the effects of the pandemic, our ongoing conversations with customers reflect optimism about further economic recovery and growth.
Vaccine distribution is improving in our footprint and businesses for the most part have reopened.

Let's start with the balance sheet. Average and ending adjusted loans declined 1% from the prior quarter. New and renewed commercial loan production increased 5% compared to the prior quarter. However, balances remained negatively impacte",1622,"Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average and ending adjusted loans declined 1% from the prior quarter. New and renewed commercial loan production increased 5% compared to the prior quarter. However, balances remained negatively impacted by excess liquidity in the market, resulting in historically low utilization levels. As of quarter end, commercial line utilization was 39% compared to our historical average of 45%. Just a reminder, each 1% of line utilization equates to approximately $600 million of loan growth.
Commercial loan balances continue to be impacted by the company's ongoing portfolio management activities and PPP forgiveness timing. Average consumer loans again reflected strong mortgage production, offset by runoff portfolios. Overall, we expect full year 2021 adjusted average loan balances to be down by low single digits compared to 2020, although we expect adjusted ending loans to grow by low single digits.
With respect to deposits, balances continued to increase this quarter to new record levels, led by growth in the consumer segment, reflecting recent government stimulus payments. The increase is primarily due to higher account balances. However, we are also experiencing new account growth. We expect near-term deposit balances will continue to increase, particularly as the recent stimulus is fully dispersed and corporate customers maintain higher cash levels.
Let's shift to net interest income and margin, which remain a significant source of stability for Regions. Net interest income decreased 4% on a reported basis or 1% excluding the impact from day count and PPP. PPP-related NII declined $14 million from the prior quarter as the benefits from round 2 were offset by slower round 1 forgiveness. 2 fewer days also reduced NII by $12 million. The decline in core NII stems mostly from lower loan balances and remixing out of higher-yielding loan categories.
Net interest margin declined during the quarter to 3.02%. Cash averaged over $16 billion during the quarter, and when combined with PPP, reduced first quarter margin by 38 basis points. Excluding excess cash and PPP, our normalized net interest margin remained stable at 3.40%, evidencing our proactive balance sheet management despite a near 0 short-term rate environment.
Similar to prior quarters, the impact from historically low long-term interest rates was offset by our cash management strategies, lower deposit costs and higher average notional values of active loan hedges. Cash management, mostly in the form of a December long-term debt call, contributed $6 million and 1 basis point of margin. Interest-bearing deposit costs fell 2 basis points in the quarter to 11 basis points, contributing $4 million and 1 basis point of margin.
Loan hedges added $102 million to NII and 31 basis points to the margin. Higher average hedge notional values drove a $3 million increase compared to the fourth quarter. At current rate levels, we expect a little over $100 million of hedge-related interest income each quarter until the hedges begin to mature in 2023. Within the quarter, we repositioned a total of $4.3 billion of cash flow swaps and floors targeting less protection in 2023 and 2024. While there may be additional adjustments in the future, we believe the resulting profile allows us to support our goal of consistent, sustainable growth. Specifically, we are positioned to benefit from the steepening yield curve and increases in short-term interest rates in the future, while protecting NII stability to the extent the Fed is on hold longer than the market currently expects. The potential for loan growth only enhances our participation in a recovering economy.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect NII, excluding cash and PPP to be relatively stable. While recent curve steepening has helped asset reinvestment levels, long-term rates will remain a modest near-term headwind. Deposit cost reductions, one additional day and hedging benefits will support NII in the quarter, while loan balances are expected to remain relatively stable. Over the second half of the year and beyond, a strengthening economy, a relatively neutral impact from rates and the potential for balance sheet growth are expected to ultimately drive growth in NII.
Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income decreased 2% from the prior quarter, but reflects a 32% increase compared to the first quarter of 2020. Capital markets delivered another strong quarter as customers continued to respond to interest rate changes and potential regulatory and tax headwinds. Fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers and securities underwriting, both achieved record levels, and M&A advisory services also delivered solid results. While we expect capital markets revenue to remain solid over the remainder of the year, some activity was pulled forward. Looking ahead, we expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue in the $55 million to $65 million range on average, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA.
Mortgage delivered another strong quarter as we continue to focus on growing market share and improving our customer experience. Mortgage income increased 20% over the prior quarter, driven primarily by agency gain on sale and favorable MSR valuation. Production for the quarter was up 89% over the prior year, setting the stage for another strong year of mortgage income.
Service charges were negatively impacted by both seasonal declines and increased deposit balances. While improving, we believe changes in customer behavior as well as customer benefits from enhancements to our overdraft practices and transaction posting are likely to keep service charges below pre-pandemic levels. Although we expect the impact of these changes will be partially offset by continued account growth, we estimate 2021 service charges will grow compared to 2020, but remain approximately 10% to 15% below 2019 levels.
Card and ATM fees have recovered, up 10% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by increased debit card spend. Given the timing of interest rate changes in 2020, combined with exceptionally strong fee income performance, we expect 2021 adjusted total revenue to be down modestly compared to the prior year. But this will be dependent on the timing and amount of PPP loan forgiveness and loan growth.
Let's move on to noninterest expense. Adjusted noninterest expenses decreased 1% in the quarter, driven by lower incentive compensation, primarily related to capital markets and mortgage, which was partially offset by a seasonal increase in payroll taxes. Of note, base salaries were 4% lower compared to the fourth quarter as we remain focused on our continuous improvement process. Associate head count decreased 2% quarter-over-quarter and 4% year-over-year. And excluding the impact of our Ascentium Capital acquisition that closed April 1, 2020, head count was down 6%.
We will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology, products and people to grow our business. In 2021, we expect adjusted noninterest expenses to remain stable compared to 2020, with quarterly adjusted noninterest expenses in the $880 million to $890 million range. And while we face uncertainty regarding the pace of economic recovery, we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time.
From an asset quality perspective, overall credit continues to perform better than expected. Annualized net charge-offs were 40 basis points, a 3 basis point improvement over the prior quarter, reflecting broad-based improvement across most portfolios. Nonperforming loans, total delinquencies, business services criticized loans all declined modestly. Our allowance for credit losses declined 25 basis points to 2.44% of total loans and 280% of total nonaccrual loans. Excluding PPP loans, our allowance for credit losses was 2.57%. The decline in the allowance reflects charge-offs previously provided for, stabilization in our economic outlook, and improved credit performance, including the impact of the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill approved in March.
The allowance reduction resulted in a net $142 million benefit to the provision. Our allowance remains one of the highest in our peer group as measured against period-end loans or stress losses as modeled by the Federal Reserve. Future levels of the allowance will depend on the timing of charge-offs and greater certainty with respect to the path of the economic recovery. As we look forward, we are cautiously optimistic regarding our credit performance for the year. While net charge-offs can be volatile quarter-to-quarter, based on current expectations, we believe the peak is behind us, and we expect full year 2021 net charge-offs to range from 40 to 50 basis points.
With respect to capital, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 50 basis points to an estimated 10.3% this quarter. As you are aware, the Federal Reserve extended their restrictions on capital distributions through the second quarter of 2021. The Federal Reserve also indicated these restrictions are expected to be lifted beginning in the third quarter, subject to capital remaining above required levels in the ongoing 2021 CCAR cycle for firms participating. We have opted into this year's CCAR and assuming capital levels remain above required levels in the Fed stress test, we should be back to managing capital distributions against the SCB requirements beginning in the third quarter. However, our plan is to begin share repurchases in the second quarter subject to the Fed's earnings-based restrictions.
Based on our internal stress testing framework and the amount of capital we need to run our business, we are updating our operating range for common equity Tier 1 to 9.25% to 9.75%, with a goal of managing to the midpoint over time.
So wrapping up on the next slide, our 2021 expectations, which we have already addressed. In summary, we feel really good about our first quarter results and anticipate carrying the momentum into the remainder of 2021. Pretax pre-provision income remained strong. Expenses are well controlled. Credit quality is outperforming expectations. Capital and liquidity are solid, and we are optimistic about the prospect for the economic recovery to continue in our markets.
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

We wanted protection, and our goal is not to turn the derivatives into a trading asset, but to have it help us manage the volatility of NII and this worked extremely well for us. As we think about the future, we obviously look at all the data points to try and figure out when the Fed may move. And as we continue to have economic progress, we're thinking that there is more likelihood of an increase at short rates and probably long rates to follow starting in the back half of '22 into '23 and '24.
We wanted to participate in that and not have our NII being muted, so we terminated the $4.3 billion worth of derivatives. You take the whatever gain you have and you have to spread that over the life, you don't get a onetime gain. So we will continue to evaluate the economic recovery, and we'll make adjustments as we go along. We still have protection, though, for '21 and '22. No change there. It's just the -- out the curve, I mean, out the term a little bit in terms of '20 -- really '23 and '24."

We've done a little bit, but we're reluctant because I was talking to our Treasurer yesterday, there's no free lunch here. You just can't -- you can't hide from the risk that you take if you try to take duration risk right now and deploying that. The securities book will help you short term in NII, but you will pay for that dearly down the road, and we're playing the long game.

Obviously, continue to have pressure and reinvestment of fixed rate assets throughout the year. We do have some, obviously, protection on NII through our hedging program. So we're excited about that.
From a loan growth standpoint, we are in some great markets, and we expect to benefit over time as our economies continue to open and we get some loan growth. We have some headwinds in terms of can we continue to have capital markets at $100 million every quarter. We guided you to $55 million to $65 million. So who knows, I mean, if we continue to have capital markets should be robust, M&A should be robust, and we might be able to outperform there. But we gave you the guide of $55 million to $65 million. We think mortgage will continue to be strong. Our teams are performing very well in terms of mortgage. And we think there could be some upside there. But who knows, we have to see what happens with the rate environment.
I think in terms of PPP, we have $4.3 billion of PPP loans outstanding. We originated $1.5 billion under the PPP 2 program, and we forgave about $700 million in the first quarter. The timing of that forgiveness is a big determinant, Ryan, in terms of ultimate income for us. We think that's back-end loaded literally in the fourth quarter before you start seeing real forgiveness. As a matter of fact, we have a little bit of pressure on PPP-generated revenue in -- from first to second quarter as we disclosed a little bit -- and that's only because of timing. The point is, if you got $4.3 billion, the fees and interest we earn off, that's a little over 3%, it's just timing. When is it coming in and your guess is as good as ours on that. But that will be -- that's a pretty big swing factor in terms of where we end up on our guide on revenue for the year."

You put out a release the other day announcing a $2.5 billion buyback. And if I look at market expectations for earnings, it implies a pretty steep decline in the capital level. So can you maybe just talk about expectations for utilizing the buyback, assuming the Fed continues to ease restrictions? And where do you see you actually running with the capital? I heard you said to run in the middle, but given that we're entering a period of strong economic growth potential for rates rising at some point in time, could we move towards the lower end of that over time?"

That range can change as economic conditions continue to improve. And we still have uncertainty out there. So we believe that's an appropriate range and appropriate midpoint of that at 9.50% is the right place for Regions at this time. As conditions get better, we'll -- we can adjust accordingly. Or if they get worse, we'll adjust the other way. We are at 10.3% today. So that's 80 basis points from the middle. Round numbers, that's $800 million worth of capital. We'll continue to -- we didn't have buybacks in the first quarter. As I mentioned, we will have some in the second quarter.
But let's go back and remember, our capital, we want to use to grow our business. That's its priority. We'd love to have more loan growth out there and to use it that way. We're going to pay a dividend in the 35% to 45% of our income, so that we have a sustainable dividend. We like to use that capital for nonbank acquisitions like we did on Ascentium Capital as a good example. So that's our preference.
We will then -- the last effort, we will use buybacks to maintain and optimize our capital at that 9.5% common equity Tier 1. So we'll be restricted on how much we get to do in the second quarter. We think we'll have a very good CCAR submission, which gives us more flexibility to manage that -- to that 9.5% starting in the third quarter. And you should expect us to get there fairly quickly."

We think of with the appropriate reserve we need to have, based on the risk inherent in our portfolio, that can change based on your profile. And to the extent the profile is better than it was that January when we adopted, if the environment that we expect through the whole life of the loan is better, then the reserves can go below that.
But it's all dependent on what the facts and circumstances are at each balance sheet day. And so we see the economy getting better. As we've mentioned, it's better, faster than we thought. We're still cautiously optimistic about where this goes. We need to get the vaccine out. We need the economies to continue to open. And if all that happens, you would expect reserves to come down. But right now, we can only take it -- we can only adjust the reserves based on what we see today. If next quarter, it's better, then you would expect it to come down.

We operate in some -- as David said, some really good markets. And most of the states that we operate in were some of the first to reopen their economies. As a result, unemployment rates in states like Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida are better than national average. And so we see businesses expanding.
Our pipelines today are 50% larger than they were this time last year. And that is broad-based across geography and sectors. And we expect to see growth as companies work through the excess liquidity they're holding, beginning to rebuild inventories, make investments in property, plant and equipment as their businesses expand. So I think there is opportunity to grow. The question will be the timing of that. And as David mentioned, we are experiencing historically low levels of line utilization. We expect our customers will get back into their lines of credit. Once they work through the excess liquidity that they're holding, just don't know what the timing of that will be, it's largely a function of, obviously, economic growth. We're confident that as the economy expands, we will grow loans.
Separately, I think we'll continue to see good mortgage production on the consumer side, and we've got some other initiatives underway related to consumer lending that we think could have an impact as well. And finally, with small business, we're very pleased with our acquisition of Ascentium Capital. We think that equipment finance is an important part of potential growth, particularly in late 2021 and 2022. And so I believe all those things can be drivers of some loan growth to offset, to your point, the headwinds we face with PPP and some of the exit portfolios."

We do that by both growing the revenue and -- because of the investments that we're making and watching our costs. We feel good about where we are with our efficiency ratio, especially compared to our peer group. Obviously, that gets more challenging as the year goes as a low interest rate environment and the reinvestment risk puts more pressure on revenue.
You asked about '22. I haven't gotten to '22 yet, but if you think about the industry, I think we've got all work towards getting underneath that 55% in time and lower. But you can't do that until you get kind of normalized environment where you have normalized revenue. And if you did that, being under 55% is going to be, I think, expected. So in the interim, you get as efficient as you can, but you still have to make the investments to grow revenue, and that's what we're doing. So we've got a number of initiatives on our continuous improvement program that will continue to help us from the cost standpoint. And hopefully, those continuous improvement efforts also help us grow revenue. So I know I didn't give you a specific point, John, but at the end of the day, we'll continue to work to get that number down over time."

And so we want to be actively participating.
We have a very good, as an example, solar capabilities and capital markets capabilities associated with solar, and we are continuing to look for opportunities to develop capabilities that would support the transition to a more climate-friendly environment.

We're pleased with our performance this quarter. And importantly, we're beginning to see increased activity across our footprint that gives us greater confidence for overall growth in the second half of the year. 
Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $748 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.77. Credit quality at regions and across the industry has demonstrated remarkable resiliency throughout the pandemic. Broadly speaking, since the pandemic began, I believe banks have done a tremendous job staying close to customers and supporting their needs by providing capital, advice and guidance. 
As I've begun to track our footprint again and meet with customers, I see them gaining confidence in the economic recovery and their own business plans. I've seen the strength of our markets firsthand. This, combined with the ongoing successful execution of our strategic plan, has positioned the Regions well for growth as the economic recovery continues. We remain focused on client selectivity, risk-adjusted returns and capital allocation, all while making investments, particularly in talent and technology, to support growth. 
For example, over the last year, we redesigned our mobile app and are continuing to make further enhancements to both our online and mobile platforms. We digitized the sales process. You can now apply for almost any consumer banking product online. We're putting digital tools in the hands of our bankers and contact center associates, allowing customers to start a process in one channel and seamlessly transition to another. We now have e-signature capabilities across most of the franchise. 
As a result of all of these changes, year-to-date, digital sales are up 53% over the prior year. We have also leveraged artificial intelligence to build lead generation and next best action tools for our bankers. We're also utilizing artificial intelligence in our contact centers. [ Reggie, ] our virtual banker, is on pace to handle over 1 million customer calls this year. Technology investments have also allowed nearly 100% of our contact center associates to work remotely, providing permanent cost saves from reductions in legacy corporate space. 
In addition, over the last 3 years, we've increased mortgage loan originators by approximately 150 and we'll continue to add talent as we grow market share. We've also added approximately 80 client-facing associates across the corporate bank and wealth management with a particular focus on growth markets. We've consolidated over 215 branches while opening 75 de novo branches, primarily within dense, fast-growing markets. These new branches have contributed almost 20% of our total retail checking account growth over the last 3 years. 
We're also investing in products and capabilities to serve our customers. In Wealth Management, we deepened our expertise in the not-for-profit and health care space through the acquisition of Highland Associates. And we're working on a digital advisory solution with deployment targeted for late this year or early next. Last year, we purchased Ascentium Capital to help small businesses with their essential equipment needs, and the platform has performed well throughout the pandemic. 
On the consumer side, we just announced an agreement to acquire EnerBank, a top 5 originator in the home improvement point-of-sale space, which we're really excited about. Going forward, we'll continue to look for bolt-on acquisitions that provide products and capabilities that are important to our customers. 
With some really great markets as reflected on the slide you see now. These markets, coupled with our go-to-market strategy and aided by technology investments, have helped us realize some really nice growth in consumer checking accounts. Our year-to-date account growth is nearly 3x higher than our 2019 pre-pandemic rate for the same period. 
So we have a really solid strategic plan that supports our goal of generating consistent, sustainable, long-term performance, and we have a proven track record of successful execution. We feel very good about our progress and believe we are really well positioned to grow as the economic recovery continues to gain momentum in our markets. 
Now David will provide you with some details regarding the quarter."

Let's start with the balance sheet. Average adjusted loans remained stable during the quarter, although adjusted ending loans increased 1%, confirming our view that loan growth should begin in the back half of the year. Although corporate",1526,"Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average adjusted loans remained stable during the quarter, although adjusted ending loans increased 1%, confirming our view that loan growth should begin in the back half of the year. Although corporate loans continued to be impacted by low utilization rates and excess liquidity, pipelines have now surpassed pre-pandemic levels, production remains strong with new and renewed commitments increasing 33% compared to first quarter, and we believe utilization reached an inflection point during the quarter. 
On a reported basis, average corporate loans increased, while ending loans declined, reflecting an acceleration in PPP forgiveness late in the quarter. Through June 30, approximately 53% of total PPP loans have been forgiven and we anticipate that reaching approximately 80% by year-end. Consumer loans reflected another strong quarter of mortgage production accompanied by modest ending growth in credit card. However, consumer loans continue to be negatively impacted by runoff portfolios and further pay downs in home equity. 
Overall, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted average loan balances to be down by low single digits compared to 2020, although we expect adjusted ending loans to grow by low single digits. With respect to loan guidance and the rest of our 2021 expectations, we are not including any impacts from our pending EnerBank acquisition. 
So let's turn to deposits. Although the pace of deposit growth has slowed, balances continued to increase this quarter to new record levels. The increase is primarily due to higher account balances; however, as John mentioned, we're also producing strong new account growth. We are continuing to analyze probable future deposit behavior. And based on analysis of pandemic-related deposit inflow characteristics, we currently believe between 20% and 30% of deposit increases will likely persist on the balance sheet. Broadly speaking, we think liquidity will normalize over time as the Fed becomes less accommodative. Reductions in their asset purchases will mitigate future liquidity increases in the system, which should curve further deposit growth. 
Let's shift to net interest income and margin, which remains a significant source of stability for Regions. Pandemic-related items continue to impact NII and margin. PPP-related NII increased $3 million from the prior quarter. Cash averaged $23 billion during the quarter. And when combined with PPP, reduced second quarter reported margin by 50 basis points. Excluding excess cash and PPP, our adjusted margin was 3.31%, evidencing active balance sheet management efforts despite a near zero short-term rate environment. 
The 9 basis point linked quarter decline was mostly attributable to the purchase of $2 billion of securities and 1 additional day in the quarter, both of which support NII at the expense of margin. Similar to prior quarters, the impact on NII from historically low long-term interest rates was completely offset by balance sheet management strategies, lower deposit costs and higher hedging income. Lower LIBOR drove a $2 million increase from loan hedges. And at current rate levels, we expect roughly $105 million of hedge-related interest income each quarter until the hedges begin to mature in 2023. 
Since the beginning of 2021, we have repositioned a total of $6.3 billion of cash flow swaps and floors. We do not currently expect any further repositioning. However, this is continually evaluated in the context of a dynamic balance sheet. Our current balance sheet profile allows us to support our goal of consistent, sustainable earnings growth. Specifically, we are positioned to benefit from higher middle tenor interest rates and increases in short-term interest rates in the future while protecting NII stability to the extent the Fed remains on hold longer than the market currently expects. 
Importantly, recent declines of longer maturity market yields have less of an impact on Regions' earnings potential as most of our fixed rate production has maturities of shorter than 6 years, a point on the curve that on a relative basis has fallen less. With respect to outlook, we view second quarter's NII to be the low point for the year. Over the second half and beyond, a strengthening economy, a relatively neutral impact from rates and organic and strategic balance sheet growth are expected to ultimately drive NII growth. 
Before moving on, I want to highlight Slides 17 through 19 in the appendix, which provides additional asset liability management information that we think will be helpful to investors. Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income decreased 6% from the prior quarter, but reflects a 5% increase compared to the second quarter of 2020. Capital Markets returned to a normal run rate after experiencing record results in the prior 2 quarters. 
Looking ahead, we expect capital markets to remain a strong contributor, generating quarterly revenue in the $55 million to $65 million range on average, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. Mortgage income decreased quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to the gain on sale compression and hedge performance, particularly around timing and market volatility. We believe pricing has stabilized and expect second half revenue to be fairly consistent with that recorded during the second quarter. 
Wealth management income increased quarter-over-quarter, reflecting strong production and favorable market conditions. Service charges also increased compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by 3 additional business days. While improving, we believe changes in customer behavior as well as customer benefits from enhancements to our overdraft practices and transaction posting, which we have highlighted in the appendix, are likely to keep service charges below pre-pandemic levels. We estimate 2021 service charges will grow compared to 2020, but remain approximately 10% to 15% below 2019 levels. 
Card and ATM fees continue to benefit from increased economic activity in our footprint, reflecting strong growth, up 11% compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by increased debit and credit card spend, both now exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Given the timing of interest rate declines in 2020, combined with exceptionally strong noninterest income, we expect 2021 adjusted total revenue to be stable to up modestly compared to the prior year. But this will be dependent on the timing and amount of PPP loan forgiveness. 
Let's move on to noninterest expense. While exceptionally strong performance, particularly in credit, is contributing to higher-than-anticipated other incentive compensation, adjusted noninterest expenses decreased 3% in the quarter, driven primarily by lower capital markets incentive compensation, payroll taxes and legal and professional fees, partially offset by an increase in merit and marketing expenses. 
We will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology, products and people to grow our business. In 2021, we expect adjusted noninterest expenses to be stable to up modestly compared to 2020, with quarterly adjusted noninterest expenses in the $880 million to $890 million range. And we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time. From an asset quality standpoint, we delivered strong performance as overall credit continues to perform better than expected. 
Reflecting broad-based improvement across most portfolios and recoveries associated with strong collateral asset values, annualized net charge-offs decreased 17 basis points during the quarter to 23 basis points. Nonperforming loans, total delinquencies and business services criticized loans all improved during the quarter. Our allowance for credit losses declined 44 basis points to 2% of total loans and 253% of total nonaccrual loans. Excluding PPP loans, our allowance for credit losses was 2.07%. 
The decline in the allowance reflects better-than-expected credit trends and a continued constructive outlook on the economy. The allowance reduction resulted in a net $337 million benefit to the provision. Our allowance remains above peer median as measured against period-end loans or stress losses as modeled by the Federal Reserve. Future levels of the allowance will depend on the timing of charge-offs and greater certainty with respect to the path of the economic recovery. Based on improved market conditions, we now expect full year 2021 net charge-offs to range from 25 to 35 basis points.
With respect to capital, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 10 basis points to an estimated 10.4% this quarter. Based on the recent stress test results, our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement for the fourth quarter 2021 through the third quarter of 2022 will be 2.5%. And our common equity Tier 1 operating range remains 9.25% to 9.75%, with the goal of managing to the midpoint over time. 
We repurchased 8 million common shares during the second quarter. However, we are temporarily pausing further share repurchases until the expected EnerBank closing date in the fourth quarter. We anticipate being back in the market in the fourth quarter and expect to manage CET1 to the midpoint of our operating range by year-end. Also, earlier this week, our Board of Directors declared a 10% increase to our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.17 per share. 
So wrapping up on the next slide are our 2021 expectations, which we've already addressed. In summary, we're very pleased with our second quarter results and are poised for growth as the economic recovery continues. Pretax pre-provision income remained strong. Expenses are well controlled. Credit quality is outperforming expectations. Capital and liquidity are solid. And we're optimistic about the pace of the economic recovery in our markets. 
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

Our markets were -- when COVID originally impacted the economy, they were some of the last to close and first to reopen. And we really have seen the benefits of that with increasing activity -- economic activity in our markets. We also are operating in markets that are some of the least vaccinated. And so we have been at risk of some recurrence of COVID. The Delta variant is having some impact on the population, but we've not seen it necessarily impact the economy yet. Loan growth has been broad-based. We're seeing increasing activity across virtually all of our markets. Growth has been across multiple segments, whether it be small business, middle market, large corporate. 
We're growing in many of our specialized industries businesses like health care, technology, financial services, transportation, seeing growth in asset-based lending. And so pipelines are -- have definitely expanded as I think the point was made, they exceed levels that we were experiencing at this same time in 2019. And the needs are for -- to support M&A activity, to support short-term working capital needs associated with expansion in businesses, growth in commodity prices, and also increasingly some fixed capital investment, which I think is a very good sign. And then -- and frankly, is a green shoot we've been looking for. 
Just as a follow-on on the consumer side as well. We obviously had good mortgage production. We expect to begin to see some growth in card as the level of payments comes down and spend increases. So that should be positive as well."

We're obviously in this transition period post -- or I guess, still in the middle of the pandemic, but starting to return to work, but having some -- return to the office, I should say. We've been working the whole time, really providing some flexibility for our workforce. So I think when you create opportunities like that, you have to pay people fair market value and we think we do that. 
So we haven't seen any big trends that have gone the other way. But we're cognizant of the fact that people have alternatives when we're working in a remote environment. And I think being able to adapt to that and have flexibility will be a way to deal with it. So the answer, I guess, short answer is no, we haven't seen that yet."

So we're carrying on average about $23 billion sitting at the Fed, earning 15 basis points. We'd love to redeploy that in a more meaningful manner. But sitting here where we are with the 10-year and trying to invest in mortgage-backed securities is probably ill-advised. 
Normally, we had been -- withdraw, that number had been, call it, $1 billion, maybe $2 billion in normal times. So it's a tremendous number. We do think the surge deposits that we've had this year, $30-plus billion that we think 20% to 30% of that will persist on the balance sheet, as we mentioned. We'll have a higher beta on it, but nonetheless, the question of timing really is centered on the economic recovery and what the Fed does with its balance sheet and lower rate environment, more accommodation means deposits linger longer. If, in fact, the economy continues to rebound, we get the virus under control, when we start seeing GDP growth and people putting their cash to work, then maybe we see it run out a little faster.

So it's -- today, we estimate the marketplace is about $176 billion annual origination market across a couple of different categories of home improvement. EnerBank has been particularly active in HVAC, in pools, have a growing presence in solar. And we have been observing, participating in indirectly the point-of-sale lending space for now 6 or 7 years and have aspired to have the opportunity to have an origination vehicle, if you will. And we think EnerBank provides that. We built our consumer lending strategy around lending around the home, if you will. So we've been investing in mortgage. We're making some improvements in our equity loan and line products. And we think EnerBank is sort of the third leg of that lending around the homes too with a focus on home improvement and point-of-sale lending at -- to the consumer. 
In terms of what we bring, we bring balance sheet. EnerBank's growth has been constrained to some extent by their willingness, if you will, the parent company's willingness to fund their growth. And we, of course, have significant liquidity and a balance sheet and a desire to continue to grow that business. We bring banking products and services to EnerBank's customers, which we think we can more broadly deliver, and deepen those relationships, which benefits EnerBank as well. And then which bring overall capacity in an existing customer portfolio that we think we can market into across our footprint. 
So we believe the combination, really powerful. We think we can be a nice asset for growth, a nice a set of products to offer to our existing customers, and at the same time, a nice group of customers to sell our products into to meet EnerBank's customer needs. It should be a good combination."

And so if somebody takes out a loan and then refinances, we're going to be there, that's going to be our customer now that we have mortgage opportunity for. 
So if that happens, those fees get accelerated. And so -- whereas EnerBank would have received that, they wouldn't have gotten the benefits of the mortgage. We're going to be able to get that and the fees. So we just think it's going to be very powerful. The last piece of this, I'll say is, as John mentioned, it's a large industry, but it's incredibly fragmented where EnerBank only represents 1% of that production.

And so the repositioning of moving those notional amounts to a different period of time to help protect us when the economy actually rolls over the other way and the Fed becomes more accommodative. So it's very dynamic. What we want to do is make sure we have an appropriate interest rate risk program that lets us benefit regardless of what the rate environment is. And that's in every day. We have a whole group of people. That's what they do every day. And so we've made the changes we think necessary thus far, but we're going to continue to watch it."

I'm glad you mentioned that. That's exactly the point we're trying to make. So if you just looked at the hedge benefit of the $105 million, I think we have -- can we put that in the slide? If we didn't do it this time, we act",247,"Yes. I mean that's the point. I'm glad you mentioned that. That's exactly the point we're trying to make. So if you just looked at the hedge benefit of the $105 million, I think we have -- can we put that in the slide? If we didn't do it this time, we actually had a slide that show it, drifting down lower as you go through 2023. But that's that. That's based on today. Over time, that can change because if we reposition certain derivatives, we're not going to be benefiting from the derivative, but we'll be benefiting because rates are higher on the rest of our loan portfolio. 
The purpose of the hedge was to protect us, not the juice NII and margin. It was to protect us if rates stayed low, which they have done. And so when you think about giving up, if you will, benefit from our derivatives, because either their term comes or we terminate them, is because we're winning on our whole portfolio that helps offset and then some for NII growth. Hopefully, that makes sense. 
Let me go back to John Pancari's question on loan production. So John, we -- if you go back to the second quarter of '19 and you compare that production level to what we just had, it's a little over 100%. So a little bit more than double what that production was at that time. So Hopefully, that gives you a little bit of context."

Approximately 48% we said is dedicated to keeping the bank going to maintaining operations and 42% support innovation and new ideas. And we're going to continue to make those investments. And we believe through doing things like improving our mobile app through digitizing the account origination process, through giving our bankers, whether they're in the branches or commercial wealth RMs, more digital tools to assist customers, e-signature capabilities across the footprint drives digital usage. 
At the same time, we want to make sure that we're investing in capabilities that give customers more self-service options that allow them to use all of our channels and have the same great experience, whether they're at an ATM in a branch or using their mobile or online app or talking to the call center. That will be really important to us as we continue to try to meet customer expectations for convenience and speed of transaction, more self-service options. So I think as we make those investments, they create process improvements. They help us drive efficiencies and effectiveness consistent with our desire to continuously improve. And that generates more funding for reinvestment in technology and innovation.

We're pleased with our performance this quarter. And importantly, we're beginning to see increased activity across our footprint that gives us greater confidence for overall growth in the second half of the year.
Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $748 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.77. Credit quality at Regions and across the industry has demonstrated remarkable resiliency throughout the pandemic. Broadly speaking, since the pandemic began, I believe banks have done a tremendous job staying close to customers and supporting their needs by providing capital, advice and guidance.
As I've begun to track our footprint again and meet with customers, I see them gaining confidence in the economic recovery and their own business plans. I've seen the strength of our markets firsthand. This, combined with the ongoing successful execution of our strategic plan, has positioned Regions well for growth as the economic recovery continues. We remain focused on client selectivity, risk-adjusted returns and capital allocation, all while making investments, particularly in talent and technology, to support growth.
For example, over the last year, we redesigned our mobile app and are continuing to make further enhancements to both our online and mobile platforms. We digitized the sales process. You can now apply for almost any consumer banking product online. We're putting digital tools in the hands of our bankers and contact center associates, allowing customers to start a process in one channel and seamlessly transition to another. We now have e-signature capabilities across most of the franchise.
As a result of all of these changes, year-to-date, digital sales are up 53% over the prior year. We have also leveraged artificial intelligence to build lead generation and next best action tools for our bankers. We're also utilizing artificial intelligence in our contact centers. Reggie, our virtual banker, is on pace to handle over 1 million customer calls this year. Technology investments have also allowed nearly 100% of our contact center associates to work remotely, providing permanent cost saves from reductions in legacy corporate space.
In addition, over the last 3 years, we've increased mortgage loan originators by approximately 150, and we'll continue to add talent as we grow market share. We've also added approximately 80 client-facing associates across the corporate bank and wealth management with a particular focus on growth markets. We've consolidated over 215 branches while opening 75 de novo branches, primarily within dense, fast-growing markets. These new branches have contributed almost 20% of our total retail checking account growth over the last 3 years.
We're also investing in products and capabilities to serve our customers. In Wealth Management, we deepened our expertise in the not-for-profit and health care space through the acquisition of Highland Associates. And we're working on a digital advisory solution with deployment targeted for late this year or early next. Last year, we purchased Ascentium Capital to help small businesses with their essential equipment needs, and the platform has performed well throughout the pandemic.
On the consumer side, we just announced an agreement to acquire EnerBank, a top 5 originator in the home improvement point-of-sale space, which we're really excited about. Going forward, we'll continue to look for bolt-on acquisitions that provide products and capabilities that are important to our customers.
We're in some really great markets as reflected on the slide you see now. These markets, coupled with our go-to-market strategy and aided by technology investments, have helped us realize some really nice growth in consumer checking accounts. Our year-to-date account growth is nearly 3x higher than our 2019 prepandemic rate for the same period.
So we have a really solid strategic plan that supports our goal of generating consistent, sustainable, long-term performance, and we have a proven track record of successful execution. We feel very good about our progress and believe we are really well positioned to grow as the economic recovery continues to gain momentum in our markets.
Now David will provide you with some details regarding the quarter."

Let's start with the balance sheet. Average adjusted loans remained stable during the quarter, although adjusted ending loans increased 1%, confirming our view that loan growth should begin in the back half of the year. Although corporate",1527,"Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average adjusted loans remained stable during the quarter, although adjusted ending loans increased 1%, confirming our view that loan growth should begin in the back half of the year. Although corporate loans continued to be impacted by low utilization rates and excess liquidity, pipelines have now surpassed prepandemic levels, production remains strong with new and renewed commitments increasing 33% compared to first quarter, and we believe utilization reached an inflection point during the quarter.
On a reported basis, average corporate loans increased, while ending loans declined, reflecting an acceleration in PPP forgiveness late in the quarter. Through June 30, approximately 53% of total PPP loans have been forgiven, and we anticipate that reaching approximately 80% by year-end. Consumer loans reflected another strong quarter of mortgage production accompanied by modest ending growth in credit card. However, consumer loans continue to be negatively impacted by runoff portfolios and further paydowns in home equity.
Overall, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted average loan balances to be down by low single digits compared to 2020, although we expect adjusted ending loans to grow by low single digits. With respect to loan guidance and the rest of our 2021 expectations, we are not including any impacts from our pending EnerBank acquisition.
So let's turn to deposits. Although the pace of deposit growth has slowed, balances continued to increase this quarter to new record levels. The increase is primarily due to higher account balances; however, as John mentioned, we're also producing strong new account growth. We are continuing to analyze probable future deposit behavior and based on analysis of pandemic-related deposit inflow characteristics, we currently believe between 20% and 30% of deposit increases will likely persist on the balance sheet. Broadly speaking, we think liquidity will normalize over time as the Fed becomes less accommodative. Reductions in their asset purchases will mitigate future liquidity increases in the system, which should curb further deposit growth.
Let's shift to net interest income and margin, which remain a significant source of stability for Regions. Pandemic-related items continue to impact NII and margin. PPP-related NII increased $3 million from the prior quarter. Cash averaged $23 billion during the quarter, and when combined with PPP, reduced second quarter reported margin by 50 basis points. Excluding excess cash and PPP, our adjusted margin was 3.31%, evidencing active balance sheet management efforts despite a near-zero short-term rate environment.
The 9 basis point linked-quarter decline was mostly attributable to the purchase of $2 billion of securities and 1 additional day in the quarter, both of which support NII at the expense of margin. Similar to prior quarters, the impact on NII from historically low long-term interest rates was completely offset by balance sheet management strategies, lower deposit costs and higher hedging income. Lower LIBOR drove a $2 million increase from loan hedges. And at current rate levels, we expect roughly $105 million of hedge-related interest income each quarter until the hedges begin to mature in 2023.
Since the beginning of 2021, we have repositioned a total of $6.3 billion of cash flow swaps and floors. We do not currently expect any further repositioning. However, this is continually evaluated in the context of a dynamic balance sheet. Our current balance sheet profile allows us to support our goal of consistent, sustainable earnings growth. Specifically, we are positioned to benefit from higher middle tenor interest rates and increases in short-term interest rates in the future while protecting NII stability to the extent the Fed remains on hold longer than the market currently expects.
Importantly, recent declines of longer maturity market yields have less of an impact on Regions' earnings potential as most of our fixed rate production has maturities of shorter than 6 years, a point on the curve that on a relative basis has fallen less. With respect to outlook, we view second quarter's NII to be the low point for the year. Over the second half and beyond, a strengthening economy, a relatively neutral impact from rates, and organic and strategic balance sheet growth are expected to ultimately drive NII growth.
Before moving on, I want to highlight Slides 17 through 19 in the appendix, which provides additional asset liability management information that we think will be helpful to investors.
Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income decreased 6% from the prior quarter, but reflects a 5% increase compared to the second quarter of 2020. Capital markets returned to a normal run rate after experiencing record results in the prior 2 quarters. Looking ahead, we expect capital markets to remain a strong contributor, generating quarterly revenue in the $55 million to $65 million range on average, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA.
Mortgage income decreased quarter over quarter, primarily due to the gain on sale compression and hedge performance, particularly around timing and market volatility. We believe pricing has stabilized and expect second half revenue to be fairly consistent with that recorded during the second quarter.
Wealth Management income increased quarter over quarter, reflecting strong production and favorable market conditions. Service charges also increased compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by 3 additional business days. While improving, we believe changes in customer behavior as well as customer benefits from enhancements to our overdraft practices and transaction posting, which we have highlighted in the appendix, are likely to keep service charges below prepandemic levels. We estimate 2021 service charges will grow compared to 2020, but  remain approximately 10% to 15% below 2019 levels.
Card and ATM fees continue to benefit from increased economic activity in our footprint, reflecting strong growth, up 11% compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by increased debit and credit card spend, both now exceeding prepandemic levels. Given the timing of interest rate declines in 2020, combined with exceptionally strong noninterest income, we expect 2021 adjusted total revenue to be stable to up modestly compared to the prior year. But this will be dependent on the timing and amount of PPP loan forgiveness.
Let's move on to noninterest expense. While exceptionally strong performance, particularly in credit, is contributing to higher-than-anticipated other incentive compensation, adjusted noninterest expenses decreased 3% in the quarter, driven primarily by lower capital markets incentive compensation, payroll taxes and legal and professional fees, partially offset by an increase in merit and marketing expenses.
We will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology, products and people to grow our business. In 2021, we expect adjusted noninterest expenses to be stable to up modestly compared to 2020, with quarterly adjusted noninterest expenses in the $880 million to $890 million range. And we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time. From an asset quality standpoint, we delivered strong performance as overall credit continues to perform better than expected. 
Reflecting broad-based improvement across most portfolios and recoveries associated with strong collateral asset values, annualized net charge-offs decreased 17 basis points during the quarter to 23 basis points. Nonperforming loans, total delinquencies and business services criticized loans all improved during the quarter. Our allowance for credit losses declined 44 basis points to 2% of total loans and 253% of total nonaccrual loans. Excluding PPP loans, our allowance for credit losses was 2.07%.
The decline in the allowance reflects better-than-expected credit trends and a continued constructive outlook on the economy. The allowance reduction resulted in a net $337 million benefit to the provision. Our allowance remains above peer median as measured against period-end loans or stress losses as modeled by the Federal Reserve. Future levels of the allowance will depend on the timing of charge-offs and greater certainty with respect to the path of the economic recovery. Based on improved market conditions, we now expect full year 2021 net charge-offs to range from 25 to 35 basis points.
With respect to capital, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 10 basis points to an estimated 10.4% this quarter. Based on the recent stress test results, our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement for the fourth quarter 2021 through the third quarter of 2022 will be 2.5%. And our common equity Tier 1 operating range remains 9.25% to 9.75%, with a goal of managing to the midpoint over time.
We repurchased 8 million common shares during the second quarter. However, we are temporarily pausing further share repurchases until the expected EnerBank closing date in the fourth quarter. We anticipate being back in the market in the fourth quarter and expect to manage CET1 to the midpoint of our operating range by year-end. Also, earlier this week, our Board of Directors declared a 10% increase to our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.17 per share.
So wrapping up on the next slide are our 2021 expectations, which we've already addressed. In summary, we're very pleased with our second quarter results and are poised for growth as the economic recovery continues. Pretax preprovision income remains strong. Expenses are well controlled. Credit quality is outperforming expectations. Capital and liquidity are solid. And we're optimistic about the pace of the economic recovery in our markets.
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

Our markets where -- when COVID originally impacted the economy, they were some of the last to close and first to reopen. And we really have seen the benefits of that with increasing activity -- economic activity in our markets. We also are operating in markets that are some of the least vaccinated. And so we have been at risk of some recurrence of COVID. The Delta variant is having some impact on the population, but we've not seen it necessarily impact the economy yet. Loan growth has been broad-based. We're seeing increasing activity across virtually all of our markets. Growth has been across multiple segments, whether it be small business, middle market, large corporate.
We're growing in many of our specialized industries businesses like health care, technology, financial services, transportation, seeing growth in asset-based lending. And so pipelines are -- have definitely expanded as I think the point was made, they exceed levels that we were experiencing at this same time in 2019. And the needs are for -- to support M&A activity, to support short-term working capital needs associated with expansion in businesses, growth in commodity prices, and also increasingly some fixed capital investment, which I think is a very good sign. And then -- and frankly, is a green shoot we've been looking for.
I should say on the -- just as a follow-on on the consumer side as well. We obviously have had good mortgage production. We expect to begin to see some growth in card as the level of payments comes down and spend increases. So that should be positive as well."

We don't expect -- we didn't expect the growth we had this past quarter. So it continues to come in. Of course, we have childcare credits and things of that nature that will probably aid to the liquidity. So we're carrying on average about $23 billion sitting at the Fed, earning 15 basis points. We'd love to redeploy that in a more meaningful manner. But sitting here where we are with the 10-year and trying to invest in mortgage-backed security is probably ill-advised.
Normally, we had been draw -- that number had been, call it, $1 billion, maybe $2 billion in normal times. So it's a tremendous number. We do think the surge deposits that we've had this year, $30-plus billion that -- we think 20% to 30% of that will persist on the balance sheet, as we mentioned. We'll have a higher beta on it, but nonetheless, the question of timing really is centered on the economic recovery and what the Fed does with its balance sheet and lower rate environment. More accommodation means deposits linger longer. If, in fact, the economy continues to rebound, we get the virus under control, when we start seeing GDP growth and people putting their cash to work, then maybe we see it run out a little faster. So it's really, really hard to tell."

So if you look back 10 years and come forward to the day, there's been an over 40% decline in NSF OD fees that we recognize. So call that, I guess, on average about 4% a year from customers just managing their finances better. We've grown our customer base over that period of time. So you'd have to assume there are fewer incidences of NSFs and overdrafts. And I think that, that trend will continue. And as David said, we're prepared for that through growth in other fees associated with growth in our business, whether it be debit card transactions associated with the high level of debit card activation and growth in checking accounts, growth in wealth management, capital markets, and other sources of mortgage, other sources of fee income."

So it's -- today, we estimate the marketplace is about $176 billion annual origination market across a couple of different categories of home improvement. EnerBank has been particularly active in HVAC, in pools, have a growing presence in solar. And we have been observing, participating in indirectly the point-of-sale lending space for now 6 or 7 years and have aspired to have the opportunity to have an origination vehicle, if you will. And we think EnerBank provides that. We built our consumer lending strategy around -- lending around the home, if you will. So we've been investing in mortgage. We're making some improvements in our equity loan and line products. And we think EnerBank is sort of the third leg of that lending around the homes too with a focus on home improvement and point-of-sale lending at -- to the consumer.
In terms of what we bring, we bring balance sheet. EnerBank's growth has been constrained to some extent by their willingness, if you will, the parent company's willingness to fund their growth. And we, of course, have significant liquidity and a balance sheet and a desire to continue to grow that business. We bring banking products and services to EnerBank's customers, which we think we can more broadly deliver, and deepen those relationships, which benefits EnerBank as well. And then which bring overall capacity in an existing customer portfolio that we think we can market into across our footprint.
So we believe the combination, really powerful. We think we can be a nice asset for growth, a nice set of products to offer to our existing customers, and at the same time, a nice group of customers to sell our products into to meet EnerBank's customer needs. It should be a good combination."

As it relates to production, so 55% of their production is in our existing footprint. Obviously, 45% is not. And so we're looking at continuing to build out and diversify throughout the country on this particular product. One of the things we bring that they did not have is, as you know, the yield is roughly 9% with 2.5 points of that coming from the contractor or the dealer and the other is the customer. And so if somebody takes out a loan and then refinances, we're going to be there, that's going to be our customer now that we have a mortgage opportunity for.
So if that happens, those fees get accelerated. And so -- whereas EnerBank would have received that, they wouldn't have gotten the benefits of the mortgage. We're going to be able to get that and the fees. So we just think it's going to be very powerful. The last piece of this, I'll say is, as John mentioned, it's a large industry, but it's incredibly fragmented where EnerBank only represents 1% of that production. And we think, over time, we're going to be able to penetrate this market much deeper than what they've been able to do, primarily because of our funding."

We've talked about -- we think there's a misunderstanding on our swap book. We do have long terms, 5-year terms on our swaps. And as conditions change and we see an opportunity for rising rates, then you would expect us to take off some of that protection for low rate environment -- protection that we have for the low rate environment so that we can benefit as rates rise.
So that being said, we are naturally asset sensitive more so than many banks because of our deposit base. And so the repositioning of moving those notional amounts to a different period of time to help protect us when the economy actually rolls over the other way and the Fed becomes more accommodative. So it's very dynamic. What we want to do is make sure we have an appropriate interest rate risk program that lets us benefit regardless of what the rate environment is. And that's in every day. We have a whole group of people. That's what they do every day. And so we've made the changes we think necessary thus far, but we're going to continue to watch it."

So if you just looked at the hedge benefit of the $105 million, I think we have -- can we put that in the slide? If we didn't do it this time, we actually had a slide that show it, drifting down lower as you go through 2023. But that's that. That's based on today. Over time, that can change because if we reposition certain derivatives, we're not going to be benefiting from the derivative, but we'll be benefiting because rates are higher on the rest of our loan portfolio.
The purpose of the hedge was to protect us, not the juice NII and margin. It was to protect us if rates stayed low, which they have done. And so when you think about giving up, if you will, benefit from our derivatives, because either their term comes or we terminate them, it's because we're winning on our whole portfolio that helps offset and then some for NII growth. Hopefully, that makes sense.
Let me go back to John Pancari's question on loan production. So John, we -- if you go back to the second quarter of '19 and you compare that production level to what we just had, it's a little over 100%. So a little bit more than double what that production was at that time. So Hopefully, that gives you a little bit of context."

We appreciate you joining our call today. We're very pleased with our performance this quarter as we achieved earnings of $624 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.65.

We're very pleased with our performance this quarter as we achieved earnings of $624 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.65. Adjusted pretax preprovision income increased 4% sequentially, and we generated year-to-date positive operating leverage. 
Our ability to keep the momentum going and deliver solid third quarter results comes from 3 primary factors. First, we continue to benefit from our growing footprint. Unemployment levels are improving, and most of our markets are well below the national level. People and businesses are continuing to move into our 15-state footprint, and that bodes well for our growth prospects for the remainder of the year and into 2022. We'll continue to make strategic investments in core and growth markets where we can grow new customers and deepen existing relationships. 
On that note, we're also pleased to share that year-to-date net account growth has exceeded account growth for the preceding 3 years combined; second, credit quality has demonstrated incredible resiliency and continues to exceed our expectations. Businesses across all industries have found ways to adapt and prosper despite ongoing supply chain and labor issues and consumers continue to cautiously manage their finances. 
Overall, we feel very good about the health of our business and consumer customers; third, we continue to take advantage of opportunities to invest in talent, technology and capabilities to support growth. For instance, earlier this month, we closed on our acquisition of InterBank, a leading home improvement point-of-sale lender, a key part of our strategy to serve as a premier lender to homeowners. We also entered into an agreement to acquire Sabal Capital Partners. Sabal has a strong reputation in a proprietary technology platform that will expand our real estate and capital markets capabilities. 
Once the transition is complete, we expect to be a top 5 bank agency producer. The InterBank and Sabal acquisitions complement our existing portfolio of products and capabilities in the consumer and corporate bank. We will continue to evaluate prudent nonbank M&A opportunities that will allow us to expand our products and services and enhance our relevancy with our customers. 
Also, we recently launched our bank-owned certified now checking account. This new product has all the benefits of a traditional checking account without the concern of overdraft fees. And finally, our investments in digital and data are positioning us for growth. Through a technology-enabled seamless experience in branches and across all platforms, customers are responding to the personalized service, advice and guidance they received from regions. Today, more than 2/3 of our customer transactions are digital. Further, over the last 2 years, active mobile banking users are up 23%. And notably, Zelle transactions have more than tripled. 
We feel really good about our progress and momentum. We operate in some of the best markets in the country, have a solid strategic plan, an outstanding team and the experience to compete effectively. We focus every day on delivering products and services that are valued by our customers while continuing to support our communities and provide an appropriate return to our shareholders. 
Now David will provide you with some details regarding the quarter."
271409,674329894,2409899,"Regions Financial Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2021",2021-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Adjusted average in ending loans increased approximately 1% during the quarter. Although business loans continue to be impacted by low utilization rates and excess liquidity, pipelines have surpassed pr",1414,"Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Adjusted average in ending loans increased approximately 1% during the quarter. Although business loans continue to be impacted by low utilization rates and excess liquidity, pipelines have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. In addition, production remains strong with line of credit commitments increasing $2 billion year-to-date. Consumer loans reflected another strong quarter of mortgage production accompanied by modest growth in credit card. 
However, consumer loans remain negatively impacted by exit portfolios and further pay downs in home equity. Overall, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted average loan balances to be down by low single digits compared to 2020. Although, we expect adjusted ending loans to grow by low single digits. 
With respect to loan guidance, we are not including any impacts from our InterBank acquisition, which closed on October 1 and resulted in the addition of $3.1 billion in loan balances that will benefit the fourth quarter and beyond. So let's turn to deposits. Although the pace of deposit growth has slowed, balances continued to increase this quarter to new record levels. The increase is primarily due to higher account balances. 
However, as John mentioned, we are also producing strong new account growth. We are continuing to analyze probable future deposit behavior. And based on analysis of pandemic-related deposit inflow characteristics, we currently believe approximately 30% or $10 billion to $12 billion of deposit increases can be used to support longer-term growth through the rate cycle. 
Additional portions of the deposit increases could persist on the balance sheet but are likely to be more rate sensitive. Let's shift to net interest income and margin. Pandemic-related items continue to impact net interest income and margin. Net interest income from PPP loans decreased $12 million from the prior quarter but is expected to pick up in the fourth quarter. 
Cash averaged $25 billion during the quarter. And when combined with PPP reduced third quarter reported margin by 54 basis points. Excluding excess cash and PPP, net interest income grew almost 1.5% linked quarter and our adjusted margin was essentially stable at 3.30%. This reflects strengthening loan growth as well as active balance sheet management efforts despite a near zero short-term rate environment. 
Similar to prior quarters, the impact on NII from historically low long-term interest rates was completely offset by balance sheet management strategies, lower deposit costs and higher hedging income. During the third quarter, we repositioned an additional $5 billion of received fixed swaps, which shortened the maturities from 2026 to late 2022. The repositioning locked in the associated gains that will be amortized over the remaining life of the interest rate swap. 
It will allow for more NII expansion when rates are projected to increase. Further, with the inclusion of InterBank's fixed rate loan portfolio, less hedges will be needed to protect NII and the net interest margin profile for falling rates. The cumulative value created from our hedging program is approximately $1.6 billion, roughly 75% of that amount has either been recognized or is locked into future earnings from hedge terminations, reflecting the dynamic management of our hedging strategy. Excluding InterBank and PPP, adjusted net interest income should be relatively stable in the fourth quarter after excluding the nonrecurring interest recovery in the third quarter. 
Including PPP and the InterBank acquisition, linked quarter net interest income is expected to grow between 5% and 6% in the fourth quarter. As illustrated on the slide, over a longer horizon, a strengthening economy, the ability to benefit from higher rates and organic and strategic balance sheet growth are expected to ultimately drive net interest income growth. 
Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income increased 8% from the prior quarter, primarily attributable to strong capital markets activity, including record loan syndication revenue and solid M&A advisory fees. We expect capital markets to remain strong in the fourth quarter, generating revenue in the $60 million to $70 million range, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. We'll provide more specificity regarding 2022 expectations in January. Other noninterest income also increased during the quarter due to an increase in the value of certain equity investments as well as increased gains associated with the sale of certain small dollar equipment loans and leases. 
Mortgage income decreased quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustments, partially offset by improved secondary market gains. Service charges remained relatively stable compared to the prior quarter and we continue to expect they will remain 10% to 15% below pre-pandemic levels. We attribute the decline to changes in customer behavior as well as customer benefits from enhancements to our overdraft practices, including transaction posting order. 
Card and ATM fees remained stable compared to the second quarter. Debit and credit card spend remain above pre-pandemic levels as we continue to benefit from elevated account growth and increased economic activity in our footprint. Given the timing of interest rate declines in 2020 and excluding the fourth quarter benefit from our InterBank acquisition, we expect 2021 adjusted total revenue to be up modestly compared to the prior year, but this will ultimately be dependent on the timing and amount of PPP loan forgiveness. 
Let's move on to noninterest expense. Adjusted noninterest expenses increased 3% in the quarter as higher salary and benefits and professional and legal fees were offset by a decline in marketing expenses. Salaries and benefits increased 4%, primarily due to higher variable base compensation associated with elevated fee income as well as 1 additional day in the third quarter. 
Associate head count also increased by 149 positions during the quarter, with the vast majority of those within revenue-producing businesses. Further, exceptional performance, particularly in credit, is also contributing to higher incentive compensation. We will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology, products and people to grow our business. 
Excluding approximately $35 million of core run rate expenses associated with our fourth quarter InterBank acquisition, we expect adjusted noninterest expenses to be up modestly compared to 2020, and we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time. 
From an asset quality standpoint, we delivered an exceptionally strong quarter as overall credit continues to perform better than expected, reflecting continued broad-based improvement across virtually all portfolios and continued recoveries associated with strong collateral asset values, annualized net charge-offs decreased 9 basis points during the quarter to 14 basis points, representing the company's lowest level on record post our 2006 merger of [ Equals ]. 
In addition to lower charge-offs, nonperforming loans and business services criticized loans also improved, while total delinquencies remained unchanged during the quarter. Our allowance for credit losses declined 20 basis points to 1.8% of total loans and 283% of total nonaccrual loans. Excluding PPP loans, our allowance for credit losses was 1.83%. The decline in the allowance reflects better-than-expected credit trends and the continued constructive outlook on the economy. 
The allowance reduction resulted in a $155 million benefit to the provision. Future levels of the allowance will depend on the timing of charge-offs, greater certainty with respect to the resolution of remaining risk to credit losses as well as the integration of InterBank. Year-to-date, net charge-offs are 25 basis points, and we expect full 2021 net charge-offs to approximate that same level, which includes the impact of InterBank and excludes the benefits of any future recoveries that may occur. 
With respect to capital, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 40 basis points to an estimated 10.8% this quarter. As previously noted, we continue to prioritize the utilization of our capital for organic growth, and nonbank acquisitions like InterBank and Sabal that propel future growth. Beyond that, we use share repurchases to manage our capital levels. Share repurchases were temporarily paused ahead of the InterBank closing, which absorbed approximately $1 billion of capital in the fourth quarter. 
We anticipate being back in the repurchase market this quarter and expect to manage common equity Tier 1 to the midpoint of our 9.25% to 9.75% operating range by year-end. So wrapping up on the next slide are our 2021 expectations, which we've already addressed. In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter results and are poised for growth as the economic recovery continues. 
Pretax preprovision income remained strong. Expenses are well controlled. Credit quality is outperforming expectations. Capital and liquidity are solid, and we are optimistic about the pace of the economic recovery in our markets. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

So essentially 2x what we were experiencing about a year ago. Commitments are up by over $2 billion, and that's largely the result of new relationships that we're adding resulting from disruption in markets that we're operating in, talent, we've been able to acquire. 
Growth is occurring in some of our specialized industry businesses, transportation, health care, financial services, technology and defense are all generating and finding new opportunities, and our pipelines are again, back at pre-pandemic levels and 2x essentially what they were about a year ago.

The other 70% is likely to either run off or come at a much higher cost. When you think about the 70% of surge deposits, that beta is going to be substantially higher than our core. We would peg that at closer to 75% on that component part. But just remember, when -- in the last rate cycle, we were one of the lowest deposit betas. And that's the value of our franchise, low-cost, low-volatile deposit side that we're looking to extract value out of as we get a more normal rate environment."

We're trying to gauge where we think rates are going to be. Obviously, in 2018, we anticipated the rates declining we put on our forward starting swaps to protect us in the down rate. 
As we get more confidence that the economy can reopen and that the Fed is likely to raise rates, we want to take some of that protection off, which we've done, and that's with the repositioning of the $5 billion did. Today, we have about $20 billion of notional protection, received fixed swaps. And in particular, we have some other some floors. But for the most part, they're in swap form. 
And that protection goes through '22, where we start gauging the fact that there's a little bit more probability of rates starting to rise towards the end of '22. And we want to participate in that rate environment. So our slide on Page 8 was trying to demonstrate how we hand off from the protection that we have in the low rate environment to let the rates carry us up as the swaps either terminate on their own or because we terminate them as we did with the $5 billion we locked in that gain, and we'll enjoy that benefit through the remainder of the swap period."

So it's -- there's a great opportunity for us to really leverage their technology. And we think we can grow that faster than they did. 
But right now, we're looking at at least having that kind of production of $1.7 billion on top of that. If you look at the yield on the portfolio today, you didn't ask this question, but I'm going to add to it, just so you understand -- everybody understands that the yield on that is right at, call it, 6% because of the -- we had to mark that $3.1 billion book to market, so we don't get the fee that's paid by the dealer, which is deferred and amortized as a yield adjustment over time.

And no, we aren't interested in being second to slowest growing as depicted on the page.

We've gone from second to last in terms of return on tangible common equity. We'll see where we finish, but it will be #4 or 5 this year. And so it's worked, and we've reduced our risk profile dramatically over time. So we've exited businesses. So an example would be our auto businesses. We've gotten out of loan-only relationships that didn't give us the full relationship value that we need and want and where we weren't being paid for the risk that we are taking in things like real estate. 
So we did -- we've had this massive shift, and we've worked through virtually all that. There's always areas to prune, but we're ready to leverage our markets. We're in fabulous markets that we think are going to grow faster than most every part of the country.

If you go back to 2014, when we began to emphasize the importance of capital markets and began to acquire and develop capabilities to serve our customers, it really was making a very, very modest, almost nominal contribution to the company. And that's obviously changed over the last 7 years as we've continued to make investments in the business. We've acquired talent, new capabilities. 
We've acquired businesses, and we'll continue to do that. I don't know that there's an upward limit on what the contribution can be. We're certainly very satisfied with the results we've achieved to date. 
We announced earlier this year that we've been approved for Freddie license to go with our Fannie DUS license, the acquisition of Sabal, which is a fee-based generating business brings with it additional HUD capabilities, small balance Fannie and Freddie capabilities to enhance our ability to generate placement revenue. We're looking at other opportunities within capital markets to make acquisitions. 
So we're going to continue to make investments there. We know that our customers have needs and we want to make sure that we have the capability to meet those needs. And I would expect that the Capital Markets contribution to noninterest revenue into the overall profitability of the company will continue to grow over time. I don't see a particular upward limit on that."

What we want to do is get back to what our business is, taking deposits, making loans, and we think we're in great shape and great markets to really leverage that liquidity into loan growth. That's where the driver of improvement in margin will be. We stabilized our margin for the most part, ex PPP and cash at 330. And we think that over time, obviously, we can grow that and get back to a much higher margin over time. 
An example of that is we're going to spend -- we have $3 billion of InterBank loans that we're booking in the first quarter. As I mentioned, that has a carry of about 6% on them. And our new production, the consumer guys will add on in a year of $1.7 billion plus, we'll have closer to 9%.

With respect to bank M&A, I think we've been consistent in saying that bank M&A is not a strategic priority. We think that bank M&A can be very disruptive. We have a solid plan. We want to continue to focus on executing our plan. The economics of bank M&A have not looked terribly favorable in the past, given where our stock traded, we continue to experience improvement. So that changes the economics. We revisit the idea with our Board every year as part of our strategic planning process and just come to the conclusion that we're -- we think we can generate top quartile returns for our shareholders by being focused on executing our plan, active in the nonbank M&A space. And so whole bank M&A has just not been a priority for us. 
And John, this is David. I'll add to the nonbank deal. So as I mentioned, the prioritization to really focus our capital allocation on growing our bank. The Corporate Development group works with each of our segment leaders to identify capabilities that they would like to have, companies that they have products and services that we'd love to have to serve our customers. It's interesting after you do a couple of deals that we've had, you get into the deal flow a little bit more than you would before. And so we get more opportunities.

We are seeing a bit of inflation that will impact us some and our industry, we suspect, in 2022, we've got to find ways to overcome it. And so we'll give you exactly what that commitment is in January. But the bottom line is we're growing our business. We're going to grow revenue. We're going to work on controlling our expenses and improving returns over time."

And so that's why we get so fixated on making sure the investments we make in the faster-growing markets really help us grow customers, and it's paying off. So you see it in the card and ATM fees. We've added wealth advisers to help us grow wealth management income. 
You can see we're up almost 12% year-over-year. And now far that's driven by the market. Markets had a nice run, too. And then mortgage income. Mortgage has been a little volatile. We've had nice production this year in this past quarter. But '22 is probably not going to be as strong as it was in '21 and '20. Now we said that for '21 relative to '20 and we've had a really nice year. So who knows? 
But just proud of the fact that we've got a lot of different noninterest revenue sources that work in multiple different economies and rate environments. And our goal is, again, to continue to grow our total revenue, control expenses and control credit and we have nice returns to the shareholders."

We appreciate you joining our call today. We're very pleased with our performance this quarter as we achieved earnings of $624 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.65. Adjusted pre-tax pre-provision i",529,"Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. We're very pleased with our performance this quarter as we achieved earnings of $624 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.65. Adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income increased 4% sequentially, and generated year-to-date positive operating leverage.  
Our ability to keep the momentum going and deliver solid third quarter results comes from 3 primary factors. First, we continue to benefit from our growing footprint. Unemployment levels are improving, and in most of our markets are well below the national level. People and businesses are continuing to move into our 15-state footprint, and that bodes well for our growth prospects for the remainder of the year and into 2022. We'll continue to make strategic investments in core and growth markets where we can grow new customers and deepen existing relationships.  
On that note, we're also pleased to share that year-to-date net account growth has exceeded account growth for the preceding 3 years combined. Second, credit quality has demonstrated incredible resiliency and continues to exceed our expectations. Businesses across all industries have found ways to adapt and prosper despite ongoing supply chain and labor issues and consumers continue to cautiously manage their finances.  
Overall, we feel very good about the health of our business and consumer customers. Third, we continue to take advantage of opportunities to invest in talent, technology and capabilities to support growth. For instance, earlier this month, we closed on our acquisition of EnerBank, a leading home improvement point-of-sale lender, a key part of our strategy to serve as a premier lender to home owners. We also entered into an agreement to acquire Sabal Capital Partners. Sabal has a strong reputation in a proprietary technology platform that will expand our real estate capital markets capabilities.  
Once the transition is complete, we expect to be a top 5 bank agency producer. The EnerBank and Sabal acquisitions complement our existing portfolio of products and capabilities in the consumer and corporate bank. We will continue to evaluate prudent non-bank M&A opportunities that will allow us to expand our products and services and enhance our relevancy with our customers.  
Also, we recently launched our Bank On-certified Now Checking account. This new product has all the benefits of a traditional checking account without the concern of overdraft fees. And finally, our investments in digital and data are positioning us for growth. Through a technology-enabled seamless experience in branches and across all platforms, customers are responding to the personalized service, advice and guidance they received from Regions. Today, more than 2/3 of our customer transactions are digital. Further, over the last 2 years, active mobile banking users are up 23%. And notably, Zelle transactions have more than tripled.  
We feel really good about our progress and momentum. We operate in some of the best markets in the country, have a solid strategic plan, an outstanding team and the experience to compete effectively. We focus every day on delivering products and services that are valued by our customers while continuing to support our communities and provide an appropriate return to our shareholders.  
Now David will provide you with some details regarding the quarter."
271409,674329894,2410040,"Regions Financial Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2021",2021-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Adjusted average and ending loans increased approximately 1% during the quarter. Although business loans continue to be impacted by low utilization rates and excess liquidity, pipelines have surpassed p",1410,"Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Adjusted average and ending loans increased approximately 1% during the quarter. Although business loans continue to be impacted by low utilization rates and excess liquidity, pipelines have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. In addition, production remains strong with line of credit commitments increasing $2 billion year-to-date. Consumer loans reflected another strong quarter of mortgage production accompanied by modest growth in credit card.  
However, consumer loans remain negatively impacted by exit portfolios and further pay downs in home equity. Overall, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted average loan balances to be down by low-single-digits compared to 2020. Although, we expect adjusted ending loans to grow by low-single-digits.  
With respect to loan guidance, we are not including any impacts from our EnerBank acquisition, which closed on October 1 and resulted in the addition of $3.1 billion in loan balances that will benefit the fourth quarter and beyond. So let's turn to deposits. Although the pace of deposit growth has slowed, balances continued to increase this quarter to new record levels. The increase is primarily due to higher account balances.  
However, as John mentioned, we are also producing strong new account growth. We are continuing to analyze probable future deposit behavior. And based on analysis of pandemic-related deposit inflow characteristics, we currently believe approximately 30% or $10 billion to $12 billion of deposit increases can be used to support longer-term growth through the rate cycle.  
Additional portions of the deposit increases could persist on the balance sheet but are likely to be more rate sensitive. Let's shift to net interest income and margin. Pandemic-related items continue to impact net interest income and margin. Net interest income from PPP loans decreased $12 million from the prior quarter but is expected to pick up in the fourth quarter.  
Cash averaged $25 billion during the quarter. And when combined with PPP reduced third quarter reported margin by 54 basis points. Excluding excess cash and PPP, net interest income grew almost 1.5% linked quarter and our adjusted margin was essentially stable at 3.30%. This reflects strengthening loan growth as well as active balance sheet management efforts despite a near zero short-term rate environment. 
Similar to prior quarters, the impact on NII from historically low long-term interest rates was completely offset by balance sheet management strategies, lower deposit costs and higher hedging income. During the third quarter, we repositioned an additional $5 billion of received fixed swaps, which shortened the maturities from 2026 to late 2022. The repositioning locked in the associated gains that will be amortized over the remaining life of the interest rate swaps. 
It will allow for more NII expansion when rates are projected to increase. Further, with the inclusion of EnerBank's fixed rate loan portfolio, less hedges will be needed to protect NII and the net interest margin profile for falling rates. The cumulative value created from our hedging program is approximately $1.6 billion, roughly 75% of that amount has either been recognized or is locked into future earnings from hedge terminations, reflecting the dynamic management of our hedging strategy. Excluding EnerBank and PPP, adjusted net interest income should be relatively stable in the fourth quarter after excluding the nonrecurring interest recovery in the third quarter. 
Including PPP and the EnerBank acquisition, linked quarter net interest income is expected to grow between 5% and 6% in the fourth quarter. As illustrated on the slide, over a longer horizon, a strengthening economy, the ability to benefit from higher rates and organic and strategic balance sheet growth are expected to ultimately drive net interest income growth. 
Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income increased 8% from the prior quarter, primarily attributable to strong capital markets activity, including record loan syndication revenue and solid M&A advisory fees. We expect capital markets to remain strong in the fourth quarter, generating revenue in the $60 million to $70 million range, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. We'll provide more specificity regarding 2022 expectations in January. Other non-interest income also increased during the quarter due to an increase in the value of certain equity investments as well as increased gains associated with the sale of certain small dollar equipment loans and leases. 
Mortgage income decreased quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustments, partially offset by improved secondary market gains. Service charges remained relatively stable compared to the prior quarter and we continue to expect they will remain 10% to 15% below pre-pandemic levels. We attribute the decline to changes in customer behavior as well as customer benefits from enhancements to our overdraft practices, including transaction posting order. 
Card and ATM fees remained stable compared to the second quarter. Debit and credit card spend remain above pre-pandemic levels as we continue to benefit from elevated account growth and increased economic activity in our footprint. Given the timing of interest rate declines in 2020 and excluding the fourth quarter benefit from our EnerBank acquisition, we expect 2021 adjusted total revenue to be up modestly compared to the prior year, but this will ultimately be dependent on the timing and amount of PPP loan forgiveness. 
Let's move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expenses increased 3% in the quarter as higher salary and benefits and professional and legal fees were offset by a decline in marketing expenses. Salaries and benefits increased 4%, primarily due to higher variable-based compensation associated with elevated fee income as well as 1 additional day in the third quarter. 
Associate head count also increased by 149 positions during the quarter, with the vast majority of those within revenue producing businesses. Further, exceptional performance, particularly in credit, is also contributing to higher incentive compensation. We will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology, products and people to grow our business. 
Excluding approximately $35 million of core run rate expenses associated with our fourth quarter EnerBank acquisition, we expect adjusted non-interest expenses to be up modestly compared to 2020, and we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time. 
From an asset quality standpoint, we delivered an exceptionally strong quarter as overall credit continues to perform better than expected, reflecting continued broad-based improvement across virtually all portfolios and continued recoveries associated with strong collateral asset values, annualized net charge-offs decreased 9 basis points during the quarter to 14 basis points, representing the company's lowest level on record post our 2006 merger of [ Equals ]. 
In addition to lower charge-offs, nonperforming loans and business services criticized loans also improved, while total delinquencies remained unchanged during the quarter. Our allowance for credit losses declined 20 basis points to 1.8% of total loans and 283% of total nonaccrual loans. Excluding PPP loans, our allowance for credit losses was 1.83%. The decline in the allowance reflects better-than-expected credit trends and the continued constructive outlook on the economy. 
The allowance reduction resulted in a $155 million benefit to the provision. Future levels of the allowance will depend on the timing of charge-offs, greater certainty with respect to the resolution of remaining risk to credit losses as well as the integration of EnerBank. Year-to-date, net charge-offs are 25 basis points, and we expect full 2021 net charge-offs to approximate that same level, which includes the impact of EnerBank and excludes the benefits of any future recoveries that may occur. 
With respect to capital, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 40 basis points to an estimated 10.8% this quarter. As previously noted, we continue to prioritize the utilization of our capital for organic growth, and non-bank acquisitions like EnerBank and Sabal that propel future growth. Beyond that, we use share repurchases to manage our capital levels. Share repurchases were temporarily paused ahead of the EnerBank closing, which absorbed approximately $1 billion of capital in the fourth quarter. 
We anticipate being back in the repurchase market this quarter and expect to manage common equity Tier 1 to the mid-point of our 9.25% to 9.75% operating range by year-end. So wrapping up on the next slide are our 2021 expectations, which we've already addressed. In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter results and are poised for growth as the economic recovery continues. 
Pre-tax pre-provision income remained strong. Expenses are well controlled. Credit quality is outperforming expectations. Capital and liquidity are solid, and we are optimistic about the pace of the economic recovery in our markets. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

And right now, what we're trying to gauge is the surge deposits that we had some $35 billion to $36 billion of surge deposits where we said 30% of those, we think, can be put to work. 
The other 70% is likely to either run off or come at a much higher cost. When you think about the 70% of surge deposits, that beta is going to be substantially higher than our core. We would peg that at closer to 75% on that component part. But just remember, when -- in the last rate cycle, we were one of the lowest deposit betas. And that's the value of our franchise, low-cost, low-volatile deposit side that we're looking to extract value out of as we get a more normal rate environment."

We're trying to gauge where we think rates are going to be. Obviously, in 2018, we anticipated the rates declining we put on our forward starting swaps to protect us in the down rate. 
As we get more confidence that the economy can reopen and that the Fed is likely to raise rates, we want to take some of that protection off, which we've done, and that's with the repositioning of the $5 billion did. Today, we have about $20 billion of notional protection, received fixed swaps. And in particular, we have some other some floors. But for the most part, they're in swap form. 
And that protection goes through '22, where we start gauging the fact that there's a little bit more probability of rates starting to rise towards the end of '22. And we want to participate in that rate environment. So our slide on Page 8 was trying to demonstrate how we hand off from the protection that we have in the low rate environment to let the rates carry us up as the swaps either terminate on their own or because we terminate them as we did with the $5 billion we locked in that gain, and we'll enjoy that benefit through the remainder of the swap period."

If you look at the yield on the portfolio today, you didn't ask this question, but I'm going to add to it, just so you understand -- everybody understands that the yield on that is right at, call it, 6% because of the -- we had to mark that $3.1 billion book-to-market, so we don't get the fee that's paid by the dealer, which is deferred and amortized as a yield adjustment over time. 
Our new production on the other hand, will get that. And so you're looking at going from a 6% to 9%, 9.5% yield on the new production. If we start growing that just a little bit faster than they have, we're going to -- this is going to be a nice growth engine for us, and that's what we try to depict a bit on Slide 8."

And no, we aren't interested in being second to slowest growing as depicted on the page. What we're trying to demonstrate is we had a shift strategically several years ago to focus on improving our risk-adjusted return on capital because we think that's what shareholders wanted. 
We've gone from second to last in terms of return on tangible common equity. We'll see where we finish, but it will be 4 -- #4 or 5 this year. And so it's worked, and we've reduced our risk profile dramatically over time. So we've exited businesses. So an example would be our auto businesses. We've gotten out of loan-only relationships that didn't give us the full relationship value that we need and want and where we weren't being paid for the risk that we are taking in things like real estate. 
So we did -- we've had this massive shift, and we've worked through virtually all of that. There's always areas to prune, but we're ready to leverage our markets. We're in fabulous markets that we think are going to grow faster than most every part of the country. And so as we -- the economy continues to reopen, we have the liquidity and the capital to put to work, and we'd much rather do that to buy our stock back. And so I think we're looking at to improve our loan growth quite substantially relative to what you see on Page 21."

If you go back to 2014, when we began to emphasize the importance of capital markets and began to acquire and develop capabilities to serve our customers, it really was making a very, very modest, almost nominal contribution to the company. And that's obviously changed over the last 7 years as we've continued to make investments in the business. We've acquired talent, new capabilities. 
We've acquired businesses, and we'll continue to do that. I don't know that there's an upward limit on what the contribution can be. We're certainly very satisfied with the results we've achieved to date. 
We announced earlier this year that we've been approved for Freddie license to go with our Fannie DUS license, the acquisition of Sabal, which is a fee-based generating business brings with it additional HUD capabilities, small balance Fannie and Freddie capabilities to enhance our ability to generate placement revenue. We're looking at other opportunities within capital markets to make acquisitions. 
So we're going to continue to make investments there. We know that our customers have needs and we want to make sure that we have the capability to meet those needs.

What we want to do is get back to what our business is, taking deposits, making loans, and we think we're in great shape and great markets to really leverage that liquidity into loan growth. That's where the driver of improvement in margin will be. We stabilized our margin for the most part, ex PPP and cash at 3.30%. And we think that over time, obviously, we can grow that and get back to a much higher margin over time. 
An example of that is we're going to spend -- we have $3 billion of EnerBank loans that we're booking in the first quarter. As I mentioned, that has a carry of about 6% on them. And our new production, the consumer guys will add on in a year of $1.7 billion plus, we'll have closer to 9%.

We're going to be prudent about that capital allocation there and make sure things are really accretive for our shareholders as we seek to grow our business and ultimately, our risk-adjusted returns."

Some of them have quite nicely efficiency ratios. -- others are not so hot. We don't really think of it that way. We think of it as much as the capability we need to have that leverages all the other things that we're doing in our business services segment. So we really look at that together. Fee-based businesses generally aren't as efficient, but that's okay. And I think as long as they're complementary, and we're making sure we're as efficient in delivering those products and services, then we'll be okay. 
And if you look at our efficiency ratio over time, this quarter, we're the second best in terms of efficiency ratio at 56.6% and looking to improve that over time, even though we're adding some of these other businesses that are less efficient."

We're going to give you good numbers on that in January in terms of what the next few years are kind of as you wrap up the expense tied to all this revenue change. We've steadily been committed to positive operating leverage. And we've done a really good job of controlling our expense base. We've been around 1% compound annual growth rate on expenses over the last 4 or 5 years. 
We are seeing a bit of inflation that will impact us some and our industry, we suspect, in 2022, we've got to find ways to overcome it. And so we'll give you exactly what that commitment is in January. But the bottom line is we're growing our business. We're going to grow revenue. We're going to work on controlling our expenses and improving returns over time."

You have more -- when you grow checking accounts, this is what you get. You get usage in particular debit card usage for us. 
And so that's why we get so fixated on making sure the investments we make in the faster-growing markets really help us grow customers, and it's paying off. So you see it in the card and ATM fees. We've added wealth advisers to help us grow wealth management income. 
You can see we're up almost 12% year-over-year. And now far that's driven by the market. Markets had a nice run, too. And then mortgage income. Mortgage has been a little volatile. We've had nice production this year in this past quarter. But '22 is probably not going to be as strong as it was in '21 and '20. Now we said that for '21 relative to '20 and we've had a really nice year. So who knows? 
But just proud of the fact that we've got a lot of different non-interest revenue sources that work in multiple different economies and rate environments. And our goal is, again, to continue to grow our total revenue, control expenses and control credit and we have nice returns to the shareholders."

My whole point on that was we're just not going to take risk to use a quarter or 6 months. We really want to invest for the long haul, and we just don't see putting our cash to work more than we have. Now we get a different rate environment, we get a little steepness to the yield curve where we get paid for the risk, and we might change our mind."
