Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights from the fourth quarter and full year, then briefly discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, Clear Aligners and Systems and Services. 
John will provide more detail on our financial results and share additional color on business trends. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. 
Our fourth quarter was a strong finish to the year with record revenues and volumes from both Invisalign aligners and iTero scanners as well as increased gross margins, operating margins, EPS and cash flow. Our fourth quarter performance was driven by strong year-over-year growth across customer channels and regions and continued momentum sequentially. 
During the quarter, we achieved a major milestone in EMEA with a shipment to our 2 millionth Invisalign patients that will be amplified with the EMEA y campaign that we'll launch next month. This milestone for EMEA reflects strong acceleration in Invisalign adoption and growth. 
For Q4, total revenues were $834.5 million, up 13.7% sequentially and up 28.4% year-over-year. Q4 '20 Clear Aligner revenues of $700.7 million were up 12.9% sequentially and increased 28.9% year-over-year. 
In Q4, we shipped a record 568,000 Invisalign cases, an increase of 14.5% sequentially and 37.3% year-over-year. Q4 reflects increased Invisalign adoption from both adults and teenagers, which are up 36.7% and 38.7% year-over-year, respectively. 
Our teen and mom-focused consumer campaign generated 77% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our website and 76% increase in lead generation. 
In addition, Invisalign social media influencers like Charlie D'Amelio, Marsai Martin, Cristina, Milana, Tisha Camel Martin, Rachel Zou, Tiffany Ma and tas Mauri continue to deliver exciting new content and increased engagement for the Invisalign brand with consumers and among their millions of followers. 
Our digital platform continues to gain traction as doctors uses of iTero scanners increase. Our consumer and patient app was rolled out to more than 50 markets, resulting in more than a 2.5x increase in apps download and monthly active users in 2020 versus a year ago. 
Our patient feature uses continues to increase. For example, Invisalign virtual appointment was used 68,000 times. Our insurance verification feature was used 26,000 times and more than 30,000 patients enrolled in Invisalign virtual care in 2020. Our new consumer website was rolled out to more than 40 markets around the world and is driving increased effectiveness and lead generation. We also launched an improved new doctor recruitment website in the U.S. and Canada to support our digital conversion journey. 
This will be expanded to other markets in the next few months. From a product perspective, growth was strong across the Invisalign portfolio, especially for noncomprehensive cases, including Invisalign Go and Invisalign Modern. 
There are also more doctors engaging with us through the aligned digital and practice transformation or ADAPT program as more practices are moving towards digital practice optimization. As you'll recall, ADAPT was piloted over 2 years ago and is being commercialized as a stand-alone service, providing the relevant workforce, clinical and marketing support to enable doctors to digitally transform their practices. 
In Q4, we shipped a record 77,000 Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which a record 7,300 were first time customers. We also trained over 6,400 new docs in Q4, including over 3,900 international doctors. 
Q4 '20 System and Services revenues of $133.8 million were up 18% sequentially, driven by momentum in the Americas and EMEA, and up 26% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific. 
Our results reflect continued strong uptake of the iTero Element 5d, the only inter oral scanner with Carrie's detection, which is scaling rapidly across each region and represented approximately 1/3 of iTero volumes in Q4. 
Innovation remains a cornerstone of our business. Today, we announced the availability of the iTero Element Plus series, which expands our portfolio of iTero Element scanners and imaging systems to include new solutions that serve a broader range of the dental marketplace. 
The new ITero Element plus series of scanners and imaging systems builds on the success of the award-winning iTero Element family and offers in all the existing orthodontic and restorative digital capabilities, doctors have come to rely on, plus faster processing time and advanced visualization capabilities for a seamless scanning experience in a new sleek ergonomically designed package. 
We announced the launch of our next-gen ClinCheck Pro 6.0 proprietary treatment planning software with In-Face visualization, and our Invisalign G8 improved predictability in our last earnings call, we announced. 
Their availability is being expanded across all regions. Further, we launched several enhancements to our treatment planning including improved final teeth position and auto segmentation. We also added several new features to our virtual care tool. For the full year 2020, total net revenues were a record $2.5 billion, up 2.7% year-over-year. Clear Aligner revenues of $2.1 billion were up 3.7%, reflecting a record 1.6 million Invisalign shipments and growth of 7.9%. 
During the year, 30.3% of total Invisalign cases or nearly [ 1.5 ] million teens or younger started Invisalign treatment. This is up 11.5% from 2019. 
system and Services revenues were down slightly compared to 2019. 
2020 was a year unlike any other we've experienced. The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact have been life changing. Marked by loss in separation, recovery and renewal, record highs and lows and significant milestones and accomplishments. Even at a time of huge disruption, we all had to adapt, evaluate priorities and develop new ways of doing things, both personally and professionally. 
Through it all, Align's priority has been the health and well-being of our employees and their families and our doctor customers and their staff, and that remains a constant. 
Despite the swift onset of the pandemic and the uncertainty through 2020, we didn't hold our plans or change our strategy for continued growth. We completed the acquisition of exocad, accelerated our investments in marketing to create Invisalign brand awareness and drive consumer demand for our doctors' offices, accelerated new technology to market with virtual tools that enable our doctors to stay connected with their patients, provided PPE to those in need and supported doctors and their teams with online education and digital forms that went beyond products to help them navigate the uncertainty of the pandemic. 
As a result of our continued strategic focus and investments, we exited the year stronger than we started and 2021 is off to a great start. 
Now let's turn to the specifics around our fourth quarter, starting with the Americas. For the Americas region, Q4 Invisalign case volume was up 12.7% sequentially and up 34.1% year-over-year, reflecting increased utilization of Invisalign treatment for both orthodontic and GP channels. Our continued investments in digital marketing and sales programs and focus on market segmentation are helping drive strong growth of Invisalign clear aligners and iTero products. 
During the quarter, we continued offering sales initiatives to our doctor partners to help drive adoption of Invisalign and iTero products. The bracket buyback Swithc program, which we launched in North America in Q2 '20, continues to drive conversions from wires and brackets to Invisalign clear aligners. 
During Q4, and this program resulting -- has resulted in about 10,000 new cases, similar to Q3. We believe it's also causing a halo effect with patients switching from wires and brackets to Invisalign clear aligners with increased awareness of the benefits of Invisalign treatment and how it is less disruptive to their lives with the outcome of a beautiful smile through an Invisalign trained doctor. The teen awesomeness centers programs, direct patients to Invisalign doctors who are experts at treating teens, and are seen as the go-to docs for treatment. We continue to see growth with Invisalign first for treatment in younger kids, driving increased comprehensive treatments within North America ortho channel. 
Latin American volume was also up year-over-year, led by strong growth in Brazil and Mexico. We believe the market for orthodontic treatment is huge in Latin America as we continue to grow our presence across the region. We saw increased utilization in the GP channel with Invisalign Go and the continued adoption of moderate. The GP Accelerator program designed exclusively for general practitioner dentists provides an all-encompassing support plan based on practice needs that is centered around maximizing iTero integration, clinical support needs and implementing new marketing strategies. 
We also see increased utilization with GP dentists that have enrolled in the iPro program as well as with doctors that have installed the iTero scanner. 
DSO utilization also increased and continues to be a strong growth driver, led by Heartland and Smile docs. 
For the full year, American Invisalign volume was up 3.6%. For international business, Q4 Invisalign case volume was up sequentially 6.7%, led by strong growth in EMEA as doctors returned from summer holiday season, offset somewhat by seasonally slower period in China. 
On a year-over-year basis, international shipments were up 41.1%, reflecting increases throughout both EMEA and APAC. For the full year, International Invisalign volume was up 13.3%. 
For EMEA, Q4 volumes were up sequentially 47.9% and 48.3% on a year-over-year basis across all markets with strong performance across both ortho and GP channels. 
Within the GP channel specifically, we saw acceleration in both utilization and shipments with Invisalign Go. We also saw acceleration in both core and expansion markets with growth in our core markets led by Iberia, U.K. and France, along with continued growth in our expansion markets led by Central and Eastern Europe and the Benelux. 
We introduced the Ortho Recovery 360 program in EMEA last quarter to support our orthodontist as they started reopening their businesses. 
As of Q4, 3,200 orthodontists have enrolled in the program. During the quarter, we launched a Recovery 2 program with a refreshed website featuring all digital tools, growth programs and education events for EMEA doctors to support their relief efforts during COVID-19. 
We also held our digital innovation form at the beginning of December, where approximately 900 doctors, both ortho and GP, attended the 2-day form event with keynotes on the digitization of dental practices. We also continued our digital excellence series of webinars launched by the iTero team. 
Throughout the quarter, the following digital innovations were also launched across EMEA, Invisalign G8, ClinCheck Pro 6.0 and Invisalign Go Plus to help drive Invisalign clear aligner utilization. 
To support our GP doctors, we launched our GP Recovery 360 program last quarter with over 2,700 GPs enrolled so far. We continue to offer online and on-demand education events, which reached over 15,000 GPs cumulatively. 
For the full year, EMEA Invisalign volume was up 12.6%. 
For APAC, Q4 volumes were down sequentially, 14.7%, notwithstanding typical Q4 seasonality in China, following a strong Q3. We had strong growth in Japan and ANZ and Southeast Asia. 
On a year-over-year basis, APAC was up 30% compared to the prior year, reflecting continued strong growth across the region. We were pleased to see the growth in the adult segment with noncomprehensive cases with the Invisalign moderate product in the GP channel. 
In the team segment, we also saw an increase in utilization amongst Invisalign doctors, and we saw continued acceleration from Japan and ANZ. For the full year, APAC Invisalign volume was up 14.3%. 
Last year, we launched a new and improved digital learning environment for our doctors offering a comprehensive learning platform with role specific content for orthos, GPS and their teams. The improved functionality enables more online learning opportunities with spotlight features for what's trending now, recommended learning path based on doctors' experiences and expanded categories including digital treatment planning, comprehensive dentistry and team education. 
For the year, over 127,000 doctors have accessed or recorded lectures, completed self paced learning modules and watch how to videos with new certified doctors doing more than 1.4 million pages of content. Among the ortho channel, over 47,000 unique users have engaged with the digital learning site with an additional 80,000 unique users from the GP channel. 
As we've mentioned, we are seeing good adoption of the ADAPT program, which is an expert and independent fee-based business consulting service offered by Align to optimize clinic's operational workflow and processes to enhance the patient's experience and customer and staff satisfaction, which will, in turn, translate into higher growth and greater efficiencies for orthodontic practices. 
As a result, the ADAPT service -- participating process in Q4 improved profitability significantly after implementation. 
Our consumer marketing is focused on capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform [ 500 million spouse, ] educating consumers about the Invisalign system and driving that demand to our Invisalign doctor offices. 
In Q4, we saw strong digital engagement globally with more than a 77% increase in unique visitors, a 108% increase in doc locator searches and 76% increase in leads created, driven by our global adult and mom focused campaigns and teen focused influencer content. 
Our U.S. Mom Teen Multitouch multimillion-dollar campaign with influencer led YouTube videos, a mom focused TV spot, a custom Twitch activation and mega teen sensation, Charli D'Amelio continued to perform very well and garnered 2.7 billion impressions in Q4. 
The statistics I shared previously speak to the successful reach of this marketing campaign is having to not only drive demand with consumers but also in educating them on the benefits of Invisalign treatment through a doctor's office. 
In Q4, we also launched media test in the EMEA region, in the U.K., Germany and France, and in the APAC region in Australia and Japan. These have worked very well and resulted in more than a 6x increase in leads in EMEA and a 3x increase in leads in APAC. Several key metrics that show increased activity and engagement with the Invisalign brand are included in our Q4 quarterly presentation slides available on our website. 
Align is always looking for new opportunities to reach consumers and be relevant to potential patients wherever they work, live and play, which is why we announced the Invisalign brand is the official Clear Aligner sponsor of the National Football League, the NFL, and 11 NFL teams, including the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Kansas City Cheese. 
The NFL league partnership designed to expand our reach with consumers generated over 150 million impressions in 2020, helping to drive awareness of Invisalign clear aligner treatment at a national level, while the team agreements are designed to help us engage within key markets and connect consumers with doctors in those markets. 
For our Systems and Services business, Q4 revenues were up 18% sequentially due to higher shipments and services revenue. We continue to see momentum with the iTero Element 5D imaging system, gaining traction in all regions with significant Element Flex sales in EMEA. 
On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenues were up 26% due to higher shipments and services. For the year, our System and Services total revenues were down 2.8% year-over-year, cumulatively over 3.1 -- 31.4 million orthodontic scans and 6.7 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. 
For Q4, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas increased to 84% from 79.5% in Q4 of last year. International scans increased to 73.7%, up 64.7% in the same quarter last year. 
We're pleased to see that within the Americas, 94.8% of cases submitted by North American orthodontists were submitted digitally. We're also proud to share that iTero Element inter oral scanners are the winners of the 2020 Dentaltown Towne Choice award for digital impressioning category. 
Also during the quarter, the National Association of Dental Laboratories judging panel selected the iTero Element 5D as the winner of the 2020 Journal of Dental Technology [indiscernible] award. 
The award represents a recognition of our commitment to enhancing patient engagement and communications that support efficient laboratory production. 
For exocad, during the quarter, we launched 2 of the largest software releases in history, Dental CAD and exoplant. Dental CAD 3.0 Galway includes over 90 new features and over 80 enhanced functionalities with significant improvements to reduce design time, such as instant anatomic morphine. 
Exoplanets 3.0 Galway includes over 40 new features and over 60 enhanced functionalities that support planning of [indiscernible] cases, including the design of surgical guides. 
During the quarter, exocad also added 2 new large implant manufacturers as OEMs for exoplan in Brazil. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to John."

Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $834.5 million, up 13.7% from the prior quarter and up 28.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. 
For Clear Aligners, Q4 revenues of [ $700.7 ] million were up 12.9% sequentially and up 28.9% year-over-year, reflecting Invisalign volume growth in all regions, partially offset by lower ASPs. 
Clear Aligner revenues growth was favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $5 million or approximately 0.8 points sequentially, and on a year-over-year basis by approximately $10.3 million or approximately 1.9 points. 
Q4 Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially $15, primarily due to increased revenue deferrals related to a higher mix of new cases versus additional aligners, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange and lower promotional discounts. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we did not implement a price increase in 2020, given our continued commitment to helping our customers in their recovery efforts during the pandemic. 
On a year-over-year basis, Q4 Invisalign ASPs decreased approximately $75, primarily due to our decision not to raise prices last summer, increased revenue deferrals for new cases versus additional aligners and higher promotional discounts, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. 
As a result, clear aligner deferred revenue on the balance sheet increased $83 million sequentially and $195 million year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. 
Total Q4 clear aligner shipments of 568,000 cases were up 14.5% sequentially and up 37.3% year-over-year. Our System and Services revenues for the fourth quarter was $133.8 million, up 18% sequentially due to an increase in scanner sales and increased services revenues from our larger installed base and higher ASPs. 
Year-over-year, Systems and Services revenue was up 26% due to higher scanner sales, services revenue and the inclusion of exocad CAD/CAM services, partially offset by lower scanner ASPs. Imaging systems and CAD/CAM services deferred revenue was up 30% sequentially and up 69% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues, which we recognize ratably over the service period. 
Moving on to gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 73.2%, up 0.4 points sequentially and up 0.5 points year-over-year. 
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangibles related to exocad, overall gross margin was 73.6% for the fourth quarter, up 0.3 points sequentially and up 0.7 points year-over-year. 
Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 74.9%, up 0.1 points sequentially due to lower additional aligner volume, partially offset by higher warranty, other manufacturing costs and lower ASPs. 
Clear Aligner gross margin was up 0.7 points year-over-year, primarily due to favorable product mix from increased iTero scanner absorption as a result of increased manufacturing volumes, partially offset by lower ASPs, higher warranty costs and other manufacturing costs. 
Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.2%, up 2.2 points sequentially, primarily due to higher ASPs and increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes. Systems and Services gross margin was down 0.7 points year-over-year due to lower ASPs, higher freight and other manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher services revenue. 
Q4 operating expenses were $397.3 million, up sequentially 11.3% and up 23.8% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating expenses is due to increased marketing and media spend and spending commensurate with business growth. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $76.5 million, reflecting our continued investment in sales and marketing, R&D activities and manufacturing operations. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $372.3 million, up sequentially 12.1% and up 23.4% year-over-year due to the reasons as described earlier. 
Our fourth quarter operating income of $213.2 million resulted in an operating margin of 25.5%, up 1.4 points sequentially and up 2.3 points year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year increases in operating income and the operating margin are primarily attributed to higher gross margin and operating leverage. 
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to exocad and acquisition-related costs, operating margin for the fourth quarter was 28.9%, up 0.9 points sequentially and up 2.5 points year-over-year. 
Interest and other income expense net for the fourth quarter was a benefit of $1.4 million, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange. 
With regards to the fourth quarter tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was 25.9%, which includes tax benefits of approximately $11 million related to adjustments in prior year's unrecognized tax positions. The fourth quarter tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 14.5% compared to 16.6% in prior quarter and 20.9% in the same quarter a year ago. 
The fourth quarter non-GAAP tax rate was lower than the third quarter's rate, primarily due to the reasons previously stated. Fourth quarter net income per diluted share was $2, up $0.24 sequentially and up $0.47 compared to the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.61 for the fourth quarter, up $0.37 sequentially and up $0.85 year-over-year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $960.8 million, an increase of approximately $345.3 million from the prior quarter, which is primarily due to higher cash flow from operations. 
Of our $960.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $548.3 million was held in the U.S. and $412.5 million was held by our international entities. 
Q4 accounts receivable balance was $657.7 million, up approximately 5% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 71 days, down approximately 6 days sequentially and down approximately 5 days as compared to Q4 last year due to strong cash collections. 
Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $381.4 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $53.2 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $328.3 million. 
Under our May 2018 repurchase program, we have $100 million still available for repurchase of our common stock. 
Before we move to the outlook, I would like to make a few comments on the full year 2020 results. In 2020, we shipped a record [ 1.6 million ] Invisalign cases, up 7.9% year-over-year. This reflects 13.3% volume growth from our international doctors and 3.6% volume growth from our Americans doctors. Systems and Services volumes were down 12% compared to 2019, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on equipment sales. 
Total revenue was a record $2.5 billion, up 2.7% year-over-year, with Clear Aligner revenues, a record $2.1 billion, up 3.7% year-over-year. 
2020 Systems and Services revenue were $370.5 million, including exocad revenues from April 1, 2020 forward, compared to $381 million in 2019. 
Full year 2020 operating income of $387.2 million, down 28.6% versus 2019, and operating margin at 15.7% versus 22.5% in 2019. 
2019 operating income included a litigation benefit of $51 million and Invisalign store closures of $23 million for net benefit on operating margin of 1.1%. 
With regards to full year tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was negative 368.6%, which includes a onetime tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion net of current year amortization associated with the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to intra-entity sale of certain intellectual property rights resulting from our corporate structure reorganization completed in the first quarter of 2020. 
Excluding the tax benefit related to our corporate structure reorganization and the related tax effects of stock-based compensation and other non-GAAP adjustments, the full year tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 17.6% compared to 22% for 2019. 
2020 diluted EPS was $22.41. On a non-GAAP basis, 2020 diluted EPS was $5.25. Free cash flow was $507.3 million for 2020, down $90.3 million versus 2019. 
Now let me turn to our outlook. Overall, we are very pleased with our Q4 performance and a strong momentum in our business, which has continued through January for both Clear Aligners and Systems and Services. As we discussed at our Investor Day in November, we are committed to making significant investments to drive growth, and we are seeing good return on these investments across all regions and customer channels. 
These strong returns give us confidence to continue investing in sales, marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity to accelerate adoption in a huge underpenetrated market. These investments, coupled with typically higher seasonal operating expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected to result in sequentially lower operating margin percent in Q1 as we have historically seen. 
While the global operating environment surrounding the pandemic remains uncertain, we will continue to focus on what we can control, and we are confident in our ability to continue to execute. Our responsibility is to continue driving innovation and delivering on the needs of our customer, doctors and their patients. 
Over the past 24 years, Align has invested billions in technology, innovation, consumer marketing and demand creation to connect millions of consumers with our doctor customers. We will continue to invest in this business to drive demand and drive adoption of the Align digital platform, including manufacturing and operational expansion. We will always be responsible. Just like we've done in the past, we make investments to drive growth and maximize ROI. 
We remain committed to our long-term target model of 20% to 30% revenue growth for Clear Aligners and Systems and Services and operating margin of 25% to 30%. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?"

The choices we made in 2020 to protect employees, support customers and press forward on our strategy for growth were possible because of the strength of our balance sheet and the confidence we have in our business model. 
Our actions reflect our conviction and the enormous opportunity we have to transform smiles and change lives. With 15 million orthodontic cases starts annually and more than 500 million consumers who can benefit from a better smile, the market for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry is massive and has been unleashed by the need for digital. 
In a macro sense, COVID-19 has accentuated the benefits and pervasiveness of the digital economy. From an Align standpoint, practices across every region are embracing digital treatment in new ways and more purposely than ever before. 
Invisalign providers are using our virtual tools to minimize in-office appointments and deliver doctor directed personalized treatment that meets the needs of the moment, and that will reshape the future of treatment. Digital acceleration is not just around Invisalign treatment. It includes digital workflows around iTero scanners and general dentistry. 
Doctors tell us that the iTero scanner is central to their practice and their practice workflows, and it's key to driving digital treatment. 
We've also known this, iTero and now exocad are core components of the Align Digital platform. Our integrated suite of unique proprietary technologies and services delivered as a seamless end-to-end solution for patients and consumers, orthodontists and GP dentists and lab partners. 
And particularly, we now have all the building blocks to create digital workflows, leveraging the combined power Invisalign treatment, iTero scanners and exocad software become more relevant to the GP market, which is critical to accessing the $500 million consumer opportunity. 
Align is a growth business with huge opportunities, but the environment remains uncertain due to COVID-19. Our plan is still to counter uncertainty by staying focused on our long-term strategy, living our value, supporting our employees and customers and keeping in mind the demand drivers we've identified over the past year. 
The redirection of disposable income for many consumers, channel focus that allows us to reach and support a wider range of customers within each channel. And most importantly, the digital mindset that's taking hold with more and more of our customers and that we are supporting through innovative products and programs that can help support their digital transformation. 
We are not ignoring the reality of COVID-19 and how long it may be part of our lives. But we're also not going to stop driving the business forward for the good of the customers and their patients, our employees and our stakeholders. 
In closing, I want to leave you with a few thoughts as we begin the new year. While there is considerable amount of turmoil in the world, our focus is on what we can control as a company. We have strong momentum. We'll stay focused on our strategic priorities, international expansion, patient demand and conversion, orthodontist utilization and GP dentist treatment. 
In summary, we're very pleased with the fourth quarter and the full year results of 2020 during a remarkable year with events beyond our control as a result of COVID-19. 
It is during times such as this when having a solid strategy combined with focused execution can lead to outcomes that support growth, not only for Align business, but also practice growth for alliance customers, which also leads to more and more Invisalign smiles. 
With that, turn it over to the operator and we'll take calls."

I'll let the others maybe talk about the quarterly trends. But one of the things that kind of stood out to me was, you're driving extremely strong volume growth amidst what's kind of a stable to slightly declining pricing environment. Just curious first, when do you think you'll be able to go back to the kind of prior model where you're able to take pricing? Is that still in the cards? 
And then secondly, I think the teen market is an area that we've kind of always been looking at as the next leg of growth, the kind of huge market that's out there and you're talking about some of the conversion and the lead generation. Can you help us understand some of the conversion rates around the leads that you generate in terms of timing and how long this takes to get the ROI that is put in to the advertising that you're out there?"

We try to communicate this as strongly as we can is to keep your eyes on gross margin because we have huge mix, whether it's international mix or it's product mix, you see a lot of progress in iGo and products like moderate and Invisalign first in those products. The carry actually lower average selling prices, but higher margins. And so you could often mix up on those things. 
So I'd say, as we keep emphasizing, is don't be overly concerned about ASPs or focused on ASPs. Like John said, we didn't increase ASPs this year because we're interested in supporting our customers and making sure that this is difficult -- really difficult transition for many practices right now and instituting a price increase just wouldn't have been responsible in that sense. But at the same time, we drove incredible productivity across the business, and we're able to show those kind of gross margins. So I hope you and the rest of the analyst community out there can actually see that. 
We've been talking about this for a few years, but actually taken place. 
On the teen side, in the conversion from an advertising standpoint, mean we come at this from a lot of different ways and a lot of different areas. And we -- if we're going to start teen season, you really have to start in February in the United States, and you have to really work through a lot of different aspects of social media. You advertise differently from moms and you do teens and different things like that. So I can't give you a correlation coefficient in the sense of here we invest and how much we get back. But we understand as well as a business. We've been doing it for years. We understand the timing of it and more and more we become more specific on the social advertising pieces and how to implement that properly. And John, do you have anything you want to add?"

Steve, the basic way to think about this is as we look at our revenue, we've got revenue on a new case that we ship out, and there's a certain amount that you recognize on that shipment based on our rev rec.

And then you also get into your revenue so those deferrals that you've made for maybe previous quarters or even previous year, that as they -- that doctor needs to use that additional lines, you're going to get revenue for that. 
When you have a mix like we have, where there's much more, there's a demand for future volume for new cases, you get a mix where we just have a lot more as a percentage of new cases and that's what impacts ASPs. 
When we look at that from a margin standpoint, it's margin accretive. We're getting that as new cases. Many of the cases that we get back from a deferred revenue standpoint, where there's refinements, we just don't make as much margin on that. 
You get the deferred revenue, but you don't get as much of the margin. So there's those dynamics that we have. We saw just when you have a significant volume increase like we saw in our third and fourth quarter."

From a GP channel standpoint, I mean, 3 years ago, when we first started segmenting in Europe and now we are doing the states, and we do it all over the world.

Steve, I can't tell you where it's going. But when we talk about that 500 million patients like I did in my script, that's where they are. And that's where you touch them. And it's a different -- it's not a big teen market. It's a lot of adults, but it has to have a workflow that's specific to a GP. And that's why we drive our products. It's why iTero is so important from a front-end standpoint. 
Your question on exocad is we think that's going to be a big GP driver for us. It's a big legitimate piece for us. But I don't think it's adding to volume right now.

Right now, you throw it on a screen, it's live. You can see exactly what's going on. It becomes an incredible patient communication tool in a sense of where is your dentition, what needs to be done?

And when you look at iTero, it is arguably the highest performing scanner in the world, the speed of it, the exactness of it, color rendering and also with [indiscernible] technology, be able to see carries or cavities is a real benefit. Even the orthodontist, who want to make sure that before you start the treatment, that dentition is in good enough shape to be the accept that kind of movement. So that just -- this is the time for digitization inside of Dentistry, and iTero plays a big role in that, and it front ends our digital platform."

John will provide more detail on our financial results and share additional color on business trends. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.  
Our fourth quarter was a strong finish to the year with record revenues and volumes from both Invisalign aligners and iTero scanners as well as increased gross margins, operating margins, EPS and cash flow. Our fourth quarter performance was driven by strong year-over-year growth across customer channels and regions and continued momentum sequentially.
During the quarter, we achieved a major milestone in EMEA with a shipment to our 2 millionth Invisalign patient that will be amplified with the EMEA-wide campaign that will launch next month. This milestone for EMEA reflects strong acceleration in Invisalign adoption and growth.
For Q4, total revenues were $834.5 million, up 13.7% sequentially and up 28.4% year-over-year. Q4 '20 clear aligner revenues of $700.7 million were up 12.9% sequentially and increased 28.9% year-over-year.
In Q4, we shipped a record 568,000 Invisalign cases, an increase of 14.5% sequentially and 37.3% year-over-year. Q4 reflects increased Invisalign adoption from both adults and teenagers, which are up 36.7% and 38.7% year-over-year, respectively.
Our teen and mom-focused consumer campaign generated 77% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our website and 76% increase in lead generation.
In addition, Invisalign social media influencers like Charlie D'Amelio, Marsai Martin, Cristina Milan, Tisha Campbell-Martin, Rachel Zoe, Tiffany Ma and Tahj Mowry continue to deliver exciting new content and increased engagement for the Invisalign brand with consumers and among their millions of followers.
Our Digital Platform continues to gain traction as doctors usage of iTero scanners increase. Our consumer and patient app was rolled out to more than 50 markets, resulting in more than a 2.5x increase in apps download and monthly active users in 2020 versus a year ago.
Our patient feature usage continues to increase. For example, Invisalign virtual appointment was used 68,000 times. Our insurance verification feature was used 26,000 times and more than 30,000 patients enrolled in Invisalign Virtual Care in 2020. Our new consumer website was rolled out to more than 40 markets around the world and is driving increased effectiveness in lead generation. We also launched an improved new doctor recruitment website in the U.S. and Canada to support our digital conversion journey. This will be expanded to other markets in the next few months. 
From a product perspective, growth was strong across the Invisalign portfolio, especially for noncomprehensive cases, including Invisalign Go and Invisalign Moderate. There are also more doctors engaging with us through the Aligned Digital and Practice Transformation or ADAPT program as more practices are moving towards digital practice optimization. 
As you'll recall, ADAPT was piloted over 2 years ago and is being commercialized as a standalone service, providing the relevant workforce, clinical and marketing support to enable doctors to digitally transform their practices.
In Q4, we shipped a record 77,000 Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which a record 7,300 were first time customers. We also trained over 6,400 new docs in Q4, including over 3,900 international doctors.
Q4 '20 System and Services revenues of $133.8 million were up 18% sequentially, driven by momentum in the Americas and EMEA, and up 26% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific.
Our results reflect continued strong uptake of the iTero Element 5D, the only inter oral scanner with caries detection, which is scaling rapidly across each region and represented approximately 1/3 of iTero volumes in Q4.
Innovation remains a cornerstone of our business. Today, we announced the availability of the iTero Element Plus series, which expands our portfolio of iTero Element scanners and Imaging Systems to include new solutions that serve a broader range of the dental marketplace.  
The new iTero Element plus series of scanners and Imaging Systems builds on the success of the award-winning iTero Element family and offers in all the existing orthodontic and restorative digital capabilities, doctors have come to rely on, plus faster processing time and advanced visualization capabilities for a seamless scanning experience in a new sleek, ergonomically designed package.
We announced the launch of our next-gen ClinCheck Pro 6.0 proprietary treatment planning software with in-face visualization, and our Invisalign G8 improved predictability in our last earnings call, we announced. Their availability is being expanded across all regions. 
Further, we launched several enhancements to our treatment planning including improved final teeth position and auto segmentation. We also added several new features to our virtual care tool. 
For the full year 2020, total net revenues were a record $2.5 billion, up 2.7% year-over-year. Clear aligner revenues of $2.1 billion were up 3.7%, reflecting a record 1.6 million Invisalign shipments and growth of 7.9%.
During the year, 30.3% of total Invisalign cases or nearly 0.5 million teens or younger started Invisalign treatment. This is up 11.5% from 2019. System and Services revenues were down slightly compared to 2019.
2020 was a year unlike any other we've experienced. The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact have been life changing. Marked by loss and separation, recovery and renewal, record highs and lows and significant milestones and accomplishments. Even at a time of huge disruption, we all had to adapt, evaluate priorities and develop new ways of doing things, both personally and professionally.
Through it all, Align's priority has been the health and well-being of our employees and their families and our doctor customers and their staff, and that remains a constant.
Despite the swift onset of the pandemic and the uncertainty through 2020, we didn't hold our plans or change our strategy for continued growth. We completed the acquisition of exocad, accelerated our investments in marketing to create Invisalign brand awareness and drive consumer demand for our doctors' offices, accelerated new technology to market with virtual tools that enable our doctors to stay connected with their patients, provided PPE to those in need and supported doctors and their teams with online education and digital forms that went beyond products to help them navigate the uncertainty of the pandemic.
As a result of our continued strategic focus and investments, we exited the year stronger than we started and 2021 is off to a great start.
Now let's turn to the specifics around our fourth quarter, starting with the Americas. For the Americas region, Q4 Invisalign case volume was up 12.7% sequentially and up 34.1% year-over-year, reflecting increased utilization of Invisalign treatment for both orthodontic and GP channels. Our continued investments in digital marketing and sales programs and focus on market segmentation are helping drive strong growth of Invisalign clear aligners and iTero products.
During the quarter, we continued offering sales initiatives to our doctor partners to help drive adoption of Invisalign and iTero products. The Bracket Buy Back - Switch program, which we launched in North America in Q2 '20, continues to drive conversions from wires and brackets to Invisalign clear aligners.
During Q4, and this program resulting -- has resulted in about 10,000 new cases, similar to Q3. We believe it's also causing a halo effect with patients switching from wires and brackets to Invisalign clear aligners with increased awareness of the benefits of Invisalign treatment and how it is less disruptive to their lives with the outcome of a beautiful smile through an Invisalign-trained doctor. 
The Teen Awesomeness Centers programs, direct patients to Invisalign doctors who are experts at treating teens, and are seen as the go-to docs for treatment. We continue to see growth with Invisalign First for treatment in younger kids, driving increased comprehensive treatments within North America ortho channel.
Latin American volume was also up year-over-year, led by strong growth in Brazil and Mexico. We believe the market for orthodontic treatment is huge in Latin America as we continue to grow our presence across the region. 
We saw increased utilization in the GP channel with Invisalign Go and the continued adoption of Moderate. The GP Accelerator program designed exclusively for general practitioner dentists provides an all-encompassing support plan based on practice needs that is centered around maximizing iTero integration, clinical support needs and implementing new marketing strategies.
We also see increased utilization with GP dentists that have enrolled in the iPro program as well as with doctors that have installed the iTero scanner. DSO utilization also increased and continues to be a strong growth driver, led by Heartland and Smile docs.  For the full year, Americas Invisalign volume was up 3.6%.
For international business, Q4 Invisalign case volume was up sequentially 6.7%, led by strong growth in EMEA as doctors returned from summer holiday season, offset somewhat by seasonally slower period in China. On a year-over-year basis, international shipments were up 41.1%, reflecting increases throughout both EMEA and APAC. For the full year, International Invisalign volume was up 13.3%. 
For EMEA, Q4 volumes were up sequentially 47.9% and 48.3% on a year-over-year basis across all markets with strong performance across both ortho and GP channels. Within the GP channel specifically, we saw acceleration in both utilization and shipments with Invisalign Go. 
We also saw acceleration in both core and expansion markets with growth in our core markets led by Iberia, U.K. and France, along with continued growth in our expansion markets led by Central and Eastern Europe and the Benelux. 
We introduced the Ortho Recovery 360 program in EMEA last quarter to support our orthodontist as they started reopening their businesses. As of Q4, 3,200 orthodontists have enrolled in the program. 
During the quarter, we launched a Recovery II program with a refreshed website featuring all digital tools, growth programs and education events for EMEA doctors to support their relief efforts during COVID-19. 
We also held our Digital Innovation Forum at the beginning of December, where approximately 900 doctors, both ortho and GP, attended the 2-day forum event with keynotes on the digitization of dental practices. We also continued our digital excellence series of webinars launched by the iTero team.
Throughout the quarter, the following digital innovations were also launched across EMEA, Invisalign G8, ClinCheck Pro 6.0 and Invisalign Go Plus to help drive Invisalign clear aligner utilization.
To support our GP doctors, we launched our GP Recovery 360 program last quarter with over 2,700 GPs enrolled so far. We continue to offer online and on-demand education events, which reached over 15,000 GPs cumulatively. For the full year, EMEA Invisalign volume was up 12.6%. 
For APAC, Q4 volumes were down sequentially, 14.7%. Notwithstanding typical Q4 seasonality in China, following a strong Q3, we had strong growth in Japan and ANZ and Southeast Asia. On a year-over-year basis, APAC was up 30% compared to the prior year, reflecting continued strong growth across the region. 
We were pleased to see the growth in the adult segment with noncomprehensive cases with the Invisalign Moderate product in the GP channel. 
In the teen segment, we also saw an increase in utilization amongst Invisalign doctors, and we saw continued acceleration from Japan and ANZ. For the full year, APAC Invisalign volume was up 14.3%.
Last year, we launched a new and improved digital learning environment for our doctors offering a comprehensive learning platform with role-specific content for orthos, GPS and their teams. 
The improved functionality enables more online learning opportunities with spotlight features for what's trending now, recommended learning path based on doctors' experiences and expanded categories including digital treatment planning, comprehensive dentistry and team education.
For the year, over 127,000 doctors have accessed recorded lectures, completed self-paced learning modules and watched how-to videos with new certified doctors viewing more than 1.4 million pages of content. Among the ortho channel, over 47,000 unique users have engaged with the digital learning site, with an additional 80,000 unique users from the GP channel.
As we've mentioned, we are seeing good adoption of the ADAPT program, which is an expert and independent fee-based business consulting service offered by Align to optimize clinics' operational workflow and processes to enhance the patient's experience and customer and staff satisfaction, which will, in turn, translate into higher growth and greater efficiencies for orthodontic practices.
As a result, the ADAPT service -- participating process in Q4 improved profitability significantly after implementation.
Our consumer marketing is focused on capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles, educating consumers about the Invisalign system and driving that demand to our Invisalign doctor offices.
In Q4, we saw strong digital engagement globally with more than a 77% increase in unique visitors, a 108% increase in doc locator searches and 76% increase in leads created, driven by our global adult- and mom-focused campaigns and teen-focused influencer content.
Our U.S. mom/teen multi-touch multimillion-dollar campaign with influencer led YouTube videos; a mom-focused TV spot; a custom Twitch activation; and mega teen sensation, Charli D'Amelio, continued to perform very well and garnered 2.7 billion impressions in Q4. 
The statistics I shared previously speak to the successful reach of this marketing campaign is having to not only drive demand with consumers but also in educating them on the benefits of Invisalign treatment through a doctor's office.
In Q4, we also launched media test in the EMEA region, in the U.K., Germany and France, and in the APAC region in Australia and Japan. These have worked very well and resulted in more than a 6x increase in leads in EMEA and a 3x increase in leads in APAC. Several key metrics that show increased activity and engagement with the Invisalign brand are included in our Q4 quarterly presentation slides available on our website.
Align is always looking for new opportunities to reach consumers and be relevant to potential patients, wherever they work, live and play, which is why we announced the Invisalign brand is the official clear aligner sponsor of the National Football League, the NFL, and 11 NFL teams, including the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Kansas City Chiefs.
The NFL league partnership designed to expand our reach with consumers, generated over 150 million impressions in 2020, helping to drive awareness of Invisalign clear aligner treatment at a national level, while the team agreements are designed to help us engage within key markets and connect consumers with doctors in those markets.
For our Systems and Services business, Q4 revenues were up 18% sequentially due to higher shipments and services revenue. We continue to see momentum with the iTero Element 5D Imaging System, gaining traction in all regions with significant Element Flex sales in EMEA.
On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenues were up 26% due to higher shipments and services. For the year, our System and Services total revenues were down 2.8% year-over-year, cumulatively over 3.1 -- 31.4 million orthodontic scans and 6.7 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. 
For Q4, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas increased to 84% from 79.5% in Q4 of last year. International scans increased to 73.7%, up 64.7% in the same quarter last year.
We're pleased to see that within the Americas, 94.8% of cases submitted by North American orthodontists were submitted digitally. We're also proud to share that iTero Element intraoral scanners are the winners of the 2020 Dentaltown Townie Choice award for Digital Impressioning category. 
Also during the quarter, the National Association of Dental Laboratories judging panel selected the iTero Element 5D as the winner of the 2020 Journal of Dental Technology WOW! Award.
The award represents a recognition of our commitment to enhancing patient engagement and communications that support efficient laboratory production.
For exocad, during the quarter, we launched 2 of the largest software releases in history, DentalCAD and exoplan. Dental CAD 3.0 Galway includes over 90 new features and over 80 enhanced functionalities with significant improvements to reduce design time, such as Instant Anatomic Morphing. 
Exoplan 3.0 Galway includes over 40 new features and over 60 enhanced functionalities that support planning of edentulous cases, including the design of surgical guides.
During the quarter, exocad also added 2 new large implant manufacturers as OEMs for exoplan in Brazil.
With that, I'll now turn it over to John."
24568,700101935,2190455,"Align Technology, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Align Technology, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q4 financial results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $834.5 million, up 13.7% from the prior quarter and up 28.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For clear aligners, Q4 revenues of $700.7 million were up 1",1554,"Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q4 financial results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $834.5 million, up 13.7% from the prior quarter and up 28.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. 
For clear aligners, Q4 revenues of $700.7 million were up 12.9% sequentially and up 28.9% year-over-year, reflecting Invisalign volume growth in all regions, partially offset by lower ASPs.
Clear aligner revenues growth was favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $5 million or approximately 0.8 points sequentially, and on a year-over-year basis by approximately $10.3 million or approximately 1.9 points.
Q4 Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially $15, primarily due to increased revenue deferrals related to a higher mix of new cases versus additional aligners, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange and lower promotional discounts.
As we mentioned last quarter, we did not implement a price increase in 2020, given our continued commitment to helping our customers in their recovery efforts during the pandemic. 
On a year-over-year basis, Q4 Invisalign ASPs decreased approximately $75, primarily due to our decision not to raise prices last summer, increased revenue deferrals for new cases versus additional aligners and higher promotional discounts, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange.
As a result, clear aligner deferred revenue on the balance sheet increased $83 million sequentially and $195 million year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped.
Total Q4 clear aligner shipments of 568,000 cases were up 14.5% sequentially and up 37.3% year-over-year. Our System and Services revenues for the fourth quarter was $133.8 million, up 18% sequentially due to an increase in scanner sales and increased services revenues from our larger installed base and higher ASPs.
Year-over-year, Systems and Services revenue was up 26% due to higher scanner sales, services revenue and the inclusion of exocad's CAD/CAM services, partially offset by lower scanner ASPs. Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM services deferred revenue was up 30% sequentially and up 69% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues, which we recognize ratably over the service period.
Moving on to gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 73.2%, up 0.4 points sequentially and up 0.5 points year-over-year. 
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangibles related to exocad, overall gross margin was 73.6% for the fourth quarter, up 0.3 points sequentially and up 0.7 points year-over-year.
Clear aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 74.9%, up 0.1 points sequentially due to lower additional aligner volume, partially offset by higher warranty, other manufacturing costs and lower ASPs.
Clear aligner gross margin was up 0.7 points year-over-year, primarily due to favorable product mix from increased iTero scanner absorption as a result of increased manufacturing volumes, partially offset by lower ASPs, higher warranty costs and other manufacturing costs.
Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.2%, up 2.2 points sequentially, primarily due to higher ASPs and increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes. Systems and Services gross margin was down 0.7 points year-over-year due to lower ASPs, higher freight and other manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher services revenue.
Q4 operating expenses were $397.3 million, up sequentially 11.3% and up 23.8% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating expenses is due to increased marketing and media spend and spending commensurate with business growth. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $76.5 million, reflecting our continued investment in sales and marketing, R&D activities and manufacturing operations.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $372.3 million, up sequentially 12.1% and up 23.4% year-over-year due to the reasons as described earlier.
Our fourth quarter operating income of $213.2 million resulted in an operating margin of 25.5%, up 1.4 points sequentially and up 2.3 points year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year increases in operating income and the operating margin are primarily attributed to higher gross margin and operating leverage.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to exocad and acquisition-related costs, operating margin for the fourth quarter was 28.9%, up 0.9 points sequentially and up 2.5 points year-over-year.
Interest and other income expense, net for the fourth quarter was a benefit of $1.4 million, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange.
With regards to the fourth quarter tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was 25.9%, which includes tax benefits of approximately $11 million related to adjustments in prior year's unrecognized tax positions. The fourth quarter tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 14.5% compared to 16.6% in prior quarter and 20.9% in the same quarter a year ago. The fourth quarter non-GAAP tax rate was lower than the third quarter's rate, primarily due to the reasons previously stated. 
Fourth quarter net income per diluted share was $2, up $0.24 sequentially and up $0.47 compared to the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.61 for the fourth quarter, up $0.37 sequentially and up $0.85 year-over-year.
Moving on to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $960.8 million, an increase of approximately $345.3 million from the prior quarter, which is primarily due to higher cash flow from operations. 
Of our $960.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $548.3 million was held in the U.S. and $412.5 million was held by our international entities.
Q4 accounts receivable balance was $657.7 million, up approximately 5% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 71 days, down approximately 6 days sequentially and down approximately 5 days as compared to Q4 last year due to strong cash collections.
Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $381.4 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $53.2 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. 
Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $328.3 million. Under our May 2018 repurchase program, we have $100 million still available for repurchase of our common stock.
Before we move to the outlook, I would like to make a few comments on the full year 2020 results. In 2020, we shipped a record 1.6 million Invisalign cases, up 7.9% year-over-year. This reflects 13.3% volume growth from our international doctors and 3.6% volume growth from our Americans doctors.
Systems and Services volumes were down 12% compared to 2019, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on equipment sales. Total revenue was a record $2.5 billion, up 2.7% year-over-year, with clear aligner revenues, a record $2.1 billion, up 3.7% year-over-year.
2020 Systems and Services revenue were $370.5 million, including exocad revenues from April 1, 2020 forward, compared to $381 million in 2019.
Full year 2020 operating income of $387.2 million, down 28.6% versus 2019, and operating margin at 15.7% versus 22.5% in 2019. 2019 operating income included a litigation benefit of $51 million and Invisalign store closures of $23 million for net benefit on operating margin of 1.1%.
With regards to full year tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was negative 368.6%, which includes a onetime tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion, net of current year amortization associated with the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to intra-entity sale of certain intellectual property rights resulting from our corporate structure reorganization completed in the first quarter of 2020.
Excluding the tax benefit related to our corporate structure reorganization and the related tax effects of stock-based compensation and other non-GAAP adjustments, the full year tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 17.6% compared to 22% for 2019.
2020 diluted EPS was $22.41. On a non-GAAP basis, 2020 diluted EPS was $5.25. Free cash flow was $507.3 million for 2020, down $90.3 million versus 2019.
Now let me turn to our outlook. Overall, we are very pleased with our Q4 performance and the strong momentum in our business, which has continued through January for both clear aligners and Systems and Services. As we discussed at our Investor Day in November, we are committed to making significant investments to drive growth, and we are seeing good return on these investments across all regions and customer channels.
These strong returns give us confidence to continue investing in sales, marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity to accelerate adoption in a huge under-penetrated market. These investments, coupled with typically higher seasonal operating expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected to result in sequentially lower operating margin percent in Q1 as we have historically seen.
While the global operating environment surrounding the pandemic remains uncertain, we will continue to focus on what we can control, and we are confident in our ability to continue to execute. Our responsibility is to continue driving innovation and delivering on the needs of our customer, doctors and their patients.
Over the past 24 years, Align has invested billions in technology, innovation, consumer marketing and demand creation to connect millions of consumers with our doctor customers. We will continue to invest in this business to drive demand and drive adoption of the Align Digital Platform, including manufacturing and operational expansion. 
We will always be responsible. Just like we've done in the past, we make investments to drive growth and maximize ROI. We remain committed to our long-term target model of 20% to 30% revenue growth for clear aligners and Systems and Services and operating margin of 25% to 30%.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?"

The choices we made in 2020 to protect employees, support customers and press forward on our strategy for growth, were possible because of the strength of our balance sheet and the confidence we have in our business model.
Our actions reflect our conviction in the enormous opportunity we have to transform smiles and change lives. With 15 million orthodontic cases starts annually and more than 500 million consumers who can benefit from a better smile, the market for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry is massive and has been unleashed by the need for digital.
In a macro sense, COVID-19 has accentuated the benefits and pervasiveness of the digital economy. From an Align standpoint, practices across every region are embracing digital treatment in new ways and more purposefully than ever before. Invisalign providers are using our virtual tools to minimize in-office appointments and deliver doctor-directed personalized treatment that meets the needs of the moment, and that will reshape the future of treatment. 
Digital acceleration is not just around Invisalign treatment. It includes digital workflows around iTero scanners and general dentistry. Doctors tell us that the iTero scanner is central to their practice and their practice workflows, and it's key to driving digital treatment.
We've also known this, iTero and now exocad are core components of the Align Digital Platform. Our integrated suite of unique proprietary technologies and services delivered as a seamless end-to-end solution for patients and consumers, orthodontists and GP dentists and lab partners.
And particularly, we now have all the building blocks to create digital workflows, leveraging the combined power of Invisalign treatment, iTero scanners and exocad software to become more relevant to the GP market, which is critical to accessing the $500 million consumer opportunity.
Align is a growth business with huge opportunities, but the environment remains uncertain due to COVID-19. Our plan is still to counter uncertainty by staying focused on our long-term strategy, living our values, supporting our employees and customers and keeping in mind the demand drivers we've identified over the past year.
The redirection of disposable income for many consumers; channel focus that allows us to reach and support a wider range of customers within each channel; and most importantly, the digital mindset that's taking hold with more and more of our customers and that we are supporting through innovative products and programs that can help support their digital transformation.
We are not ignoring the reality of COVID-19 and how long it may be part of our lives. But we're also not going to stop driving the business forward for the good of the customers and their patients, our employees and our stakeholders.
In closing, I want to leave you with a few thoughts as we begin the new year. While there is considerable amount of turmoil in the world, our focus is on what we can control as a company. We have strong momentum. We'll stay focused on our strategic priorities, international expansion, patient demand and conversion, orthodontist utilization and GP dentist treatment.
In summary, we're very pleased with the fourth quarter and the full year results of 2020, during a remarkable year with events beyond our control as a result of COVID-19.
It is during times such as this when having a solid strategy combined with focused execution can lead to outcomes that support growth, not only for Align's business, but also practice growth for Align's customers, which also leads to more and more Invisalign smiles.
With that, turn it over to the operator and we'll take calls."

Just curious first, when do you think you'll be able to go back to the kind of prior model where you're able to take pricing? Is that still in the cards?
And then secondly, I think the teen market is an area that we've kind of always been looking at as the next leg of growth, the kind of huge market that's out there and you're talking about some of the conversion and the lead generations.

We try to communicate this as strongly as we can is to keep your eyes on gross margin because we have huge mix, whether it's international mix or it's product mix, you see a lot of progress in iGo and products like Moderate and Invisalign First in those products. They carry actually lower average selling prices, but higher margins. And so you could often mix up on those things.
So I'd say, as we keep emphasizing, is don't be overly concerned about ASPs or focused on ASPs. Like John said, we didn't increase ASPs this year because we're interested in supporting our customers and making sure that this is difficult -- a really difficult transition for many practices right now and instituting a price increase just wouldn't have been responsible in that sense. 
But at the same time, we drove incredible productivity across the business, and we were able to show those kind of gross margins. So I hope you and the rest of the analyst community out there can actually see that. We've been talking about this for a few years, but actually taken place.
On the teen side, in the conversions from an advertising standpoint, I mean we come at this from a lot of different ways and a lot of different areas. And we -- if we're going to start teen season, you really have to start in February in the United States, and you have to really work through a lot of different aspects of social media. You advertise differently for moms and you do teens and different things like that. 
So I can't give you a correlation coefficient in the sense of here we invest and how much we get back. But we understand as well as a business. We've been doing it for years. We understand the timing of it and more and more we become more specific on the social advertising pieces and how to implement that properly. And John, do you have anything you want to add?"

Steve, the basic way to think about this is as we look at our revenue, we've got revenue on a new case that we ship out, and there's a certain amount that you recognize on that shipment based on our rev rec. And then there's a certain amount for future aligners or future modifications that are needed, that will be deferred revenue. And then you also get into your revenue so those deferrals that you've made for maybe previous quarters or even previous year, that as they -- that doctor needs to use that additional aligners, you're going to get revenue for that.
When you have a mix like we have, where there's much more, there's a demand for future volume for new cases, you get a mix where we just have a lot more as a percentage of new cases and that's what impacts ASPs.
When we look at that from a margin standpoint, it's margin accretive. We're getting that as new cases. Many of the cases that we get back from a deferred revenue standpoint, where there's refinements, we just don't make as much margin on that.
You get the deferred revenue, but you don't get as much of the margin. So there's those dynamics that we have. We saw just when you have a significant volume increase like we saw in our third and fourth quarter."

And just -- and a sales force that can communicate with GPs because it's a different conversation than with orthos. Steve, I can't tell you where it's going. But when we talk about that 500 million patients like I did in my script, that's where they are. And that's where you touch them. And it's a different -- it's not a big teen market. It's a lot of adults, but it has to have a workflow that's specific to a GP.
And that's why we drive our products. It's why iTero is so important from a front-end standpoint. 
Your question on exocad is we think that's going to be a big GP driver for us. It's a big legitimate piece for us. But I don't think it's adding to volume right now.

Your question about orthodontists that start to move up and do a significant part of their practice being Invisalign, you see a scanner at every chair. And they use these things constantly. It's part of what they do. 
And what we see on the GP segment is the communication tool ends up being the scanner in the front of the scanner. Because in the past, they'd hold up a mirror and say, Can you see that second møller back there and you'd say, yes, but you really couldn't, right?  Now you throw it on a screen, it's live. You can see exactly what's going on. It becomes an incredible patient communication tool in a sense of where is your dentition? What needs to be done? And it helps to convince patients of what the doctor wants to do and the validity of that kind of treatment. 
So that -- this is where dentistry is going. And when you look at iTero, it is arguably the highest performing scanner in the world, the speed of it, the exactness of it, color rendering and also with [ neary ] technology, be able to see caries or cavities is a real benefit. Even the orthodontist, who want to make sure that before you start the treatment that, that dentition is in good enough shape to be the -- accept that kind of movement.

A lot of changes to [indiscernible], which is our final positioning aspect of dentition. We had the plus product from iGo, the in-face visualization. This is a digital business, and it requires constant iterations in products. 
I mean -- and obviously, mid-winter and those things were great places to highlight it. But our innovation, we looked at it as agile not waterfall anymore. And then since waterfall used to be invent during the year, release one period of the year. More and more, you'll see us just monthly, just rolling out new products as we adapt to a more kind of an agile philosophy of development than a waterfall type of, if that's what you're asking, Elizabeth."

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights from the fourth quarter and full year, then briefly discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, Clear Aligner and Systems and Services.
John will provide more detail on our financial results and share additional color on business trends. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.  
Our fourth quarter was a strong finish to the year, with record revenues and volumes from both Invisalign aligners and iTero scanners, as well as increased gross margins, operating margins, EPS and cash flow. Our fourth quarter performance was driven by strong year-over-year growth across customer channels and regions and continued momentum sequentially.
During the quarter, we achieved a major milestone in EMEA, with a shipment to our 2 millionth Invisalign patient that will be amplified with the EMEA-wide campaign that will launch next month. This milestone for EMEA reflects strong acceleration in Invisalign adoption and growth.
For Q4, total revenues were $834.5 million, up 13.7% sequentially and up 28.4% year-over-year. Q4 '20 Clear Aligner revenues of $700.7 million were up 12.9% sequentially and increased 28.9% year-over-year. In Q4, we shipped a record 568,000 Invisalign cases, an increase of 14.5% sequentially and 37.3% year-over-year. 
Q4 reflects increased Invisalign adoption from both adults and teenagers, which are up 36.7% and 38.7% year-over-year, respectively.  Our teen and mom-focused consumer campaign generated 77% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our website and 76% increase in lead generation.
In addition, Invisalign social media influencers like Charli D'Amelio, Marsai Martin, Christina Milian, Tisha Campbell-Martin, Rachel Zoe, Tiffany Ma and Tahj Mowry, continue to deliver exciting new content and increased engagement for the Invisalign brand with consumers and among their millions of followers.
Our Digital Platform continues to gain traction as doctors' usage of iTero scanners increase. Our consumer and patient app was rolled out to more than 50 markets, resulting in more than a 2.5x increase in apps download and monthly active users in 2020 versus a year ago.
Our patient feature usage continues to increase. For example, Invisalign virtual appointment was used 68,000 times. Our insurance verification feature was used 26,000 times and more than 30,000 patients enrolled in Invisalign Virtual Care in 2020. Our new consumer website was rolled out to more than 40 markets around the world and is driving increased effectiveness in lead generation. We also launched an improved new doctor recruitment website in the U.S. and Canada to support our digital conversion journey. This will be expanded to other markets in the next few months. 
From a product perspective, growth was strong across the Invisalign portfolio, especially for noncomprehensive cases, including Invisalign Go and Invisalign Moderate. There are also more doctors engaging with us through the Aligned Digital and Practice Transformation, or ADAPT program, as more practices are moving towards digital practice optimization. 
As you'll recall, ADAPT was piloted over 2 years ago and is being commercialized as a standalone service, providing the relevant workforce, clinical and marketing support to enable doctors to digitally transform their practices. In Q4, we shipped a record 77,000 Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which a record 7,300 were first time customers. We also trained over 6,400 new docs in Q4, including over 3,900 international doctors.
Q4 '20 System and Services revenues of $133.8 million were up 18% sequentially, driven by momentum in the Americas and EMEA, and up 26% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Our results reflect continued strong uptake of the iTero Element 5D, the only inter oral scanner with caries detection, which is scaling rapidly across each region and represented approximately 1/3 of iTero volumes in Q4.
Innovation remains a cornerstone of our business. Today, we announced the availability of the iTero Element Plus series, which expands our portfolio of iTero Element scanners and Imaging Systems to include new solutions that serve a broader range of the dental marketplace.  
The new iTero Element plus series of scanners and Imaging Systems builds on the success of the award-winning iTero Element family and offers in all the existing orthodontic and restorative digital capabilities, doctors have come to rely on, plus faster processing time and advanced visualization capabilities for a seamless scanning experience in a new sleek, ergonomically designed package.
We announced the launch of our next-gen ClinCheck Pro 6.0 proprietary treatment planning software with in-face visualization, and our Invisalign G8 improved predictability in our last earnings call, we announced. Their availability is being expanded across all regions. 
Further, we launched several enhancements to our treatment planning including improved final teeth position and auto segmentation. We also added several new features to our virtual care tool. 
For the full year 2020, total net revenues were a record $2.5 billion, up 2.7% year-over-year. Clear Aligner revenues of $2.1 billion were up 3.7%, reflecting a record 1.6 million Invisalign shipments and growth of 7.9%. During the year, 30.3% of total Invisalign cases or nearly 0.5 million teens or younger started Invisalign treatment. This is up 11.5% from 2019. System and Services revenues were down slightly compared to 2019.
2020 was a year unlike any other we've experienced. The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact have been life changing, marked by loss and separation, recovery and renewal, record highs and lows and significant milestones and accomplishments. Even at a time of huge disruption, we all had to adapt, evaluate priorities and develop new ways of doing things, both personally and professionally. Through it all, Align's priority has been the health and well-being of our employees and their families and our doctor customers and their staff, and that remains a constant.
Despite the swift onset of the pandemic and the uncertainty through 2020, we didn't halt our plans or change our strategy for continued growth. We completed the acquisition of exocad, accelerated our investments in marketing to create Invisalign brand awareness and drive consumer demand for our doctors' offices, accelerated new technology to market with virtual tools that enable our doctors to stay connected with their patients, provided PPE to those in need and supported doctors and their teams with online education and digital forms that went beyond products to help them navigate the uncertainty of the pandemic. As a result of our continued strategic focus and investments, we exited the year stronger than we started and 2021 is off to a great start.
Now let's turn to the specifics around our fourth quarter, starting with the Americas. For the Americas region, Q4 Invisalign case volume was up 12.7% sequentially and up 34.1% year-over-year, reflecting increased utilization of Invisalign treatment for both orthodontic and GP channels. Our continued investments in digital marketing and sales programs and focus on market segmentation are helping drive strong growth of Invisalign clear aligners and iTero products.  
During the quarter, we continued offering sales initiatives to our doctor partners to help drive adoption of Invisalign and iTero products. The Bracket Buy Back - Switch program, which we launched in North America in Q2 '20, continues to drive conversions from wires and brackets to Invisalign clear aligners.
During Q4, and this program resulting -- has resulted in about 10,000 new cases, similar to Q3. We believe it's also causing a halo effect with patients switching from wires and brackets to Invisalign clear aligners with increased awareness of the benefits of Invisalign treatment and how it is less disruptive to their lives with the outcome of a beautiful smile through an Invisalign-trained doctor. 
The Teen Awesomeness Centers programs, direct patients to Invisalign doctors who are experts at treating teens, and are seen as the go-to docs for treatment. We continue to see growth with Invisalign First for treatment in younger kids, driving increased comprehensive treatments within North America ortho channel.
Latin American volume was also up year-over-year, led by strong growth in Brazil and Mexico. We believe the market for orthodontic treatment is huge in Latin America as we continue to grow our presence across the region. We saw increased utilization in the GP channel with Invisalign Go and the continued adoption of Moderate. The GP Accelerator program, designed exclusively for general practitioner dentists, provides an all-encompassing support plan based on practice needs that is centered around maximizing iTero integration, clinical support needs and implementing new marketing strategies.
We also see increased utilization with GP dentists that have enrolled in the iPro program as well as with doctors that have installed the iTero scanner. DSO utilization also increased and continues to be a strong growth driver, led by Heartland and Smile docs.  For the full year, Americas Invisalign volume was up 3.6%.
For international business, Q4 Invisalign case volume was up sequentially 6.7%, led by strong growth in EMEA as doctors returned from summer holiday season, offset somewhat by seasonally slower period in China. On a year-over-year basis, international shipments were up 41.1%, reflecting increases throughout both EMEA and APAC. For the full year, International Invisalign volume was up 13.3%. 
For EMEA, Q4 volumes were up sequentially 47.9% and 48.3% on a year-over-year basis across all markets, with strong performance across both ortho and GP channels. Within the GP channel specifically, we saw acceleration in both utilization and shipments with Invisalign Go. 
We also saw acceleration in both core and expansion markets with growth in our core markets led by Iberia, U.K. and France, along with continued growth in our expansion markets led by Central and Eastern Europe and the Benelux. We introduced the Ortho Recovery 360 program in EMEA last quarter to support our orthodontist as they started reopening their businesses. As of Q4, 3,200 orthodontists have enrolled in the program. 
During the quarter, we launched a Recovery II program with a refreshed website featuring all digital tools, growth programs and education events for EMEA doctors to support their relief efforts during COVID-19. We also held our Digital Innovation Forum at the beginning of December, where approximately 900 doctors, both ortho and GP, attended the 2-day forum event with keynotes on the digitization of dental practices. We also continued our digital excellence series of webinars launched by the iTero team.
Throughout the quarter, the following digital innovations were also launched across EMEA: Invisalign G8; ClinCheck Pro 6.0; and Invisalign Go Plus to help drive Invisalign clear aligner utilization. To support our GP doctors, we launched our GP Recovery 360 program last quarter, with over 2,700 GPs enrolled so far. We continue to offer online and on-demand education events, which reached over 15,000 GPs cumulatively. For the full year, EMEA Invisalign volume was up 12.6%. 
For APAC, Q4 volumes were down sequentially, 14.7%. Notwithstanding typical Q4 seasonality in China, following a strong Q3, we had strong growth in Japan and ANZ and Southeast Asia. On a year-over-year basis, APAC was up 30% compared to the prior year, reflecting continued strong growth across the region. We were pleased to see the growth in the adult segment with noncomprehensive cases with the Invisalign Moderate product in the GP channel. 
In the teen segment, we also saw an increase in utilization amongst Invisalign doctors, and we saw continued acceleration from Japan and ANZ. For the full year, APAC Invisalign volume was up 14.3%. Last year, we launched a new and improved digital learning environment for our doctors offering a comprehensive learning platform with role-specific content for orthos, GPS and their teams. 
The improved functionality enables more online learning opportunities with spotlight features for what's trending now, recommended learning path based on doctors' experiences and expanded categories including digital treatment planning, comprehensive dentistry and team education. 
For the year, over 127,000 doctors have accessed recorded lectures, completed self-paced learning modules and watched how-to videos with new certified doctors viewing more than 1.4 million pages of content. Among the ortho channel, over 47,000 unique users have engaged with the digital learning site, with an additional 80,000 unique users from the GP channel.
As we've mentioned, we are seeing good adoption of the ADAPT program, which is an expert and independent fee-based business consulting service offered by Align to optimize clinics' operational workflow and processes to enhance the patient's experience and customer and staff satisfaction, which will, in turn, translate into higher growth and greater efficiencies for orthodontic practices.
As a result, the ADAPT service -- participating process in Q4 improved profitability significantly after implementation. Our consumer marketing is focused on capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles, educating consumers about the Invisalign system and driving that demand to our Invisalign doctor offices.
In Q4, we saw strong digital engagement globally, with more than a 77% increase in unique visitors, a 108% increase in doc locator searches and 76% increase in leads created, driven by our global adult- and mom-focused campaigns and teen-focused influencer content.  Our U.S. mom/teen multi-touch multimillion-dollar campaign, with influencer-led YouTube videos, a mom-focused TV spot, a custom Twitch activation, and mega teen sensation, Charli D'Amelio, continued to perform very well and garnered 2.7 billion impressions in Q4. The statistics I shared previously speak to the successful reach of this marketing campaign is having to not only drive demand with consumers but also in educating them on the benefits of Invisalign treatment through a doctor's office.
In Q4, we also launched media tests in the EMEA region, in the U.K., Germany and France, and in the APAC region in Australia and Japan. These have worked very well and resulted in more than a 6x increase in leads in EMEA and a 3x increase in leads in APAC. Several key metrics that show increased activity and engagement with the Invisalign brand are included in our Q4 quarterly presentation slides available on our website.
Align is always looking for new opportunities to reach consumers and be relevant to potential patients, wherever they work, live and play, which is why we announced the Invisalign brand is the official clear aligner sponsor of the National Football League, the NFL, and 11 NFL teams, including the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Kansas City Chiefs.
The NFL league partnership, designed to expand our reach with consumers, generated over 150 million impressions in 2020, helping to drive awareness of Invisalign clear aligner treatment at a national level, while the team agreements are designed to help us engage within key markets and connect consumers with doctors in those markets.
For our Systems and Services business, Q4 revenues were up 18% sequentially due to higher shipments and services revenue. We continue to see momentum, with the iTero Element 5D Imaging System gaining traction in all regions with significant Element Flex sales in EMEA.
On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenues were up 26% due to higher shipments and services. For the year, our System and Services total revenues were down 2.8% year-over-year, cumulatively over 3.1 -- 31.4 million orthodontic scans and 6.7 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. 
For Q4, total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas increased to 84% from 79.5% in Q4 of last year. International scans increased to 73.7%, up 64.7% in the same quarter last year.
We're pleased to see that within the Americas, 94.8% of cases submitted by North American orthodontists were submitted digitally. We're also proud to share that iTero Element intraoral scanners are the winners of the 2020 Dentaltown Townie Choice award for Digital Impressioning category. 
Also during the quarter, the National Association of Dental Laboratories judging panel selected the iTero Element 5D as the winner of the 2020 Journal of Dental Technology WOW! Award. The award represents a recognition of our commitment to enhancing patient engagement and communications that support efficient laboratory production.
For exocad, during the quarter, we launched 2 of the largest software releases in history, DentalCAD and exoplan. Dental CAD 3.0 Galway includes over 90 new features and over 80 enhanced functionalities with significant improvements to reduce design time, such as Instant Anatomic Morphing. Exoplan 3.0 Galway includes over 40 new features and over 60 enhanced functionalities that support planning of edentulous cases, including the design of surgical guides. During the quarter, exocad also added 2 new large implant manufacturers as OEMs for exoplan in Brazil.
With that, I'll now turn it over to John."
24568,700101935,2242020,"Align Technology, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Align Technology, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q4 financial results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $834.5 million, up 13.7% from the prior quarter and up 28.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For clear aligners, Q4 revenues of $700.7 million were up 12.",1554,"Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q4 financial results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $834.5 million, up 13.7% from the prior quarter and up 28.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For clear aligners, Q4 revenues of $700.7 million were up 12.9% sequentially and up 28.9% year-over-year, reflecting Invisalign volume growth in all regions, partially offset by lower ASPs.
Clear aligner revenues growth was favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $5 million or approximately 0.8 points sequentially, and on a year-over-year basis by approximately $10.3 million or approximately 1.9 points. Q4 Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially $15, primarily due to increased revenue deferrals related to a higher mix of new cases versus additional aligners, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange and lower promotional discounts.
As we mentioned last quarter, we did not implement a price increase in 2020, given our continued commitment to helping our customers in their recovery efforts during the pandemic. 
On a year-over-year basis, Q4 Invisalign ASPs decreased approximately $75, primarily due to our decision not to raise prices last summer, increased revenue deferrals for new cases versus additional aligners and higher promotional discounts, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. As a result, clear aligner deferred revenue on the balance sheet increased $83 million sequentially and $195 million year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped.
Total Q4 clear aligner shipments of 568,000 cases were up 14.5% sequentially and up 37.3% year-over-year. Our System and Services revenues for the fourth quarter was $133.8 million, up 18% sequentially due to an increase in scanner sales and increased services revenues from our larger installed base and higher ASPs.
Year-over-year, Systems and Services revenue was up 26% due to higher scanner sales, services revenue and the inclusion of exocad's CAD/CAM services, partially offset by lower scanner ASPs. Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM services deferred revenue was up 30% sequentially and up 69% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues, which we recognize ratably over the service period.
Moving on to gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 73.2%, up 0.4 points sequentially and up 0.5 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangibles related to exocad, overall gross margin was 73.6% for the fourth quarter, up 0.3 points sequentially and up 0.7 points year-over-year.
Clear aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 74.9%, up 0.1 points sequentially due to lower additional aligner volume, partially offset by higher warranty, other manufacturing costs and lower ASPs. Clear aligner gross margin was up 0.7 points year-over-year, primarily due to favorable product mix from increased iTero scanner absorption as a result of increased manufacturing volumes, partially offset by lower ASPs, higher warranty costs and other manufacturing costs.
Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.2%, up 2.2 points sequentially, primarily due to higher ASPs and increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes. Systems and Services gross margin was down 0.7 points year-over-year due to lower ASPs, higher freight and other manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher services revenue.
Q4 operating expenses were $397.3 million, up sequentially 11.3% and up 23.8% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating expenses is due to increased marketing and media spend and spending commensurate with business growth. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $76.5 million, reflecting our continued investment in sales and marketing, R&D activities and manufacturing operations.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $372.3 million, up sequentially 12.1% and up 23.4% year-over-year due to the reasons as described earlier. Our fourth quarter operating income of $213.2 million resulted in an operating margin of 25.5%, up 1.4 points sequentially and up 2.3 points year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year increases in operating income and the operating margin are primarily attributed to higher gross margin and operating leverage.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to exocad and acquisition-related costs, operating margin for the fourth quarter was 28.9%, up 0.9 points sequentially and up 2.5 points year-over-year. Interest and other income expense, net for the fourth quarter was a benefit of $1.4 million, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange.
With regards to the fourth quarter tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was 25.9%, which includes tax benefits of approximately $11 million related to adjustments in prior year's unrecognized tax positions. The fourth quarter tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 14.5% compared to 16.6% in prior quarter and 20.9% in the same quarter a year ago. The fourth quarter non-GAAP tax rate was lower than the third quarter's rate, primarily due to the reasons previously stated. 
Fourth quarter net income per diluted share was $2, up $0.24 sequentially and up $0.47 compared to the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.61 for the fourth quarter, up $0.37 sequentially and up $0.85 year-over-year.
Moving on to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $960.8 million, an increase of approximately $345.3 million from the prior quarter, which is primarily due to higher cash flow from operations. Of our $960.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $548.3 million was held in the U.S. and $412.5 million was held by our international entities.
Q4 accounts receivable balance was $657.7 million, up approximately 5% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 71 days, down approximately 6 days sequentially and down approximately 5 days as compared to Q4 last year due to strong cash collections.  Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $381.4 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $53.2 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $328.3 million. Under our May 2018 repurchase program, we have $100 million still available for repurchase of our common stock.
Before we move to the outlook, I would like to make a few comments on the full year 2020 results. In 2020, we shipped a record 1.6 million Invisalign cases, up 7.9% year-over-year. This reflects 13.3% volume growth from our international doctors and 3.6% volume growth from our Americans doctors.
Systems and Services volumes were down 12% compared to 2019, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on equipment sales. Total revenue was a record $2.5 billion, up 2.7% year-over-year, with clear aligner revenues, a record $2.1 billion, up 3.7% year-over-year. 2020 Systems and Services revenue were $370.5 million, including exocad revenues from April 1, 2020 forward, compared to $381 million in 2019.
Full year 2020 operating income of $387.2 million, down 28.6% versus 2019, and operating margin at 15.7% versus 22.5% in 2019. 2019 operating income included a litigation benefit of $51 million and Invisalign store closures of $23 million for net benefit on operating margin of 1.1%.
With regards to full year tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was negative 368.6%, which includes a onetime tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion, net of current year amortization associated with the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to intra-entity sale of certain intellectual property rights resulting from our corporate structure reorganization completed in the first quarter of 2020.
Excluding the tax benefit related to our corporate structure reorganization and the related tax effects of stock-based compensation and other non-GAAP adjustments, the full year tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 17.6% compared to 22% for 2019. 2020 diluted EPS was $22.41. On a non-GAAP basis, 2020 diluted EPS was $5.25. Free cash flow was $507.3 million for 2020, down $90.3 million versus 2019.
Now let me turn to our outlook. Overall, we are very pleased with our Q4 performance and the strong momentum in our business, which has continued through January for both clear aligners and Systems and Services. As we discussed at our Investor Day in November, we are committed to making significant investments to drive growth, and we are seeing good return on these investments across all regions and customer channels.
These strong returns give us confidence to continue investing in sales, marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity to accelerate adoption in a huge under-penetrated market. These investments, coupled with typically higher seasonal operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, are expected to result in sequentially lower operating margin percent in Q1 as we have historically seen.
While the global operating environment surrounding the pandemic remains uncertain, we will continue to focus on what we can control, and we are confident in our ability to continue to execute. Our responsibility is to continue driving innovation and delivering on the needs of our customer, doctors and their patients.
Over the past 24 years, Align has invested billions in technology, innovation, consumer marketing and demand creation to connect millions of consumers with our doctor customers. We will continue to invest in this business to drive demand and drive adoption of the Align Digital Platform, including manufacturing and operational expansion. 
We will always be responsible. Just like we've done in the past, we make investments to drive growth and maximize ROI. We remain committed to our long-term target model of 20% to 30% revenue growth for clear aligners and Systems and Services and operating margin of 25% to 30%.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?"

The choices we made in 2020 to protect employees, support customers and press forward on our strategy for growth, were possible because of the strength of our balance sheet and the confidence we have in our business model.
Our actions reflect our conviction in the enormous opportunity we have to transform smiles and change lives. With 15 million orthodontic cases starts annually and more than 500 million consumers who can benefit from a better smile, the market for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry is massive and has been unleashed by the need for digital.
In a macro sense, COVID-19 has accentuated the benefits and pervasiveness of the digital economy. From an Align standpoint, practices across every region are embracing digital treatment in new ways and more purposefully than ever before. Invisalign providers are using our virtual tools to minimize in-office appointments and deliver doctor-directed personalized treatment that meets the needs of the moment, and that will reshape the future of treatment. 
Digital acceleration is not just around Invisalign treatment. It includes digital workflows around iTero scanners and general dentistry. Doctors tell us that the iTero scanner is central to their practice and their practice workflows, and it's key to driving digital treatment.
We've also known this, iTero and now exocad are core components of the Align Digital Platform. Our integrated suite of unique proprietary technologies and services delivered as a seamless end-to-end solution for patients and consumers, orthodontists and GP dentists and lab partners.
And particularly, we now have all the building blocks to create digital workflows, leveraging the combined power of Invisalign treatment, iTero scanners and exocad software to become more relevant to the GP market, which is critical to accessing the $500 million consumer opportunity.
Align is a growth business with huge opportunities, but the environment remains uncertain due to COVID-19. Our plan is still to counter uncertainty by staying focused on our long-term strategy, living our values, supporting our employees and customers and keeping in mind the demand drivers we've identified over the past year.
The redirection of disposable income for many consumers; channel focus that allows us to reach and support a wider range of customers within each channel; and most importantly, the digital mindset that's taking hold with more and more of our customers and that we are supporting through innovative products and programs that can help support their digital transformation.
We are not ignoring the reality of COVID-19 and how long it may be part of our lives. But we're also not going to stop driving the business forward for the good of the customers and their patients, our employees and our stakeholders.
In closing, I want to leave you with a few thoughts as we begin the new year. While there is considerable amount of turmoil in the world, our focus is on what we can control as a company. We have strong momentum. We'll stay focused on our strategic priorities, international expansion, patient demand and conversion, orthodontist utilization and GP dentist treatment.
In summary, we're very pleased with the fourth quarter and the full year results of 2020, during a remarkable year with events beyond our control as a result of COVID-19. It is during times such as this when having a solid strategy, combined with focused execution, can lead to outcomes that support growth, not only for Align's business, but also practice growth for Align's customers, which also leads to more and more Invisalign smiles.
With that, turn it over to the operator and we'll take calls."

I'll let the others maybe talk about the quarterly trends. But one of the things that kind of stood out to me was, you're driving extremely strong volume growth amidst what's kind of a stable to slightly declining pricing environment. Just curious first, when do you think you'll be able to go back to the kind of prior model where you're able to take pricing? Is that still in the cards?
And then secondly, I think the teen market is an area that we've kind of always been looking at as the next leg of growth, the kind of huge market that's out there and you're talking about some of the conversion and the lead generations. Can you help us understand some of the conversion rates around the leads that you generate in terms of timing and how long this takes to get the ROI that is put in to the advertising that you're putting out there?"
24568,700101935,2242020,"Align Technology, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Align Technology, Inc.","Executives","Ravi, first of all, I guess, your first question is on average selling prices.

We try to communicate this as strongly as we can is to keep your eyes on gross margin because we have huge mix, whether it's international mix or it's product mix, you see a lot of progress in iGo and products like Moderate and Invisalign First and those products. They carry actually lower average selling prices, but higher margins. And so you could often mix up on those things.
So I'd say, as we keep emphasizing, is don't be overly concerned about ASPs or focused on ASPs. Like John said, we didn't increase ASPs this year because we're interested in supporting our customers and making sure that this is difficult -- a really difficult transition for many practices right now and instituting a price increase just wouldn't have been responsible in that sense. 
But at the same time, we drove incredible productivity across the business, and we were able to show those kind of gross margins. So I hope you and the rest of the analyst community out there can actually see that. We've been talking about this for a few years, but actually taken place.
On the teen side, in the conversions from an advertising standpoint, I mean we come at this from a lot of different ways and a lot of different areas. And we -- if we're going to start teen season, you really have to start in February in the United States, and you have to really work through a lot of different aspects of social media. You advertise differently for moms than you do teens and different things like that. 
So I can't give you a correlation coefficient in the sense of here we invest and how much we get back. But we understand as well as a business. We've been doing it for years. We understand the timing of it and more and more we become more specific on the social advertising pieces and how to implement that properly. And John, do you have anything you want to add?"

Steve, the basic way to think about this is as we look at our revenue, we've got revenue on a new case that we ship out, and there's a certain amount that you recognize on that shipment based on our rev rec. And then there's a certain amount for future aligners or future modifications that are needed, that will be deferred revenue. 
And then you also get into your revenue, so those deferrals that you've made for maybe previous quarters or even previous year, that as they -- that doctor needs to use that additional aligners, you're going to get revenue for that.
When you have a mix like we have, where there's much more, there's a demand for future volume for new cases, you get a mix where we just have a lot more as a percentage of new cases and that's what impacts ASPs. When we look at that from a margin standpoint, it's margin accretive. 
We're getting that as new cases. Many of the cases that we get back from a deferred revenue standpoint, where there's refinements, we just don't make as much margin on that. You get the deferred revenue, but you don't get as much of the margin. So there's those dynamics that we have. We saw just when you have a significant volume increase like we saw in our third and fourth quarter."

But when we talk about that 500 million patients like I did in my script, that's where they are. And that's where you touch them. And it's a different -- it's not a big teen market. It's a lot of adults, but it has to have a workflow that's specific to a GP.
And that's why we drive our products. It's why iTero is so important from a front-end standpoint. Your question on exocad is we think that's going to be a big GP driver for us.

They're still doing impressions and different pieces. And so it's -- the growth has been tremendous in that sense. 
Your question about orthodontists that start to move up and do a significant part of their practice being Invisalign, you see a scanner at every chair. And they use these things constantly. It's part of what they do. 
And what we see on the GP segment is the communication tool ends up being the scanner and the front of the scanner. Because in the past, they'd hold up a mirror and say, Can you see that second molar back there and you'd say, yes, but you really couldn't, right?  Now you throw it on a screen, it's live. 
You can see exactly what's going on. It becomes an incredible patient communication tool in a sense of where is your dentition? What needs to be done? And it helps to convince patients of what the doctor wants to do and the validity of that kind of treatment. 
So that -- this is where dentistry is going. And when you look at iTero, it is arguably the highest performing scanner in the world, the speed of it, the exactness of it, color rendering and also with NIRI technology, be able to see caries or cavities is a real benefit. Even the orthodontist, who want to make sure that before you start the treatment that, that dentition is in good enough shape to be the -- accept that kind of movement.

And those people who had wires and brackets on their teeth can talk about their experience with Invisalign. So there's a lot of positives to it. And as Joe said, it started in Japan, and we've seen great success in the U.S., and we look to other places as well."

John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the full year. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. 
I'm pleased to report another strong quarter with record revenues and volumes reflecting strong growth for both Invisalign Clear Aligners and iTero Systems and Services across products and customer channels worldwide. Q1 sequential Invisalign Clear Aligner growth was driven by strength in both adult and teen market segments across products, customer channels, especially in North America and the EMEA region. The year is off to a great start, and Q1 reflects increasing momentum and the benefit from continued investments in our strategic initiatives focusing on: expanding our operations globally in existing and emerging international markets; increasing ortho adoption and utilization of Invisalign treatment, especially with teens; training and education GP dentists; and increasing conversion to Clear Aligners and building Invisalign brand preference with millions of consumers through advertising, PR, digital, social media and influencer marketing to drive demand and conversion through Invisalign-trained doctors. 
For Q1, total revenues were $894.8 million, up 72% sequentially and 62.4% year-over-year. Q1 System and Services were $141.5 million, up 5.8% sequentially and up 104% year-over-year. Q1 '21 Clear Aligner revenues of $753.3 million were up 7.5% sequentially, an increase of 56.4% year-over-year. In Q1, we shipped a record 595,800 Invisalign cases, an increase of 4.9% sequentially and 65.8% year-over-year. In addition, we shipped to a record 78,600 Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which approximately 6,600 were first-time customers. 
During the quarter, we reached a significant milestone with our 10 millionth Invisalign patient, Gabriela Silva, who recently began our treatment with Dr. Eunice Blind, an Invisalign-trained orthodontist in São Paulo, Brazil, one of our fastest-growing country markets. It's remarkable to think about the pace of growth and adoption that we are experiencing worldwide, especially we're considering it took 10 years to achieve our 1 millionth Invisalign patient milestone and now we're adding 1 million new Invisalign patients in less than 6 months. We're grateful to our doctor partners and their patients and to our 20,000 employees around the world who have helped us reach this milestone. 
In recognition of our 10 millionth Invisalign milestone, we have donated $10 million to the Align Foundation Donor advised fund, are kicking off a campaign called 10 Million Smiles, 10 Million Thanks centered around the transformative power of Invisalign treatment through the eyes of Invisalign patients. 
From a product perspective, Q1 Clear Aligner revenues reflect strong growth across the Invisalign portfolio for both comprehensive and noncomprehensive products. Q1 comp volume increased 4.9% sequentially and 62.3% year-over-year, and Q1 non-comp or noncomprehensive volume increased 5.0% sequentially and 74.4% year-over-year. Invisalign Clear Aligners address a wide range of case complexity and can treat approximately 90% of case starts for adults and teens and phase 1 treatment for kids as young as 6 years old. Q1 adult patients increased 5.8% sequentially and 68.5% year-over-year. Q1 teens or younger patients increased 2.7% sequentially, 58.9% year-over-year. Teenage cases made up nearly 75% of the 15 million ortho starts each year and despite our rapid growth in adoption, Invisalign treatment is still only single digits worldwide. So we continue to see significant runway here. 
Our strong Q1 results also reflect our multimillion-dollar consumer marketing investment across key media channels with broad reach to drive consumers to Invisalign doctor practices. Our teen and mom-focused consumer campaign generated 138% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our website and 35% increase in leads generated. In addition, Invisalign social media influencers like Charli D'Amelio, Avana Greg, Anton Franz and many others, content creators, influencers, enable a delivery of 4.2 billion impressions in Q1 '21, delivering exciting new content and increased engagement for the Invisalign brand among their millions of followers. 
The consumer insights and data we receive from our programs suggest adults are also continuing to invest more in themselves for their overall health and well-being and have more disposable income to do so. They are seeking Invisalign Clear Aligner treatment from our Invisalign doctors and sharing their positive experiences with their friends, family and social networks, becoming influencers themselves. 
Now let's turn to the specifics around our first quarter results, starting with the Americas. For the Americas region, Q1 was another strong quarter with Invisalign case volume up 8.4% sequentially and 53.8% year-over-year reflecting increased Invisalign submitters and utilization growth for both orthodontic and GP channels. Q1 results also reflect continued investment in digital marketing, sales programs, our channel focus around GPs, orthos and DSOs and other initiatives to help drive utilization. 
In the GP channel, Invisalign Moderate and Invisalign Go continue to gain traction. This was especially true for GP dentists that enrolled in the iPro program as well as doctors that have installed iTero scanners. The GP Accelerator program, designed exclusively for GPs, provides an all-encompassing support plan based on practice needs that is centered around maximizing iTero integration, clinical support needs and implementing new marketing strategies. DSO utilization also increased and continues to be a strong growth driver and outpaced non-DSO practices. 
Today, we announced that we have extended our relationship with DECA Dental Group and have signed a new multiyear agreement for the Invisalign System through early 2025. In addition, DECA Dental Group is extending utilization of iTero Element 5D imaging system across its affiliate practices in the United States. This provides DECA Dental doctors and clinical support team members with access to Align's customized clinical education for the Invisalign system and the iTero Element 5D imaging system to support practices in adopting new workflows for restorative dentistry and for digital orthodontics. 
In the ortho channel, the Team Awesomeness Centers program direct patients to Invisalign doctors who are experts are treating teams and are seen as the go-to doctors in their markets, helping to drive increased comprehensive treatments within the North American ortho channel. Tomorrow, registration opens for the 2021 Teen Form virtual edition to be held on June 10 and 11, which combines 2 days of all new dynamic sessions focused on the Invisalign teen patient journey. Sessions will focus on building clinical confidence, efficient workflows, teen and parent conversion and the overall digital treatment experience that teams expect. The timing of the forum is designed as a strong lead to the busy teen season. And attendees will have the option after post forum mentoring by Invisalign teen experts to help orthos and their staff apply the tools from the teen forum to their practices and get additional support through their busy summer. 
For our international business, Q1 Invisalign case volume was up sequentially 0.9%. On a year-over-year basis, international shipments were up 83.2%. In EMEA, Q1 volumes were sequentially 3.7%, up 74.9% year-over-year, with strong broad-based growth across all markets, led by the U.K., France and Italy, along with continued growth in our expansion markets, led by Turkey, Russia, CIS and Benelux. We also saw strong performance from both ortho and GP channels, with momentum in the GP channels with adults reflected in strong utilization in shipments from Invisalign Go. EMEA growth programs are customized by market and customers type to encourage Invisalign utilization, such as Professional 360 Ortho and Advance 360 Ortho programs with over 2,000 orthodontist enrolled. We also had GP Move 360, a program design to be able to help move doctors along their developmental journey, with an increase in GP cohorts of over 117% compared to a prior year. We're also continuing to offer online and on-demand education events, which have reached over 15,000 GPs cumulatively. 
In the region, we hosted several successful summits and forums for Invisalign doctors this quarter. In all virtual formats, the U.K. GP Forum and Ortho Summit, French Ortho Summit and the iTero Element Plus launch media event. In addition, we just held the Italian and Docker German Ortho Summit last week. International expansion remains one of our key strategic pillars. Last week, we announced plans to open a new manufacturing facility in Poland, which will be our first Aligner plant in the EMEA region  and our third plant worldwide joining Juarez, Mexico and Ziyang, China. The new facility is expected to be supplying customers in the EMEA region in early 2022, helping address the large and relatively untapped market of more than 5 million annual orthodontic case starts and more than 150 million EMEA customers who could benefit from treatment. The investment is part of our strategy to bring operational facilities closer to our customers and reflects our commitment to Invisalign train doctors and their patients in the EMEA region and extends our local operations in the region. 
The state-of-the-art EMEA plant in Wroclaw is expected to have more than 2,500 jobs by the end of 2025, making it the company's largest investment in EMEA to date and the largest 3D printing operation in the region. 
For APAC, Q1 volumes were down sequentially, 3.9% as expected, reflecting seasonality. On a year-over-year basis, APAC was up 101.3% compared to the prior year, reflecting continued strong growth across the region, led by China, Japan and ANZ. Invisalign volume growth drivers were young adults, with young kids ramping faster than any other age group. In the teen segment, Invisalign volumes accelerated during the quarter and were driven by increased Invisalign utilization and case submissions from Invisalign doctors. We also continue to see good adoption of the Invisalign Moderate product for noncomprehensive treatment in the GP channel. During the quarter, we continued to offer online and on-demand education events which reached over 14,000 GPs cumulatively. 
Invisalign volumes in China were flat sequentially and up over 200% year-over-year. In Q1, China volumes gained momentum throughout the quarter. The Aligned Clinical Education site is to go to digital hub for Invisalign doctors and team education and training. The digital learning environment was relaunched in February 2020 for Invisalign doctors, offering a comprehensive learning platform with role-specific content for orthos, GPs and their teams. The site enables more online learning opportunities with spotlight features for what's trending now, recommended learning paths based on doctors' experiences and expanded categories, including digital treatment planning, comprehensive dentistry and team education. 
During the quarter, over 102,000 unique users have assessed the records lecture, completed self-paced learning modules and watched how to videos, doing more than 3 million pages of learn content. On the ortho channel, over 38,000 unique users have engaged with a digital learning site and additional 63,000 unique users from the GP channel. 
We also continue to see good adoption of the ADAPT program which is an expert and independent fee-based business, consulting service offered by a line to optimize clinics operational workflow and processes to enhance patient experience, customer and staff satisfaction. As a result of the ADAPT service, practices experience higher growth and greater efficiencies for orthodontic practices as well as improved profitability after implementation. To date, we've seen a 50% increase in Invisalign cases among doctors' cohorts within 6 months of participation in the ADAPT program. In addition, while still early in the program, we're also seeing a strong correlation or halo effect on team utilization among adapt doctor cohorts. 
On consumer marketing, this focuses on educating consumers about the Invisalign system and driving that demand to our Invisalign doctor offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles. In Q1, we continue to see strong digital engagement globally with more than 138% increase in unique visitors, 95% increase in doctor locator searches and 35% increase in leads created on a year-over-year basis, driven by our global adult and mom-focused campaigns and teen-focused influencer content, our U.S. mom/teen multitouch, multimillion-dollar campaign with influencer-led YouTube videos, among focused TV spot a custom Twitch activation and mega teen sensations such as Charli D'Amelio and Yvonne Greg continued to perform well and garnered 4.2 billion impressions in Q1. 
The statistics I shared previously speak to the continued success this marketing campaign is having to not only drive demand with consumers but also educate them on the benefits of Invisalign treatment through a doctor's office. The Align digital platform continues to gain traction globally. Our consumer and patient app, My Invisalign is now available in 58 markets, resulting in a more than 4x increase in app downloads and 3x increase in patients actively using our app in Q1 '21 versus the same period a year ago. Our consumer and patient feature usage continues to increase, for example, Invisalign Virtual Appointment Tool was used 86,000 times and our insurance verification feature was used 27,000 times in Q1. Further, we received more than 575,000 patient photos in our Virtual Care feature to date globally, providing us rich data to leverage our AI capabilities to improve our services for doctors and patients. 
Lastly, our new consumer website has been rolled out to more than 50 markets and continues to drive increased effectiveness in lead creation. In the EMEA region, we built on the tremendous success we saw with the consumer marketing pilot in Q4 in the U.K. and expanded our media investments across the U.K., Germany and France, to driving engagements resulting in more than 335% increase in unique visitors and a 95% increase in leads. We also expanded our consumer advertising in the APAC region in Australia, Japan and China, and saw more than a 2,000% increase in consumer engagement and a 298% increase in leads. Several key metrics that show increased activity engagement with Invisalign brand are included in our Q1 quarterly presentation slides available on our website. 
Our NFL partnership continues to do well, generating over 23.5 million impressions during the quarter. It continues to be another major integral channel to reach adults considering Clear Aligner treatment through an Invisalign-trained doctor. During the quarter, we expanded our sports partnership marketing strategy with the Invisalign brand named the Official Smile Partner of the Golden State Warriors. As part of the agreement with the 6x NBA Champion Golden State Warriors, the Invisalign brand also, the official smile partner of the Santa Cruz Warriors, the Golden Stage G League affiliate and the Golden Guardians, its e-sport affiliate. The sponsorship includes an omnichannel activation across TV, digital media, social, a Jersey partnership with the Golden Guardians and the Santa Cruz Warriors. 
Finally, on the consumer marketing front, we also launched our first ever social purpose initiative in Q1 called Invisalign Change Makers, an award program, we developed in partnership with a national 4H council, this is to celebrate and highlight teams in making impact in their communities. We were blown away by the number of recommendations and stories we received about teens from redistributing excess food to combat hunger in their communities, to donating weighted blankets to those in the autism spectrum. Overall, it's been heartwarming to learn about each of these amazing teenagers who bring a unique approach to positively impacting their communities and following their passions to create change. 
In total, received nearly 800 Change-Maker applications on June 28, we will announce 100 winners, each of whom will receive 5,000 to help them continue their goodwill efforts. We'll also celebrate these young forces of change with a virtual ceremony currently slated for mid-July. 
We are continuing to invest in creating consumer demand for Invisalign Aligners in markets around the world, our global campaigns include a multichannel media strategy using digital video, social media, influencer marketing and TV. 
For our Systems and Services business, Q1 revenues were up 5.8% sequentially, reflecting slightly lower scanner volume following a record fourth quarter. This is primarily due to the seasonality of capital equipment sales at year-end and higher services revenue. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenues were up 104% and reflecting strong scanner shipments and services. The iTero Element 5D Imaging System continues to gain traction across all regions. Element 5D is the first integrated dental imaging system that simultaneously records 3D inter-oral optical impressions, 2D color images and near infrared technology or NIRI technology. Full scans can be completed in as little as 60 seconds and NIRI technology scans a structure of the tooth in real-time without harm for radiation, acting as digital aid for detection of interproximal caries or cavities above the gingiva line. 
In APAC, the Element Flex is doing well with its wand-only configuration that provides needed mobility, so doctors can see patients anywhere they choose and also or perform full art scans and even the smallest office. During the quarter, we announced availability of the iTero Element Plus series, which expands the iTero portfolio to serve a broad range of the dental market. The new Element Plus series offers faster processing time, advanced visualization capabilities for a seamless scanning experience in a new sleek ergonomically-designed package. It's also engineered with the latest computing power, a dedicated AI chip and new AI-based features as well as an easy upgrade path for future innovation. 
In terms of digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions in Q1, total digital scans increased to 80.9% from 75.8% in Q1 last year. International scans increased to 75.1%, up from 68.7% in the same quarter last year. For the Americas, 85.5% of the case is submitted digitally compared to 80.5% a year ago. Cumulatively, over 35.4 million orthodontic scans and 7.5 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. 
Turning to exocad, a year ago in April, we welcome exocad in to the Align family. I want to thank the entire team for their continued progress on integration and road map development. Together, we are working to extend exocad's position as a key technology provider for the dental CAD/CAM industry and to drive continuous innovation with the open and integrated approach that is the foundation of exocad. 
During Q1, the new release of exocad's DentalCAD 3D Galway was successfully rolled out globally with very positive customer feedback, a record number of over 70,000 verified prosthetic components we created in DentalCAD Galway, one of the largest prosthetic libraries in the industry. exocad also reached a new milestone for the exoplan database, which now supports nearly 10,000 implants from over 90 manufacturers. The new release also includes a unique and highly innovative DentalCAD feature, instant anatomic morphine that reduces design time by up 30% compared to previous version. It also includes new AI technology for exocad smile creator, which enables time-saving, automatic detection of facial features. 
In addition, the new My iTero Connector was launched directly to exocad Labs. The my iTero Connector creates an easy and integrated way to receive inter-oral scan cases from thousands of iTero doctors worldwide. New cases are downloaded automatically and will show up directly in the dental DB case list. 
exocad also cohosted a joint dentistry event in the U.K. to showcase full workflow with Chairside titled Digital Dentistry Hands On, a virtual roadshow and that general dentist showcases a full digital workflow for the clinical environment with Chairside CAD, exocad's complete open architecture CAD software platform for single-visit dentistry. Hosted by Dr. Gilson Margery, the participants of the roadshow series learned how to use the software for single visit restorations and implant planning and a dental practice along the entire digital dentistry workflow. 
These are just a few milestones, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead to shape the dental industry with technology and expertise that benefits all customers, labs, partners and users. We look forward to sharing more about ongoing exocad developments. With that, I'll now turn it over to John."

Total revenues for the first quarter were $894.8 million, up 7.2% from the prior quarter and up 62.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For Clear Aligners, Q1 revenues of $753.3 million were up 7.5",1777,"Thanks, Joe. 
Now for our Q1 financial results. Total revenues for the first quarter were $894.8 million, up 7.2% from the prior quarter and up 62.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For Clear Aligners, Q1 revenues of $753.3 million were up 7.5% sequentially and up 56.4% year-over-year, reflecting Invisalign volume growth in most geographies. Clear Aligner revenue's growth was favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $14.4 million or approximately 2.1 points sequentially and on a year-over-year basis, by approximately $22.3 million or approximately 4.6 points. 
For Q1, Invisalign comprehensive and non-comprehensive ASPs were both up sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 Invisalign comprehensive and non-comprehensive ASP decreased. Overall, on a sequential and year-over-year basis, ASPs were favorably impacted by foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, ASPs were impacted by higher net revenue deferrals in all regions and higher promotional discounts. Clear Aligner deferred revenue on the balance sheet increased $79 million sequentially and $256 million year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. 
Total Q1 clear aligner shipments of 595,800 cases were up 4.9% sequentially and and up 65.8% year-over-year. 
Our Systems and Services revenues for the first quarter was a record $141.5 million, up 5.8% sequentially and due to product mix and increased services revenues from our larger installed base and exocad's CAD/CAM services. Year-over-year, systems and services revenues was up 104% and due to higher scanner shipments and services and the inclusion of exocad's CAD/CAM services from the April 2020 acquisition and increased services from our larger installed base. 
Our Systems and Services deferred revenue was up 17% sequentially and up 102% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. 
Moving on to gross margin. First quarter overall gross margin was 75.7%, up 2.5 points sequentially and up 4.1 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition, overall gross margin was 76.1% for the first quarter and up 2.5 points sequentially and up 4.2 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately 0.5 points sequentially and 0.7 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. 
Clear Aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 77.6%, up 2.7 points sequentially due to increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes, higher ASPs and lower freight, partially offset by higher additional aligner volume. Clear Aligner gross margin was up 4.6 points year-over-year due to increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes and lower freight, partially offset by lower ASPs. 
Systems and Services gross margin for the first quarter was a record 65.4%, up 1.2 points sequentially, primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes and higher ASPs, partially offset by increased freight. Systems and Services gross margin was up 3.6 points year-over-year due to manufacturing efficiencies from increased volume, higher ASPs and services revenues. 
Q1 operating expenses were $451.7 million, up sequentially 13.7% and up 39.2% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating expenses is due to increased compensation, primarily from additional headcount and incentive compensation, consumer marketing spend and other general and administrative costs. Year-over-year operating expenses increased by $127.2 million, reflecting our continued investment in sales and R&D activities and investments commensurate with business growth. 
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition and acquisition costs related to our exocad acquisition, operating expenses were $424.8 million, up sequentially 14.1% and up 40.9% year-over-year. Our first quarter operating income of $225.4 million resulted in an operating margin of 25.2%, down 0.3 points sequentially and up 12.5 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin is attributed to operational investments. The year-over-year increase in operating margin are primarily attributed to higher gross margin and operating leverage. 
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles, the acquisition costs related to our exocad acquisition, operating margin for the first quarter was 28.6%, down 0.4 points sequentially and up 11.5 points year-over-year. Our operating margin was favorably impacted by approximately 0.8 points sequentially and 1.5 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. 
Interest and other income and expense net for the first quarter was a gain of $36.2 million, primarily driven by the SEC arbitration award gain. Excluding the SEC arbitration award gain, interest and other income and expense net was a $7.2 million expense on a non-GAAP basis. 
With regards to the first quarter tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was 23.4%, which includes tax expense of approximately $11 million related to U.S. taxes on the STC arbitration award received and approximately $14 million of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our GAAP tax rate this quarter was lower than the prior quarter rate of 25.9%, primarily due to the higher excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by foreign income taxes at different rates. 
Our GAAP tax rate was higher than the same quarter last year, which was negative 2,745%, primarily due to a onetime tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion associated with our corporate structure reorganization completed during the first quarter of 2020. The first quarter tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 20.2% compared to 14.5% in prior quarter and 33.2% in the prior year. The first quarter non-GAAP tax rate was higher than the prior quarter rate, primarily due to lower tax benefits from foreign income tax at different rates. In comparison to prior year, the non-GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was lower primarily due to higher tax benefits from foreign income tax at different rates. 
First quarter net income per diluted share was $2.51, up $0.51 sequentially and down $16.70 compared to prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.49 for the first quarter, down $0.12 sequentially and up $1.76 year-over-year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. As of March 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 billion, an increase of approximately $170.9 million from the prior quarter, which is primarily due to cash flow from operations. Of our $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $684.4 million was held in the U.S. and $447.3 million was held by our international entities. 
Q1 accounts receivable balance was $719 million, up approximately 9.3% sequentially. Our overall day sales outstanding was 72 days, up approximately 1 day sequentially and down approximately 15 days as compared to Q1 last year. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $227.2 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $43.4 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $183.8 million. 
We also have $300 million available under our revolving line of credit. Under our May 2018 repurchase program, we have $100 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock. 
Now let me turn to our outlook. Overall, we are very pleased with our first quarter results and our continued strong momentum across regions and customer channels. It has been over a year since the pandemic began, and I want to briefly recap the actions we took to support our employees by protecting employee jobs and salaries and by supporting our customers with PPE, extended payment terms, training and many other areas of assistance. 
Instead of going quiet, we accelerated our investments in marketing to drive consumer demand to our doctors' offices and stay top of mind with consumers. We accelerated our digital technology investments so that we could provide virtual tools to our doctors, enabling them to stay connected with their patients and keep their treatment moving forward. We continue to grow the business, increased our investments in R&D and product innovation and developing our plans for manufacturing expansion in EMEA. We did all these things for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders because we believe in the industry and the size of the market opportunity. Our results are the outcome of our conviction in our business model, focus and ability to execute. 
While there continues to be uncertainty around the pandemic and global environment, the strength in our business reflects the purposeful decisions we made through the pandemic and fuels our confidence in continuing to invest into growth to drive demand and conversion globally. 
Q2 is off to a great start and momentum has continued through April. Consumer demand trends and patient traffic across the dental industry are favorable and continue to improve. Given these factors and the positive trends we continue to see across the business, we believe it is important to share our current outlook and provide guidance for the full year. Note that the outlook we are providing does not reflect any potential significant disruption or additional costs related to any supply constraints. 
With that, let's turn to our full year 2021 outlook and the factors that have formed our view. We have growing confidence in our digital platform and how it is driving growth across all regions and market segments. We expect 2021 revenues of $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion, up 50% to 58% year-over-year. Consistent with past years, we expect second half revenue to make up more than half of the full year revenue and our second half revenue to grow year-over-year around the midpoint of our long-term operating model target of 20% to 30%. 
As discussed during our last earnings call, we are increasing our investments in sales, marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity to continue to drive our growth programs and accelerate adoption in a vastly underpenetrated market. On a GAAP basis, we anticipate 2021 and operating margin to be between 23.5% and 24.5%. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect 2021 operating margin to be approximately 3 points higher than our GAAP operating margin after excluding stock-based compensation and intangible amortization. 
In addition, during Q2 '21, we expect to repurchase $100 million of our common stock through either open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement we intend to enter into on or prior to May 3, 2021. The repurchase is intended to complete the $600 million stock repurchase authorization announced on May 23, 2018. 
For 2021, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $300 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. This includes our planned investment in a new manufacturing facility in Wroclaw, Poland, our first one in the EMEA region. We intend to fund these needs with cash generated from operations. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?"

In summary, we're very pleased with the first quarter results of 2021.

In summary, we're very pleased with the first quarter results of 2021. Our strong growth and continued momentum reflect our strategic initiatives and investments, including support for doctors to ensure treatment and business continuity, ramping availability of virtual tools to keep doctors and patients connected throughout treatment, and increased consumer marketing and concierge programs. The benefits of digital treatment and digital tools and the limitations of outdated old analog approaches continue to drive adoption of Invisalign Clear Aligners and iTero scanners and services. Over the past year, more doctors have experienced Align's digital platform, which made it possible for thousands of Invisalign practices and patients to continue treatments throughout global disruption, thanks to Invisalign aligners, digital treatment planning, virtual monitoring and care as well as by iTero scanners. 
But the shift from traditional analog wires and brackets to a fully end-to-end digital platform is not easy, cannot be done without very complex technology. And this technology is prevalent, touching every aspect of what we do from manufacturing excellence where we currently manufacture over 700,000 unique aligners per day to expanding our geographic footprint to over 100 markets to building a network of over 200,000 trained Invisalign doctors and providing the technology to our doctors in a complete digital system, the Aligned Digital platform. 
As the market leader in the Clear Aligner space, we have been building this industry over 24 years to get to where it is today. And yet the majority of the market opportunity remains largely untapped. With over 500 million potential case starts globally, Align is in a rare position to address this market with the Aligned Digital Platform, powered by 2 decades of clinical data based on more than 10.2 million patients with AI machine learning and digital tools to help our doctors efficiently communicate with their patients, show and explain any issues and visualize potential treatment outcomes. And together with doctors, we're going to leverage the power of digital dentistry and orthodontics more than ever. 
We remain focused on our strategic execution, agility, customer service excellence and continuing to make investments to grow our business to drive utilization of the Invisalign system, ultimately returning value to our shareholders. This is the multi-variable equation that we talk about and there's no other company in the market today that has all these capabilities combined. 
Finally, throughout the pandemic, our priority has been the health and safety of our employees and their families and our doctor customers and their staff, and that has not changed. We remain dedicated to the well being, and I want to reiterate our commitment to all Invisalign practices and our employees around the world, especially those in areas recently affected by a surge in COVID-19: India, Brazil, France, Poland, Ukraine, Mexico, Thailand and Japan. We are continuing to monitor the situations and are providing support and resources to those impacted employees. 
Thanks for your time today. I look forward to updating you on our progress as the year unfolds. Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator."

So I feel we have an incredible advantage. You look at SmartTrack, we look to highly initiate that with over 4 million lines of codes that we have in ClinCheck.

It was -- it's not 1 or 2 doctors doing this. There's hundreds, if not thousands, that are doing incredible kinds of cases. And so -- which I think that more and more, it just lends credibility to this product line, it can do what we say now, 90% of all the cases that are out there. That's not just because it's plastic, right? It is the whole system from how we 3D print, what plastic we can use, the algorithms we use, how we constantly tweak it by the information that we have, driving a brand like this, having the kind of training.

John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook for the full year. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. 
I'm pleased to report another strong quarter with record revenues and volumes reflecting strong growth for both Invisalign Clear Aligners and iTero Systems and Services across products and customer channels worldwide. Q1 sequential Invisalign Clear Aligner growth was driven by strength in both adult and teen market segments across products, customer channels, especially in North America and the EMEA region. The year is off to a great start, and Q1 reflects increasing momentum and the benefit from continued investments in our strategic initiatives focusing on: expanding our operations globally in existing and emerging international markets; increasing ortho adoption and utilization of Invisalign treatment, especially with teens; training and education GP dentists; an increasing conversion to Clear Aligners; and building Invisalign brand preference with millions of consumers through advertising, PR, digital, social media and influencer marketing to drive demand and conversion through Invisalign-trained doctors. 
For Q1, total revenues were $894.8 million, up 7.2% sequentially and 62.4% year-over-year. Q1 System and Services were $141.5 million, up 5.8% sequentially and up 104% year-over-year. Q1 '21 Clear Aligner revenues of $753.3 million were up 7.5% sequentially and increased of 56.4% year-over-year. 
In Q1, we shipped a record 595,800 Invisalign cases, an increase of 4.9% sequentially and 65.8% year-over-year. In addition, we shipped to a record 78,600 Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which approximately 6,600 were first-time customers. 
During the quarter, we reached a significant milestone with our 10 millionth Invisalign patient, Gabriela Silva, who recently began our treatment with Dr. Eunice Blind, an Invisalign-trained orthodontist in São Paulo, Brazil, one of our fastest-growing country markets. It's remarkable to think about the pace of growth and adoption that we are experiencing worldwide, especially when considering it took 10 years to achieve our 1 millionth Invisalign patient milestone and now we're adding 1 million new Invisalign patients in less than 6 months. We're grateful to our doctor partners and their patients and to our 20,000 employees around the world who have helped us reach this milestone. 
In recognition of our 10 millionth Invisalign milestone, we have donated $10 million to the Align Foundation donor-advised fund, are kicking off a campaign called 10 Million Smiles, 10 Million Thanks centered around the transformative power of Invisalign treatment through the eyes of Invisalign patients. 
From a product perspective, Q1 clear aligner revenues reflect strong growth across the Invisalign portfolio for both comprehensive and noncomprehensive products. Q1 comp volume increased 4.9% sequentially and 62.3% year-over-year, and Q1 non-comp or noncomprehensive volume increased 5.0% sequentially and 74.4% year-over-year. Invisalign Clear Aligners address a wide range of case complexity and can treat approximately 90% of case starts for adults and teens and phase 1 treatment for kids as young as 6 years old. Q1 adult patients increased 5.8% sequentially and 68.5% year-over-year. Q1 teens or younger patients increased 2.7% sequentially, 58.9% year-over-year. Teenage cases made up nearly 75% of the 15 million ortho starts each year and despite our rapid growth and adoption, Invisalign treatment is still only single digits worldwide, so we continue to see significant runway here. 
Our strong Q1 results also reflect our multimillion-dollar consumer marketing investment across key media channels with broad reach to drive consumers to Invisalign doctor practices. Our teen and mom-focused consumer campaign generated 138% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our website and 35% increase in leads generated. In addition, Invisalign social media influencers like Charli D'Amelio, Avani Gregg, and Tan France and many other content creators/influencers enabled a delivery of 4.2 billion impressions in Q1 '21, delivering exciting new content and increased engagement for the Invisalign brand among their millions of followers. 
The consumer insights and data we receive from our programs suggest adults are also continuing to invest more in themselves for their overall health and well-being and have more disposable income to do so. They are seeking Invisalign clear aligner treatment from our Invisalign doctors and sharing their positive experiences with their friends, family and social networks, becoming influencers themselves. 
Now let's turn to the specifics around our first quarter results, starting with the Americas. For the Americas region, Q1 was another strong quarter with Invisalign case volume up 8.4% sequentially and 53.8% year-over-year reflecting increased Invisalign submitters and utilization growth for both orthodontic and GP channels. Q1 results also reflect continued investment in digital marketing, sales programs, our channel focus around GPs, orthos and DSOs and other initiatives to help drive utilization. 
In the GP channel, Invisalign Moderate and Invisalign Go continue to gain traction. This was especially true for GP dentists that enrolled in the iPro program as well as doctors that have installed iTero scanners. The GP Accelerator program, designed exclusively for GPs, provides an all-encompassing support plan based on practice needs that is centered around maximizing iTero integration, clinical support needs and implementing new marketing strategies. DSO utilization also increased and continues to be a strong growth driver and outpaced non-DSO practices. 
Today, we announced that we have extended our relationship with DECA Dental Group and have signed a new multiyear agreement for the Invisalign System through early 2025. In addition, DECA Dental Group is extending utilization of iTero Element 5D imaging system across its affiliate practices in the United States. This provides DECA Dental doctors and clinical support team members with access to Align's customized clinical education for the Invisalign system and the iTero Element 5D imaging system to support practices in adopting new workflows for restorative dentistry and for digital orthodontics. 
In the ortho channel, the Teen Awesomeness Centers program direct patients to Invisalign doctors who are experts are treating teens and are seen as the go-to doctors in their markets, helping to drive increased comprehensive treatments within the North American ortho channel. Tomorrow, registration opens for the 2021 Teen Forum: Virtual Edition to be held on June 10 and 11, which combines 2 days of all new dynamic sessions focused on the Invisalign teen patient journey. Sessions will focus on building clinical confidence, efficient workflows, teen and parent conversion and the overall digital treatment experience that teens expect. The timing of the forum is designed as a strong lead to the busy teen season, and attendees will have the option, at the post forum mentoring by Invisalign teen experts, to help orthos and their staff apply the tools from the teen forum to their practices and get additional support through their busy summer. 
For our international business, Q1 Invisalign case volume was up sequentially 0.9%. On a year-over-year basis, international shipments were up 83.2%. In EMEA, Q1 volumes were sequentially 3.7%, up 74.9% year-over-year, with strong broad-based growth across all markets, led by the U.K., France and Italy, along with continued growth in our expansion markets, led by Turkey, Russia, CIS and Benelux. We also saw strong performance from both ortho and GP channels, with momentum in the GP channels with adults reflected in strong utilization in shipments from Invisalign Go. 
EMEA growth programs are customized by market and customers' type to encourage Invisalign utilization, such as Professional 360 Ortho and Advance 360 Ortho programs with over 2,000 orthodontist enrolled. We also had GP Move 360, a program design to be able to help move doctors along their developmental journey, with an increase in GP cohorts of over 117% compared to a prior year. We're also continuing to offer online and on-demand education events, which have reached over 15,000 GPs cumulatively. 
In the region, we hosted several successful summits and forums for Invisalign doctors this quarter in all-virtual formats: the U.K. GP Forum and Ortho Summit, French Ortho Summit and the iTero Element Plus launch media event. In addition, we just held the Italian and DACH or German Ortho Summits last week. 
International expansion remains one of our key strategic pillars. Last week, we announced plans to open a new manufacturing facility in Poland, which will be our first Aligner plant in the EMEA region and our third plant worldwide joining Juarez, Mexico and Ziyang, China. The new facility is expected to be supplying customers in the EMEA region in early 2022, helping address the large and relatively untapped market of more than 5 million annual orthodontic case starts and more than 150 million EMEA customers who could benefit from treatment. The investment is part of our strategy to bring operational facilities closer to our customers and reflects our commitment to Invisalign-trained doctors and their patients in the EMEA region and extends our local operations in the region. 
The state-of-the-art EMEA plant in Wroclaw is expected to have more than 2,500 jobs by the end of 2025, making it the company's largest investment in EMEA to date and the largest 3D printing operation in the region. 
For APAC, Q1 volumes were down sequentially 3.9% as expected, reflecting seasonality. On a year-over-year basis, APAC was up 101.3% compared to the prior year, reflecting continued strong growth across the region, led by China, Japan and ANZ. Invisalign volume growth drivers were young adults, with young kids ramping faster than any other age group. In the teen segment, Invisalign volumes accelerated during the quarter and were driven by increased Invisalign utilization and case submissions from Invisalign doctors. We also continue to see good adoption of the Invisalign Moderate product for noncomprehensive treatment in the GP channel. During the quarter, we continued to offer online and on-demand education events which reached over 14,000 GPs cumulatively. 
Invisalign volumes in China were flat sequentially and up over 200% year-over-year. In Q1, China volumes gained momentum throughout the quarter. The Align clinical education site is the go-to digital hub for Invisalign doctors and team education and training. The digital learning environment was relaunched in February 2020 for Invisalign doctors, offering a comprehensive learning platform with role-specific content for orthos, GPs and their teams. The site enables more online learning opportunities with spotlight features for what's trending now, recommended learning paths based on doctors' experiences and expanded categories, including digital treatment planning, comprehensive dentistry and team education. 
During the quarter, over 102,000 unique users, having accessed the records lecture, completed self-paced learning modules and watched how-to videos, viewing more than 3 million pages of learning content. On the Ortho channel, over 38,000 unique users have engaged with a digital learning site and additional 63,000 unique users from the GP channel. 
We also continue to see good adoption of the ADAPT program, which is an expert and independent fee-based business consulting service offered by Align to optimize clinics' operational workflow and processes to enhance patient experience, customer and staff satisfaction. As a result of the ADAPT service, practices experience higher growth and greater efficiencies for orthodontic practices as well as improved profitability after implementation. To date, we've seen a 50% increase in Invisalign cases among doctors' cohorts within 6 months of participation in the ADAPT program. In addition, while still early in the program, we're also seeing a strong correlation or halo effect on teen utilization among ADAPT doctor cohorts. 
On consumer marketing, this focuses on educating consumers about the Invisalign system and driving that demand to our Invisalign doctor offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles. 
In Q1, we continue to see strong digital engagement globally with more than 138% increase in unique visitors, 95% increase in doctor locator searches and 35% increase in leads created on a year-over-year basis, driven by our global adult and mom-focused campaigns and teen-focused influencer content. Our U.S. Mom/Teen multitouch, multimillion-dollar campaign with influencer-led YouTube videos, a mom-focused TV spot, a custom Twitch activation and mega teen sensations such as Charli D'Amelio and Avani Gregg continued to perform well and garnered 4.2 billion impressions in Q1. 
The statistics I shared previously speak to the continued success this marketing campaign is having to not only drive demand with consumers but also educate them on the benefits of Invisalign treatment through a doctor's office. 
The Align Digital Platform continues to gain traction globally. Our consumer and patient app, My Invisalign, is now available in 58 markets, resulting in a more than 4x increase in app downloads and 3x increase in patients actively using our app in Q1 '21 versus the same period a year ago. Our consumer and patient feature usage continues to increase. For example, Invisalign Virtual Appointment Tool was used 86,000 times and our insurance verification feature was used 27,000 times in Q1. Further, we received more than 575,000 patient photos in our Virtual Care feature to date globally, providing us rich data to leverage our AI capabilities to improve our services for doctors and patients. 
Lastly, our new consumer website has been rolled out to more than 50 markets and continues to drive increased effectiveness in lead creation. In the EMEA region, we built on the tremendous success we saw with the consumer marketing pilot in Q4 in the U.K. and expanded our media investments across the U.K., Germany and France to drive engagements, resulting in more than 335% increase in unique visitors and a 95% increase in leads. 
We also expanded our consumer advertising in the APAC region in Australia, Japan and China, and saw more than a 2,000% increase in consumer engagement and a 298% increase in leads. Several key metrics that show increased activity engagement with Invisalign brand are included in our Q1 quarterly presentation slides available on our website. 
Our NFL partnership continues to do well, generating over 23.5 million impressions during the quarter. It continues to be another major integral channel to reach adults considering clear aligner treatment through an Invisalign-trained doctor. During the quarter, we expanded our sports partnership marketing strategy with the Invisalign brand named the official smile partner of the Golden State Warriors. As part of the agreement with the 6x NBA Champion Golden State Warriors, the Invisalign brand also is the official smile partner of the Santa Cruz Warriors, the Golden State's G League affiliate, and the Golden Guardians, its e-sport affiliate. The sponsorship includes an omnichannel activation across TV, digital media, social, a jersey partnership with the Golden Guardians and the Santa Cruz Warriors. 
Finally, on the consumer marketing front, we also launched our first ever social purpose initiative in Q1 called Invisalign ChangeMakers, an award program we developed in partnership with the National 4-H Council. This is to celebrate and highlight teens in making an impact in their communities. We were blown away by the number of recommendations and stories we received about teens, from redistributing excess food to combat hunger in their communities, to donating weighted blankets to those in the autism spectrum. Overall, it's been heartwarming to learn about each of these amazing teenagers who bring a unique approach to positively impacting their communities and following their passions to create change. 
In total, we received nearly 800 ChangeMaker (sic) [ ChangeMakers ] applications. On June 28, we will announce 100 winners, each of whom will receive $5,000 to help them continue their goodwill efforts. We'll also celebrate these young forces of change with a virtual ceremony currently slated for mid-July.
We are continuing to invest in creating consumer demand for Invisalign Aligners in markets around the world. Our global campaigns include a multichannel media strategy using digital video, social media, influencer marketing and TV. 
For our Systems and Services business, Q1 revenues were up 5.8% sequentially, reflecting slightly lower scanner volume following a record fourth quarter. This is primarily due to the seasonality of capital equipment sales at year-end and higher services revenue. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenues were up 104%, reflecting strong scanner shipments and services. 
The iTero Element 5D Imaging System continues to gain traction across all regions. Element 5D is the first integrated dental imaging system that simultaneously records 3D intra-oral optical impressions, 2D color images and Near Infrared technology (sic) [ Near Infrared Images ] or NIRI technology. Full arch scans can be completed in as little as 60 seconds, and NIRI technology scans the structure of the tooth in real-time without harmful radiation, acting as digital aid for detection of interproximal caries, or cavities, above the gingiva line. 
In APAC, the Element Flex is doing well with its wand-only configuration that provides needed mobility so doctors can see patients anywhere they choose and also or perform full arch scans in even the smallest office. 
During the quarter, we announced availability of the iTero Element Plus series, which expands the iTero portfolio to serve a broad range of the dental market. The new Element Plus series offers faster processing time, advanced visualization capabilities for a seamless scanning experience in a new sleek ergonomically-designed package. It's also engineered with the latest computing power, a dedicated AI chip and new AI-based features as well as an easy upgrade path for future innovation. 
In terms of digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions in Q1, total digital scans increased to 80.9% from 75.8% in Q1 last year. International scans increased to 75.1%, up from 68.7% in the same quarter last year. For the Americas, 85.5% of the cases submitted digitally compared to 80.5% a year ago. Cumulatively, over 35.4 million orthodontic scans and 7.5 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. 
Turning to exocad. A year ago in April, we welcomed exocad into the Align family. I want to thank the entire team for their continued progress on integration and road map development. Together, we are working to extend exocad's position as a key technology provider for the dental CAD/CAM industry and to drive continuous innovation with the open and integrated approach that is the foundation of exocad. 
During Q1, the new release of exocad's DentalCAD 3D (sic) [ DentalCAD3.0 ] Galway was successfully rolled out globally with very positive customer feedback. A record number of over 70,000 verified prosthetic components were created in DentalCAD Galway, one of the largest prosthetic libraries in the industry. 
exocad also reached a new milestone for the exoplan database, which now supports nearly 10,000 implants from over 90 manufacturers. The new release also includes a unique and highly innovative DentalCAD feature, Instant Anatomic Morphing, that reduces design time by up to 30% compared to previous version. It also includes new AI technology for exocad's Smile Creator, which enables time-saving automatic detection of facial features. 
In addition, the new MyiTero Connector was launched directly to exocad labs. The MyiTero Connector creates an easy and integrated way to receive intra-oral scan cases from thousands of iTero doctors worldwide. New cases are downloaded automatically and will show up directly in the DentalDB case list. 
exocad also co-hosted a joint dentistry event in the U.K. to showcase full workflow with chairside (sic) [ ChairsideCAD ] titled Digital Dentistry Hands On. The virtual roadshow aimed at general dentists showcases a full digital workflow for the clinical environment with ChairsideCAD, exocad's complete open architecture CAD software platform for single-visit dentistry. Hosted by Dr. Gulshan Murgai, the participants of the roadshow series learn how to use the software for single-visit restorations and implant planning in the dental practice along the entire digital dentistry workflow. 
These are just a few milestones, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead to shape the dental industry with technology and expertise that benefits all customers, labs, partners and users. We look forward to sharing more about ongoing exocad developments. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to John."
24568,710056018,2261819,"Align Technology, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Align Technology, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q1 financial results. Total revenues for the first quarter were $894.8 million, up 7.2% from the prior quarter and up 62.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For Clear Aligners, Q1 revenues of $753.3 million were up 7.5",1773,"Thanks, Joe. 
Now for our Q1 financial results. Total revenues for the first quarter were $894.8 million, up 7.2% from the prior quarter and up 62.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For Clear Aligners, Q1 revenues of $753.3 million were up 7.5% sequentially and up 56.4% year-over-year, reflecting Invisalign volume growth in most geographies. Clear Aligner revenue growth was favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $14.4 million or approximately 2.1 points sequentially and on a year-over-year basis, by approximately $22.3 million or approximately 4.6 points. 
For Q1, Invisalign Comprehensive and Non-Comprehensive ASPs were both up sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 Invisalign Comprehensive and Non-Comprehensive ASP decreased. Overall, on a sequential and year-over-year basis, ASPs were favorably impacted by foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, ASPs were impacted by higher net revenue deferrals in all regions and higher promotional discounts. 
Clear aligner deferred revenue on the balance sheet increased $79 million sequentially and $256 million year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Total Q1 clear aligner shipments of 595,800 cases were up 4.9% sequentially and up 65.8% year-over-year. 
Our Systems and Services revenues for the first quarter was a record $141.5 million, up 5.8% sequentially due to product mix and increased services revenues from our larger installed base and exocad's CAD/CAM services. Year-over-year, Systems and Services revenues was up 104% due to higher scanner shipments and services and the inclusion of exocad's CAD/CAM services from the April 2020 acquisition and increased services from our larger installed base. 
Our Systems and Services deferred revenue was up 17% sequentially and up 102% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. 
Moving on to gross margin. First quarter overall gross margin was 75.7%, up 2.5 points sequentially and up 4.1 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition, overall gross margin was 76.1% for the first quarter and up 2.5 points sequentially and up 4.2 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately 0.5 points sequentially and 0.7 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. 
Clear Aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 77.6%, up 2.7 points sequentially due to increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes, higher ASPs and lower freight, partially offset by higher additional aligner volume. Clear Aligner gross margin was up 4.6 points year-over-year due to increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes and lower freight, partially offset by lower ASPs. 
Systems and Services gross margin for the first quarter was a record 65.4%, up 1.2 points sequentially, primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes and higher ASPs, partially offset by increased freight. Systems and Services gross margin was up 3.6 points year-over-year due to manufacturing efficiencies from increased volume, higher ASPs and services revenues. 
Q1 operating expenses were $451.7 million, up sequentially 13.7% and up 39.2% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating expenses is due to increased compensation, primarily from additional headcount and incentive compensation, consumer marketing spend and other general and administrative costs. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $127.2 million, reflecting our continued investment in sales and R&D activities and investments commensurate with business growth. 
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition and acquisition costs related to our exocad acquisition, operating expenses were $424.8 million, up sequentially 14.1% and up 40.9% year-over-year. 
Our first quarter operating income of $225.4 million resulted in an operating margin of 25.2%, down 0.3 points sequentially and up 12.5 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin is attributed to operational investments. The year-over-year increase in operating margin are primarily attributed to higher gross margin and operating leverage. 
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles, the acquisition costs related to our exocad acquisition, operating margin for the first quarter was 28.6%, down 0.4 points sequentially and up 11.5 points year-over-year. Our operating margin was favorably impacted by approximately 0.8 points sequentially and 1.5 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. 
Interest and other income and expense, net, for the first quarter was a gain of $36.2 million, primarily driven by the SDC arbitration award gain. Excluding the SDC arbitration award gain, interest and other income and expense, net, was a $7.2 million expense on a non-GAAP basis. 
With regards to the first quarter tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was 23.4%, which includes tax expense of approximately $11 million related to U.S. taxes on the SDC arbitration award received and approximately $14 million of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our GAAP tax rate this quarter was lower than the prior quarter rate of 25.9%, primarily due to the higher excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by foreign income taxes at different rates. 
Our GAAP tax rate was higher than the same quarter last year, which was negative 2,745%, primarily due to a onetime tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion associated with our corporate structure reorganization completed during the first quarter of 2020. The first quarter tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 20.2% compared to 14.5% in prior quarter and 33.2% in the prior year. The first quarter non-GAAP tax rate was higher than the prior quarter rate, primarily due to lower tax benefits from foreign income tax at different rates. In comparison to prior year, the non-GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was lower primarily due to higher tax benefits from foreign income tax at different rates. 
First quarter net income per diluted share was $2.51, up $0.51 sequentially and down $16.70 compared to prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.49 for the first quarter, down $0.12 sequentially and up $1.76 year-over-year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. As of March 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 billion, an increase of approximately $170.9 million from the prior quarter, which is primarily due to cash flow from operations. Of our $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $684.4 million was held in the U.S. and $447.3 million was held by our international entities. 
Q1 accounts receivable balance was $719 million, up approximately 9.3% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 72 days, up approximately 1 day sequentially and down approximately 15 days as compared to Q1 last year. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $227.2 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $43.4 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $183.8 million. 
We also have $300 million available under our revolving line of credit. Under our May 2018 repurchase program, we have $100 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock. 
Now let me turn to our outlook. Overall, we are very pleased with our first quarter results and our continued strong momentum across regions and customer channels. It has been over a year since the pandemic began, and I want to briefly recap the actions we took to support our employees by protecting employee jobs and salaries and by supporting our customers with PPE, extended payment terms, training and many other areas of assistance. 
Instead of going quiet, we accelerated our investments in marketing to drive consumer demand to our doctors' offices and stay top of mind with consumers. We accelerated our digital technology investments so that we could provide virtual tools to our doctors, enabling them to stay connected with their patients and keep their treatment moving forward. We continued to grow the business, increased our investments in R&D and product innovation and developing our plans for manufacturing expansion in EMEA. We did all these things for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders because we believe in the industry and the size of the market opportunity. Our results are the outcome of our conviction in our business model, focus and ability to execute. 
While there continues to be uncertainty around the pandemic and global environment, the strength in our business reflects the purposeful decisions we made through the pandemic and fuels our confidence in continuing to invest into growth to drive demand and conversion globally. 
Q2 is off to a great start and momentum has continued through April. Consumer demand trends and patient traffic across the dental industry are favorable and continue to improve. Given these factors and the positive trends we continue to see across the business, we believe it is important to share our current outlook and provide guidance for the full year. Note that the outlook we are providing does not reflect any potential significant disruption or additional costs related to any supply constraints. 
With that, let's turn to our full year 2021 outlook and the factors that inform our view. We have growing confidence in our digital platform and how it is driving growth across all regions and market segments. We expect 2021 revenues of $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion, up 50% to 58% year-over-year. Consistent with past years, we expect second half revenue to make up more than half of the full year revenue, and our second half revenue to grow year-over-year around the midpoint of our long-term operating model target of 20% to 30%. 
As discussed during our last earnings call, we are increasing our investments in sales, marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity to continue to drive our growth programs and accelerate adoption in a vastly underpenetrated market. On a GAAP basis, we anticipate 2021 and operating margin to be between 23.5% and 24.5%. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect 2021 operating margin to be approximately 3 points higher than our GAAP operating margin after excluding stock-based compensation and intangible amortization. 
In addition, during Q2 '21, we expect to repurchase $100 million of our common stock through either open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement we intend to enter into on or prior to May 3, 2021. The repurchase is intended to complete the $600 million stock repurchase authorization announced on May 23, 2018. 
For 2021, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $300 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. This includes our planned investment in a new manufacturing facility in Wroclaw, Poland, our first one in the EMEA region. We intend to fund these needs with cash generated from operations. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?"

In summary, we're very pleased with the first quarter results of 2021. Our strong growth and continued momentum reflect our strategic initiatives and investments, including support for doctors to ensure treatment and business continuity, ramping availability of virtual tools to keep doctors and patients connected throughout treatment and increased consumer marketing and concierge programs. The benefits of digital treatment and digital tools and the limitations of outdated old analog approaches continue to drive adoption of Invisalign Clear Aligners and iTero scanners and services. 
Over the past year, more doctors have experienced Align's digital platform, which made it possible for thousands of Invisalign practices and patients to continue treatments throughout global disruption, thanks to Invisalign aligners, digital treatment planning, virtual monitoring and care as well as iTero scanners. 
But the shift from traditional analog wires and brackets to a fully end-to-end digital platform is not easy, cannot be done without very complex technology. And this technology is prevalent, touching every aspect of what we do from manufacturing excellence where we currently manufacture over 700,000 unique aligners per day, to expanding our geographic footprint to over 100 markets, to building a network of over 200,000 trained Invisalign doctors and providing the technology to our doctors in a complete digital system, the Aligned digital platform. 
As the market leader in the clear aligner space, we have been building this industry over 24 years to get to where it is today and yet the majority of the market opportunity remains largely untapped. With over 500 million potential case starts globally, Align is in a rare position to address this market with the Align Digital Platform, powered by 2 decades of clinical data based on more than 10.2 million patients with AI machine learning and digital tools to help our doctors efficiently communicate with their patients, show and explain any issues and visualize potential treatment outcomes. And together with doctors, we're going to leverage the power of digital dentistry and orthodontics more than ever. 
We remain focused on our strategic execution, agility, customer service excellence and continuing to make investments to grow our business to drive utilization of the Invisalign system, ultimately returning value to our shareholders. This is the multi-variable equation that we talk about and there's no other company in the market today that has all these capabilities combined. 
Finally, throughout the pandemic, our priority has been the health and safety of our employees and their families and our doctor customers and their staff, and that has not changed. We remain dedicated to their well-being, and I want to reiterate our commitment to all Invisalign practices and our employees around the world, especially those in areas recently affected by a surge in COVID-19: India, Brazil, France, Poland, Ukraine, Mexico, Thailand and Japan. We are continuing to monitor the situations and are providing support and resources to those impacted employees. 
Thanks for your time today. I look forward to updating you on our progress as the year unfolds. Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator."

What's happening today is it's becoming more common. I mean you go all around the world. It was -- it's not 1 or 2 doctors doing this. There's hundreds, if not thousands, that are doing incredible kinds of cases. And so -- which I think that more and more, it just lends credibility to this product line. It can do what we say now 90% of all the cases that are out there. That's not just because it's plastic, right?

This is not a promotional discussion in a sense of when you ask your question about how to promote it. There's nothing tricky there. What we do is we have a broad number of products. You have the NIRI product plus, which is the very high end of the product line. Then you have a flex system, which I mentioned in my opening, which is basically a wand itself and it's used with the -- a normal kind of a computer that's adapted to that.

On our call today, I'll provide some highlights from the second quarter then briefly discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, System Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. 
I'm pleased to report our first $1 billion revenue quarter, with record volumes reflecting continued momentum from both Clear Aligners and Systems and Services. For Q2, Systems and Services revenues reflect strong growth across all regions and the strategic value of the iTero business, with continued adoption of the iTero Element 5D plus series of next-generation scanners and imaging systems, which launched in February. Increasingly, doctors are seeing the strategic impact and value of iTero scanners in their practices. In addition to its role in Invisalign case submissions, it's true -- it's a true workhorse and digital enabler in every type of practice and across every type of orthodontic and restorative workflow. 
Q2 sequential ClearLiner volumes were primarily driven by strength in both adult and teen market segments and across customer channels and regions, especially from the Americas and EMEA regions, reflecting the expanding opportunity for Invisalign treatment among adults globally as well as the underlying orthodontic market as we continue to build awareness of the Invisalign brand and drive utilization among teens and younger patients. For Q2 '21, Invisalign clear aligner volumes for teens were up 9.5% sequentially, 156% year-over-year to 181,000 teens, representing 1/3 of total cases shipped, with strong growth from North America and EMEA orthodontists. 
During the quarter, we hosted several team-focused peer-to-peer events designed to build clinical confidence in teen treatment and highlighted teen digital treatment journey with Invisalign treatment. The recent APAC virtual symposium featured leading providers, focusing on clinical excellence with team treatment, and North America hosted the Invisalign Teen Forum Virtual Edition for Invisalign doctors, bringing together clinical speakers, digital industry experts and team patient panelists to share their insights. 
In May, Align focused on the aligned digital platform at the 2021 AAO annual session, featuring a dynamic virtual lineup of Invisalign doctors describing how they have grown their practices through adoption of digital technology. Our Q2 results also reflect the positive impact of our investments in consumer marketing, generating billions of impressions and 33% year-over-year increase in leads for Invisalign doctors. 
During the quarter, we launched the next phase of our Monte multitouch campaign as well as the new Envisia powerful think campaign designed to engage teens and young adults. We also deepened our partnership with influencers like Charli D’Amelio, with the first limited edition aligner case as part of our new e-commerce initiative featuring custom cases, cleaning and oral care products as well as accessories like Invisalign stickables, all of which are available on invisalign.com. 
These other consumer initiatives are important in supporting doctors' practices, especially through the busy summer teen season and beyond. They also build out our investments in digital technology and innovation that are the foundation of the Align Digital platform, including integrated digital workflows and virtual tools designed to improve clinical confidence, treatment, efficiency and patient outcomes. 
A year ago, we released Invisalign Virtual Appointment and Invisalign Virtual Care tools within our My Invisalign app in response to the global pandemic to enable Invisalign doctors to provide continuity of care for their patients. Today, Invisalign Virtual Care is available globally in 60 markets, and the My Invisalign app has been downloaded 1 million times with Invisalign patients worldwide. It was recently recognized as the best virtual care platform by the MedTech Breakthrough Awards program and has a digital innovation of the year by Healthcare Asia Medtech Awards. As part of the Invisalign Virtual Care, patients use my Invisalign app to stay engaged with their treatment and convey progress photos to their doctor, fostering 2-way communications with a doctor through their Invisalign treatment journey. 
Now let's turn to the specifics around our second quarter results, starting with the Americas. For the Americas region, Q2 is another strong quarter, with Invisalign case volumes up 11% sequentially and 261% year-over-year, reflecting growth across the region, especially in the United States and Canada from both comprehensive and non-comprehensive products, an increase in Invisalign utilization from orthodontic and GP channels. DSO utilization continues to be a strong growth driver as well led by Heartland and Smile Docs. 
For international business, Q2 Invisalign case volume was up sequentially 12.7% on a year-over-year basis. International shipments were up 149%. For EMEA, Q2 volumes were up sequentially, 17% and 265% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across all markets, led by Iberia, U.K. and Italy, along with continued growth in our expansion markets. In Q2, growth in both channels was strong, with orthodontic channel growth reflecting increased Invisalign utilization and GP channel growth driven by increased Invisalign submitters. 
For Q2, EMEA growth also reflects adoption of the Invisalign First product, designed to treat a broad range of teeth-straightening issues in growing children from simple to complex including crowding, spacing and narrow dental arches. Aiding in treatment engagement for those younger patients, Invisalign Stickables are innovative accessories designed exclusively for use of a patented SmartTrack material in Invisalign Clear Systems. Available in array of designs, colors, shapes and themes, Invisalign Stickables are a fun way for patients to show their personal style during Invisalign treatment. During the quarter, we also hosted a successful virtual edition of GP Growth Summit attended by over 1,200 doctors from the EMEA region. 
For APAC, Q2 volumes were up sequentially 4.8% and 50% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting growth across the region, led by Japan, China and ANZ despite new and extended COVID restrictions in several APAC markets. APAC performance reflects strength in GP channel, with increased Invisalign submitters, especially in Japan which continues to deliver strong growth. During the quarter, we hosted our China forum attended by over 1,500 doctors from private clinics. Our APAC virtual symposium intended by 1,400 doctors as well as the China public hospital forum in June. 
Our consumer marketing is focused on educating consumers about the Invisalign system and driving that demand for Invisalign doctor's offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles. We have provided many of our key metrics that show increased activity engagement with the Invisalign brand and our Q2 quarterly presentation slides available on aligntech.com. 
In Q2, we launched the next generation of Envisas multitouch campaign, driving reach and awareness with adult mom and teen consumers, yielding more than 200% growth and visitors globally to our websites and more than 82% increase in searches for an Invisalign-trained doctor. Leading with the Envisas' Not Your Parent's Braces campaign, we connected with teams, utilizing digital media such as YouTube, Twitch and social media. We also continue with our Invisalign ChangeMakers program that celebrated and recognized teams driving change in their communities, which was covered by multiple media outlets, such as Elite Daily, Refinery 29, Yahoo!, Unwind Hollywood Life, She Knows, J14, Yahoo! Finance, Parents.com, Glamour and New Beauty and generated more than 600 million impressions. 
In EMEA region, our new marketing campaign to drive engagement, Envisas' A Powerful Thing, went live in the U.K., Germany and France during the quarter, resulting in more than 170% year-over-year increase in unique visitors and 136% year-over-year increase in doctor locator searches. We will continue to roll out the campaign to additional markets in the region during the third quarter. 
We continue to expand our consumer advertising in the APAC region in Australia, Japan and China and saw more than an 800% increase in consumer engagement and 55% year-over-year increase in leads. Lastly, we continue to build strong relationship with global search and social media giants like Google, Snapchat and TikTok, in order to further leverage our best-in-class consumer demand programs more effective globally. These partners recognize the power of the Invisalign brand and are helping us to amplify and gain efficiencies from our investments. 
For our Systems and Services business, Q2 revenues were up 20% sequentially and up 214% year-over-year, reflecting strong scanner shipments and services. This represents the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. The iTero Element 5D imaging system continues to gain traction across all regions, with strong adoption with new customers in the APAC and EMEA regions and with existing customers in the Americas region. In APAC, the iTero Element 2 inter-oral scanner did well during the quarter, helping to transform digital workflows and chairside consults for doctors. During the quarter, we announced a new iTero workflow of 2.0 software and previewed auto upload functionality in the iTero Element 5D imaging system. 
The iTero Workflow 2.0 software advanced features include faster scanning, improved visualization and enhanced patient communication tools, were rolled out regionally in all markets where the iTero Element plus imaging systems are sold. The iTero Element 5D imaging system auto upload feature will eliminate steps and streamline Invisalign case submissions, with inter-oral color scan images that can be used in place of traditional inter-oral photos, the. Auto upload functionality is scheduled for release during the third quarter of 2021. 
There's great symmetry between Systems and Services business with Clear Aligner business reflected in the positive correlation between the deployment of scanners and the increased utilization of Invisalign clear aligners. In terms of digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions, total digital scans in Q2 increased to 82.2% from 78.5% in Q2 last year. International scans increased to 76.2%, up from 72% in the same quarter last year. For the Americas, 86.6% of cases were submitted digitally compared to 86% a year ago. Cumulatively, over 40.1 million orthodontic scans and 8.4 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. I'm also pleased to share that Align received regulatory approval for the iTero 5D+ series in Japan on July 1, with a formal launch event planned for August. 
Turning to exocad. During the quarter, exocad launched the Creator Center, the new exocad one-stop shop for online and in-person educational events, with a database consisting of 35 educational webinars showcasing the highlights and add-on features of exocad's Software Solutions, Dental CAD Galway 3.0, exocad 3.0 Galway. More than 2,500 users and distributors have been trained on the new software releases worldwide. exocad has also expanded their market coverage with a new global OEM partner, Ivoclar Vivident, or we call IV, one of the largest manufacturers in the dental industry. This strategic collaboration will give exocad access to thousands of new IV users worldwide. We'll also provide exocad users with access to production processes with removable prosthetics in the future. 
Earlier this month, exocad has released partial CAD 3.0 Galway, its module for removable parcel dental frameworks, which has new and advanced features for the design of high-quality partial dentures. This new release enhances digital CAD/CAM possibilities for exocad users and dental technicians by providing simpler design solutions for complex cases. Partial CAD 3.0 Galway provide both experts and new users with smooth, improved integration with dental CAD, exocad-leading software for dental laboratories. Bringing the iTero and exocad businesses together makes us more viable within the GP segment and more relevant in day-to-day comprehensive dentistry for our customers. 
The combination of Invisalign clear aligners and iTero scanners have long provided a seamless workflow for orthodontic treatment. The integration of exocad's expertise in restorative dentistry and implantology, guided surgery and smile design takes the Align technical portfolio beyond our established footprint in orthodontics to ortho restorative and restorative treatment and paves the way for new cross-disciplinary workflows that span from visualization and treatment planning to lab production to chairside. exocad also broadens Align's platform reach and digital dentistry with over 200 partners and more than 40,000 licenses installed worldwide. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to John."

Let me begin by reminding everyone that for Align and many companies, Q2 2020 was significantly impacted by COVID-19 business disruptions, and comparisons of our results 2021 should be considered accordingly. Now for our Q2 financial result",1563,"Thanks, Joe. Let me begin by reminding everyone that for Align and many companies, Q2 2020 was significantly impacted by COVID-19 business disruptions, and comparisons of our results 2021 should be considered accordingly. 
Now for our Q2 financial results. Total revenues for the second quarter were $1 billion, up 13% from the prior quarter and up 186.9% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For Clear Aligners, Q2 revenues of $841 million were up 11.6% sequentially and up 181.9% year-over-year, reflecting Invisalign volume growth in most geographies. In Q2, we shipped a record 665,600 Invisalign cases, an increase of 11.7% sequentially and 200% year-over-year. In addition, we shipped a record 83,500 Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which approximately 7,200 first-time customers. 
Q2 clear aligner of revenues reflect strong growth across the Invisalign portfolio for both comprehensive and noncomprehensive products. Q2 comprehensive volume increased 11.4% sequentially and 181.9% year-over-year. In Q2, non-comprehensive volume increased 12.3% sequentially, driven by strength in Invisalign Moderate and Invisalign Go and up 251.7% year-over-year. Q2 adult patients increased 12.6% sequentially and 220.4% year-over-year. In Q2, teens or younger patients increased 9.5% sequentially and 156.3% year-over-year. 
Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $3.4 million or approximately 0.5 points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $36.7 million or approximately 12.3 points. 
For Q2 Invisalign comprehensive ASPs decreased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs reflect higher discounts of credits and foreign exchange, partially offset by regional mix. On a year-over-year basis, comprehensive ASPs reflect the increase in net revenue deferrals for new Invisalign cases versus additional aligner shipments, partially offset by foreign exchange. Recall, Q2 2020 ASPs increased as a result of more additional shipments of aligner shipments as doctors were focused on maintaining treatment progress for existing Invisalign patients. This trend reversed itself after practices reopened in Q3 and demand for new cases ramped up significantly. 
Q2 Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and were flat year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs reflect lower discounts, partially offset by foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs were favorably impacted by foreign exchange, offset by higher mix of new Invisalign cases versus additional aligner shipments. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $101 million sequentially and $337 million year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. 
Our System and Services revenues for the second quarter were a record $169.8 million, up 20% sequentially and up 214.7% year-over-year. The increase sequentially and year-over-year can be attributed to increased scanner shipments, higher ASP and increased services revenue for our larger installed base. Our Systems and Services deferred revenue on the balance sheet was up 22% sequentially and up 135% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. 
Moving on to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin was 75%, down 0.6 points sequentially and up 11.4 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition, overall gross margin was 75.4% for the second quarter, down 0.7 points sequentially and up 11 points year-over-year. Overall, gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately 1.1 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange and relatively unchanged sequentially. 
Clear Aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 76.9%, down 0.7 points sequentially due to higher freight costs and slightly lower ASPs. Clear Aligner gross margin was 12.4 points year-over-year due to increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes, partially offset by lower ASPs. 
Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was a record 65.9%, up 0.5 points sequentially, primarily due to higher ASPs, partially offset by manufacturing variances and higher freight costs. Systems and Services gross margin was up 6.6 points year-over-year due to higher ASPs and services revenues in addition to improved manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes, partially offset by higher freight costs. 
Q2 operating expenses were $489.6 million, up sequentially 8.4% and up 64.7% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating expenses is due to increased consumer marketing spend, increased compensation related to additional headcount and higher commissions and other general and administrative costs. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $192.3 million, reflecting our continued investment in marketing and sales and R&D activities and investments commensurate with business growth. 
On a non-GAAP basis, which includes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition, operating expenses were $461.2 million, up sequentially 8.6% and up 73.6% year-over-year due to the reasons described above. Our second quarter operating income of $268.9 million resulted in an operating margin of 26.6%, up 1.4 points versus prior quarter and up 47.3 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin was attributed primarily to operational leverage. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was primarily attributed to higher gross margin and operating leverage as well as a favorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 1.8 points. 
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles, operating margin for the second quarter was 29.8%, up 1.2 points sequentially and up 40.8 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the second quarter was a loss of $0.1 million, down sequentially by $36.3 million, primarily due to the SDC arbitration award gain recorded in the first quarter. 
With regards to the second quarter tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was 25.7%, which was higher than the prior quarter rate of 23.4%, primarily due to lower excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our GAAP tax rate was lower than the same quarter last year, which was 44.8%, primarily due to foreign income tax at lower rates. The second quarter tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 19.5% compared to 20.2% in the prior quarter and 27.8% in the prior year. The second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was lower than the prior quarter and the second quarter of the prior year rates due to foreign income tax and lower rates. 
Second quarter net income per diluted share was $2.51, flat sequentially and up $3.03 compared to the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $3.04 for the second quarter, up $0.55 sequentially and up $3.39 year-over-year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 billion, flat sequentially. Of our $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $551 million was held in the U.S., and $535.3 million was held by our international entities. Q2 accounts receivable balance was $808.1 million, up approximately 12.4% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 72 days, flat sequentially and down approximately 49.1 days as compared to Q2 last year. 
Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $317.5 million. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $124.2 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $193.3 million. We also have $300 million available under our revolving line of credit. Under our $1 billion repurchase program announced in May 2021, we have $900 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock. 
Now let me turn to our outlook and the factors that inform our view for the remainder of the year. Overall, we are very pleased with our second quarter results and our continued strong performance across regions, customer channels and products. While there continues to be uncertainty around the pandemic and increasing restrictions related to COVID-19 in certain geographies, we are continuing to invest in our strategic growth initiatives, including sales, marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity to drive demand and conversion globally and are confident in our competitive position and ability to execute. At the same time, we are also anticipating more pronounced summer seasonality across all regions than we have experienced in recent years as doctors, their staff and patients take long over duplications. 
Notwithstanding seasonality, given our strong performance and continued confidence in the huge market opportunity, our industry leadership and our ability to execute, we are increasing our 2021 revenue guidance provided in April on the Q1 '21 earnings call to a range of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion. Additionally, we now expect our second half year-over-year revenue growth rate to be above the midpoint of our long-term operating model target of 20% to 30%. 
On a GAAP basis, we now anticipate our 2021 operating margin to be better than our prior guidance in the range of 24% to 25%. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the 2021 operating margin to be approximately 3 points higher than our GAAP operating margin after excluding stock-based compensation and intangible amortization. 
In addition, during Q3 '21, we expect to repurchase up to $75 million of our common stock through either a combination of open market repurchases and or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. For 2021, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million. Capital expenditures primarily related to building construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. This includes our planned investment in our new manufacturing facility in Poland, our first one in the EMEA region. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?"

We're very pleasing improvements we're seeing in recovering doctor practices. We truly value their increasing adoption of digital treatment approaches, their confidence in the unique aligned digital platform that spans from iTero to the world's most sophisticated treatment planning, the world's largest 3D printing business on the globe to a patient apport, with over 1 million consumers along with the world's most recognized orthodontic brand has driven strong performance across the business. Our performance over the last year confirms the incredible size of our target market and demonstrates that our strategy and investments in recent years can help further solidify our competitive position. 
We have numerous growth drivers in a vastly underpaid traded market. And while we continue to see some lasting impact and continued uncertainty due to COVID, we remain confident in both the enormous opportunity we have to lead the evolution of digital orthodontics and comprehensive dentistry with our doctor customers and in our ability to execute our strategy to increase adoption of Invisalign treatment globally. 
We're also confident in and excited about the benefits of digital treatment that more and more doctors are experiencing by transforming their practices with Invisalign digital orthodontics and iTero scanners for chairside treatment planning and visualization. In fact, Invisalign treatment requires, on an average, 30% fewer doctor visits than fixed appliances, creating efficiency gains for the doctors and a better patient experience. And 85% of orthodontist surveyed agreed that adopting the aligned digital platform have made a huge difference in their practices. It provides ways to improve their efficiency and productivity. 
I look forward to updating you at the GP Summit an Investor Day in October in Las Vegas and sharing more examples of how Align is helping doctors transform their practices and their approach to treatment.

So we're -- I'm confident that that's a great market for us. We know that 500 million patients we talk about globally sits broadly in that segment.

Then you raised the back part of the year from roughly 25% year-over-year revenue midpoint growth to closer to 27%, yet you call out some more pronounced summer seasonality.

But in general, we just feel good about the direction of the business, the signal and words that we're getting from our doctors and what they're explaining they're seeing out there, and that's all incorporated into what we've been forecasting for. 
The 1 thing to never forget about, too, Jason is the size of this marketplace. We talk about 500 million patients, and I know you hear from a lot of other companies in different industries about oversize, SIMs and whatever. This is true. If anything's sort of shown, like I mentioned in my closing comments, that this market is as big as we talked about being is what you've seen from this business over the last year. And in the adult segment of that part, too, which is a big part of that 500 million patients that we talked about."

But we have a very experienced team there. We funded it well. I feel good about our position from a product standpoint and iTero scanners. And it's a big market for us. And don't just think about Brazil, too, Latin America, in general, it's been a big expanding market for us. So Brazil leads because of the size population and the size we talked about.

And that ground war has basically started with product liability. And obviously, with Invisalign First and mandibular advancement and some of our other innovations that we've had, we've really opened up that segment and made it available to us, too. Now the work is primarily with orthodontists to make them confident that they can service these teams, not just clinically, but from a business standpoint also. That's why our programs like Adapt and different things we put in place. 
And remember, if the war here is not against other clear aligner companies, it's about braces and fixed appliances. And that's what we really have to break through and get done. And honestly, orthodontists just have to be comfortable not clinically, but also from a business standpoint. And I feel like we're making progress in educating teens and educating moms. But on the other hand, educating orthodontists to how they can properly do this clinically and also be efficient in their practices in doing it. And that's the ground war part. 
I feel we're well positioned. And obviously, our numbers say we're making progress. But there is -- we're not declaring victory here at all."

And it's like our other competitors are starting to figure that piece out and see pieces of it. We have strong patents around SmartTrack and obviously improvement over time. It's a real important part about not just having the right materials, but having the right kind of system in place, and that's a treatment planning part that we talked about 25 years of understanding how to really activate those aligners and make that plastic actually work through those algorithms. 
And we don't use a displacement methodology, which is basically built on a wire that kind of leads things. It actually engages with these things in a different way. So I expect more companies to come out and work different polymers or whatever. We have a huge amount of experience to that, but don't forget about the entire system, the algorithms, how it works together and how it works with attachments, the exactness of the attachments, where you put those attachments, how they're shaped. There's a lot going on there. We feel good about our position, and we'll continue to innovate in that space across all those spectrums.

John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. 
I'm pleased to report our first $1 billion revenue quarter, with record volumes reflecting continued momentum from both Clear Aligners and Systems and Services. For Q2, Systems and Services revenues reflect strong growth across all regions and the strategic value of the iTero business, with continued adoption of the iTero Element 5D plus series of next-generation scanners and imaging systems, which launched in February. Increasingly, doctors are seeing the strategic impact and value of iTero scanners in their practices. In addition to its role in Invisalign case submissions, it's true -- it's a true workhorse and digital enabler in every type of practice and across every type of orthodontic and restorative workflow. 
Q2 sequential Clear Aligner volumes were primarily driven by strength in both adult and teen market segments and across customer channels and regions, especially from the Americas and EMEA regions, reflecting the expanding opportunity for Invisalign treatment among adults globally as well as the underlying orthodontic market as we continue to build awareness of the Invisalign brand and drive utilization among teens and younger patients. For Q2 '21, Invisalign clear aligner volumes for teens were up 9.5% sequentially, 156% year-over-year to 181,000 teens, representing 1/3 of total cases shipped, with strong growth from North America and EMEA orthodontists. 
During the quarter, we hosted several teen-focused peer-to-peer events designed to build clinical confidence in teen treatment and highlighted teen digital treatment journey with Invisalign treatment. The recent APAC virtual symposium featured leading providers, focusing on clinical excellence with team treatment, and North America hosted the Invisalign Teen Forum Virtual Edition for Invisalign doctors, bringing together clinical speakers, digital industry experts and teen patient panelists to share their insights. 
In May, Align focused on the aligned digital platform at the 2021 AAO annual session, featuring a dynamic virtual lineup of Invisalign doctors describing how they have grown their practices through adoption of digital technology. Our Q2 results also reflect the positive impact of our investments in consumer marketing, generating billions of impressions and 33% year-over-year increase in leads for Invisalign doctors. 
During the quarter, we launched the next phase of our Mom/Teen multitouch campaign as well as the new Invis is a Powerful Thing campaign designed to engage teens and young adults. We also deepened our partnership with influencers like Charli D’Amelio, with the first limited edition aligner case as part of our new e-commerce initiative featuring custom cases, cleaning and oral care products as well as accessories like Invisalign stickables, all of which are available on invisalign.com. 
These other consumer initiatives are important in supporting doctors' practices, especially through the busy summer teen season and beyond. They also build out our investments in digital technology and innovation that are the foundation of the Align Digital Platform, including integrated digital workflows and virtual tools designed to improve clinical confidence, treatment, efficiency and patient outcomes. 
A year ago, we released Invisalign Virtual Appointment and Invisalign Virtual Care tools within our My Invisalign app in response to the global pandemic to enable Invisalign doctors to provide continuity of care for their patients. Today, Invisalign Virtual Care is available globally in 60 markets, and the My Invisalign app has been downloaded 1 million times with Invisalign patients worldwide. It was recently recognized as the Best Virtual Care Platform by the MedTech Breakthrough Awards program and has a digital innovation of the year by Healthcare Asia Medtech awards. As part of the Invisalign Virtual Care, patients use my Invisalign app to stay engaged with their treatment and convey progress photos to their doctor, fostering 2-way communications with a doctor through their Invisalign treatment journey. 
Now let's turn to the specifics around our second quarter results, starting with the Americas. For the Americas region, Q2 is another strong quarter, with Invisalign case volumes up 11% sequentially and 261% year-over-year, reflecting growth across the region, especially in the United States and Canada from both comprehensive and non-comprehensive products, an increase in Invisalign utilization from orthodontic and GP channels. DSO utilization continues to be a strong growth driver as well led by Heartland and Smile Docs. 
For international business, Q2 Invisalign case volume was up sequentially 12.7% on a year-over-year basis. International shipments were up 149%. For EMEA, Q2 volumes were up sequentially, 17% and 265% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across all markets, led by Iberia, U.K. and Italy, along with continued growth in our expansion markets. In Q2, growth in both channels was strong, with orthodontic channel growth reflecting increased Invisalign utilization and GP channel growth driven by increased Invisalign submitters. 
For Q2, EMEA growth also reflects adoption of the Invisalign First product, designed to treat a broad range of teeth-straightening issues in growing children from simple to complex, including crowding, spacing and narrow dental arches. Aiding in treatment engagement for those younger patients, Invisalign Stickables are innovative accessories designed exclusively for use of a patented SmartTrack material in Invisalign Clear Systems. Available in array of designs, colors, shapes and themes, Invisalign Stickables are a fun way for patients to show their personal style during Invisalign treatment. During the quarter, we also hosted a successful virtual edition of GP Growth Summit attended by over 1,200 doctors from the EMEA region. 
For APAC, Q2 volumes were up sequentially 4.8% and 50% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting growth across the region, led by Japan, China and ANZ despite new and extended COVID restrictions in several APAC markets. APAC performance reflects strength in GP channel, with increased Invisalign submitters, especially in Japan which continues to deliver strong growth. During the quarter, we hosted our China forum attended by over 1,500 doctors from private clinics. Our APAC virtual symposium attended by 1,400 doctors as well as the China Public Hospital Forum in June. 
Our consumer marketing is focused on educating consumers about the Invisalign system and driving that demand for Invisalign doctor's offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles. We have provided many of our key metrics that show increased activity engagement with the Invisalign brand and our Q2 quarterly presentation slides available on aligntech.com. 
In Q2, we launched the next generation of Invis Is multitouch campaign, driving reach and awareness with adult mom and teen consumers, yielding more than 200% growth in visitors globally to our websites and more than 82% increase in searches for an Invisalign-trained doctor. Leading with the Invis Is Not Your Parent's Braces campaign, we connected with teams, utilizing digital media such as YouTube, Twitch and social media. We also continue with our Invisalign ChangeMakers program that celebrated and recognized teens driving change in their communities, which was covered by multiple media outlets, such as Elite Daily, Refinery 29, Yahoo!, Unwind Hollywood Life, SheKnows, J-14, Yahoo! Finance, Parents.com, Glamour and New Beauty and generated more than 600 million impressions. 
In EMEA region, our new marketing campaign to drive engagement, Invis Is a Powerful Thing, went live in the U.K., Germany and France during the quarter, resulting in more than 170% year-over-year increase in unique visitors and 136% year-over-year increase in doctor locator searches. We will continue to roll out the campaign to additional markets in the region during the third quarter. 
We continue to expand our consumer advertising in the APAC region in Australia, Japan and China and saw more than an 800% increase in consumer engagement and 55% year-over-year increase in leads. Lastly, we continue to build strong relationship with global search and social media giants like Google, Snapchat and TikTok, in order to further leverage our best-in-class consumer demand programs more effective globally. These partners recognize the power of the Invisalign brand and are helping us to amplify and gain efficiencies from our investments. 
For our Systems and Services business, Q2 revenues were up 20% sequentially and up 214% year-over-year, reflecting strong scanner shipments and services. This represents the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. The iTero Element 5D Plus imaging system continues to gain traction across all regions, with strong adoption with new customers in the APAC and EMEA regions and with existing customers in the Americas region. In APAC, the iTero Element 2 intraoral scanner did well during the quarter, helping to transform digital workflows and chairside consults for doctors. During the quarter, we announced a new iTero Workflow 2.0 software and previewed auto upload functionality in the iTero Element 5D imaging system. 
The iTero Workflow 2.0 software advanced features include faster scanning, improved visualization and enhanced patient communication tools, were rolled out regionally in all markets where the iTero Element Plus imaging systems are sold. The iTero Element 5D imaging system auto upload feature will eliminate steps and streamline Invisalign case submissions, with intraoral color scan images that can be used in place of traditional intraoral photos, the. Auto upload functionality is scheduled for release during the third quarter of 2021. 
There's great symmetry between Systems and Services business with Clear Aligner business reflected in the positive correlation between the deployment of scanners and the increased utilization of Invisalign clear aligners. In terms of digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions, total digital scans in Q2 increased to 82.2% from 78.5% in Q2 last year. International scans increased to 76.2%, up from 72% in the same quarter last year. For the Americas, 86.6% of cases were submitted digitally compared to 86% a year ago. Cumulatively, over 40.1 million orthodontic scans and 8.4 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. I'm also pleased to share that Align received regulatory approval for the iTero 5D Plus series in Japan on July 1, with a formal launch event planned for August. 
Turning to exocad. During the quarter, exocad launched the Creator Center, the new exocad one-stop shop for online and in-person educational events, with a database consisting of 35 educational webinars showcasing the highlights and add-on features of exocad's Software Solutions, Dental CADGalway 3.0, exoplan 3.0 Galway. More than 2,500 users and distributors have been trained on the new software releases worldwide. exocad has also expanded their market coverage with a new global OEM partner, Ivoclar Vivadent, or we call IV, one of the largest manufacturers in the dental industry. This strategic collaboration will give exocad access to thousands of new IV users worldwide. We'll also provide exocad users with access to production processes with removable prosthetics in the future. 
Earlier this month, exocad has released PartialCAD 3.0 Galway, its module for removable parcel dental frameworks, which has new and advanced features for the design of high-quality partial dentures. This new release enhances digital CAD/CAM possibilities for exocad users and dental technicians by providing simpler design solutions for complex cases. PartialCAD 3.0 Galway provide both experts and new users with smooth, improved integration with dental CAD, exocad's leading software for dental laboratories. Bringing the iTero and exocad businesses together makes us more viable within the GP segment and more relevant in day-to-day comprehensive dentistry for our customers. 
The combination of Invisalign clear aligners and iTero scanners have long provided a seamless workflow for orthodontic treatment. The integration of exocad's expertise in restorative dentistry and implantology, guided surgery and smile design takes the Align technical portfolio beyond our established footprint in orthodontics to ortho restorative and restorative treatment and paves the way for new cross-disciplinary workflows that span from visualization and treatment planning to lab production to chairside. exocad also broadens Align's platform reach in digital dentistry with over 200 partners and more than 40,000 licenses installed worldwide. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to John."
24568,1672658479,2353467,"Align Technology, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Align Technology, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe. Let me begin by reminding everyone that for Align and many companies, Q2 2020 was significantly impacted by COVID-19 business disruptions, and comparisons of our results 2021 should be considered accordingly. Now for our Q2 financial result",1565,"Thanks, Joe. Let me begin by reminding everyone that for Align and many companies, Q2 2020 was significantly impacted by COVID-19 business disruptions, and comparisons of our results 2021 should be considered accordingly. 
Now for our Q2 financial results. Total revenues for the second quarter were $1 billion, up 13% from the prior quarter and up 186.9% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For Clear Aligners, Q2 revenues of $841 million were up 11.6% sequentially and up 181.9% year-over-year, reflecting Invisalign volume growth in most geographies. In Q2, we shipped a record 665,600 Invisalign cases, an increase of 11.7% sequentially and 200% year-over-year. In addition, we shipped a record 83,500 Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which approximately 7,200 were first-time customers. 
Q2 clear aligner of revenues reflect strong growth across the Invisalign portfolio for both comprehensive and noncomprehensive products. Q2 comprehensive volume increased 11.4% sequentially and 181.9% year-over-year. In Q2, non-comprehensive volume increased 12.3% sequentially, driven by strength in Invisalign Moderate and Invisalign Go and up 251.7% year-over-year. Q2 adult patients increased 12.6% sequentially and 220.4% year-over-year. In Q2, teens or younger patients increased 9.5% sequentially and 156.3% year-over-year. 
Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $3.4 million or approximately 0.5 points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $36.7 million or approximately 12.3 points. 
For Q2 Invisalign comprehensive ASPs decreased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs reflect higher discounts of credits and foreign exchange, partially offset by regional mix. On a year-over-year basis, comprehensive ASPs reflect the increase in net revenue deferrals for new Invisalign cases versus additional aligner shipments, partially offset by foreign exchange. Recall, Q2 2020 ASPs increased as a result of more additional shipments -- of aligner shipments as doctors were focused on maintaining treatment progress for existing Invisalign patients. This trend reversed itself after practices reopened in Q3 and demand for new cases ramped up significantly. 
Q2 Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and were flat year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs reflect lower discounts, partially offset by foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs were favorably impacted by foreign exchange, offset by higher mix of new Invisalign cases versus additional aligner shipments. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $101 million sequentially and $337 million year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. 
Our System and Services revenues for the second quarter were a record $169.8 million, up 20% sequentially and up 214.7% year-over-year. The increase sequentially and year-over-year can be attributed to increased scanner shipments, higher ASP and increased services revenue for our larger installed base. Our Systems and Services deferred revenue on the balance sheet was up 22% sequentially and up 135% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. 
Moving on to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin was 75%, down 0.6 points sequentially and up 11.4 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition, overall gross margin was 75.4% for the second quarter, down 0.7 points sequentially and up 11 points year-over-year. Overall, gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately 1.1 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange and relatively unchanged sequentially. 
Clear Aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 76.9%, down 0.7 points sequentially due to higher freight costs and slightly lower ASPs. Clear Aligner gross margin was 12.4 points year-over-year due to increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes, partially offset by lower ASPs. 
Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was a record 65.9%, up 0.5 points sequentially, primarily due to higher ASPs, partially offset by manufacturing variances and higher freight costs. Systems and Services gross margin was up 6.6 points year-over-year due to higher ASPs and services revenues in addition to improved manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes, partially offset by higher freight costs. 
Q2 operating expenses were $489.6 million, up sequentially 8.4% and up 64.7% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating expenses is due to increased consumer marketing spend, increased compensation related to additional headcount and higher commissions and other general and administrative costs. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $192.3 million, reflecting our continued investment in marketing and sales and R&D activities and investments commensurate with business growth. 
On a non-GAAP basis, which includes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition, operating expenses were $461.2 million, up sequentially 8.6% and up 73.6% year-over-year due to the reasons described above. Our second quarter operating income of $268.9 million resulted in an operating margin of 26.6%, up 1.4 points versus prior quarter and up 47.3 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin was attributed primarily to operational leverage. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was primarily attributed to higher gross margin and operating leverage as well as a favorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 1.8 points. 
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles, operating margin for the second quarter was 29.8%, up 1.2 points sequentially and up 40.8 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the second quarter was a loss of $0.1 million, down sequentially by $36.3 million, primarily due to the SDC arbitration award gain recorded in the first quarter. 
With regards to the second quarter tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was 25.7%, which was higher than the prior quarter rate of 23.4%, primarily due to lower excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our GAAP tax rate was lower than the same quarter last year, which was 44.8%, primarily due to foreign income tax at lower rates. The second quarter tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 19.5% compared to 20.2% in the prior quarter and 27.8% in the prior year. The second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was lower than the prior quarter and the second quarter of the prior year rates due to foreign income tax and lower rates. 
Second quarter net income per diluted share was $2.51, flat sequentially and up $3.03 compared to the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $3.04 for the second quarter, up $0.55 sequentially and up $3.39 year-over-year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 billion, flat sequentially. Of our $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $551 million was held in the U.S., and $535.3 million was held by our international entities. Q2 accounts receivable balance was $808.1 million, up approximately 12.4% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 72 days, flat sequentially and down approximately 49.1 days as compared to Q2 last year. 
Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $317.5 million. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $124.2 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $193.3 million. We also have $300 million available under our revolving line of credit. Under our $1 billion repurchase program announced in May 2021, we have $900 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock. 
Now let me turn to our outlook and the factors that inform our view for the remainder of the year. Overall, we are very pleased with our second quarter results and our continued strong performance across regions, customer channels and products. While there continues to be uncertainty around the pandemic and increasing restrictions related to COVID-19 in certain geographies, we are continuing to invest in our strategic growth initiatives, including sales, marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity to drive demand and conversion globally and are confident in our competitive position and ability to execute. At the same time, we are also anticipating more pronounced summer seasonality across all regions than we have experienced in recent years as doctors, their staff and patients take long overdue vacations. 
Notwithstanding seasonality, given our strong performance and continued confidence in the huge market opportunity, our industry leadership and our ability to execute, we are increasing our 2021 revenue guidance provided in April on the Q1 '21 earnings call to a range of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion. Additionally, we now expect our second half year-over-year revenue growth rate to be above the midpoint of our long-term operating model target of 20% to 30%. 
On a GAAP basis, we now anticipate our 2021 operating margin to be better than our prior guidance in the range of 24% to 25%. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the 2021 operating margin to be approximately 3 points higher than our GAAP operating margin after excluding stock-based compensation and intangible amortization. 
In addition, during Q3 '21, we expect to repurchase up to $75 million of our common stock through either a combination of open market repurchases and or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. For 2021, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. This includes our planned investment in a new manufacturing facility in Poland, our first one in the EMEA region. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?"

We're very pleased with improvements we're seeing in recovering doctor practices. We truly value their increasing adoption of digital treatment approaches, their confidence in the unique aligned digital platform that spans from iTero to the world's most sophisticated treatment planning, the world's largest 3D printing business on the globe to a patient app worth -- with over 1 million consumers along with the world's most recognized orthodontic brand has driven strong performance across the business. Our performance over the last year confirms the incredible size of our target market and demonstrates that our strategy and investments in recent years can help further solidify our competitive position. 
We have numerous growth drivers in a vastly underpenetrated market. And while we continue to see some lasting impact and continued uncertainty due to COVID, we remain confident in both the enormous opportunity we have to lead the evolution of digital orthodontics and comprehensive dentistry with our doctor customers, and in our ability to execute our strategy to increase adoption of Invisalign treatment globally. 
We're also confident in and excited about the benefits of digital treatment that more and more doctors are experiencing by transforming their practices with Invisalign digital orthodontics and iTero scanners for chairside treatment planning and visualization. In fact, Invisalign treatment requires, on an average, 30% fewer doctor visits than fixed appliances, creating efficiency gains for the doctors and a better patient experience. And 85% of orthodontist surveyed agreed that adopting the Align Digital Platform have made a huge difference in their practices. It provides ways to improve their efficiency and productivity. 
I look forward to updating you at the GP Summit an Investor Day in October in Las Vegas and sharing more examples of how Align is helping doctors transform their practices and their approach to treatment.

And thirdly, new products like we're working iGO and different derivatives of that product line that are very efficient for GPs to use, and it gives them a huge amount of confidence in our product line when they use it, John. So it's a combination of our brand, it's a combination of a digital platform with iTero, it's a combination of product piece. 
And then we don't talk about it a lot, but we split our sales force years ago. And we have a specific focused sales force on GPs. And being a GP, speak a different language, John, it's different than orthodontists altogether. And that team has been incredibly effective in being able to work with doctors, how they can integrate Invisalign into their workflow and, from a restorative standpoint, how you use this proactively. 
So we're -- I'm confident that, that's a great market for us. We know that 500 million patients we talk about globally sits broadly in that segment.

Then you raised the back part of the year from roughly 25% year-over-year revenue midpoint growth to closer to 27%, yet you call out some more pronounced summer seasonality.

Now when we talk about third quarter and seasonality as John was talking about whatever, a lot of that is around adult patients and vacations and different things, too, and it affects different parts of the organization, but -- and how we go to market.

Is there any incremental spend that you're budgeting? And just in general, sort of expand on that, could you talk a little bit about consumer marketing spend? How are those costs trending? How is the return on that going?"

And it's like our other competitors are starting to figure that piece out and see pieces of it. 
We have strong patents around SmartTrack and obviously improvement over time. It's a real important part about not just having the right materials, but having the right kind of system in place, and that's a treatment planning part that we talked about, 25 years of understanding how to really activate those aligners and make that plastic actually work through those algorithms. 
And we don't use a displacement methodology, which is basically built on a wire that kind of leads things. It actually engages with these things in a different way. So I expect more companies to come out and work different polymers or whatever. We have a huge amount of experience to that, but don't forget about the entire system, the algorithms, how it works together and how it works with attachments, the exactness of those attachments, where you put those attachments, how they're shaped. 
There's a lot going on there. We feel good about our position, and we'll continue to innovate in that space across all those spectrums. But there's nothing in the competitive marketplace that we are concerned with that would change the trajectory of where we're investing right now. 
From a China competitive standpoint, obviously, Angelalign, IPO, we watch that closely. And it gives some clarity to everybody in that marketplace as they IPO-ed and what's going on. And I think you see they're strong in Tier 3 cities, they're strong with public hospitals in different areas. And -- but look, we -- I feel good about our position in China.

John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. 
I'm pleased to report our first $1 billion revenue quarter with record volumes reflecting continued momentum from both Clear Aligners and Systems and Services. For Q2, Systems and Services revenues reflect strong growth across all regions and the strategic value of the iTero business with continued adoption of the iTero Element 5D Plus Series of next-generation scanners and imaging systems, which launched in February. Increasingly, doctors are seeing the strategic impact and value of iTero scanners in their practices. In addition to its role in Invisalign case submissions, it's true -- it's a true workhorse and digital enabler in every type of practice and across every type of orthodontic and restorative workflow. 
Q2 sequential Clear Aligner volumes were primarily driven by strength in both adult and teen market segments and across customer channels and regions, especially from the Americas and EMEA regions, reflecting the expanding opportunity for Invisalign treatment among adults globally as well as the underlying orthodontic market as we continue to build awareness of the Invisalign brand and drive utilization among teens and younger patients. 
For Q2 '21, Invisalign clear aligner volumes for teens were up 9.5% sequentially, 156% year-over-year to 181,000 teens, representing 1/3 of total cases shipped, with strong growth from North America and EMEA orthodontists. During the quarter, we hosted several teen-focused peer-to-peer events designed to build clinical confidence in teen treatment and highlight the teen digital treatment journey with Invisalign treatment. The recent APAC virtual symposium featured leading providers focusing on clinical excellence with teen treatment, and North America hosted the Invisalign Teen Forum: Virtual Edition for Invisalign doctors, bringing together clinical speakers, digital industry experts and teen patient panelists to share their insights. In May, Align focused on the Align Digital Platform at the 2021 AAO annual session, featuring a dynamic virtual lineup of Invisalign doctors describing how they have grown their practices through adoption of digital technology. 
Our Q2 results also reflect the positive impact of our investments in consumer marketing, generating billions of impressions and 33% year-over-year increase in leads for Invisalign doctors. During the quarter, we launched the next phase of our Mom/Teen multitouch campaign as well as the new ""Invis is a powerful thing"" campaign designed to engage teens and young adults. We also deepened our partnership with influencers like Charli D’Amelio, with the first limited-edition aligner case as part of our new e-commerce initiative featuring custom cases, cleaning and oral care products as well as accessories like Invisalign Stickables, all of which are available on invisalign.com. These and other consumer initiatives are important in supporting doctors' practices, especially through the busy summer teen season and beyond. They also build out our investments in digital technology and innovation that are the foundation of the Align Digital Platform, including integrated digital workflows and virtual tools designed to improve clinical confidence, treatment, efficiency and patient outcomes. 
A year ago, we released Invisalign Virtual Appointment and Invisalign Virtual Care tools within our My Invisalign app in response to the global pandemic to enable Invisalign doctors to provide continuity of care for their patients. Today, Invisalign Virtual Care is available globally in 60 markets, and the My Invisalign app has been downloaded 1 million times with Invisalign patients worldwide. It was recently recognized as the Best Virtual Care Platform by the MedTech Breakthrough Awards program and as a Digital Innovation of the Year by Healthcare Asia Medtech Awards. As part of the Invisalign Virtual Care, patients use My Invisalign app to stay engaged with their treatment and convey progress photos to their doctor, fostering 2-way communications with a doctor through their Invisalign treatment journey. 
Now let's turn to the specifics around our second quarter results, starting with the Americas. For the Americas region, Q2 was another strong quarter, with Invisalign case volumes up 11% sequentially and 261% year-over-year, reflecting growth across the region, especially in the United States and Canada, from both comprehensive and non-comprehensive products, and increased Invisalign utilization from orthodontic and GP channels. DSO utilization continues to be a strong growth driver as well, led by Heartland and Smile Docs. 
For international business, Q2 Invisalign case volume was up sequentially 12.7% on a year-over-year basis. International shipments were up 149%. 
For EMEA, Q2 volumes were up sequentially, 17% and 265% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across all markets, led by Iberia, U.K. and Italy, along with continued growth in our expansion markets. In Q2, growth in both channels was strong, with orthodontic channel growth reflecting increased Invisalign utilization and GP channel growth driven by increased Invisalign submitters. For Q2, EMEA growth also reflects adoption of the Invisalign First product, designed to treat a broad range of teeth-straightening issues in growing children from simple to complex, including crowding, spacing and narrow dental arches. Aiding in treatment engagement for those younger patients, Invisalign Stickables are innovative accessories designed exclusively for use with a patented SmartTrack material in Invisalign clear systems. Available in an array of designs, colors, shapes and themes, Invisalign Stickables are a fun way for patients to show their personal style during Invisalign treatment. During the quarter, we also hosted a successful virtual edition of GP Growth Summit attended by over 1,200 doctors from the EMEA region. 
For APAC, Q2 volumes were up sequentially 4.8% and 50% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting growth across the region, led by Japan, China and ANZ despite new and extended COVID restrictions in several APAC markets. APAC performance reflects strength in GP channel with increased Invisalign submitters, especially in Japan which continues to deliver strong growth. During the quarter, we hosted our China Forum attended by over 1,500 doctors from private clinics, our APAC Virtual Symposium attended by 1,400 doctors, as well as the China Public Hospital Forum in June. 
Our consumer marketing is focused on educating consumers about the Invisalign system and driving that demand for Invisalign doctor's offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles. We have provided many of our key metrics that show increased activity engagement with the Invisalign brand in our Q2 quarterly presentation slides available on aligntech.com. 
In Q2, we launched the next generation of ""Invis is"" multitouch campaign, driving reach and awareness with adult mom and teen consumers, yielding more than 200% growth in visitors globally to our websites and more than 82% increase in searches for an Invisalign-trained doctor. Leading with the ""Invis is not your parents' braces"" campaign, we connected with teens, utilizing digital media such as YouTube, Twitch and social media. We also continued with our Invisalign ChangeMakers program that celebrated and recognized teens driving change in their communities, which was covered by multiple media outlets such as Elite Daily, Refinery29, Yahoo! Unwind, Hollywood Life, SheKnows, J-14, Yahoo Finance, Parents.com, Glamour and NewBeauty, and generated more than 600 million impressions. 
In EMEA region, our new marketing campaign to drive engagement, ""Invis is a powerful thing,"" went live in the U.K., Germany and France during the quarter, resulting in more than 170% year-over-year increase in unique visitors and 136% year-over-year increase in doctor locator searches. We will continue to roll out the campaign to additional markets in the region during the third quarter. We continued to expand our consumer advertising in the APAC region in Australia, Japan and China and saw more than an 800% increase in consumer engagement and 55% year-over-year increase in leads. 
Lastly, we continue to build strong relationship with global search and social media giants like Google, Snapchat and TikTok in order to further leverage our best-in-class consumer demand programs more effective globally. These partners recognize the power of the Invisalign brand and are helping us to amplify and gain efficiencies from our investments. 
For our Systems and Services business, Q2 revenues were up 20% sequentially and up 214% year-over-year, reflecting strong scanner shipments and services. This represents the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. 
The iTero Element 5D Plus imaging system continues to gain traction across all regions, with strong adoption with new customers in the APAC and EMEA regions and with existing customers in the Americas region. In APAC, the iTero Element 2 intraoral scanner did well during the quarter, helping to transform digital workflows and chairside consults for doctors. During the quarter, we announced a new iTero Workflow 2.0 software and previewed auto-upload functionality in the iTero Element 5D imaging system. The iTero Workflow 2.0 software's advanced features include faster scanning, improved visualization and enhanced patient communication tools, were rolled out regionally in all markets where the iTero Element Plus imaging systems are sold. The iTero Element 5D imaging system auto-upload feature will eliminate steps and streamline Invisalign case submissions, with intraoral color scan images that can be used in place of traditional intraoral photos. The auto-upload functionality is scheduled for release during the third quarter of 2021. 
There's great symmetry between Systems and Services business with Clear Aligner business reflected in the positive correlation between the deployment of scanners and the increased utilization of Invisalign clear aligners. In terms of digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions, total digital scans in Q2 increased to 82.2% from 78.5% in Q2 last year. International scans increased to 76.2%, up from 72% in the same quarter last year. For the Americas, 86.6% of cases were submitted digitally compared to 86% a year ago. Cumulatively, over 40.1 million orthodontic scans and 8.4 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. I'm also pleased to share that Align received regulatory approval for the iTero 5D Plus Series in Japan on July 1, with a formal launch event planned for August. 
Turning to exocad. During the quarter, exocad launched the Creator Center, the new exocad one-stop shop for online and in-person educational events, with a database consisting of 35 educational webinars showcasing the highlights and add-on features of exocad's software solutions, DentalCAD Galway 3.0, exoplan 3.0 Galway. More than 2,500 users and distributors have been trained on the new software releases worldwide. 
exocad has also expanded their market coverage with a new global OEM partner, Ivoclar Vivadent, or we call IV, one of the largest manufacturers in the dental industry. This strategic collaboration will give exocad access to thousands of new IV users worldwide, will also provide exocad users with access to production processes with removable prosthetics in the future. 
Earlier this month, exocad has released PartialCAD 3.0 Galway, its module for removable partial dental frameworks, which has new and advanced features for the design of high-quality partial dentures. This new release enhances digital CAD/CAM possibilities for exocad users and dental technicians by providing simpler design solutions for complex cases. PartialCAD 3.0 Galway provide both experts and new users with smooth, improved integration with DentalCAD, exocad's leading software for dental laboratories. 
Bringing the iTero and exocad businesses together makes us more viable within the GP segment and more relevant in day-to-day comprehensive dentistry for our customers. The combination of Invisalign clear aligners and iTero scanners have long provided a seamless workflow for orthodontic treatment. The integration of exocad's expertise in restorative dentistry and implantology, guided surgery and smile design takes the Align technical portfolio beyond our established footprint in orthodontics to ortho-restorative and restorative treatment and paves the way for new, cross-disciplinary workflows that span from visualization and treatment planning to lab production to chairside. exocad also broadens Align's platform reach in digital dentistry with over 200 partners and more than 40,000 licenses installed worldwide. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to John."

Now for our Q2 financial",1573,"Thanks, Joe. Let me begin by reminding everyone that for Align and many companies, Q2 2020 was significantly impacted by COVID-19 business disruptions, and comparisons of our results for Q2 2021 should be considered accordingly. 
Now for our Q2 financial results. Total revenues for the second quarter were $1 billion, up 13% from the prior quarter and up 186.9% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. 
For Clear Aligners, Q2 revenues of $841 million were up 11.6% sequentially and up 181.9% year-over-year, reflecting Invisalign volume growth in most geographies. In Q2, we shipped a record 665,600 Invisalign cases, an increase of 11.7% sequentially and 200% year-over-year. In addition, we shipped to a record 83,500 Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which approximately 7,200 were first-time customers. 
Q2 Clear Aligner revenues reflect strong growth across the Invisalign portfolio for both comprehensive and noncomprehensive products. Q2 comprehensive volume increased 11.4% sequentially and 181.9% year-over-year. In Q2, non-comprehensive volume increased 12.3% sequentially, driven by strength in Invisalign Moderate and Invisalign Go and up 251.7% year-over-year. Q2 adult patients increased 12.6% sequentially and 220.4% year-over-year. In Q2, teens or younger patients increased 9.5% sequentially and 156.3% year-over-year. Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $3.4 million or approximately 0.5 points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $36.7 million or approximately 12.3 points. 
For Q2, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs decreased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs reflect higher discounts, credits and foreign exchange, partially offset by regional mix. On a year-over-year basis, comprehensive ASPs reflect the increase in net revenue deferrals for new Invisalign cases versus additional aligner shipments, partially offset by foreign exchange. Recall Q2 2020 ASPs increased as a result of more additional shipments -- of aligner shipments as doctors were focused on maintaining treatment progress for existing Invisalign patients. This trend reversed itself after practices reopened in Q3 and demand for new cases ramped up significantly. 
Q2 Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and were flat year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs reflect lower discounts, partially offset by foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs were favorably impacted by foreign exchange, offset by higher mix of new Invisalign cases versus additional aligner shipments. 
Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $101 million sequentially and $337 million year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. 
Our System and Services revenues for the second quarter were a record $169.8 million, up 20% sequentially and up 214.7% year-over-year. The increase sequentially and year-over-year can be attributed to increased scanner shipments, higher ASP and increased services revenue for our larger installed base. Our Systems and Services revenue -- deferred revenue on the balance sheet was up 22% sequentially and up 135% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. 
Moving on to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin was 75%, down 0.6 points sequentially and up 11.4 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition, overall gross margin was 75.4% for the second quarter, down 0.7 points sequentially and up 11 points year-over-year. Overall, gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately 1.1 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange and relatively unchanged sequentially. 
Clear Aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 76.9%, down 0.7 points sequentially due to higher freight costs and slightly lower ASPs. Clear Aligner gross margin was up 12.4 points year-over-year due to increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes, partially offset by lower ASPs. Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was a record 65.9%, up 0.5 points sequentially, primarily due to higher ASPs, partially offset by manufacturing variances and higher freight costs. Systems and Services gross margin was up 6.6 points year-over-year due to higher ASPs and services revenues in addition to improved manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes, partially offset by higher freight costs. 
Q2 operating expenses were $489.6 million, up sequentially 8.4% and up 64.7% year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating expenses is due to increased consumer marketing spend, increased compensation related to additional head count and higher commissions and other general and administrative costs. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $192.3 million, reflecting our continued investment in marketing and sales and R&D activities and investments commensurate with business growth. On a non-GAAP basis, which includes (sic) [ excludes ] stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition, operating expenses were $461.2 million, up sequentially 8.6% and up 73.6% year-over-year due to the reasons described above. 
Our second quarter operating income of $268.9 million resulted in an operating margin of 26.6%, up 1.4 points versus prior quarter and up 47.3 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin was attributed primarily to operational leverage. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was primarily attributed to higher gross margin and operating leverage as well as a favorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 1.8 points. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles, operating margin for the second quarter was 29.8%, up 1.2 points sequentially and up 40.8 points year-over-year. 
Interest and other income and expense net for the second quarter was a loss of $0.1 million, down sequentially by $36.3 million primarily due to the SDC arbitration award gain recorded in the first quarter. 
With regards to the second quarter tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was 25.7%, which was higher than the prior quarter rate of 23.4%, primarily due to lower excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our GAAP tax rate was lower than the same quarter last year, which was 44.8%, primarily due to foreign income tax at lower rates. The second quarter tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 19.5% compared to 20.2% in the prior quarter and 27.8% in the prior year. The second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was lower than the prior quarter and the second quarter of the prior year rates due to foreign income tax and lower rates. 
Second quarter net income per diluted share was $2.51, flat sequentially and up $3.03 compared to the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $3.04 for the second quarter, up $0.55 sequentially and up $3.39 year-over-year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 billion, flat sequentially. Of our $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $551 million was held in the U.S., and $535.3 million was held by our international entities. Q2 accounts receivable balance was $808.1 million, up approximately 12.4% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 72 days, flat sequentially and down approximately 49.1 days as compared to Q2 last year. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $317.5 million. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $124.2 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $193.3 million. We also have $300 million available under our revolving line of credit. Under our $1 billion repurchase program announced in May 2021, we have $900 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock. 
Now let me turn to our outlook and the factors that inform our view for the remainder of the year. Overall, we are very pleased with our second quarter results and our continued strong performance across regions, customer channels and products. While there continues to be uncertainty around the pandemic and increasing restrictions related to COVID-19 in certain geographies, we are continuing to invest in our strategic growth initiatives, including sales, marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity, to drive demand and conversion globally and are confident in our competitive position and ability to execute. At the same time, we are also anticipating more pronounced summer seasonality across all regions than we have experienced in recent years as doctors, their staff and patients take long overdue vacations. 
Notwithstanding seasonality, given our strong performance and continued confidence in the huge market opportunity, our industry leadership and our ability to execute, we are increasing our 2021 revenue guidance provided in April on the Q1 '21 earnings call to a range of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion. Additionally, we now expect our second half year-over-year revenue growth rate to be above the midpoint of our long-term operating model target of 20% to 30%. On a GAAP basis, we now anticipate our 2021 operating margin to be better than our prior guidance in the range of 24% to 25%. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the 2021 operating margin to be approximately 3 points higher than our GAAP operating margin after excluding stock-based compensation and intangible amortization. 
In addition, during Q3 '21, we expect to repurchase up to $75 million of our common stock through either a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. For 2021, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. This includes our planned investment in a new manufacturing facility in Poland, our first one in the EMEA region. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?"

We truly value their increasing adoption of digital treatment approaches. Their confidence in the unique Align Digital Platform that spans from iTero to the world's most sophisticated treatment planning, the world's largest 3D printing business on the globe to a patient app worth -- with over -- with 1 million consumers along with the world's most recognized orthodontic brand has driven strong performance across the business. 
Our performance over the last year confirms the incredible size of our target market and demonstrates that our strategy and investments in recent years have helped further solidify our competitive position. We have numerous growth drivers in a vastly underpenetrated market. And while we continue to see some lasting impact and continued uncertainty due to COVID, we remain confident in both the enormous opportunity we have to lead the evolution of digital orthodontics and comprehensive dentistry with our doctor customers and in our ability to execute our strategy to increase adoption of Invisalign treatment globally. 
We're also confident in and excited about the benefits of digital treatment that more and more doctors are experiencing by transforming their practices with Invisalign digital orthodontics and iTero scanners for chairside treatment, planning and visualization. In fact, Invisalign treatment requires, on an average, 30% fewer doctor visits than fixed appliances, creating efficiency gains for the doctors and a better patient experience. And 85% of orthodontists surveyed agreed that adopting the Align Digital Platform have made a huge difference in their practices. It provides ways to improve their efficiency and productivity. 
I look forward to updating you at the GP Summit and Investor Day in October in Las Vegas and sharing more examples of how Align is helping doctors transform their practices and their approach to treatment.

So it's a combination of our brand. It's a combination of a digital platform with iTero. It's a combination of product piece. 
And then we don't talk about it a lot, but we split our sales force years ago. And we have a specific focused sales force on GPs. And being a GP speak a different language, Jon. It's different than orthodontists altogether. And that team has been incredibly effective in being able to work with doctors, how they can integrate Invisalign into their workflow and, from a restorative standpoint, how you use this proactively. So we're -- I'm confident. That's a great market for us.

Second question, John, just let me try to be as detailed as possible. So you've got solid 2Q '21 sales upside that you just reported. Then you raised the back part of the year from roughly 25% year-over-year revenue midpoint growth to closer to 27%. Yet you call out some more pronounced summer seasonality. And those seem at odds with one another. So can you just reconcile those 2 data points? In other words, you're alluding to more seasonality.

Just curious on your view and whether that's kind of starting to have any sort of impact or is it too early and then how you plan to maybe position yourself to kind of keep ahead of the peers. 
And then secondly, just around China, I guess it's another kind of competition question with, I guess, your largest but still relatively small competitor going public. How are you kind of viewing that market now with kind of another, I guess, well-funded competitor out there in terms of the ability to grow the market or kind of go after a potential segment of that market, whether it's the more luxury-focused patients?

So it's various polymers that you put together, and we're balancing the equation between elasticity and overall rigidity or tensile strength. And it's like our other competitors are starting to figure that piece out and see pieces of it. We have strong patents around SmartTrack and obviously improvement over time. It's a real important part about not just having the right materials but having the right kind of system in place, and that's a treatment planning part that we talked about, 25 years of understanding how to really activate those aligners and make that plastic actually work through those algorithms. And we don't use the displacement methodology, which is basically building wire that kind of leads things. It actually engages with these things in a different way. 
So I expect more companies to come out and work different polymers or whatever. We have a huge amount of experience to that, but don't forget about the entire system, the algorithms, how it works together and how it works with attachments, the exactness of those attachments, where you put those attachments, how they're shaped. There's a lot going on there. We feel good about our position, and we'll continue to innovate in that space across all those spectrums. But there's nothing in the competitive marketplace that we are concerned with that would change the trajectory of where we're investing right now. 
From a China competitive standpoint, obviously, Angelalign IPO, we watch that closely. And it gives some clarity to everybody in that marketplace as they IPO-ed and what's going on. And I think you see they're strong in Tier 3 cities. They're strong with public hospitals in different areas and -- but look, we -- I feel good about our position in China. Our manufacturing is strong. Our training centers there are strong. Our treatment planning is strong. It's close to accounts.

John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. 
I'm pleased to report strong third quarter results with revenue growth of 38.4% year-over-year on top of a record third quarter last year, driven by the strength across all regions, customer channels and products. For Q3, we shipped to a record 85,500 doctors in the quarter and reached 11.6 million Invisalign patients cumulatively. 
On a sequential basis, Q3 results reflect continued adoption of iTero scanners and increased utilization of Invisalign Clear Aligners in the Americas and APAC regions as well as the growth in Teen segment, especially in the North American orthodontic channel. 
Our third quarter revenues reflect a growing confidence of doctors and patients with Invisalign treatment, iTero scanners and exocad software as more doctors discover the benefits of digital treatment and transform their practices with the Align digital platform. For Q3, Systems and Services revenues were up 57.3% year-over-year with strong revenue growth across all regions and up 5% sequentially primarily in North America. Q3 results reflect the continued adoption of iTero Element 5D Plus Series, our next-generation scanners and imaging system, which launched earlier this year and feature innovative technology like near-infrared technology, we call NIRI, which age and detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions or cavities above the gingiva without harmful radiation. 
For Q3, Clear Aligners revenues were up 34.9% year-over-year with strong revenue growth across all regions and across the portfolio, including comprehensive and non-comprehensive products as well as Invisalign Moderate and Invisalign Go. On a sequential basis, Q3 Clear Aligner revenues were down very slightly from record Q2, reflecting more pronounced summer seasonality than last year, especially in EMEA where practices and patients appear to have taken extended holidays and where offices were impacted due to resurgence of COVID-19 cases and restrictions, especially in some markets in Asia Pacific. 
In the Teen segment, Q3 '21 Invisalign Clear Aligner volumes for teens were strong, up 13.8% sequentially and 26.6% year-over-year to a record 206,000 teens, representing approximately 1/3 of total cases shipped, with strong shipment growth from North American orthodontists and a record quarter for Teen in APAC. 
Our third quarter revenues also include non-case revenue for clinical training and education and doctor-prescribed retainer products. Retention is a critical part of creating and maintaining a beautiful new smile. Retainers prevent teeth from gradually shifting back to their initial positions after treatment ends. Studies show that without retention, even perfectly aligned teeth can gradually revert to their pre-treatment state and that dentition continues to change as patients age, often requiring limited treatment, also known as touch-up treatment if not properly retained. 
Our retention products are designed to maintain teeth that have been aligned by Invisalign aligners, braces or other aligners. These retainer products can accommodate lingual bars, wires, also known as a permanent retainer, missing teeth that require an artificial tooth and bite ramps, also known as turbos or blocks. 
While our retainer business continues to deliver solid revenue growth, our share of retention market is significantly underpenetrated, even more so than in our share of the orthodontic case starts. We have been developing a robust retainer strategy, including a separate marketing team focused solely on driving adoption and increasing market share in the United States. 
Our objective is to build brand awareness for Vivera retainers and drive engagement with doctors through clinical education and sales initiatives while connecting consumers to doctors through demand creation programs and our concierge service. We've also recently implemented social media campaigns featuring the benefits of Vivera from the makers of Invisalign Clear Aligners. We believe that incremental investments will provide increased value for Invisalign practices and drive growth consistent with our long-term financial model target. 
In addition, we successfully rolled out a limited pilot program to participating Invisalign providers in the United States and Canada that offers a monthly targeted subscription program to address the unmet patient demand for retention or touch-up cases. Our goal is to encourage experienced high volume in Invisalign practices who regularly treat patients with our comprehensive products to offer premium retention or entry-level products for the long-term health of their patients and to grow their businesses. 
Practices in this pilot program can purchase a monthly subscription at a fixed price based on our monthly needs for retention or limited treatment. The program allows doctors the flexibility to order both touch-up or retention aligners with their tier subscription. The program is designed for a segment of experienced Invisalign doctors who are not regularly using our retainers or low-stage aligners. 
The positive feedback from our doctors have been encouraging. For instance, the doctors at Bray and Tarvy told us the program is very straightforward and easy to understand, and they've been hoping Align will do something like this. Dr. Jonathan Nicosisis at Princeton Orthodontics called the program a home run. We went -- he went on to predict it should replace the idea that doctors invest in 3D printing and the additional complications and expenses it requires, including the need for a full-time employee and additional overhead costs, particularly because he believes his treatment outcomes are always better with Align. 
Q3 non-case revenues also included accessories and consumables such as aligner cases called clam shells, cleaning crystals and other oral health products that are available on our e-commerce channels in the U.S. only, including the Invisalign accessory store, Walmart and Amazon. In Q3, we announced an exclusive supply distribution agreement with UltraGen Products Inc., a leading developer and manufacturer of high-tech dental materials, devices and instruments worldwide. 
The Invisalign Professional Whitening program powered by Opalescence is optimized for Invisalign aligners and Vivera retainers and is available only through Invisalign-trained doctors. Also in Q3, we launched the Invisalign Whitening Pen through an e-commerce channels in the U.S. only. The Whitening Pen is an over-the-counter retail product for consumers seeking quick tooth whitening at a lower price and is not intended to be used with aligners. The Whitening Pen complements the other accessory products that Align already marks to consumers through its existing e-commerce channels and is a key addition to our consumable product portfolio. 
Now let's turn to the specifics around our third quarter results, starting with the Americas. For the Americas, Q3 results reflected strong performance, including record revenues for Latin America as well as summer seasonality for adult case starts in North America that primarily impacted GP practices, strong ortho performance, especially in the teen market that included increased utilization from the orthodontic channel. Invisalign case volume was up 0.7% sequentially and up 36.4% year-over-year, reflecting growth across the region, especially in LatAm. DSO utilization continued to be a strong growth driver as well, led by Heartland and Smile Docs. 
For our international business, Q3 Invisalign case volume was up 27% year-over-year on top of record growth in the same quarter last year. On a sequential basis, international shipments were down sequentially 4.3% primarily as a result of greater seasonality and COVID-related shutdowns in APAC markets. For EMEA, Q3 Invisalign case volumes were up 49.6% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across all markets led by the U.K. and Iberia along with continued growth in our expansion markets in Central and Eastern Europe and the Benelux. 
For Q3, year-over-year Invisalign volume in EMEA was driven by increased submitters from both orthodontists and GPs and increased utilization primarily from orthos. On a sequential basis, EMEA was down sequentially 16.5% following a record Q2 primarily as a result of the extended seasonality we had anticipated primarily from summer holidays and vacations across the region. 
For APAC, Q3 volumes were up 4.2% compared to a record Q3 last year in APAC. On a year-over-year basis, growth was uneven. The market as APAC, the first region to emerge from the depth of the COVID lockdown in 2020. Additionally, we saw COVID resurgences and locked down sporadically impact various APAC countries in Q3. 
On a sequential basis, Q3 Invisalign volumes were up 21.2% reflecting growth across the region, led by a record quarter in China, especially from teen cases as well as strong growth in Japan and ANZ. In Q3, growth from both channels was strong with ortho growth driven by increased Invisalign utilization and GP growth -- channel growth driven by increased Invisalign submitters. 
APAC teen shipments reached an all-time high in Q3. At the recent 10th China Finance Summit Awards, Align was recognized as the 2021 most innovative enterprise for its advancements and outstanding contributions in the field of digital orthodontics. This award builds on our prior recognition of Align's leadership in the digital orthodontics industry and its efforts to promote the modernization of orthodontics. 
Our consumer marketing focuses on educating consumers about the Invisalign system to drive demand to Invisalign doctor's offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles. 
In Q3, we expanded the next generation of the Invis is media campaign across EMEA, APAC and Brazil to increase awareness with adult, mom and teen consumers. Globally, we delivered 6.45 billion impressions, growing 42% year-over-year resulting in a 70% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our websites. In the U.S., we connected with teens on Snapchat, YouTube and Twitch with our Invis is it's not your parent's braces campaign. These campaigns continue to feature some of the largest teen influencers from our Invisalign Smile Squad, like Charli D’Amelio, Marsai Martin, Michael Lean Collins and Devon Key. These influencers share their personal experience with Invisalign treatment, including why they chose Invisalign treatment to shape their smiles. 
As part of our focus on teens, with our Invisalign ChangeMakers program, we held a recognition event hosted by Marsai Martin, with teams across the country to celebrate and recognize 100 teams across the country who drove positive change within their communities. 
To continue growing for our young adult businesses, we expanded the Invis is powerful think campaign, which highlights how powerful the smile transformation with Invisalign treatment can be for their self-confidence. In the U.S., we expanded our Invisalign Smile Squad to include young adult influencers such as Cody Rigsby, Lana Candor and Emily Hampshire, will help to deliver over 405 million impressions. Additionally, our influencer partnerships with TikTok creators helped increase traffic to our sites with a 127% increase in click-through rates. 
In Brazil, we launched the Invis is a powerful thing campaign and teamed up with mega-influencer, to increase website traffic by 30%. In the EMEA region, we expanded into new media channels such as TikTok and Snapchat across the U.K., Germany and France to drive engagement. These efforts led to more than 153% increase in unique visitors. We also started consumer advertising in Russia, which resulted in more of a 1,000 increase in unique visitors to our website. 
In Q3, we continue to expand our consumer advertising across the APAC region experienced a 132% increase in unique visitors to our websites. In Australia, we expanded our media mix to include partners such as TikTok and Snapchat, which resulted in a 250% growth year-over-year in unique visitors to our website. 
In Japan, we continue to see a strong response from consumers to our Invis is campaign, resulting more than an 800% increase year-over-year in unique visitors to our website. Adoption of our consumer and patient app, My Invisalign, continued to increase in Q3 with 1.2 million downloads to date. Usage of our 4 digital tools also continue to increase. For example, our Invisalign Virtual Appointment tool was used over 15,000 times and our insurance verification feature was used 14,000 times in Q3. Furthermore, we received more than 1.5 million patient photos in our Virtual Care feature to date globally, which continues to provide us with rich data to leverage our AI capabilities and improve our services for doctors that is used to enhance their patient's care. 
For our Systems and Services business, Q3 revenues grew 57.3% year-over-year reflecting strong scanner shipments and services and was up 5% sequentially. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth for our Systems and Services business. The iTero Element 5D Plus Imaging System continue gaining traction across all regions, with the most recent launch in Japan in Q3. The iTero Element 5D Plus Imaging System will be available in China in Q4 of this year. Additionally, the iTero Element Plus Series was launched in Korea in Q3. 
The series expands the portfolio of iTero Element scanners and imaging systems to include new solutions that serve the needs of a broader range of doctors and patients in the dental market. Moreover, I'm proud to say that in a recent clinical study, the iTero Element 5D intraoral scanner was found to be more sensitive than bite wing radiology in detecting early enamel lesions, providing further evidence of the benefits of iTero 5D scanner in detection and monitoring of enproximaal caries lesions or cavities above the ginger without exposing patients to harmful ionizing radiation. 
This is great news for our iTero business as the study further supports the diagnostic validity of near-infrared imaging technology offered by the iTero 5D scanner for early proximal caries detection. 
The findings also underscore the valuable role that NIRI technology can have in dental health assessment and early detection of cavities, which is important to the overall oral health care treatment options and a comfortable safe experience for a broad population of patients. A strong indicator of the digital acceleration with dental offices is a number of intraoral digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions. 
Total worldwide intraoral digital scans used to start in Invisalign case in Q3 increased 84.2% from 78.3% in Q3 last year. International intraoral scans for Invisalign case submissions increased 79.3%, up from 72.1% in the same last year. 
For the Americas, 88% of cases were submitted using an intraoral digital scan compared to 83.2% a year ago. Cumulatively, over 44.9 million orthodontic scans and 9.3 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. 
Our Q3 Systems and Services revenues also includes exocad, CAD/CAM products and services. exocad's expertise in restorative dentistry, implantology, guided surgery and spell design, extends our digital dental solutions and broadens Align's digital platform towards fully integrated interdisciplinary and workflows. We remain excited about our continued integration progress and product plans with exocad. 
During the quarter, exocad launched CAD 3.0 Galway, the next generation of exocad's easy-to-use CAD software for single-visit dentistry. The software has improved automation for fast crown design and enables users to integrate open hardware and materials of choice. exocad's CAD received 2021 Celeron's Best-of-Class Technology award for the third consecutive year. 
Also during the quarter, exocad has its largest ever presence at IDS, the International Dental Show, where they showcased their seamless digital workflows and the simplicity of the use of exocad's Galway software release. Exocad was the only company at IDS to showcase live patient treatment with a smile creator experience station featuring iTero scans, instant smile makeovers and production of clip on smiles. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to John."

Total revenues for the third quarter were $1.016 billion, up 0.5% from the prior quarter and up 38.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For Clear Aligners, Q3 revenues of $837.6 million were down 0.4% sequentially and up 34.9% year-over-year, reflecting Invisalign volume growth across all geographies. 
In Q3, we shipped 655,100 Invisalign cases, a decrease of 1.6% sequentially and with an increase of 32.1% year-over-year. In addition, we shipped to a record 85,500 Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which approximately 7,200 were first-time customers. 
Q3 Clear Aligner revenues reflect strong growth across the Invisalign portfolio, led by comprehensive products. Q3 comprehensive volume increased 1.3% sequentially and 30.3% year-over-year. And Q3 non-comprehensive volume decreased 8.1% sequentially and increased 36.8% year-over-year. Q3 adult patients decreased 7.3% sequentially and increased 34.7% year-over-year. In Q3, teens or younger patients increased 13.8% sequentially and 26.6% year-over-year. 
Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $1.5 million or approximately 0.2 points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $16.1 million or approximately 2.6 points. 
For Q3, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional aligners. On a year-over-year basis, comprehensive ASPs reflect favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by the increase in net revenue deferrals for new Invisalign cases versus additional aligner shipments. 
Q3 Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional aligners, partially offset by higher discounts. On a year-over-year basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs were favorably impacted by foreign exchange, higher additional aligners and lower discounts. 
Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $84 million or 9.3% sequentially and $347.3 million or 53.9% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Our Systems and Services revenues for the third quarter were a record $178.3 million, up 5% sequentially and up 57.3% year-over-year. This marks the fifth quarter in a row of sequential revenue increase. 
The increase sequentially can be attributed to increased scanner shipments and increased services revenues from our larger installed base. The increase year-over-year can be attributed to increased scanner shipments, increased service revenues from our larger installed base as well as higher ASPs from a favorable mix shift towards higher-priced iTero 5D scanners and imaging systems. 
Our Systems and Services deferred revenue on the balance sheet was up $27.2 million or 17% sequentially and up $100.1 million or 115.2% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and deferral of services revenue, which we recognize ratably over the service period. 
Moving on to gross margin. Third quarter overall gross margin was 74.3%, down 0.7 points sequentially and up 1.6 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to our 2020 exocad acquisition, overall gross margin was 74.7% for the third quarter, down 0.7 points sequentially and up 1.4 points year-over-year. 
Overall gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately 0.5 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange and relatively unchanged sequentially. Clear Aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 76.2%, down 0.7 points sequentially due to higher manufacturing costs and higher additional aligners, partially offset by higher ASPs and lower freight. Clear Aligner gross margin was up 1.5 points year-over-year due to improved manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volume, partially offset by higher ASPs. 
Systems and Services gross margin for the third quarter was 65.6%, down 0.3 points sequentially primarily due to lower ASPs and higher manufacturing variances, partially offset by higher service revenue. Systems and Services gross margin was up 3.6 points year-over-year due to higher ASPs from product mix shift to iTero 5D and 5D Plus Series and service revenue, partially offset by higher freight costs. 
Q3 operating expenses were $494 million, up sequentially 0.9% and up 38.4% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up slightly by $4.4 million. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $137 million, reflecting increased headcount and our continued investment in marketing, sales and R&D activities and investments commensurate with business growth. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles and acquisition costs related to our 2020 exocad acquisition, operating expenses were $466.1 million, up sequentially 1% and up 40.3% year-over-year due to the reasons described earlier. 
Our third quarter operating income of $261.1 million resulted in an operating margin of 25.7%, down 0.9 points from the prior quarter and up 1.6 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin was attributable primarily to lower gross margin. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was primarily attributed to higher gross margin and operating leverage as well as the favorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 0.7 points, partially offset by continued investments as mentioned earlier. 
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related costs, the operating margin for the third quarter was 28.8%, down 0.9 points sequentially and up 0.8 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the third quarter was a gain of $0.8 million, up sequentially by $0.9 million and down year-over-year by $6.6 million. On a year-over-year basis, interest and other income and expense decreased primarily due to net foreign exchange losses in the 3 months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to net foreign exchange gains in the same period in 2020, which was partially offset by an unrealized gain on an investment held in a private company recognized in the 3 months ended September 30, 2021. 
The GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 30.9% compared to 25.7% in the second quarter and 24.5% in the third quarter of the prior year. On a non-GAAP -- our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.2% in the third quarter compared to 19.5% in the second quarter and 16.6% in the third quarter of the prior year. The third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were higher than the second quarter primarily due to our foreign income being taxed at different rates and tax true-ups. Our GAAP and non-GAAP third quarter effective tax rates were higher than the third quarter of the prior year primarily due to lower tax benefits from foreign income tax at lower rates and a tax benefit recognized last year resulting from an income tax audit settlement. 
Third quarter net income per diluted share was $2.28, down sequentially $0.23 and up $0.52 compared to the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.87 for the third quarter, down $0.17 sequentially and up $0.62 year-over-year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 billion, up sequentially $151.5 million and up $622.3 million year-over-year. Of our $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $607.5 million was held in the U.S. and $630.3 million was held by our international entities. 
Q3 accounts receivable balance was $855 million, up approximately 5.8% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 75 days, up approximately 3 days sequentially and down approximately 2 days as compared to Q3 last year. 
Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $355 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $124.3 million as we continue to invest in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $230.7 million. We also have $300 million available under our untapped revolving line of credit. 
Under our $1 billion repurchase program announced in May of 2021, we have $825 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock. 
Now let me turn to our outlook and the factors that inform our view for the remainder of the year. We are very pleased with our Q3 results and strong year-over-year growth, which reflects continued customer adoption of the iTero scanners and increased Invisalign utilization across customer channels, including teens, adults and young patients. 
Over the last 18 months, our investment decisions have helped drive and capture demand across all regions and customer channels. We continued spending in many areas and have seen good return on our investments and strong revenue growth. Consumer interest in improving smiles is high and doctor acceptance in the Align digital platform is helping drive growth across all regions and market segments. 
As anticipated in our Q3 outlook, we experienced more pronounced summer seasonality, more noticeably in September and continued into October as practices took more extended vacations and patient traffic flow was sporadically interrupted by regional COVID resurgence, restrictions and other lockdowns. We anticipate these COVID challenges and the general macroeconomic uncertainties to continue into Q4. 
Taking this all into account, as we look at the remainder of 2021, we expect revenues for the year to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion, at the high end of our original guidance range. We also expect our outlook and revenue growth for the second half of 2021 to be in the high end of our long-term operating model of 20% to 30%. 
On a GAAP basis, we anticipate our 2021 operating margin to be around 25%. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect 2021 operating margin to be approximately 3 points higher than our GAAP operating margin after excluding stock-based compensation and intangible amortization from our 2020 exocad acquisition. 
We remain confident in the huge market opportunities for our business, our industry leadership and our ability to execute. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity to drive our growth and accelerate adoption in a huge underpenetrated market. In addition, during Q4 2021, we expect to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock through either a combination of open-market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. 
For 2021, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to be above $400 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. This includes our planned investment in our new facility in Poland, the first in the EMEA region. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?"

In summary, Q3 was a strong quarter, and we're pleased with our performance across the business. Align is uniquely positioned. We have the clinical capability and product portfolio supported by doctor and patient workflows, only accessible through the proprietary Align digital platform to address the broadest range of orthodontic cases with the Invisalign system through a network of trained Invisalign doctors who have the expertise to reach more than the 500 million potential global patients. 
As we develop our annual plan for 2022 over the next few months, it's important that we continue to expand our commercial, manufacturing, R&D, clinical, treatment planning and manufacturing operations and continue to leverage our global quality and regulatory muscles in existing and emerging markets; reach millions of consumers who want to transform their smile with the most advanced Clear Aligner systems in the world through advertising, PR, digital, social media and influencer marketing to drive demand and conversion through Invisalign-trained doctors; increased ortho adoption and teen utilization of Invisalign treatment and train and educate GP dentists on how the iTero Element family of intraoral scanners and imaging systems propel today's dental practice into the future by enhancing patient experience and elevating clinical precision and in the benefits of digital dentistry with the Invisalign system, trusted by more than 11 million people worldwide to improve their smiles. 
We remain focused on strategic execution, accountability, agility, customer service excellence and continuing to make investments to grow our business. This is a multivariable equation that we continue to talk about and that, in combination, we remain uniquely able to offer. As we continue to stay the course with our strategic initiatives, we also continue to navigate the COVID-19 environment and the challenges and uncertainty that go with it. 
Throughout the pandemic, our top priority has been consistent. The health and safety of our employees and their families, doctors and their staff and that has not changed. The situation with COVID remains very fluid. And with the rise of the Delta variant, many cities, states and countries have issued or plan to issue new guidance including mask requirements, regular testing capacity limits and vaccination mandates. Operating in this evolving environment is challenging for everyone, and we are staying as close as we can to the situation. 
The shift from traditional analog wires and brackets to a fully end-to-end digital platform is not easy. It cannot be done without very complex and industry-leading technology and talented, passionate people. But the digital transformation in orthodontics is inevitable. Our technology is prevalent, touching every aspect of what we do for manufacturing excellence, where we currently produce over 750,000 unique aligners a day to expanding our geographic footprint to over 100 markets to building a network of over 210,000 trained Invisalign doctors and providing the technology to our doctors in a complete digital system, the Align digital platform. 
As the inventor of the leading Clear Aligner system, we've been investing in this therapy for over 24 years to get it to where it is today. And yet the majority of the market opportunity remains largely untapped, with over 500 million potential cases starts globally. Align is in a rare position to address this market with the Align digital platform powered by 2 decades of research and development, manufacturing excellence clinical data based on more than 11 million patients with AI machine learning and digital tools to help our doctors efficiently communicate with their patients, show and explain any issues and visualize potential treatment options. And together with doctors, we're going to unleash the power of digital for dentistry in orthodontics more than ever. 
Thank you for your time today. I look forward to speaking with you on Friday at our Investor Day. We will share more details on the Align digital platform and our vision and strategy to make Clear Aligner treatment available to everyone through doctors.

I mean we've been very pleased with our sequential improvements that we've seen in the Systems and Services and scanner services business. When we look at 5 quarters in a row of kind of really helping us lead the recovery out of COVID and a lot of investments that doctors are making -- our doctors are making in the digital platform, this is an excellent reflection of that. We have a lot of new doctors that started Invisalign this quarter with us, and many of them start with getting an iTero and being able to utilize that within their practice. 
So we feel very good about the scanner and services business. About 1/3 of that business is services. So that's the recurring. And as we improve and have more of an installed base, that just grows that business. So you've got a very big and growing installed base, coupled with great products that are really driving that adoption. And especially amongst newer doctors coming in, they're coming in with that scanner to really incorporate that digital technology into their practice."

And then, Joe, maybe a bigger picture question, just on kind of the return in the chair and what doctors seeing for Clear Aligners and Invisalign especially relative to braces. But we've talked to more and more docs just even over the last maybe few months who seem to be really spacing those follow-up visits in Invisalign out to 3 or even 4 months. It's cutting the chair time even in half relative to pre-COVID levels and well below braces. 
So are you seeing the same thing? I know virtual is helping that a little bit. I think some docs even doing it without virtual just given their confidence in outcomes. But how much is that kind of driving the argument in that kind of secular push into Clear Aligners, especially with staffing issues that maybe you guys are hearing about at some of the offices, things like that?"

Jeff, that's one of the key ingredients is the productivity of a doctor's time and the productivity of the real estate within that office. In a digital kind of situation, you can remote monitor it like you do on virtual care, some other products that are out there and doctors are taking advantage of that. But also, there's a lot of confidence doctors have, too, if their patients are using the aligners and they will bring them back every so often and take a look. So that's a big part of it. 
Secondly, Jeff, is it you can actually work with less labor content and less doctor content and people in the office and also size of the office, too. And you see a lot of orthodontists understanding that and really embracing it. There's also a referral aspect of Invisalign is once a patient has an experience with Invisalign, they're often ready to refer another patient to that doctor much more so than wires and brackets. And they benefit from that because they see an increase in their sales too. 
And we see that constantly and adapt and we focus on that and can actually predict it to a certain extent of time. So I hope I'm answering your question, Jeff, but that is the whole idea of digital and then we keep talking about our Align digital capability and being able to service a doctor through iTero, being having virtual care on both ends and having the kind of capability and horsepower that we can provide with our algorithms and the extent of our clinical capability is just -- it gives us a huge amount of breadth and capability at orthodontists."

And we've been talking about this over time until the beginning of this year, put a team together to really go after those things. 
It's hard to say the reason why. It's just we haven't been is focused on retention as we need to be. And many orthodontists like they make their own retainers. They do it because we just haven't been competitive in the sense of how we can deliver, how fast we can deliver, how easy we make it for them. But I guarantee you, if you go out, Brandon, and you query even orthodontists that seldom use our retainers, they'll tell you we make the best retainers in the world. 
And we should, when you make 750,000 unique parts a day, right? We know what we're doing, the fits or exquisite when you have an iTero scanner to be able to do that. And we set this thing up is a play for doctors that they can feel confident that we'll get these retainers to them in a quick amount of time. They're going to be terrific retainers, something they're proud to really get to their patients. And we've had great feedback on this so far.

When you can see caries, cavities, right, we use the clinical term. But when you can see cavities without ionizing radiation. And Brandon, what's amazing when you see this, too, what happens is the enamel almost becomes invisible. It's almost translucent. You can see through the enamel right to where the caries is. And there's a certain amount of training that has to be done in order to do it. 
And look, I grew up in an ionizing radiation business. I know what it is in CT and X-ray and it's -- that radiation component is better today than it used to be, but it still exists and patients are still concerned with it over time. And to be able to do this in a sense in a safe way and in a quick way like we do it. You know what it is to put bite wings in a chair, and it's terrible in a test chair, right? Bite down, turn your head sideways, I could go through it all day. 
And this is a quick scan, 1 minute scan, then don't have scan. It pops up on the screen. You can have a conversation with the patient and say, ""There it is, what it deals with. So yes, I think it's a killer application. Will we convince all GPs to buy iTero? No. But then you have to look at exocad, that critical workflow between labs and GPs really sets us up nicely for restorative pieces. 
Soon to announce Smile Architect, which really allows doctors to use restorative orthodontics as a standard of care. We'll talk about that more Friday. So -- and look, I'm biased I've been in the -- I'd say, the medical imaging equipment business for 15 years of my life count in iTero, this is the best scanner in the marketplace.

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights in the third quarter, then briefly discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, Systems Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more",2551,"Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights in the third quarter, then briefly discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, Systems Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.  
I'm pleased to report strong third quarter results with revenue growth of 38.4% year-over-year on top of a record third quarter last year, driven by the strength across all regions, customer channels and products. For Q3, we shipped to a record 85,500 doctors in the quarter and reached 11.6 million Invisalign patients cumulatively.  
On a sequential basis, Q3 results reflect continued adoption of iTero scanners and increased utilization of Invisalign Clear Aligners in the Americas and APAC regions as well as the growth in Teen segment, especially in the North American orthodontics channel. Our third quarter revenues reflect a growing confidence of doctors and patients with Invisalign treatment, iTero scanners and exocad software as more doctors discover the benefits of digital treatment and transform their practices with the Align Digital Platform. 
For Q3, Systems and Services revenues were up 57.3% year-over-year with strong revenue growth across all regions and up 5% sequentially primarily in North America. Q3 results reflect the continued adoption of iTero Element 5D Plus Series, our next-generation scanners and imaging system, which launched earlier this year and feature innovative technology like near-infrared technology, we call NIRI, which aids and detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions or cavities above the gingiva without harmful radiation.  
For Q3, Clear Aligner revenues were up 34.9% year-over-year with strong revenue growth across all regions and across the portfolio, including comprehensive and non-comprehensive products as well as Invisalign Moderate and Invisalign Go. On a sequential basis, Q3 Clear Aligner revenues were down very slightly from record Q2, reflecting more pronounced summer seasonality than last year, especially in EMEA where practices and patients appear to have taken extended holidays and where offices were impacted due to resurgence of COVID-19 cases and restrictions, especially in some markets in Asia Pacific.
In the Teen segment, Q3 '21 Invisalign Clear Aligner volumes for teens were strong, up 13.8% sequentially and 26.6% year-over-year to a record 206,000 teens, representing approximately 1/3 of total cases shipped, with strong shipment growth from North American orthodontists and a record quarter for Teen in APAC.
Our third quarter revenues also include non-case revenue for clinical training and education and doctor-prescribed retainer products. Retention is a critical part of creating and maintaining a beautiful new smile. Retainers prevent teeth from gradually shifting back to their initial positions after treatment ends. Studies show that without retention, even perfectly aligned teeth can gradually revert to their pre-treatment state and that dentition continues to change as patients age, often requiring limited treatment, also known as touch-up treatment if not properly retained.  
Our retention products are designed to maintain teeth that have been aligned by Invisalign aligners, braces or other aligners. These retainer products can accommodate lingual bars, wires, also known as a permanent retainer, missing teeth that require an artificial tooth and bite ramps, also known as turbos or blocks.  
While our retainer business continues to deliver solid revenue growth, our share of retention market is significantly underpenetrated, even more so than in our share of the orthodontic case starts. We have been developing a robust retainer strategy, including a separate marketing team focused solely on driving adoption and increasing market share in the United States.  
Our objective is to build brand awareness for Vivera retainers and drive engagement with doctors through clinical education and sales initiatives, while connecting consumers to doctors through demand creation programs and our concierge service. We've also recently implemented social media campaigns featuring the benefits of Vivera from the makers of Invisalign Clear Aligners. We believe that incremental investments will provide increased value for Invisalign practices and drive growth consistent with our long-term financial model target.  
In addition, we successfully rolled out a limited pilot program to participating Invisalign providers in the United States and Canada that offers a monthly targeted subscription program to address the unmet patient demand for retention or touch-up cases. Our goal is to encourage experienced high volume in Invisalign practices who regularly treat patients with our comprehensive products to offer premium retention or entry-level products for the long-term health of their patients and to grow their businesses.  
Practices in this pilot program can purchase a monthly subscription at a fixed price based on their monthly needs for retention or limited treatment. The program allows doctors the flexibility to order both touch-up or retention aligners with their tiered subscription. The program is designed for a segment of experienced Invisalign doctors who are not regularly using our retainers or low-stage aligners.  
The positive feedback from our doctors have been encouraging. For instance, the doctors at Bray and Tarby told us the program is very straightforward and easy to understand, and they've been hoping Align will do something like this. Dr. Jonathan Nicozisis at Princeton Orthodontics called the program a home run. We went -- he went on to predict it should replace the idea that doctors invest in 3D printing and the additional complications and expenses it requires, including the need for a full-time employee and additional overhead costs, particularly because he believes his treatment outcomes are always better with Align.  
Q3 non-case revenues also included accessories and consumables such as aligner cases called clam shells, cleaning crystals and other oral health products that are available on our e-commerce channels in the U.S. only, including the Invisalign accessory store, Walmart and Amazon. In Q3, we announced an exclusive supply distribution agreement with Ultradent Products Inc., a leading developer and manufacturer of high-tech dental materials, devices and instruments worldwide.  
The Invisalign Professional Whitening program powered by Opalescence is optimized for Invisalign aligners and Vivera retainers and is available only through Invisalign-trained doctors. Also in Q3, we launched the Invisalign Whitening Pen through an e-commerce channels in the U.S. only. 
The Whitening Pen is an over-the-counter retail product for consumers seeking quick tooth whitening at a lower price and is not intended to be used with aligners. The Whitening Pen complements the other accessory products that Align already markets to consumers through its existing e-commerce channels and is a key addition to our consumable product portfolio.  
Now let's turn to the specifics around our third quarter results, starting with the Americas. For the Americas, Q3 results reflected strong performance, including record revenues for Latin America as well as summer seasonality for adult case starts in North America that primarily impacted GP practices, strong ortho performance, especially in the teen market that included increased utilization from the orthodontic channel. 
Invisalign case volume was up 0.7% sequentially and up 36.4% year-over-year, reflecting growth across the region, especially in LatAm. DSO utilization continued to be a strong growth driver as well, led by Heartland and Smile Docs.  
For our international business, Q3 Invisalign case volume was up 27% year-over-year on top of record growth in the same quarter last year. On a sequential basis, international shipments were down sequentially 4.3%, primarily as a result of greater seasonality and COVID-related shutdowns in APAC markets. For EMEA, Q3 Invisalign case volumes were up 49.6% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across all markets led by the U.K. and Iberia, along with continued growth in our expansion markets in Central and Eastern Europe and the Benelux.  
For Q3, year-over-year Invisalign volume in EMEA was driven by increased submitters from both orthodontists and GPs and increased utilization primarily from orthos. On a sequential basis, EMEA was down sequentially 16.5% following a record Q2, primarily as a result of the extended seasonality we had anticipated primarily from summer holidays and vacations across the region.
For APAC, Q3 volumes were up 4.2% compared to a record Q3 last year in APAC. On a year-over-year basis, growth was uneven. The market as APAC, the first region to emerge from the depths of the COVID lockdown in 2020. Additionally, we saw COVID resurgences and lockdowns sporadically impact various APAC countries in Q3.  
On a sequential basis, Q3 Invisalign volumes were up 21.2% reflecting growth across the region, led by a record quarter in China, especially from teen cases as well as strong growth in Japan and ANZ. And Q3, growth from both channels was strong, with ortho growth driven by increased Invisalign utilization and GP growth -- channel growth driven by increased Invisalign submitters.  
APAC teen shipments reached an all-time high in Q3. At the recent 10th China Finance Summit Awards, Align was recognized as the 2021 most innovative enterprise for its advancements and outstanding contributions in the field of digital orthodontics. This award builds on our prior recognition of Align's leadership in the digital orthodontics industry and its efforts to promote the modernization of orthodontics.  
Our consumer marketing focuses on educating consumers about the Invisalign system to drive demand to Invisalign doctor's offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles.
In Q3, we expanded the next generation of the ""Invis is"" media campaign across EMEA, APAC and Brazil to increase awareness with adult, mom and teen consumers. Globally, we delivered 6.45 billion impressions, growing 42% year-over-year, resulting in a 70% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our websites. 
In the U.S., we connected with teens on Snapchat, YouTube and Twitch with our ""Invis is Not Your Parents Braces"" campaign. These campaigns continue to feature some of the largest teen influencers from our Invisalign Smile Squad, like Charli D'Amelio, Marsai Martin, [ Michael Lynn Collins ] and Devon Key. These influencers share their personal experience with Invisalign treatment, including why they chose Invisalign treatment to shape their smiles.  
As part of our focus on teens, with our Invisalign ChangeMakers program, we held a recognition event hosted by Marsai Martin, with teens across the country to celebrate and recognize 100 teens across the country who drove positive change within their communities.  
To continue growing for our young adult businesses, we expanded the ""Invis is a Powerful Thing"" campaign, which highlights how powerful the smile transformation with Invisalign treatment can be for their self-confidence. In the U.S., we expanded our Invisalign Smile Squad to include young adult influencers such as Cody Rigsby, Lana Condor and Emily Hampshire, will help to deliver over 405 million impressions. Additionally, our influencer partnerships with TikTok creators helped increase traffic to our sites with a 127% increase in click-through rates.  
In Brazil, we launched the ""Invis is a Powerful Thing"" campaign and teamed up with mega-influencer, [indiscernible] to increase website traffic by 30%. In the EMEA region, we expanded into new media channels such as TikTok and Snapchat across the U.K., Germany and France to drive engagement. These efforts led to more than 153% increase in unique visitors. We also started consumer advertising in Russia, which resulted in more of a 1,000 increase in unique visitors to our website.
In Q3, we continue to expand our consumer advertising across the APAC region, experienced a 132% increase in unique visitors to our websites. In Australia, we expanded our media mix to include partners such as TikTok and Snapchat, which resulted in a 250% growth year-over-year in unique visitors to our website.  
In Japan, we continue to see a strong response from consumers to our ""Invis is"" campaign, resulting to more than an 800% increase year-over-year in unique visitors to our website. Adoption of our consumer and patient app, My Invisalign, continued to increase in Q3 with 1.2 million downloads to date. Usage of our 4 digital tools also continue to increase. 
For example, our Invisalign Virtual Appointment tool was used over 15,000 times and our insurance verification feature was used 14,000 times in Q3. Furthermore, we received more than 1.5 million patient photos in our Virtual Care feature to date globally, which continues to provide us with rich data to leverage our AI capabilities and improve our services for doctors that is used to enhance their patient's care.
For our Systems and Services business, Q3 revenues grew 57.3% year-over-year reflecting strong scanner shipments and services and was up 5% sequentially. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth for our Systems and Services business. The iTero Element 5D Plus imaging system continued gaining traction across all regions, with the most recent launch in Japan in Q3. The iTero Element 5D Plus imaging system will be available in China in Q4 of this year. Additionally, the iTero Element Plus Series was launched in Korea in Q3.  
The series expands the portfolio of iTero Element scanners and imaging systems to include new solutions that serve the needs of a broader range of doctors and patients in the dental market. Moreover, I'm proud to say that in a recent clinical study, the iTero Element 5D intraoral scanner was found to be more sensitive than bitewing radiology in detecting early enamel lesions, providing further evidence of the benefits of iTero 5D scanner in detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions or cavities above the gingiva without exposing patients to harmful ionizing radiation.
This is great news for our iTero business as the study further supports the diagnostic validity of near-infrared imaging technology offered by the iTero 5D scanner for early proximal caries detection.  
The findings also underscore the valuable role that NIRI technology can have in dental health assessment and early detection of cavities, which is important to the overall oral health care treatment options and a comfortable safe experience for a broad population of patients. A strong indicator of the digital acceleration with dental offices is a number of intraoral digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions.
Total worldwide intraoral digital scans used to start in Invisalign case in Q3 increased 84.2% from 78.3% in Q3 last year. International intraoral digital scans for Invisalign case submissions increased 79.3%, up from 72.1% in the same last year.  
For the Americas, 88% of cases were submitted using an intraoral digital scan compared to 83.2% a year ago. Cumulatively, over 44.9 million orthodontic scans and 9.3 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners.  
Our Q3 Systems and Services revenues also includes exocad, CAD/CAM products and services. exocad's expertise in restorative dentistry, implantology, guided surgery and smile design, extends our digital dental solutions and broadens Align's digital platform towards fully integrated interdisciplinary and workflows. We remain excited about our continued integration progress and product plans with exocad.  
During the quarter, exocad launched ChairsideCAD 3.0 Galway, the next generation of exocad's easy-to-use CAD software for single-visit dentistry. The software has improved automation for fast crown design and enables users to integrate open hardware and materials of choice. exocad's ChairsideCAD received 2021 Cellerant's Best of Class Technology Award for the third consecutive year.  
Also during the quarter, exocad had its largest ever presence at IDS, the International Dental Show, where they showcased their seamless digital workflows and the simplicity of the use of exocad's Galway software release. exocad was the only company at IDS to showcase live patient treatment with a smile creator experience station, featuring iTero's scans, instant smile makeovers and production of clip-on smiles.  
With that, I'll now turn it over to John."

Now for our Q3 financial results. Total revenues for the third quarter were $1.016 billion, up 0.5% from the prior quarter and up 38.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For Clear Aligners, Q3 revenues of $837.6 million were down 0.4",1698,"Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q3 financial results. Total revenues for the third quarter were $1.016 billion, up 0.5% from the prior quarter and up 38.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For Clear Aligners, Q3 revenues of $837.6 million were down 0.4% sequentially and up 34.9% year-over-year, reflecting Invisalign volume growth across all geographies.  
In Q3, we shipped 655,100 Invisalign cases, a decrease of 1.6% sequentially with an increase of 32.1% year-over-year. In addition, we shipped to a record 85,500 Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which approximately 7,200 were first-time customers.  
Q3 Clear Aligner revenues reflect strong growth across the Invisalign portfolio, led by comprehensive products. Q3 comprehensive volume increased 1.3% sequentially and 30.3% year-over-year. And Q3 non-comprehensive volume decreased 8.1% sequentially and increased 36.8% year-over-year. Q3 adult patients decreased 7.3% sequentially and increased 34.7% year-over-year. In Q3, teens or younger patients increased 13.8% sequentially and 26.6% year-over-year. 
Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $1.5 million or approximately 0.2 points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $16.1 million or approximately 2.6 points.  
For Q3, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional aligners. On a year-over-year basis, comprehensive ASPs reflect favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by the increase in net revenue deferrals for new Invisalign cases versus additional aligner shipments.  
Q3 Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional aligners, partially offset by higher discounts. On a year-over-year basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs were favorably impacted by foreign exchange, higher additional aligners and lower discounts.  
Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $84 million or 9.3% sequentially and $347.3 million or 53.9% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Our Systems and Services revenues for the third quarter were a record $178.3 million, up 5% sequentially and up 57.3% year-over-year. This marks the fifth quarter in a row of sequential revenue increase.
The increase sequentially can be attributed to increased scanner shipments and increased services revenues from our larger installed base. The increase year-over-year can be attributed to increased scanner shipments, increased service revenues from our larger installed base as well as higher ASPs from a favorable mix shift towards higher-priced iTero 5D scanners and imaging systems. 
Our Systems and Services deferred revenue on the balance sheet was up $27.2 million or 17% sequentially and up $100.1 million or 115.2% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and deferral of services revenue, which we recognize ratably over the service period.  
Moving on to gross margin. Third quarter overall gross margin was 74.3%, down 0.7 points sequentially and up 1.6 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to our 2020 exocad acquisition, overall gross margin was 74.7% for the third quarter, down 0.7 points sequentially and up 1.4 points year-over-year.
Overall gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately 0.5 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange and relatively unchanged sequentially. Clear Aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 76.2%, down 0.7 points sequentially due to higher manufacturing costs and higher additional aligners, partially offset by higher ASPs and lower freight. Clear Aligner gross margin was up 1.5 points year-over-year due to improved manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volume, partially offset by higher ASPs.
Systems and Services gross margin for the third quarter was 65.6%, down 0.3 points sequentially primarily due to lower ASPs and higher manufacturing variances, partially offset by higher service revenue. Systems and Services gross margin was up 3.6 points year-over-year due to higher ASPs from product mix shift to iTero 5D and 5D Plus Series and service revenues, partially offset by higher freight cost.
Q3 operating expenses were $494 million, up sequentially 0.9% and up 38.4% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up slightly by $4.4 million. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $137 million, reflecting increased headcount and our continued investment in marketing, sales and R&D activities and investments commensurate with business growth. 
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles and acquisition costs related to our 2020 exocad acquisition, operating expenses were $466.1 million, up sequentially 1% and up 40.3% year-over-year due to the reasons described earlier.  
Our third quarter operating income of $261.1 million resulted in an operating margin of 25.7%, down 0.9 points from the prior quarter and up 1.6 points year-over-year. The sequential decrease in operating margin was attributable primarily to lower gross margin. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was primarily attributed to higher gross margin and operating leverage as well as the favorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 0.7 points, partially offset by continued investments as mentioned earlier.  
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related costs, the operating margin for the third quarter was 28.8%, down 0.9 points sequentially and up 0.8 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the third quarter was a gain of $0.8 million, up sequentially by $0.9 million and down year-over-year by $6.6 million. 
On a year-over-year basis, interest and other income and expense decreased primarily due to net foreign exchange losses in the 3 months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to net foreign exchange gains in the same period in 2020, which was partially offset by an unrealized gain on an investment held in a private company recognized in the 3 months ended September 30, 2021.  
The GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 30.9% compared to 25.7% in the second quarter and 24.5% in the third quarter of the prior year. On a non-GAAP -- our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.2% in the third quarter compared to 19.5% in the second quarter and 16.6% in the third quarter of the prior year. The third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were higher than the second quarter primarily due to our foreign income being taxed at different rates and tax true-ups. 
Our GAAP and non-GAAP third quarter effective tax rates were higher than the third quarter of the prior year primarily due to lower tax benefits from foreign income tax at lower rates and a tax benefit recognized last year resulting from an income tax audit settlement. Third quarter net income per diluted share was $2.28, down sequentially $0.23 and up $0.52 compared to the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.87 for the third quarter, down $0.17 sequentially and up $0.62 year-over-year.
Moving on to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 billion, up sequentially $151.5 million and up $622.3 million year-over-year. Of our $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $607.5 million was held in the U.S. and $630.3 million was held by our international entities.
Q3 accounts receivable balance was $855 million, up approximately 5.8% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 75 days, up approximately 3 days sequentially and down approximately 2 days as compared to Q3 last year.  
Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $355 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $124.3 million as we continued to invest in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $230.7 million. We also have $300 million available under our untapped revolving line of credit. Under our $1 billion repurchase program announced in May of 2021, we have $825 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock.  
Now let me turn to our outlook and the factors that inform our view for the remainder of the year. We are very pleased with our Q3 results and strong year-over-year growth, which reflects continued customer adoption of the iTero scanners and increased Invisalign utilization across customer channels, including teens, adults and young patients.  
Over the last 18 months, our investment decisions have helped drive and capture demand across all regions and customer channels. We continued spending in many areas and have seen good return on our investments and strong revenue growth. Consumer interest in improving smiles is high and doctor acceptance in the Align Digital Platform is helping drive growth across all regions and market segments.
As anticipated in our Q3 outlook, we experienced more pronounced summer seasonality, more noticeably in September and continued into October as practices took more extended vacations and patient traffic flow was sporadically interrupted by regional COVID resurgence, restrictions and other lockdowns. We anticipate these COVID challenges and the general macroeconomic uncertainties to continue into Q4.
Taking this all into account, as we look at the remainder of 2021, we expect revenues for the year to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion, at the high end of our original guidance range. We also expect our outlook and revenue growth for the second half of 2021 to be in the high end of our long-term operating model of 20% to 30%. On a GAAP basis, we anticipate our 2021 operating margin to be around 25%. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect 2021 operating margin to be approximately 3 points higher than our GAAP operating margin after excluding stock-based compensation and intangible amortization from our 2020 exocad acquisition.  
We remain confident in the huge market opportunities for our business, our industry leadership and our ability to execute. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity to drive our growth and accelerate adoption in a huge underpenetrated market. In addition, during Q4 2021, we expect to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock through either a combination of open-market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement.
For 2021, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to be above $400 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. This includes our planned investment in our new facility in Wroclaw, Poland, the first in the EMEA region.  
With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?"

Increased ortho adoption and teen utilization of Invisalign treatment and train and educate GP dentists on how the iTero Element family of intraoral scanners and imaging systems propel today's dental practice into the future by enhancing patient experience and elevating clinical precision, and in the benefits of digital dentistry with the Invisalign system, trusted by more than 11 million people worldwide to improve their smiles.  
We remain focused on strategic execution, accountability, agility, customer service excellence and continuing to make investments to grow our business. This is a multivariable equation that we continue to talk about and that, in combination, we remain uniquely able to offer. As we continue to stay the course with our strategic initiatives, we also continue to navigate the COVID-19 environment and the challenges and uncertainty that go with it.  
Throughout the pandemic, our top priority has been consistent, the health and safety of our employees and their families, doctors and their staff and that has not changed. The situation with COVID remains very fluid. And with the rise of the Delta variant, many cities, states and countries have issued or plan to issue new guidance including mask requirements, regular testing capacity limits and vaccination mandates. Operating in this evolving environment is challenging for everyone, and we are staying as close as we can to the situation.  
The shift from traditional analog wires and brackets to a fully end-to-end digital platform is not easy. It cannot be done without very complex and industry-leading technology and talented, passionate people. But the digital transformation in orthodontics is inevitable. 
Our technology is prevalent, touching every aspect of what we do for manufacturing excellence, where we currently produce over 750,000 unique aligners a day, to expanding our geographic footprint to over 100 markets, to building a network of over 210,000 trained Invisalign doctors and providing the technology to our doctors in a complete digital system, the Align Digital Platform.  
As the inventor of the leading Clear Aligner system, we've been investing in this therapy for over 24 years to get it to where it is today. And yet the majority of the market opportunity remains largely untapped, with over 500 million potential cases starts globally, align is in a rare position to address this market with the Align Digital Platform powered by 2 decades of research and development, manufacturing excellence, clinical data based on more than 11 million patients with AI machine learning and digital tools to help our doctors efficiently communicate with their patients, show and explain any issues and visualize potential treatment options. And together with doctors, we're going to unleash the power of digital for dentistry in orthodontics more than ever.  
Thank you for your time today. I look forward to speaking with you on Friday at our Investor Day. We will share more details on the Align Digital Platform and our vision and strategy to make Clear Aligner treatment available to everyone through doctors.

So are you seeing the same thing? I know virtual is helping that a little bit. I think some docs even doing it without virtual just given their confidence in outcomes.

In a digital kind of situation, you can remote monitor it like you do on virtual care, some other products that are out there and doctors are taking advantage of that. But also, there's a lot of confidence doctors have, too, if their patients are using the aligners and they will bring them back every so often and take a look. So that's a big part of it. 
Secondly, Jeff, is it -- you can actually work with less labor content and less doctor content and people in the office and also size of the office, too. And you see a lot of orthodontists understanding that and really embracing it. There's also a referral aspect of Invisalign is once a patient has an experience with Invisalign, they're often ready to refer another patient to that doctor much more so than wires and brackets. And they benefit from that because they see an increase in their sales too. 
And we see that constantly and adapt and we focus on that and can actually predict it to a certain extent of time. So I hope I'm answering your question, Jeff, but that is the whole idea of digital and then we keep talking about our Align digital capability and being able to service a doctor through iTero, being having virtual care on both ends and having the kind of capability and horsepower that we can provide with our algorithms and the extent of our clinical capability is just -- it gives us a huge amount of breadth and capability at orthodontists."

And it's obviously why we've put money into this thing and a focus on over the last years. There are certain things in this business that we all know, but there are so many things to do and focus on that sometimes something that's so obvious like that lacks the attention that you want to give to it. And we've been talking about this over time. So beginning of this year, put a team together to really go after those things. 
It's hard to say the reason why. It's just we haven't been as focused on retention as we need to be. And many orthodontists like they make their own retainers. They do it because we just haven't been competitive in the sense of how we can deliver, how fast we can deliver, how easy we make it for them. But I guarantee you, if you go out, Brandon, and you query even orthodontists that seldom use our retainers, they'll tell you we make the best retainers in the world. 
And we should, when you make 750,000 unique parts a day, right? We know what we're doing, the fits are exquisite when you have an iTero scanner to be able to do that. And we set this thing up as a play for doctors that they can feel confident that we'll get these retainers to them in a quick amount of time. They're going to be terrific retainers, something they're proud to really get to their patients. And we've had great feedback on this so far. 
So I can't apologize for the past or give you the whole history why we haven't done it, but I feel really good about the progress we've made so far."

When you can see caries, cavities, right, we use the clinical term. But when you can see cavities without ionizing radiation, and Brandon, what's amazing when you see this, too, what happens is the enamel almost becomes invisible. It's almost translucent. You can see through the enamel right to where the caries is. And there's a certain amount of training that has to be done in order to do it. 
And look, I grew up in an ionizing radiation business. I know what it is in CT and X-ray and it's -- that radiation component is better today than it used to be, but it still exists and patients are still concerned with it over time. And to be able to do this in a sense in a safe way and in a quick way like we do it. You know what it is to put bitewings in a chair, and it's terrible in a test chair, right? Bite down, turn your head sideways, I could go through it all day. 
And this is a quick scan, 1 minute scan, 1.5 minute scan. It pops up on the screen. You can have a conversation with the patient and say, ""There it is and what it deals with."" So yes, I think it's a killer application. Will it convince all GPs to buy iTero? No. But then you have to look at exocad, that critical workflow between labs and GPs really sets us up nicely for restorative pieces. 
Soon to announce Smile Architect, which really allows doctors to use restorative orthodontics as a standard of care. We'll talk about that more Friday. So -- and look, I'm biased. I've been in the -- I'd say, the medical imaging equipment business for 15 years of my life, counting iTero, this is the best scanner in the marketplace.

We -- I've got to continue advertising. We have [ a peer ] system. We have a wonderful brand. We have to leverage that piece. 
But specifically, and this goes to the last questions we had, too, doctor productivity is a big deal. And when you look at our Align Digital Platform, inherently, that's what it's about. It's how do you make doctors more productive to make sure that we don't go back and forth with a ClinChecks? Or how do we make sure that from our standpoint that we can respond quickly to customer issues. And we're investing heavily in all those things and making good progress. 
It's expensive. A lot of things that you have to do when you're really grounded in software and making those changes. We have really great talent here that knows how to do that. We've been actually working the productivity of ClinCheck and those things for 3 to 4 years and it's just starting to bring technology to the marketplace. So you're right.
