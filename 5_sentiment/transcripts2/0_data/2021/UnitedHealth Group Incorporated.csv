We remain in a time of unprecedented challenges for individuals, employers and the health system broadly, particularly frontline clinicians, including our own.

We remain in a time of unprecedented challenges for individuals, employers and the health system broadly, particularly frontline clinicians, including our own. Health systems across the world have been and continue to be stressed. 
Amidst these challenges, we are grateful for the daily displays of human spirit to serve others and the resolve to make things better. We remain optimistic because we are also living at a time of unprecedented collaboration, knowledge sharing and innovation. The health system has come together in ways previously not seen, a powerful multidimensional response to support patients, physicians and communities. I couldn't be prouder of or more grateful to the more than 325,000 women and men of this enterprise. They work each day under difficult conditions with clinicians comprising well more than 1/3 of the total to advance a high-performing health care system, one built on personal human connections, enabled through information and technology and supported by strong alignment of physician-led, value-based delivery of care. They are another profound reason for our optimism. 
With all that's transpired in 2020, we finished the year responsibly and strongly. We delivered meaningful advances in NPS and employee engagement and financial results well above the upper end of our expectations, all while navigating the uncertain environment and achieving our commitment to address financial imbalances resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
As we move into 2021, we believe we are well positioned to continue to serve more people even more deeply and more effectively while continuing to build this enterprise and grow strongly in the decades to come. Just 7 weeks ago, we were privileged to spend a full day with you at our investor conference. Over the course of that day, we tried to convey how we seek to lead in the development of the next-generation health care system. We shared the distinctive capabilities we apply to make health care more connected, more informed, more human and more deeply personal. We finished 2020 encouraged by the performance across the businesses of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Let me provide just a few broad highlights. 
The UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage offerings are off to an excellent start. 2021 will be one of our strongest years of growth, now expected to approach 900,000 more people served across individual and group Medicare Advantage and dual special needs plans. UnitedHealthcare will have grown to serve 3.5 million more seniors over 5 years. Seniors choose our offerings because of the value they receive, better health outcomes and experiences at lower costs. 
We've also been enhancing our offerings to better meet expectations about how people want to live their lives, focusing on more digital and physical care resources in the home, expanding our one-on-one concierge navigation services and enabling the home as the safest and more effective setting of care. UnitedHealthcare's Medicaid offerings continue to grow strongly as well, including entry into 3 new states in 2021. New business opportunities are substantial, with momentum towards Managed Care adoption by states and RFP activity accelerating this year and next. 
And while the economic effects of COVID-19 impacted UnitedHealthcare's employer sponsor growth in 2020, we're encouraged by the positive market response to the new highly consumer-centric offerings we've been discussing with you in recent months. Among these are digital-first, on-demand and physician-led products each provide deeply aligned, modern, personal and coordinated care experiences and save people up to 20% compared to traditional offerings. These innovative products are generating significant responses because they are designed to better meet the unique needs and financial means of more people. All in, we expect UnitedHealthcare will grow in 2021 to serve upwards of 1.5 million more people across its senior community, employer-sponsored and individual offerings. 
We continue to make important advancements and strategic investments to lay the foundation for the next-generation health system. Over the last many years, you've heard us discuss our ambition to build high-performing systems of care, including an aim to reinvent health care delivery, which is the first of our 5 strategic growth platforms. The foundations for those efforts are in our primary and multispecialty care practices. OptumCare entered 2021 with over 50,000 physicians and 1,400 clinics. Over the course of this year, we expect to grow our employed and affiliated physicians by at least 10,000. This work of building local physician-led systems of care continues to be central to our mission and is accelerating, with notable progress in the Northeast, Pacific Northwest and Southern California in 2020. 
Two weeks ago, we announced the combination of Change Healthcare and Optum Insight. We expect this combination will greatly advance the foundational connectivity and collaboration needed for the next-generation health system, establishing a new, more modern information and technology-enabled health care platform. It will help accelerate the development and use of digital and advanced technologies, another of our 5 key growth platforms and critical to connecting the -- all elements of our business strategy. This advanced platform will help clinicians make the most informed and clinically advanced patient care decisions more quickly and easily. Change Healthcare brings widely adopted technology for integrating evidence-based clinical criteria directly into the clinician's workflow. While Optum's clinical analytics expertise and individual health record can strengthen the evidence base needed to deliver effective clinical decision support at the point of care. This can ensure appropriate clinical pathways are offered in the most appropriate sites of care leading to consistent achievement of the best possible outcomes experiences and value for the patients we serve. 
Another key opportunity will be to enhance administrative processes by combining Optum's advanced data analytics with Change Healthcare's intelligent healthcare network to support simpler, more informed and accurate services and processing at considerably lower cost. 
Finally, combining Change Healthcare's payment capacities with Optum's highly automated payment networks will simplify financial interactions among care providers, payers and consumers and accelerate the movement to a more modern, realtime and transparent payment system. This will help physicians get paid more quickly, accurately and reliably and provide consumers with more options and convenience in managing their health care finances. The Change Healthcare team has been doing outstanding work, and we're looking forward to working alongside them. 
We continue to execute on the core initiatives we laid out for you in December. One example, as the pandemic disrupted care patterns, we all saw the increased need to enhance in-home and alternative settings of care, offering patients to receive safe, effective and efficient care outside of traditional venues. However, the need for in-home care will continue to grow well beyond the current environment. We know that more than 80% of what impacts a person's health happens outside of traditional health care settings. There's a significant opportunity in offering consistent, cost-effective care for seniors, people with complex medical conditions and geographically isolated individuals through in-home and alternative settings. Offering a foundational ability to care for people in their homes is essential to developing a health system that is more consumer-centric, higher quality and lower cost. We already have well-established, trusted capacities to bring skilled care resources into the home, including through Optum's HouseCall program. We expect our advanced practice clinicians will conduct over 2 million in-home visits this year. 
And we are building upon this established home capacity in many ways. We have introduced Viva 5 remote patient monitoring capabilities to improve connectivity and information sharing with physicians. This has been received positively by patients with a Net Promoter Score over 80. Optum at Home provides in-person and telephonic touch points across an interdisciplinary team, including physical, social and behavioral aspects. The program increases preventative care, achieved exceptional NPS in the mid-80s, lowers medical expense and demonstrates high quality with over 90% of our members in a 4-star or higher plan. 
Similarly, Optum's Pharmacy Care Services enables patients to receive the care and medications they need, with capacities to deliver outside of traditional settings. OptumRx's Infusion Services now addresses the needs of about 25,000 patients per month and is growing double digits, which means more patients can obtain the care they need outside of the acute settings. That makes it safer, simpler and more affordable for people. We remain encouraged as well by the traditional Pharmacy Services provided by OptumRx with an over 98% customer retention rate entering 2021. We are off to a good start for the 2022 selling season as we were recently awarded the honor to serve more than 2.5 million members of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. 
In sum, we entered 2021 with momentum, confident in our capacity to navigate through and begin to emerge from these challenging times as an even more capable, diverse and growing enterprise. Now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex."
104673,699215256,2176499,"UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2021",2021-01-20,"Earnings Calls","UnitedHealth Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank.You, Dave. The full year 2020 and fourth quarter results were favorable to the outlook we provided at our December 1 investor conference while continuing to be impacted by the unprecedented environment, which has existed most of the year. To beg",946,"Thank.
You, Dave. The full year 2020 and fourth quarter results were favorable to the outlook we provided at our December 1 investor conference while continuing to be impacted by the unprecedented environment, which has existed most of the year. 
To begin, as we know it is a great interest to you. I'd like to share what we're seeing in current care patterns. Starting at the highest level within the broad member categories we serve. People with commercial benefits continue to exhibit overall higher levels of care activity with less deferral than those served in public sector programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Our top priority remains getting people the care they need. During the fourth quarter, we saw overall average care activity return to seasonal baselines compared to the just over 95% we cited for the third quarter. The pacing over the course of the quarter, perhaps not too surprisingly, moved from just below baseline as we began to modestly exceeding baseline in the latter half. This measure includes increased direct COVID-19-related care, which, in total, comprised about 11% of all care activity during the fourth quarter compared to about 6% in the third quarter. 
Looking deeper within specific care categories. Outpatient activity began the quarter at baseline, and we were gratified people were able to obtain needed care previously deferred. By the latter part of the quarter however, some outpatient activity moderated as COVID-19 incidents elevated. 
Total inpatient activity increased modestly over the course of the quarter as the direct COVID-19-related care components rose as a percentage of the total in the latter half. For example, of the 65,000 COVID-19-related inpatient admissions during the quarter, about 20% occurred in October and about 50% in December. 
Moving to our specific businesses. OptumHealth's fourth quarter earnings increased 16% year-over-year as care activity at our fee-for-service practices and ambulatory surgery centers continue to recover, with these businesses now operating near baseline. Revenue per consumer served grew 29% over the year ago quarter. The growth in this measure reflects continued development of the value-based care arrangements, the depth of our offerings and the increasing acuity of the types of care we can deliver to the people we serve. You should expect this measure to continue to grow at a strong double-digit pace for many years to come. 
One example which highlights this potential. Of the 20 million patients OptumCare serves today, under 20% are currently in value-based arrangements. We expect both the number of patients served and the depth and number of value-based arrangements to continue to accelerate. 
OptumInsight's earnings were ahead of the outlook we offered at the beginning of December with overall 2020 performance impacted by lower levels of care with revenues dependent upon care activity volumes for many of these businesses and the generally subdued overall business environment. We continue to expect 10% to 15% growth in 2021 as care activity returns to normalized levels and we continue to advance strategic relationships and broaden services with existing customers. This outlook excludes any impact from OptumInsight's combination with Change Healthcare, which we expect will close in the second half of the year. 
OptumRx's earnings were also ahead of this outlook. During 2020, revenues in our pharmacy care services and specialty businesses continue to grow at double digits and now comprise nearly half of total OptumRx revenue. 
Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Fourth quarter operating results were above our December view. They reflect continued customer and provider assistance measures to help people obtain the care they need and comparatively lower levels of care deferral and higher COVID-19 care costs versus the third quarter. Results in the fourth quarter were further impacted by additional reserves for rebates and related activity as plans with such arrangements moved into these positions as a result of the cumulative care deferral impacts throughout 2020 and calendar year-end assessments were concluded. 
As Dave noted, sales activity in the Medicare Advantage open enrollment period was robust. Within the 900,000 new members we expect to serve for full year 2021, about 775,000 will be in individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in dual special needs plans, which are included in the Community & State Medicaid membership tables. 
Strong growth in Medicaid membership continued in the fourth quarter. Recall, our full year 2021 outlook to serve an additional 200,000 to 300,000 people assumes state redetermination activities are reinitiated during the year. We concluded 2020 with commercial membership about 100,000 people ahead of the outlook we provided at our investor conference. Early January results are well supportive of positive commercial growth in 2021, this even considering the challenging economic environment. 
Our liquidity, capital positions and capacities remain strong. Full year 2020 cash flows from operations were $22.2 billion or 1.4x net income, with the fourth quarter result exceeding the outlook we provided due in part to early customer receipts. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio of 38.9% compares to 40.2% last year. 
As we look enthusiastically toward the combination with Change Healthcare, we intend to maintain our long-standing capital policies, including our approach to returning capital to shareholders via share repurchase and an advancing dividend with ample capacity to continue building upon our strategic growth platforms and ongoing priority on expanding our local care delivery capabilities. 
Our full year 2021 outlook remains consistent with the early December commentary with total revenue approaching $280 billion and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $17.75 and to $18.25, inclusive of the negative COVID-19-related effects we described. Given the still highly dynamic circumstances, we will likely hold this broader-than-typical range of expectations as we, much like everyone else, continue to learn more about the environment. 
Now I'll turn it back to Dave."

And I would say, how it's ultimately going to shake out is going to be related to who provides the best outcome using Telehealth, the lowest cost and ultimately, the best patient experience. Those are sort of truisms which are going to exist no matter what. 
We saw a huge spike at the beginning of real high Telehealth access back in April. It sort of metered out throughout the course of the year. I'm not sure where it's going to ultimately end. But clearly, it's here to stay, and it's going to be an important part of health care going forward. Dr. Decker?"

What's fascinating is not all Telehealth offerings are created equal. And we have found that, not surprisingly, patients really appreciate being connected to their own personal providers, and providers very much need the realtime clinical data to provide good advice and care for that patient in a virtual setting. So that's key point 1. 
Point 2 is certain services like ambulatory or outpatient behavioral health care lend themselves to a Telehealth solution. And so we have seen approximately 50% of our our behavioral health care being delivered in a Telehealth setting, and that has been sustained throughout the year even as the pandemic had subsided. And as it returns, it empowers those populations to get excellent care virtually. 
Finally, I'll just add that it's critical, and we're very excited about the ability at OptumHealth to connect physical care, virtual care and home-based care in a comprehensive model that really differentiates itself by providing personal realtime care in the right setting. Thank you."

Obviously, we've been very focused on building on our pharmacy care services model for the last several years. So not only have we've been getting into only in pharmacy and home delivery, but we've been creating various programs to meet the needs of population, especially in infusion [indiscernible] pharmacies. And why we -- why I frame that is because we're trying to meet the needs of the population in unique ways and create a very differentiated solution. So I think as you look at online pharmacy and home delivery, it's been a big grower for us. We continue to grow share, expand our penetration. But we've also expanded our services within pharmacy care services to serve all consumers so that they don't have to be a member of the PBM. We've been launching over-the-counter Optum store. And so we see a significant growth of selling more products. We also will see in those stores, unique ones like Optum Perks, which is our discount card of bringing them all together in a virtual environment. So we see good prospects, and we see it as a big grower in the long term."

As we look at this environment, it's obviously still quite fluid. The PHC has been extended again and obviously, also another relief package that's being worked on. At this time, the sequester relief has only been extended a quarter. It does not match the PHE as it has throughout the pandemic.

About 2/3 of overall OptumHealth revenue is in is risk-bearing revenue. And we've sized before that you think of that as 2/3 of OptumCare also on risk-bearing relationships. 
If you want to get down to kind of the levels within OptumCare, there are 20 million members that are served by OptumCare, of that 94 million that you're referring to. And then within that 20 million, 3.4 million are in some kind of risk-bearing relationship. And then a smaller percentage than that in a true global cap relationship. I put a well below half of that 3.4 million in a global cap relationship. So you're right. And one of the reasons we were -- I was speaking to that in my prepared comments is because of that opportunity, there's a comparatively small amount of the total membership potential that is currently in a global cap relationship. That's really what's driving the growth of OptumHealth and OptumCare. It comes down to is it primarily an organic revenue growth story because when we affiliate with physician groups, typically, those come in and many of them come in and largely fee-for-service arrangements. And then we seek to convert those to risk arrangements or with more accountability, more value-based care over several years. And so when you look at kind of the overall revenue growth story of that company, it is a predominantly organic revenue growth story just because of that. And that's really -- and I was talking about kind of why do we think there's double-digit revenue growth potential there for years to come.

So first, on 2022 revenue that you're getting at there with diagnosis capture for 2021, a little bit early to talk about that at depth. But a couple of things I'll offer is, one, we're really focused in M&R about getting our members vaccinated as soon as possible. And across the enterprise, there's also a focus on doing the same for the frontline health care workers. And as both of these things happen, I think seniors will become increasingly more comfortable accessing care, and that will have obviously an impact on diagnosis capture in 2021 that impacts revenue for 2022. Remains to be seen exactly how that timing plays out, and we obviously have a bit of time remaining as we think about the 2022 bid to inform what does play out at the time of the bid and when that's submitted. 
With respect to the final notice that was published by CMS on January 15. As you know, number one, earlier than that's normally published. And the all-in rates that were included in that final notice of just north of 4% was a little bit of an increase over the advance notice. Beyond that, nothing really surprising with respect to rules or policy changes contained in the final notice this year. I'm really too early to comment on what that means for rates and benefits, a lot of moving parts that remain as we think about the 2022 bid filing. Certainly, COVID is one of those things that we're watching as well with respect to that."

So within OptumInsight, it is most sensitive to just kind of broadly claims volumes and business activity, general business activity. Those are kind of the factors that have been a component within that. The risk-bearing businesses of OptumHealth are impacted similarly to the UnitedHealthcare businesses, as you would expect, also in terms of activity there. 
Within the different categories across OptumHealth or across UnitedHealthcare in general, I would just tell you kind of as we look at that. So David just cited that as it relates to how we anticipated and incorporated thoughts about ability for seniors to access care and get proper risk adjustment done. So that's an impact that's mostly felt within Medicare & Retirement in terms of that component of it as you'd expect also. And to some extent, to a lesser extent in community and states where you'd have some of the dual special needs plan membership also. 
Within OptumRx, that is mostly also a volume-driven component has to do largely just with physician visit activity often in terms of scripts being written and as those flow through the system. So those are kind of the broad overall impacts I'd offer."

We remain in a time of unprecedented challenges for individuals, employers and the health system broadly, particularly frontline clinicians, including our own. Health systems across the world have been and continue to be stressed. Amidst these challenges, we are grateful for the daily displays of human spirit to serve others and the resolve to make things better. We remain optimistic because we are also living at a time of unprecedented collaboration, knowledge-sharing and innovation. The health system has come together in ways previously not seen, a powerful multidimensional response to support patients, physicians and communities. 
I couldn't be prouder of or more grateful to the more than 325,000 women and men of this enterprise. They work each day under difficult conditions, with clinicians comprising well more than 1/3 of the total, to advance a high-performing health care system, one built on personal human connections; enabled through information and technology; and supported by strong alignment of physician-led, value-based delivery of care. They are another profound reason for our optimism.  
With all that's transpired in 2020, we finished the year responsibly and strongly. We delivered meaningful advances in NPS and employee engagement and financial results well above the upper end of our expectations, all while navigating the uncertain environment and achieving our commitment to address financial imbalances resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As we move into 2021, we believe we are well positioned to continue to serve more people even more deeply and more effectively while continuing to build this enterprise and grow strongly in the decades to come. 
Just 7 weeks ago, we were privileged to spend a full day with you at our investor conference. Over the course of that day, we tried to convey how we seek to lead in the development of the next-generation health care system. We shared the distinctive capabilities we apply to make health care more connected, more informed, more human and more deeply personal.  
We finished 2020 encouraged by the performance across the businesses of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Let me provide just a few broad highlights.  
The UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage offerings are off to an excellent start. 2021 will be one of our strongest years of growth, now expected to approach 900,000 more people served across individual and group Medicare Advantage and Dual Special Needs Plans. UnitedHealthcare will have grown to serve 3.5 million more seniors over 5 years. Seniors choose our offerings because of the value they receive, better health outcomes and experiences at lower costs.  
We've also been enhancing our offerings to better meet expectations about how people want to live their lives, focusing on more digital and physical care resources in the home, expanding our one-on-one concierge navigation services and enabling the home as the safest and more effective setting of care. 
UnitedHealthcare's Medicaid offerings continue to grow strongly as well, including entry into 3 new states in 2021. New business opportunities are substantial, with momentum towards Managed Care adoption by states and RFP activity accelerating this year and next.  
And while the economic effects of COVID-19 impacted UnitedHealthcare's employer-sponsored growth in 2020, we're encouraged by the positive market response to the new, highly consumer-centric offerings we've been discussing with you in recent months. Among these are digital-first, on-demand and physician-led products each provide deeply aligned, modern, personal and coordinated care experiences and save people up to 20% compared to traditional offerings. These innovative products are generating significant responses because they are designed to better meet the unique needs and financial means of more people. 
All in, we expect UnitedHealthcare will grow in 2021 to serve upwards of 1.5 million more people across its senior, community, employer-sponsored and individual offerings.  
We continue to make important advancements and strategic investments to lay the foundation for the next-generation health system. Over the last many years, you've heard us discuss our ambition to build high-performing systems of care, including an aim to reinvent health care delivery, which is the first of our 5 strategic growth platforms. The foundations for those efforts are in our primary and multispecialty care practices. OptumCare entered 2021 with over 50,000 physicians and 1,400 clinics. Over the course of this year, we expect to grow our employed and affiliated physicians by at least 10,000. This work of building local physician-led systems of care continues to be central to our mission and is accelerating, with notable progress in the Northeast, Pacific Northwest and Southern California in 2020.  
2 weeks ago, we announced the combination of Change Healthcare and OptumInsight. We expect this combination will greatly advance the foundational connectivity and collaboration needed for the next-generation health system, establishing a new, more modern information and technology-enabled health care platform. It will help accelerate the development and use of digital and advanced technologies, another of our 5 key growth platforms, and critical to connecting the -- all elements of our business strategy. 
This advanced platform will help clinicians make the most informed and clinically advanced patient care decisions more quickly and easily. Change Healthcare brings widely adopted technology for integrating evidence-based clinical criteria directly into the clinician's workflow, while Optum's clinical analytics expertise and individual health record can strengthen the evidence base needed to deliver effective clinical decision support at the point of care. This can ensure appropriate clinical pathways are offered in the most appropriate sites of care, leading to consistent achievement of the best possible outcomes, experiences and value for the patients we serve. 
Another key opportunity will be to enhance administrative processes by combining Optum's advanced data analytics with Change Healthcare's Intelligent Healthcare Network to support simpler, more informed and accurate services and processing at considerably lower cost. 
Finally, combining Change Healthcare's payment capacities with Optum's highly automated payment networks will simplify financial interactions among care providers, payers and consumers and accelerate the movement to a more modern, realtime and transparent payment system. This will help physicians get paid more quickly, accurately and reliably and provide consumers with more options and convenience in managing their health care finances. 
The Change Healthcare team has been doing outstanding work, and we're looking forward to working alongside them. 
We continue to execute on the core initiatives we laid out for you in December. One example. As the pandemic disrupted care patterns, we all saw the increased need to enhance in-home and alternative settings of care, offering patients to receive safe, effective and efficient care outside of traditional venues. However, the need for in-home care will continue to grow well beyond the current environment. We know that more than 80% of what impacts a person's health happens outside of traditional health care settings. There's a significant opportunity in offering consistent, cost-effective care for seniors, people with complex medical conditions and geographically isolated individuals through in-home and alternative settings. 
Offering a foundational ability to care for people in their homes is essential to developing a health system that is more consumer-centric, higher quality and lower cost. We already have well-established, trusted capacities to bring skilled care resources into the home, including through Optum's HouseCall program. We expect our advanced practice clinicians will conduct over 2 million in-home visits this year. 
And we are building upon this established home capacity in many ways. We have introduced Vivify remote patient monitoring capabilities to improve connectivity and information-sharing with physicians. This has been received positively by patients with a Net Promoter Score over 80. Optum at home provides in-person and telephonic touch points across an interdisciplinary team, including physical, social and behavioral aspects. The program increases preventative care, achieves exceptional NPS in the mid-80s, lowers medical expense and demonstrates high quality, with over 90% of our members in a 4-star or higher plan. 
Similarly, Optum's pharmacy care services enables patients to receive the care and medications they need, with capacities to deliver outside of traditional settings. OptumRx's Infusion Services now addresses the needs of about 25,000 patients per month and is growing double digits, which means more patients can obtain the care they need outside of the acute settings. That makes it safer, simpler and more affordable for people.  
We remain encouraged as well by the traditional pharmacy services provided by OptumRx with an over 98% customer retention rate entering 2021. We are off to a good start for the 2022 selling season as we were recently awarded the honor to serve more than 2.5 million members of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. 
In sum, we enter 2021 with momentum, confident in our capacity to navigate through and begin to emerge from these challenging times as an even more capable, diverse and growing enterprise. 
Now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex."
104673,699215256,2176588,"UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2021",2021-01-20,"Earnings Calls","UnitedHealth Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dave. The full year 2020 and fourth quarter results were favorable to the outlook we provided at our December 1 investor conference while continuing to be impacted by the unprecedented environment which has existed most of the year. To begin,",945,"Thank you, Dave. The full year 2020 and fourth quarter results were favorable to the outlook we provided at our December 1 investor conference while continuing to be impacted by the unprecedented environment which has existed most of the year. 
To begin, as we know it is of great interest to you, I'd like to share what we're seeing in current care patterns. Starting at the highest level, within the broad member categories we serve. People with commercial benefits continue to exhibit overall higher levels of care activity with less deferral than those served in public sector programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Our top priority remains getting people the care they need. 
During the fourth quarter, we saw overall average care activity return to seasonal baselines compared to the just over 95% we cited for the third quarter. The pacing over the course of the quarter, perhaps not too surprisingly, moved from just below baseline as we began to modestly exceeding baseline in the latter half. This measure includes increased direct COVID-19-related care, which, in total, comprised about 11% of all care activity during the fourth quarter compared to about 6% in the third quarter.  
Looking deeper within specific care categories. Outpatient activity began the quarter at baseline, and we were gratified people were able to obtain needed care previously deferred. By the latter part of the quarter however, some outpatient activity moderated as COVID-19 incidents elevated. Total inpatient activity increased modestly over the course of the quarter as the direct COVID-19-related care component rose as a percentage of the total in the latter half. For example, of the 65,000 COVID-19-related inpatient admissions during the quarter, about 20% occurred in October and about 50% in December. 
Moving to our specific businesses. OptumHealth's fourth quarter earnings increased 16% year-over-year as care activity at our fee-for-service practices and ambulatory surgery centers continue to recover, with these businesses now operating near baseline. Revenue per consumer served grew 29% over the year-ago quarter. The growth in this measure reflects continued development of the value-based care arrangements, the depth of our offerings and the increasing acuity of the types of care we can deliver to the people we serve. You should expect this measure to continue to grow at a strong double-digit pace for many years to come. 
One example which highlights this potential. Of the 20 million patients OptumCare serves today, under 20% are currently in value-based arrangements. We expect both the number of patients served and the depth and number of value-based arrangements to continue to accelerate. 
OptumInsight's earnings were ahead of the outlook we offered at the beginning of December with overall 2020 performance impacted by lower levels of care with revenues dependent upon care activity volumes for many of these businesses and the generally subdued overall business environment. We continue to expect 10% to 15% growth in 2021 as care activity returns to normalized levels and we continue to advance strategic relationships and broaden services with existing customers. This outlook excludes any impact from OptumInsight's combination with Change Healthcare, which we expect will close in the second half of the year. 
OptumRx's earnings were also ahead of this outlook. During 2020, revenues in our pharmacy care services and specialty businesses continued to grow at double digits and now comprise nearly half of total OptumRx revenue. 
Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Fourth quarter operating results were above our December view. They reflect continued customer and provider assistance measures to help people obtain the care they need and comparatively lower levels of care deferrals and higher COVID-19 care costs versus the third quarter. Results in the fourth quarter were further impacted by additional reserves for rebates and related activity as plans with such arrangements moved into these positions as a result of the cumulative care deferral impacts throughout 2020 and calendar year-end assessments were concluded. 
As Dave noted, sales activity in the Medicare Advantage open enrollment period was robust. Within the 900,000 new members we expect to serve for full year 2021, about 775,000 will be in individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in Dual Special Needs Plans which are included in the Community & State Medicaid membership tables. 
Strong growth in Medicaid membership continued in the fourth quarter. Recall, our full year 2021 outlook to serve an additional 200,000 to 300,000 people assumes state redetermination activities are reinitiated during the year. 
We concluded 2020 with commercial membership about 100,000 people ahead of the outlook we provided at our investor conference. Early January results are well supportive of positive commercial growth in 2021, this, even considering the challenging economic environment. 
Our liquidity, capital positions and capacities remain strong. Full year 2020 cash flows from operations were $22.2 billion or 1.4x net income, with the fourth quarter result exceeding the outlook we provided due in part to early customer receipts. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio of 38.9% compares to 40.2% last year. As we look enthusiastically toward the combination with Change Healthcare, we intend to maintain our long-standing capital policy, including our approach to returning capital to shareholders via share repurchase and an advancing dividend with ample capacity to continue building upon our strategic growth platforms and ongoing priority on expanding our local care delivery capabilities. 
Our full year 2021 outlook remains consistent with the early December commentary with total revenue approaching $280 billion and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $17.75 and to $18.25, inclusive of the negative COVID-19-related effects we described. Given the still highly dynamic circumstances, we will likely hold this broader-than-typical range of expectations as we, much like everyone else, continue to learn more about the environment. 
Now I'll turn it back to Dave."

We at UnitedHealthcare, from a policy standpoint, we work with Optum, we work a lot of Telehealth providers on different products and capabilities. And I would say, how it's ultimately going to shake out is going to be related to who provides the best outcome using Telehealth, the lowest cost and ultimately the best patient experience. Those are sort of truisms which are going to exist no matter what. 
We saw a huge spike at the beginning of real high Telehealth access back in April. It sort of metered out throughout the course of the year. I'm not sure where it's going to ultimately end. But clearly, it's here to stay, and it's going to be an important part of health care going forward.

What's fascinating is not all Telehealth offerings are created equal. And we have found that, not surprisingly, patients really appreciate being connected to their own personal providers, and providers very much need the real-time clinical data to provide good advice and care for that patient in a virtual setting. So that's key point one. 
Point two is certain services, like ambulatory or outpatient behavioral health care, lend themselves to a Telehealth solution. And so we have seen approximately 50% of our behavioral health care being delivered in a Telehealth setting, and that has been sustained throughout the year even as the pandemic had subsided. And as it returns, it empowers those populations to get excellent care virtually. 
Finally, I'll just add that it's critical, and we're very excited about the ability at OptumHealth to connect physical care, virtual care and home-based care in a comprehensive model that really differentiates itself by providing personal, real-time care in the right setting. Thank you."

We've been launching over-the-counter, Optum Store. And so we see a significant growth of selling more products.

As we look at this environment, it's obviously still quite fluid. The PHC has been extended again, and obviously, also another relief package that's being worked on. At this time, the sequester relief has only been extended a quarter and does not match the PHC as it has throughout the pandemic.

We also finished a acquisition in the Southwest and in Southern California in particular with -- in the Inland Empire region. And we've also done some work up in the Pacific Northwest this past year as well and some in the center part of the United States. 
I'd say, generally speaking, the market seems to continue to gravitate towards an OptumCare-type model where there's a great sense of stability as well as a very strong quadruple-aim model which seems to resonate very well with physicians, but also with our patients, where they get better experiences, outcomes and overall lower cost is demonstrated by the value that's being brought every day and the growth of that -- in that -- overall in that area.

And we've cited before that you think of that as 2/3 of OptumCare also on risk-bearing relationships. 
If you want to get down to kind of the level, within OptumCare, there are 20 million members that are served by OptumCare of that 94 million that you're referring to. And then within that 20 million, 3.4 million are in some kind of risk-bearing relationship. And then a smaller percentage than that in a true global cap relationship, I'd put it below half -- well below half of that 3.4 million in a global cap relationship. 
So you're right. And one of the reasons we were -- I was speaking to that in my prepared comments is, because of that opportunity, there's a comparatively small amount of the total membership potential that is currently in a global cap relationship. That's really what's driving the growth of OptumHealth and OptumCare. It comes down to is, it's primarily an organic revenue growth story because when we affiliate with physician groups, typically, those come in, and many of them come in largely fee-for-service arrangements. And then we seek to convert those to risk arrangements or with more accountability, more value-based care over several years. And so when you look at kind of the overall revenue growth story of that company, it is a predominantly organic revenue growth story just because of that. 
And that's really going -- I was talking about kind of why do we think there's double-digit revenue growth potential there for years to come? It's because of the still very, I'd say, kind of early stage of where that stands."

So David just cited that as it relates to how we anticipated and incorporated thoughts about ability for seniors to access care and get proper risk adjustment done. So that's an impact that's mostly felt within Medicare & Retirement in terms of that component of it, as you'd expect also. And to some extent and to a lesser extent in community and states where you'd have some of the Dual Special Needs Plans membership also.

The exceptional dedication of the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare, again defined this period. They've adapted swiftly and creatively to demanding and rapidly changing circumstances, implemented new ideas and importantly, remain focused on serving people exceptionally well, as a result, adjusted earnings per share were $5.31, reflecting strong execution at both UnitedHealthcare and Optum.
In light of our strong start to the year, balanced with continued respect for the potential pandemic-related effects we have previously described, we are increasing our full year adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $18.10 to $18.60 per share.
I'll touch briefly on 2 highlights, among many, in the quarter that illustrate the increased momentum our colleagues at UnitedHealth Group are driving. People served with our employer and individual offerings grew nearly 100,000 in the quarter, even within the context of a challenged U.S. employment environment, and this underscores the growing consumer orientation, affordability and breadth of our products.
OptumInsight revenues increased 14% and operating income increased 45% compared to the year-ago period as more normal activity levels among health care system customers returned, leading to expansion in how we help them advance clinical and operational excellence. Significant innovation and automation in the OptumInsight businesses drove strong productivity gains.
We have the right capabilities, assets and strategies in place, and we remain restless to innovate, evolve and further integrate our offerings to serve more people more effectively, both directly and with our many external partners throughout the health care environment.
To achieve this, we've been sharpening our focus in 3 key areas: First, delivering even greater value to those we serve throughout the health care system by better harnessing the collaborative capabilities of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. We believe we can develop new products and services, which support people more effectively by bringing to bear greater application and adoption of the combined offerings of these 2 distinct and complementary organizations. OptumCare's work supporting Medicare Advantage patients illustrates this well, and I'll speak more to this shortly.
The second area of focus, increasing the application of our technology and related resources to improve care for people and the operational health systems. There are benefits for everyone in helping to make the health care system work more like an actual system, improving the natural flow accessibility and use of information is essential to that goal. all within a secure and protected framework. We can help care providers and payers better serve patients by more effectively simplifying key administrative processes and by providing timely access to relevant information.
The third focus is making health care work better for consumers. We're ambitious to meet the rising expectations of health care consumers, and we will continue to improve our offerings, including in such critical zones as greatly simplified intuitive and satisfying consumer digital experiences and advanced health care banking and payment services that enable people to find, price and pay for care digitally. You'll hear more from us about these approaches in the months ahead.
But today, I'd like to focus on the first, unlocking greater value for customers at the intersection of Optum and UnitedHealthcare, including through our ability to develop new useful service offerings.
One of the most effective ways of doing so is through stronger alignment of the high-quality clinical services of OptumCare to address the needs of patients we serve for our nearly 90 health plan customers. A key foundation is increasing the clinical outcome accountability of our OptumCare practices. Of the 4 million patients who OptumCare serves in some form of accountable arrangement today, 2 million are being served under fully capitated arrangement, and this demonstrates the strong growth and progress. But OptumCare serves 20 million patients in total, which is one reason why we view the potential of OptumCare is only beginning to be harnessed.
These accountable arrangements drive measurably better patient outcomes and experiences, all at lower costs. For example, seniors served by op care physicians, under such arrangements, spend on average, 1/3 fewer days in the hospital and have 40% fewer days in skilled nursing facilities than seniors in traditional Medicare. We expect the growth in the number of OptumCare patients served under accountable arrangements to accelerate.
A further example of using our combined expertise to advance more beneficial service offerings is the recent opening of a first-of-its-kind Optum Integrated Care facility in Riverside County, California. While we have long offered and continue to actively develop our senior-focused clinics, this new clinic and community center offers a comprehensive range of primary care-led services, including a pharmacy, all under a single roof. And importantly, it is especially orientated around supporting Medicaid, Medicare, commercial and individual members of all ages. This comprehensive health center provides improved care access with modern on-site services, including annual wellness visits, chronic disease management support, coordinated care with trusted specialists, and laboratory, imaging and pharmacy services. The adjacent community center includes a full-service gym and meeting rooms for health education. We see Optum and our payer partners as uniquely positioned to be able to offer these types of impactful venues and look forward to learning from the community and expanding these services.
To sum up, We continue to organize and apply the unique capabilities of this organization in ways that enable to execute on the goals we established for 2021 and beyond, and to continue to deliver on our 13% to 16% long-term earnings growth objective.
Now I'll turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon, to give more color on initiatives to drive greater performance across the organization."

As Andrew noted, we continue to drive growth by supporting more affordable, simpler quality care across Optum and UnitedHealthcare. These are themes you've heard us cover before, and we continue to see the benefits of this approach for people -- for the people we serve. 
Let me turn those themes into some specific examples across Optum and UnitedHealthcare, that illustrate how our approach is working. First is how we've been simplifying the consumer experience over the past year. We've driven greater engagement with seniors by increasing adoption of digital tools. Monthly active users of our digital offerings have risen double digits, with similar increases in online transactions. This has led to greater adoption of our digital therapeutic offerings.
In the first quarter, high-risk chronic disease patients in our home monitoring program logged over 1.5 million biometric measurements, such as glucose level, enabling 99% medication compliance and an NPS of 84. We've also made it easier for people to get and maintain behavioral health support by expanding traditional and virtual provider network and combine them with modern digital therapeutic services.
Behavioral health needs have increased significantly during the pandemic, and as a result, we have seen substantial adoption in our digital behavioral platform that provide on-demand emotional support, logging a rise of over 100% in utilization. Always accompanying our work to simplify health care is Optum and UnitedHealthcare's sharp focus on delivering high-quality care.
We've talked to you before about the advances we are making to integrate patient-specific health data and plan information directly into the physician's workflow. Clinicians can see gaps in care and act to close them during the patient's visit, in addition to other steps that facilitate more efficient care and better outcome.
We now support over 8 million of these in-site-enabled digital interactions each month with rapidly expanding physician adoption. Delivering high-quality care has been central in our response to the COVID pandemic. Our most recent effort to help members access vaccines is a prime example.
We launched a vaccine locator tool, helping people find and sign up for a vaccination. And we've made millions of outbound contacts to engage members and help them get the information they need. 
Lastly, making care more affordable remains central for the people we serve and the health system overall and is essential for increasing access. For instance, through our medication sourcing program, high-cost providers now source drugs at a network specialty pharmacy, including OptumRx or charge market rates only for the drug. Early work on this has generated substantial savings for our customers.
Our work to make health care simpler, higher quality and more affordable drive strong growth for our business. At the end of January, for example, UnitedHealthcare was awarded an Oklahoma SoonerCare Medicaid contract to serve nearly 200,000 people. Oklahoma previously operated under a fee-for-service program. The award affirms the value we bring to state partners and consumers and reflects our commitment to expand access to care for all Americans. We look forward to working with our new partners in Oklahoma and sharing with you, on future calls, new examples as our work on simplicity, quality and affordability continues to create improvements and new growth opportunities.
With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex."

Before I review the performance of our businesses, as in recent quarters, I'd like to provide an update on the care patterns we're seeing as the pandemic continues to evolve.
Over the course of the first quarter, total care activity, including COVID-19-related care, ran marginally below seasonal baseline. Pacing of elective care activity through the quarter generally trapped and in opposite directions with the rise in decline of COVID incidence rates, which were much higher in the early part of the quarter than in the latter part.
To put this in perspective, February and March showed COVID-related care at about half the level experienced in January. Since the quarter's end, we have again begun to see a rise in COVID-related care, while at this time, not approaching the January level.
Outpatient care activity was moderately below seasonal baseline for the full quarter, running in counterpoint to the COVID incidence patterns over the 3 months and reflecting a well-below average influenza and respiratory illness season. And total inpatient activity was modestly above seasonal baseline, with over 55,000 COVID-19-related emissions during the quarter compared to 65,000 in the fourth quarter 2020.
Moving to business unit performance. OptumHealth's first quarter revenue and earnings increased 35% year-over-year. Revenue per consumer served grew 31% over the year-ago quarter. The growth in this metric continues to reflect the expanding number of people served under value-based care arrangements and the increasing acuity of the care services we offer.
OptimumInsight's revenue grew 14% in the quarter and earnings 45%, due to growth in our services and technology offerings and improved productivity. The revenue backlog at $20.8 billion grew $1.6 billion over the first quarter 2020, as more normalized business activity started to return among our provider and payer customers.
OptumRx' revenue and earnings were relatively consistent year-over-year and in line with our expectations. Adjusted scripts declined modestly from the year-ago quarter, a period during which we provided advanced medications to the people we serve as the pandemic began. Pharmacy Care and Specialty Services continue to grow strongly, in particular, home infusion and our community behavioral health pharmacies.
Turning to UnitedHealthcare. First quarter operating results reflected strong execution and continued membership growth. In addition to the growth in commercial and Medicare Advantage offerings noted earlier, people served in managed Medicaid programs grew by nearly 1.1 million over the year-ago quarter. Of the 900,000 new seniors we expect to serve within Medicare Advantage this year, about 775,000 are in individual and group and 125,000 in dual special needs offering.
Of importance to the senior customers we serve, our house calls clinicians have been considerably more able compared to this time last year to provide their vital services. We conducted nearly 600,000 home visits in the quarter as more seniors and caregivers were vaccinated and comfortable having in-person visit. That's up by a 1/3 compared to first quarter 2020 and about 4x higher than what was achieved in the second quarter 2020.
Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong, with first quarter cash flows from operations at $6 billion or 1.2x net income. As we look forward toward the combination with Change Healthcare, we intend to maintain our long-standing capital policy. These include our approach to returning capital to shareholders via share repurchase and an advancing dividend, with ample capacity to continue building upon our strategic growth platform.
We now expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $18.10 to $18.60, an increase of $0.35 from the outlook we offered at our investor conference. This outlook continues to include an estimated $1.80 per share of unfavorable COVID-19-related effects. The substantial majority of which we still expect to occur in the latter part of the year, largely as carriers more freely able to be delivered to people.
Now I'll turn it back to Andrew."

I'm going to ask, in a second, Dr. Decker. And also, I think I'll ask Dirk McMahon to make a couple of comments, but let me just preface that.
So we've obviously seen Telehealth develop as a set of capabilities over the last several years. We've been a very extensive user of those capabilities. But I think one of the things we've seen from 2020 and the pandemic is really a kind of shift in terms of people's thinking and willingness to utilize Telehealth. We also think that the way in which they're being utilized are -- is evolving.
And so what you're going to see from us, and it's one of the examples I might cite in terms of the opportunity for new product development between Optimum and United Healthcare, is you're going to see UnitedHealth Group lean forward into much more integrated Telehealth capabilities. We've got a number of new initiatives in deployment as we speak, operating between the 2 companies.

And as you've heard us mention before, we were very proud of how quickly we stood up over 17,000 providers during the pandemic on Telehealth solutions, but that really just is the beginning. And of course, across the country, we've seen a massive shift in consumer adoption and willingness to engage in virtual health solutions as well as with our providers more broadly.
So our philosophy is that not all Telehealth is created equally. And as we continue to develop our new products, you'll see us integrating physical care, virtual care, home care and behavioral care in a way that is innovative and differentiated. And in fact, we've already launched a product we call Optum Virtual Care, that is live in all 50 states and is doing just that. And what will really differentiate our product to those that we serve is the ability to offer virtual solutions, but then if necessary, immediately connect them to a live bricks-and-mortar solution for more complex or thorough care as well as identifying and triaging both physical and behavioral health care needs and offering comprehensive behavioral health care.
We're seeing continued sustainability of virtual care solutions, which, as you may know, peaked during the height of the pandemic, have declined some, but are still probably 10x where they were pre-pandemic and certain conditions or behavior -- or areas like behavioral health care are now seeing about 50% utilization through virtual services.

So just some impacts here. I think the first important impact, I suggested that if a significant majority, I'd call it, 70% of our projected COVID impact is -- really occurs in the second half of the year. And just to be frank, we just don't know enough now about what is going to happen later in the year, kind of have a very meaningfully different projection of what our full year results will be in terms of will they be better in terms of better than the original projections, except for what we've experienced thus far, which we would expect -- expected some stronger underlying business performance, growth across a number of businesses. We've executed well on productivity measures, and maybe just very modestly less impact in the 1Q unfavorable impact than we would have anticipated. 
But the important component there being that it is really much more a back half weighted view in terms of COVID-19 impact. That's really premised upon our expectation that as we get later in the year, people are going to be more able to access previously deferred care and higher acuity levels as a result of missed or postponed treatments. And that's what we're -- that's what we built -- that's what we build into that view in terms of an expectation. But that's really an unusual time still, no question.

And before I pass it to Wyatt, again to respond to the specifics, let me just give you a sense of how we see this playing out.
And I think the answer to your question is really both. So we absolutely see tremendous opportunity to continue to develop a variety of different clinic types. And if you look at the -- I cited one particular example, but we've been opening a wide number different type of clinics depending on the environment that -- or the locality that we're operating in. And you should continue to expect to see that degree of customization according to the need of the geography. It's not a one-size-fits-all model by any means. So you'll continue to see that. 
But at the same time, we strongly believe there is opportunity over the next few years. And this is why I focused in my kind of second area of going deeper around technology. How we can then help those clinics operate more efficiently? How we can ensure they are better connected, both locally with other clinics that we may own or to a higher level of information support? So we see this as being a highly activated network of clinics and centers.
The center -- the network itself will have a high degree of diversity in it because it needs to be responsive to the needs of the locality, the communities that we're operating in. And of course, as sensitive to the previous comments, it will have a very significant Telehealth capability deployed alongside it.
Wyatt, maybe you could talk a little bit to how you see the progression within the $20 million?"

And one of the pieces that will differentiate us as a comprehensive care provider is just that being comprehensive. And so you'll see us continuing to weave together products and services that meet people's needs in new and innovative ways, and Telehealth and digital solutions are a big piece, but not the only piece. 
The other part that I'd call out is we're increasingly leveraging technology to bring advanced decision support to our physicians and providers. And you may have heard previously about optimal care. This is a value-based care delivery set of decision tools that are yielding real results, giving people the best, highest quality care that eliminates what we tend to call low-value care, and is a differentiator. So we'll continue to deploy those technologies.
As you know, we are on track to grow by over 10,000 physicians. We're now at 56,000 doctors, both affiliated, contracted and employed. And we'll leverage all of those models as we go forward. And we continue to evolve and employ doctors who are really actually quite attracted to our model of value-based primary care. We eliminate much of the clerical burden in our physicians and advanced practitioners' practice and let them focus on the work they love. So this is really gaining traction among our physician workforce.
And then to your point around how much of the 20 million lives that we serve today will ultimately be capitated, we anticipate that not only will a significant portion, you heard the number 2 million today and 0.25 million, as we mentioned, growing. So as we continue to grow, we also expect that we'll always offer a host of modalities, including fee-for-service. And that actually is a feeder system as we think about value-based care being kind of the core of what we offer and fully capitated the core of the core, if you will."

So what we're doing in the program is really both providing care, but also arranging and coordinating care, so trying to address medical, behavioral and social needs. And the results initially have been great. We've improved access for people with more than 80% having an in-home visit, and more than half of them getting connected back into office-based care, social services referrals and so forth as well as great health quality and outcomes.
So today, we've got a little under 100,000 lives across 6 markets. We're looking to expand that across Medicare Advantage Dual SNP but also into the individual MA. We're doing it with UnitedHealthcare and ultimately, to do that with other health plans. So another growth factor for us as we look at building out our value-based orientation."

And with the development of the diverse sets of clinics and skills, the development of the technology support that you've just heard referred to, we believe we're in a very strong position to be able to be the leader in ability to manage those patients in the best possible way and ensure that they get the kind of health care they deserve.

When you back out the impact of some suppressed utilization, the underlying factors associated with medical cost trend largely looked like they did. We aren't seeing significant upticks in services in specific areas out of the norm. So I would say it looks a lot like utilization prior to the COVID implications.
And when I think by line of business, I would say, generally tracking a little below baseline in both our government programs closer to baseline inside our commercial business, but largely in track with what we had expected. And where it's a little out of line again, where perhaps infection rates were higher, and we saw that naturally offset with greater utilization. So first quarter, I would say, largely as expected."

Your point in terms of how we think about as we get later into the year? And why that moves like it does? And you heard my commentary that significant majority of the $1.80 we have layered into the second half of the year. That is largely because of the assumptions around those elements that we see that people are increasingly able to get the care they need. The amount of care deferral declined meaningfully as you get into the latter part of the year. They're accessing the system. And we do get into these elements where we see rising acuity coming at.
So those are the elements that are premised in terms of that expectation at this point. So -- but really -- and the other element that Brian touched on also just in terms of your population, you have commercial, a little more access to the system versus the public program members."

That's a great question. So I think our bias is increasingly, and I think rightly towards driving a more and more seamless, simple, easy-to-access care environment, both for the patient and the provider actually.
So what that speaks to is trying to avoid the fragmentation of the interface and definitely trying to avoid the fragmentation of the information that then sits behind it. So we want to really try and create much more seamless opportunity. And so for example, I'll give you a real example in Optum Virtual, which is -- you've heard a little bit about on the call already today.
So of course, patients are looking for a way to engage with a physician. They actually want to talk to their physicians. So one of the things that we're doing is building that plan. But then there might be situations where the physician wants to bring in a specialist into that conversation.
Now in a multidisciplinary clinic, they might be in a position, in normal times, to go down the hall, get somebody to come down and visit. Now in Optum Virtual, they're able to do that kind of thing. So that's an example of trying to bring that integration even within the virtual space. So it kind of replicates a little bit more what you might expect in a physical environment.
And so we definitely see the need to try and drive toward that, and we definitely want to try and create the fluidity of the information to ensure that physicians have what they need when they're in front of the patient, when they're talking to the patient, they can make the best possible choices. So we want them to be as highly educated as possible in that context. So we're leaning much -- we're leaning very much toward the idea of integrated, seamless, and that's true whether you're in the physical or the virtual space, and we want the 2 to sit together.

Just on those large contract agreements like the one we have with John Muir.

And so if you look at those initiatives, multiple automation initiatives using advanced techniques and AI, and LP, Machine Learning, it really drove a lot of short-term productivity. But it also drives a situation where we feel like we've made sustainable margin improvements for the long term, and that puts us in a position to be more competitive.

And as Andrew said, we feel really optimistic about that pipeline and where it's headed. The disruption was more in timing and not really an interest during the pandemic. In fact, during the pandemic, I think there was growing recognition among our health system relationships that this was a very productive way to work with Optum and a really important need for them as they face some disruption even coming out of the pandemic to their finances in ways that we can sustainably support them in a really holistic way.

They've adapted swiftly and creatively to demanding and rapidly changing circumstances, implemented new ideas and importantly, remained focused on serving people exceptionally well. As a result, adjusted earnings per share were $5.31, reflecting strong execution at both UnitedHealthcare and Optum.
In light of our strong start to the year, balanced with continued respect for the potential pandemic-related effects we have previously described, we are increasing our full year adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $18.10 to $18.60 per share.
I'll touch briefly on 2 highlights, among many, in the quarter that illustrate the increased momentum our colleagues at UnitedHealth Group are driving. People served with our employer and individual offerings grew nearly 100,000 in the quarter, even within the context of a challenged U.S. employment environment, and this underscores the growing consumer orientation, affordability and breadth of our products.
OptumInsight revenues increased 14% and operating income increased 45% compared to the year-ago period as more normal activity levels among health care system customers returned, leading to expansion in how we help them advance clinical and operational excellence. Significant innovation and automation in the OptumInsight businesses drove strong productivity gains.
We have the right capabilities, assets and strategies in place, and we remain restless to innovate, evolve and further integrate our offerings to serve more people more effectively, both directly and with our many external partners throughout the health care environment. 
To achieve this, we've been sharpening our focus in 3 key areas: First, delivering even greater value to those we serve throughout the health care system by better harnessing the collaborative capabilities of Optum and UnitedHealthcare. We believe we can develop new products and services which support people more effectively by bringing to bear greater application and adoption of the combined offerings of these 2 distinct and complementary organizations. OptumCare's work supporting Medicare Advantage patients illustrates this well, and I'll speak more to this shortly. 
The second area of focus, increasing the application of our technology and related resources to improve care for people and the operational health systems. There are benefits for everyone in helping to make the health care system work more like an actual system, improving the natural flow accessibility and use of information is essential to that goal, all within a secure and protected framework. We can help care providers and payers better serve patients by more effectively simplifying key administrative processes and by providing timely access to relevant information. 
The third focus is making health care work better for consumers. We're ambitious to meet the rising expectations of health care consumers, and we will continue to improve our offerings, including in such critical zones as greatly simplified intuitive and satisfying consumer digital experiences and advanced health care banking and payment services that enable people to find, price and pay for care digitally. You'll hear more from us about these approaches in the months ahead. 
But today, I'd like to focus on the first, unlocking greater value for customers at the intersection of Optum and UnitedHealthcare, including through our ability to develop new useful service offerings. 
One of the most effective ways of doing so is through stronger alignment of the high-quality clinical services of OptumCare to address the needs of patients we serve for our nearly 90 health plan customers. A key foundation is increasing the clinical outcome accountability of our OptumCare practices. Of the 4 million patients who OptumCare serves in some form of accountable arrangement today, 2 million are being served under fully capitated arrangement, and this demonstrates a strong growth and progress. But OptumCare serves 20 million patients in total, which is one reason why we view the potential of OptumCare is only beginning to be harnessed. 
These accountable arrangements drive measurably better patient outcomes and experiences, all at lower costs. For example, seniors served by OptumCare physicians under such arrangements spend, on average, 1/3 fewer days in the hospital and have 40% fewer days in skilled nursing facilities than seniors in traditional Medicare. We expect the growth in the number of OptumCare patients served under accountable arrangements to accelerate. 
A further example of using our combined expertise to advance more beneficial service offerings is the recent opening of a first-of-its-kind Optum integrated care facility in Riverside County, California. While we have long offered and continue to actively develop our senior-focused clinics, this new clinic and community center offers a comprehensive range of primary care-led services, including a pharmacy, all under a single roof. And importantly, it is especially orientated around supporting Medicaid, Medicare, commercial and individual members of all ages. This comprehensive health center provides improved care access with modern on-site services, including annual wellness visits, chronic disease management support, coordinated care with trusted specialists, and laboratory, imaging and pharmacy services. The adjacent community center includes a full-service gym and meeting rooms for health education. We see Optum and our payer partners as uniquely positioned to be able to offer these types of impactful venues and look forward to learning from the community and expanding these services. 
To sum up, We continue to organize and apply the unique capabilities of this organization in ways that enable to execute on the goals we established for 2021 and beyond, and to continue to deliver on our 13% to 16% long-term earnings growth objective. 
Now I'll turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon, to give more color on initiatives to drive greater performance across the organization."

As Andrew noted, we continue to drive growth by supporting more affordable, simpler quality care across Optum and UnitedHealthcare. These are themes you've heard us cover before, and we continue to see the benefits of this approach for peo",543,"Thanks, Andrew. As Andrew noted, we continue to drive growth by supporting more affordable, simpler quality care across Optum and UnitedHealthcare. These are themes you've heard us cover before, and we continue to see the benefits of this approach for people -- for the people we serve.  
Let me turn those themes into some specific examples across Optum and UnitedHealthcare that illustrate how our approach is working. First is how we've been simplifying the consumer experience over the past year. We've driven greater engagement with seniors by increasing adoption of digital tools. Monthly active users of our digital offering have risen double digits, with similar increases in online transactions. This has led to greater adoption of our digital therapeutic offerings. 
In the first quarter, high-risk chronic disease patients in our home monitoring program logged over 1.5 million biometric measurements, such as glucose level, enabling 99% medication compliance and an NPS of 84. We've also made it easier for people to get and maintain behavioral health support by expanding traditional and virtual provider network and combine them with modern digital therapeutic services. 
Behavioral health needs have increased significantly during the pandemic, and as a result, we have seen substantial adoption in our digital behavioral platform that provide on-demand emotional support, logging a rise of over 100% in utilization. Always accompanying our work to simplify health care is Optum and UnitedHealthcare's sharp focus on delivering high-quality care. 
We've talked to you before about the advances we are making to integrate patient-specific health data and plant information directly into the physician's workflow. Clinicians can see gaps in care and act to close them during the patient's visit, in addition to other steps that facilitate more efficient care and better outcome. 
We now support over 8 million of these in-site-enabled digital interactions each month with rapidly expanding physician adoption. Delivering high-quality care has been central in our response to the COVID pandemic. Our most recent effort to help members access vaccines is a prime example. We launched a vaccine locator tool, helping people find and sign up for a vaccination. And we've made millions of outbound contacts to engage members and help them get the information they need.  
Lastly, making care more affordable remains central for the people we serve and the health system overall and is essential for increasing access. For instance, through our medication sourcing program, high-cost providers now source drugs at a network specialty pharmacy, including OptumRx or charge market rates only for the drug. Early work on this has generated substantial savings for our customers. 
Our work to make health care simpler, higher quality and more affordable drive strong growth for our business. At the end of January, for example, UnitedHealthcare was awarded an Oklahoma SoonerCare Medicaid contract to serve nearly 200,000 people. Oklahoma previously operated under a fee-for-service program. The award affirms the value we bring to state partners and consumers and reflects our commitment to expand access to care for all Americans. We look forward to working with our new partners in Oklahoma and sharing with you on future calls new examples as our work on simplicity, quality and affordability continues to create improvements and new growth opportunities. 
With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex."

Before I review the performance of our businesses, as in recent quarters, I'd like to provide an update on the care patterns we're seeing as the pandemic continues to evolve. Over the course of the first quarter, total care activity, in",636,"Thank you, Dirk. Before I review the performance of our businesses, as in recent quarters, I'd like to provide an update on the care patterns we're seeing as the pandemic continues to evolve. 
Over the course of the first quarter, total care activity, including COVID-19-related care, ran marginally below seasonal baseline. Pacing of elective care activity through the quarter generally trapped and in opposite directions with the rise in decline of COVID incidence rates, which were much higher in the early part of the quarter than in the latter part. 
To put this in perspective, February and March showed COVID-related care at about half the level experienced in January. Since the quarter's end, we have again begun to see a rise in COVID-related care, while at this time, not approaching the January level. 
Outpatient care activity was moderately below seasonal baseline for the full quarter, running in counterpoint to the COVID incidence patterns over the 3 months and reflecting a well-below average influenza and respiratory illness season. And total inpatient activity was modestly above seasonal baseline, with over 55,000 COVID-19-related admissions during the quarter compared to 65,000 in the fourth quarter 2020. 
Moving to business unit performance. OptumHealth's first quarter revenue and earnings increased 35% year-over-year. Revenue per consumer served grew 31% over the year ago quarter. The growth in this metric continues to reflect the expanding number of people served under value-based care arrangements and the increasing acuity of the care services we offer. 
OptumInsight's revenue grew 14% in the quarter and earnings 45%, due to growth in our services and technology offerings and improved productivity. The revenue backlog at $20.8 billion grew $1.6 billion over the first quarter 2020, as more normalized business activity started to return among our provider and payer customers. 
OptumRx revenue and earnings were relatively consistent year-over-year and in line with our expectations. Adjusted scripts declined modestly from the year-ago quarter, a period during which we provided advanced medications to the people we serve as the pandemic began. Pharmacy care and specialty services continue to grow strongly, in particular, home infusion and our community behavioral health pharmacies. 
Turning to UnitedHealthcare. First quarter operating results reflected strong execution and continued membership growth. In addition to the growth in commercial and Medicare Advantage offerings noted earlier, people served in managed Medicaid programs grew by nearly 1.1 million over the year-ago quarter. Of the 900,000 new seniors we expect to serve within Medicare Advantage this year, about 775,000 are in individual and group and 125,000 in dual special needs offering. 
Of importance to the senior customers we serve, our house calls clinicians have been considerably more able compared to this time last year to provide their vital services. We conducted nearly 600,000 home visits in the quarter as more seniors and caregivers were vaccinated and comfortable having in-person visit. That's up by 1/3 compared to first quarter 2020 and about 4x higher than what was achieved in the second quarter 2020. 
Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong, with first quarter cash flows from operations at $6 billion or 1.2x net income. As we look forward toward the combination with Change Healthcare, we intend to maintain our long-standing capital policy. These include our approach to returning capital to shareholders via share repurchase and an advancing dividend, with ample capacity to continue building upon our strategic growth platform. 
We now expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $18.10 to $18.60, an increase of $0.35 from the outlook we offered at our investor conference. This outlook continues to include an estimated $1.80 per share of unfavorable COVID-19-related effects. The substantial majority of which we still expect to occur in the latter part of the year, largely as carriers more freely able to be delivered to people. 
Now I'll turn it back to Andrew."

I'm going to ask, in a second, Dr. Decker. And also, I think I'll ask Dirk McMahon to make a couple of comments, but let me just preface that.
So we've obviously seen Telehealth develop as a set of capabilities over the last several years. We've been a very extensive user of those capabilities. But I think one of the things we've seen from 2020 and the pandemic is really a kind of shift in terms of people's thinking and willingness to utilize Telehealth. We also think that the way in which they're being utilized are -- is evolving.
And so what you're going to see from us, and it's one of the examples I might cite in terms of the opportunity for new product development between Optum and United Healthcare, is you're going to see UnitedHealth Group lean forward into much more integrated Telehealth capabilities. We've got a number of new initiatives in deployment as we speak, operating between the 2 companies.

And of course, across the country, we've seen a massive shift in consumer adoption and willingness to engage in virtual health solutions as well as with our providers more broadly.
So our philosophy is that not all Telehealth is created equally. And as we continue to develop our new products, you'll see us integrating physical care, virtual care, home care and behavioral care in a way that is innovative and differentiated. And in fact, we've already launched a product we call Optum virtual care, that is live in all 50 states and is doing just that. And what will really differentiate our product to those that we serve is the ability to offer virtual solutions, but then if necessary, immediately connect them to a live bricks-and-mortar solution for more complex or thorough care as well as identifying and triaging both physical and behavioral health care needs and offering comprehensive behavioral health care.
We're seeing continued sustainability of virtual care solutions, which, as you may know, peaked during the height of the pandemic, have declined some, but are still probably 10x where they were pre-pandemic and certain conditions or behavior -- or areas like behavioral health care are now seeing about 50% utilization through virtual services.

So just a few impacts here. I think the first important impact, I suggested that if a significant majority, I'd call it, 70% of our projected COVID impact is -- really occurs in the second half of the year. And just to be frank, we just don't know enough now about what is going to happen later in the year, kind of have a very meaningfully different projection of what our full year results will be in terms of will they be better in terms of better than the original projections, except for what we've experienced thus far, which we would expect -- expect to see some stronger underlying business performance, growth across a number of businesses. We've executed well on productivity measures, and maybe just very modestly less impact in the 1Q, unfavorable impact than we would have anticipated. 
But the important component there being that it is really much more a back half-weighted view in terms of COVID-19 impact. That's really premised upon our expectation that as we get later in the year, people are going to be more able to access previously deferred care and higher acuity levels as a result of missed or postponed treatments. And that's what we're -- that's what we built -- that's what we build into that view in terms of an expectation. But that's really an unusual time still, no question. And we therefore, increased our full year estimate, but -- by what we know today."

And before I pass it to Wyatt, again to respond to the specifics, let me just give you a sense of how we see this playing out.
And I think the answer to your question is really both. So we absolutely see tremendous opportunity to continue to develop a variety of different clinic types. And if you look at the -- I cited one particular example, but we've been opening a wide number of different type of clinics depending on the environment that -- or the locality that we're operating in. And you should continue to expect to see that degree of customization according to the need of the geography. It's not a one-size-fits-all model by any means. So you'll continue to see that. 
But at the same time, we strongly believe there is opportunity over the next few years. And this is why I focused in my kind of second area of going deeper around technology. How we can then help those clinics operate more efficiently? How we can ensure they are better connected, both locally with other clinics that we may own or to a higher level of information support? So we see this has been a highly activated network of clinics and centers.
The center -- the network itself will have a high degree of diversity in it because it needs to be responsive to the needs of the locality, the communities that we're operating in. And of course, as sensitive to the previous comments, it will have a very significant Telehealth capability deployed alongside it.
Wyatt, maybe you could talk a little bit to how you see the progression within the $20 million?"

And one of the pieces that will differentiate us as a comprehensive care provider is just that, being comprehensive. And so you'll see us continuing to weave together products and services that meet people's needs in new and innovative ways, and Telehealth and digital solutions are a big piece, but not the only piece. 
The other part that I'd call out is we're increasingly leveraging technology to bring advanced decision support to our physicians and providers. And you may have heard previously about optimal care. This is a value-based care delivery set of decision tools that are yielding real results, giving people the best, highest quality care that eliminates what we tend to call low-value care, and is a differentiator. So we'll continue to deploy those technologies.
As you know, we are on track to grow by over 10,000 physicians. We're now at 56,000 doctors, both affiliated, contracted and employed. And we'll leverage all of those models as we go forward. And we continue to evolve and employ doctors who are really actually quite attracted to our model of value-based primary care. We eliminate much of the clerical burden in our physicians and advanced practitioners' practice and let them focus on the work they love. So this is really gaining traction among our physician workforce.
And then to your point around how much of the 20 million lives that we serve today will ultimately be capitated. We anticipate that not only will a significant portion, you heard the number 2 million today and 0.25 million, as we mentioned, growing. So as we continue to grow, we also expect that we'll always offer a host of modalities, including fee-for-service. And that actually is a feeder system as we think about value-based care being kind of the core of what we offer, and fully capitated the core of the core, if you will. Thank you."

To the question around sort of center-based, tech-based, data-enabled and different versions of that, that Wyatt was talking about, Optum at home is a great example of a collaboration between UnitedHealthcare and Optum. It's in relatively early stages. But we focused on Medicare Advantage members that are in dual special need plans initially, and that's a full risk offering. And we're doing it in markets where we don't currently have local OptumCare practices. 
So what we're doing in the program is really both providing care, but also arranging and coordinating care, so trying to address medical, behavioral and social needs. And the results initially have been great. We've improved access for people with more than 80% having an in-home visit, and more than half of them getting connected back into office-based care, social services referrals and so forth as well as great health quality and outcomes.
So today, we've got a little under 100,000 lives across 6 markets. We're looking to expand that across Medicare Advantage Dual SNP but also into the individual MA. We're doing it with UnitedHealthcare and ultimately, look to do that with other health plans. So another growth vector for us as we look at building out our value-based orientation."

When you back out the impact of some suppressed utilization, the underlying factors associated with medical cost trend largely looked like they did. We aren't seeing significant upticks in services in specific areas out of the norm. So I would say it looks a lot like utilization prior to the COVID implications.
And when I think by line of business, I would say, generally tracking a little below baseline in both our government programs, closer to baseline inside our commercial business, but largely in track with what we had expected. And where it's a little out of line, again, where perhaps infection rates were higher, and we saw that naturally offset with greater utilization. So first quarter, I would say, largely as expected."

Your point in terms of how we think about as we get later into the year and why that moves like it does? And you heard my commentary that significant majority of the $1.80 we have layered into the second half of the year, that is largely because of the assumptions around those elements, that we see -- that people are increasingly able to get the care they need. The amount of care deferral declined meaningfully as you get into the latter part of the year. They're accessing the system. And we do get into these elements where we see rising acuity coming in.

That's a great question. So I think our bias is increasingly, and I think rightly, toward driving a more and more seamless, simple, easy-to-access care environment, both for the patient and the provider, actually.
So what that speaks to is trying to avoid the fragmentation of the interface and definitely trying to avoid the fragmentation of the information that then sits behind it. So we want to really try and create much more seamless opportunity. And so for example, I'll give you a real example in Optum virtual, which is -- you've heard a little bit about on the call already today.
So of course, patients are looking for a way to engage with a physician. They actually want to talk to their physicians. So one of the things that we're doing is building that platform. But then there might be situations where the physician wants to bring in a specialist into that conversation.
Now in a multidisciplinary clinic, they might be in a position, in normal times, to go down the hall, get somebody to come down and visit. Now in Optum virtual, they're able to do that kind of thing. So that's an example of trying to bring that integration even within the virtual space. So it kind of replicates a little bit more what you might expect in a physical environment.
And so we definitely see the need to try and drive toward that, and we definitely want to try and create the fluidity of the information to ensure that physicians have what they need when they're in front of the patient, when they're talking to the patient, they can make the best possible choices. So we want them to be as highly educated as possible in that context. So we're leaning much -- we're leaning very much toward the idea of integrated, seamless, and that's true whether you're in the physical or the virtual space, and we want the 2 to sit together.

A.J, listen, we were pleased with the quarter. It was a really good quarter on the top line, and that, of course, drove profitable growth that contributed to margin.
But specifically on margin, we also are really seeing the results of a lot of the modernization work we did across 2020. So last year, we undertook a significant review of the business across the operations and drove -- find some multiple ways to drive stronger and more efficient performance and help find -- ensure that the investments we are making were invested appropriately against our key growth opportunities.
And so if you look at those initiatives, multiple automation initiatives using advanced techniques and AI, NLP, machine learning, it really drove a lot of short-term productivity. But it also drives a situation where we feel like we've made sustainable margin improvements for the long term, and that puts us in a position to be more competitive. And that actually rolls over to exactly what you were mentioning, being more competitive on the large engagements.
And as Andrew said, we feel really optimistic about that pipeline and where it's headed. The disruption was more in timing and not really an interest during the pandemic. In fact, during the pandemic, I think there was growing recognition among our health system relationships that this was a very productive way to work with Optum and a really important need for them as they face some disruption even coming out of the pandemic to their finances in ways that we can sustainably support them in a really holistic way. So we feel like that's a great path forward. We're excited about the business and feel like we've made some important changes that put us on a really good track going forward."

In an enterprise with our breadth of market engagement, we have many ways to assess how we're doing. I'd like to share some of those metrics with you, picking up on Andrew's commentary on our 3 key strategic themes. 
First, collaboration. UnitedHealthcare's value proposition is rooted in lower costs, better outcomes and a better experience. Optum supports this value proposition for UnitedHealthcare and other health plans with ambulatory services, which patients and their doctors value. 
In this quarter, we met the ambulatory surgery needs of over 250,000 patients, delivering exceptional care in convenient and affordable settings with revenue growth approaching 20% over the non-pandemic affected 2019 second quarter. These centers are meeting higher acuity and more complex needs, such as total joint replacement spine and cardiovascular procedures, which are performed at an increasing number of centers. Our ambulatory settings received a consumer NPS of 92, and we deliver better and more consistent quality outcomes at about half the cost of traditional settings. 
OptumCare has over 1,600 clinics and is rapidly expanding virtual offerings to serve patients in settings where they feel the most comfortable and, importantly, with their own physician. Seniors served by OptumCare under our integrated care approach spend considerably more time with their primary care physicians than seniors in traditional Medicare and, as a result, spend 1/3 fewer days in a hospital. 
Second is our strategy to increase the application of technology to improve patient care and help the system run better. We recently announced the partnership with Bassett Healthcare, another strong example of how OptumInsight is helping health systems to expand and scale essential capabilities, including revenue cycle management and digital modernization to improve health outcomes and patients' health care experiences. We expect to continue to add new partnerships like this. 
Also at OptumInsight, we've been tackling the most resource-intensive operations through the deployment of advanced technology and other approaches. For example, we have transformed what were once largely manual chart review processes into highly automated operations. 
Third, we have been hard at work advancing our consumer capabilities. UnitedHealthcare has made significant advances in the management of complex conditions. We're focused on making sure that patients with the highest acute care needs are able to access the most appropriate site of care by assigning them advocates to help navigate the system. Nearly 1 million of these members are matched with a personal navigator to help them manage and improve their health. 
OptumRx continues to improve access and affordability of home delivery for patients, leading to significant improvements in continuity of care and having already reduced the cost to process and dispense prescriptions by nearly 20% in just the past 2 years. Also, along consumer cost savings lines, for those who prefer an in-store retail experience, we now offer tools to find the lowest cost prescriptions near them regardless of the health benefits -- of their health benefits coverage status. These tools can save self-paying consumers up to 80% on their medications. 
Consumer preference is also having an impact in behavioral health. Already this year, the OptumHealth behavioral platform has delivered over 500,000 virtual visits, an option we initiated in just the last year. Many consumers and clinicians prefer these virtual encounters since they offer enhanced accessibility, flexibility and simplicity. Care encounters delivered through our dedicated channel have a patient satisfaction of 98%.  
These are just a few of the many initiatives we are executing on as we apply technology, data and analytics to make our strategic growth agenda come alive. We look forward to updating you on our progress over the quarters to come. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex."
104673,1671940210,2345995,"UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2021",2021-07-15,"Earnings Calls","UnitedHealth Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dirk.

Our first half performance supports the foundation for strong and expanding growth for the remainder of this year and beyond. Before I review business performance, I'll offer a brief perspective on the pandemic-driven trends we're observing. The core takeaway is that our outlook for COVID-19 impact is consistent with our past commentary. The second quarter showed overall care activity continuing to trend toward baseline or normalized levels, albeit with variation across lines of business. For example, in commercial markets, care activity was above baseline as members were willing and able to obtain needed care, some of which was deferred from prior periods. Our public sector markets continue to run below baseline, even as we are actively encouraging people to get the care they need. We were gratified to see care activity for these populations begin to progress over the course of the quarter as vaccination rates advanced. We continue to estimate approximately $1.80 per share of unfavorable COVID-19 impacts for full year 2021 and to expect the majority of these effects to occur in the second half. 
Moving to overall business performance. OptumHealth's second quarter revenue and earnings increased 46% and 34%, respectively, year-over-year. Revenue per consumer grew by 43%, reflecting the impact of accountable arrangements and our expanding home and community health platform, combined with the growing complexity of the needs we're serving. Of the 20 million patients we serve through OptumCare, over 2 million are in fully accountable or capitated care arrangements, an increase of 17% from a year ago, and we expect this pacing to accelerate strongly in the years ahead. 
OptumInsight's revenue grew 12% in the quarter and earnings grew 36% with the revenue backlog increasing by $1.9 billion to $21.3 billion. Key growth drivers were managed services, the continued recovery of care activity to more normal levels and further implementations of technology-enabled services. In particular, we are seeing strong sales momentum in the services, software and analytics businesses, which serve care providers. 
OptumRx revenue and earnings increased 5% and 19% year-over-year, and script growth was 8%, with this comparison impacted by last year's pandemic-affected care patterns. Our expanding pharmacy care and specialty services continue to grow strongly now comprising just under half of OptumRx revenues. 
Turning to UnitedHealthcare. We are encouraged by the receptivity to our expanding set of responsive commercial benefits centered around Virtual First, on-demand and physician-led offerings. Year-to-date, we have added about 150,000 members in such innovative commercial offerings, even with the evolving and uneven labor market trends which impacted second quarter membership. Medicare Advantage membership has grown by 675,000 year-to-date, tracking well to our full year outlook. Our HouseCalls clinicians have been able to provide their vital services to seniors conducting over 1.1 million home visits in the first half, more than double the year ago level. 
People served in managed Medicaid programs grew by nearly 920,000 over the year ago quarter in part as state-based redetermination activities remained on hold. Our Medicaid offerings continue to deliver a positive consumer experience and demonstrable cost effectiveness for our state government partners, and we look for this momentum to build heading into next year. 
Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong with second quarter cash flows from operations at $5.5 billion or 1.3x net income. -- and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 40%. And in early June, our Board of Directors increased the dividend by 16%. 
As noted earlier, given the strength of our business performance, we've updated our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $18.30 to $18.80 per share. inclusive of the COVID-19 impact incorporated into our full year view. Within this, we expect the pacing through the second half to be fairly level. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew."

I mean a couple of things. obviously, still too early to give you kind of real shape in for 2022. So you won't be surprised we won't go there. And I would say the overwhelming story for this year is, of course, the dynamic of COVID in terms of the various puts and takes, which are taking place under the surface. And as we've done for the last several quarters, we've tried to kind of dimension that within the $1.80. But as we've also said repeatedly, the bulk of that $1.80 sits in the rest of the year, the year to go between now and the end of 2021. And so really, really pleased with the momentum and underlying performance of the company in the first 2 quarters of this year but also respectful of uncertainties that remain around the COVID puts and takes. And -- And of course, and that all feeds into how we make the judgment on raising the earnings expectation for the rest of the year. 
I think where I sit, I feel great about that underlying performance. So far, broadly speaking, the COVID dynamic has played the way we would have anticipated more or less. But there's still a ways to go and there are uncertainties within that. And maybe, John, you might go a little further and take that $1.80 apart and maybe reflect a little bit on how you're seeing those different elements of the driver of that."

So within the $1.80, we still expect about 70% of that to occur within -- in the second half of the year. So the vast majority, a lot to be seen on how that $1.80 really plays out. Keep in mind, kind of the main elements of that comprises. It's the direct treatment and testing costs that we would see offset by elective care deferral that might continue to occur or not in the rest of the year; the potential for higher acuity for those that have missed or deferred care; and at least within 2021, the impact of the care deferrals that occurred last year. So those are all super important components here. Within those elements, the things to play out would be most around the direct treatment and testing costs and the potential for higher acuity and how much care occurs in the back half. 
The other elements within the $1.80, I would say, are more steady throughout the course of the year. So that point being around care deferral in 2020 and the related revenue impacts for 2021, those should be relatively steady and I would say are running in line with the expectations that were set out for you back in December. So I don't think we've had a surprise on that element within our outlook. And I would say the kind of economic impacts, also pretty relatively steady over the course of the year in terms of the quarterly progression. So those are really the elements we continue to look for. 
You're right. Look, we saw good strength in a lot of the business, growth across the platform, really, we could point to every business. But it's a look-out to really understanding how those trends play in the second half of the year. Thank you."

And before I -- I'm going to ask Dr. Decker to make a few comments in a minute or 2 but maybe just make a couple of introductory observations. 
So first off, I think you're really starting to see OptumHealth broadly. And within that business, in particular, Optum Care and, of course, home And community really starting to demonstrate their capacity for growth because of the scale of the footprint that they now establish across the country. And I think you're starting to see these businesses move into a kind of critical mass dynamic. That's reflected in its overall growth. It's also reflected in this very rapid expansion of OptumHealth revenue per consumer up over 40% this quarter. That's reflective of the quality of services which are being delivered and the perceived value that they obviously reflect. So we feel very good about that. 
Your question around capacity constraints is a really good question. We continue to extend rapidly the number of physicians and clinicians in our organization either directly or through affiliation. This year, we expect to add about 10,000. We're well over halfway through that journey, so going super well on that front. 
I would say one of the key elements is really making sure that those practices as rapidly as possible start to develop the skills to be able to manage capitated risk, which is really what then drives a tremendous amount of the distinctive behavior and value creation for patients and, of course, for the system. That process, I think, has been continually refined. As you would be well aware, in the marketplace, people have tried different models. They don't always work super well. I'll maybe ask Dr. Decker in a second to dive a little bit more detail into some of the work they're doing there to accelerate that dimension of capacity because it's not simply having the practices and the clinicians. It's having that way of working which really drives the change in what we're able to do. 
As far as your last question is concerned, I actually think that the Optum Care clinics within the broader Optum and UHG organization, that's where some of the magic really sits here in terms of being able to leverage many different aspects. And as you see these elements of OptumHealth and Optum Care, in particular, develop, you're also seeing [Audio Gap] and health, if you will, being provided by other businesses across the organization. Payment integrity, good example, beginning to be adopted by parts of Optum Care. 
So with all of that, I'd like Dr. Decker, maybe just to go a little deeper on how we move or how we help practices develop the capabilities which allow them to deliver the value we're now seeing."

So you're quite right that a lot of what we're -- we focus on is, well, first and foremost, to try and understand what is the very best care that an individual needs and to make sure that they get access to that. And one of",384,"Ricky, that's a great question. So you're quite right that a lot of what we're -- we focus on is, well, first and foremost, to try and understand what is the very best care that an individual needs and to make sure that they get access to that. And one of the big things we've been doing this year is trying to get people, particularly seniors, back into the system, those who may be held back because of the pandemic. And as you heard earlier, we're glad to see some of that move in, albeit some way to go. 
Now within that, we also recognize there are a whole series of places, where, frankly, there are better, more effective ways to deliver care. I'm going to pick out one very simple example just to build on what you described. So if I think about some of the work that's going on at OptumRx and within our Optum infusion business, you can take drugs where perhaps $10,000, $15,000 per treatment for a hospital outpatient, exactly the same drug being delivered by Optum at-home infusion, $3,500. I mean, just that's the kind of impact that we can deliver through really thoughtful application of location of delivery and the like. And that's just one example. UHC are very much focused on this in much of their guidance, and of course, Optum is building a variety of different capabilities. 
Having said all of that, I think the reality is it's very early days, even for us in terms of change in behavior against the overall trend of the health care system. So I think that baseline in of 2019 probably is the right rational piece. Over time, I think these practices will start to bear down on the overall trend of cost. But of course, that's -- that will happen as we see those capabilities spread more broadly as we see them get more adoption and that starts to change the price point in the marketplace for some of these treatments or therapies, which are frankly overpriced. And what our clients are looking for us to do, both through UnitedHealthcare and doctors who find ways to get great care at lower cost, and that's exactly what we're focused on doing. So Ricky, thanks so much for the question."

That 8% script growth, about half of that is we would estimate kind of bounce back from the suppression of this time last year caused by the COVID -- the initial waves of the COVID disruption. But even having said that, the 4% residual growth is great. And we feel very good about the performance of the OptumRx business across its breadth of businesses. So within the kind of core PBM, but also across all of its various other pharmacy services businesses, which the company has been invested in over the last several years. We did about 10 million vaccine prescriptions, I think, year-to-date.

So yes, I think as Andrew said, so maybe I'll take script volume quickly and then just to finish that off and then maybe talk a little bit about selling season. So as Andrew said, really, if you look at whether ours is indicative of other things you've seen, what I'd say is specific to us, what you've seen over the last year is, yes, about half of that is the rebound from compression. And the rest of that is really a little bit of vaccine volume, and Andrew gave you the number there but that really hits volumes for us more than anything else because of the -- just the ratio of revenue to script there. And then in addition to that, there's a continued double-digit growth in the pharmacy services businesses. So that's making up the bulk of the additional growth that you're seeing year-over-year there. 
As far as the split of acute maintenance, et cetera. So I guess I would say we just had this discussion about what baseline is. I guess, again, we're kind of watching this in quarterly progressions. But I'd basically say that we're seeing second quarter look more like '19 than it certainly did from the -- looking like second quarter of 2020. And we basically don't see anything unique there as far as acute versus -- as far as acute ratio kind of back to what we saw prepandemic for this quarter. 
Maybe let me switch quickly to selling season. So we're still in the midst of it this year, and that's for all segments that's for employer. It's for health plan, public sector and coalition. And I'd say, generally, same activity, maybe a little different pacing of decision-making right now, but really in the midst of it. The biggest thing I would say about the selling season is clients are very interested in solutions to address high cost of specialty drugs and getting to medications and therapies that really help on the medical and the pharmacy side. So for us, we're very focused on those solutions, and we're finding that our site of care services for alternative sites and alternative therapies like biosimilars, together with some of our specialty programs that work through OptumHealth and OptumRx and straddle the medical and pharmacy benefit, are really resonating, together with our really intense clinical consulting that we're bringing to the market right now. So we're finding that resonating in the selling season, and we think we've got a lot of value out there. So hopefully, that answers your question."

We're already up to 582 of those centers. We're well on the way to close to double what we had when they first became part of the organization.

The impact they have in terms of helping improve adherence for highly complex patients, particularly those patients who are served through our Medicaid books of business, is super important.

In terms of utilization in commercial populations, interestingly, that was also the highest course of the quarter but still just marginally -- very marginally above baseline as we -- in June as we exited June.

And then as you might expect, that trends up progressively every quarter, every quarter, you'd see rising in that overall level utilization and the expectations as we head into the end of the year. 
Embedded in that is also a view in terms of what happens with intensity, acuity levels. One comment that -- a question that we've often received is what are we seeing currently in acuity levels to progress. And part of the impact as we progress in the second half is an expectation that you do see rising acuity levels. I'd tell you, we haven't observed that yet, but it's still probably a little bit early to say. When we -- among the things we look at, we look at new cancer diagnoses, new cardiac diagnoses. Those are still running below baseline levels that we'd expect. But they're -- a view to that could continue to progress as we get into the back half of the year. 
The other element in terms of just thinking about utilization and rising in the back of the year is -- and ultimately, this is one of the calls, what occurs with COVID testing and treatment costs. Clearly, there's been the evidence of the new variants and their impact in other countries and then also moving into the U.S. And even in our own data, we can see that but I would tell you still fairly limited in terms of impact. And as I sit here and look at a number of members of our members that we have in receiving treatment today in hospital beds today as you say here this morning, still well below the levels even we sit here in mid-July, what we were seeing in the April level. but that could be a trend back factor also in the second half of the year as we see that progression."

BT just mentioned, encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of seniors and their receptivity to even going in and seeing their physicians. That's all super important. 
I don't know if timing is so important on that piece. It just needs to occur during the year in terms of when that activity occurs. So that would be more the more important factor as it relates to 2022. Does it occur in 2021? Do they get in? So that's an important factor. 
Other factors here, I would say. So there's care that didn't occur in 2020 and probably hasn't occurred in '21 yet that was deferred and needs to occur. So that's more about also an element of, does it not occur at all in this year; does it work its way into 2022 and the potential for and kind of the resident impact of whether or not there's an increase in acuity or that -- from those populations. 
That -- those are really kind of the main elements, I would say, in terms of what I would call timing-related. The other elements are more just -- would be around this concept around the occurrence of COVID-19 incidents, direct treatment and testing costs, how that progresses over the back half of the year, too.

I'm going to ask Dirk in a second to make a couple of comments around the overall shift towards digital first, virtual first and may also ask Dr. Decker to refer to some of further what's going on within OptumHealth, which is an important around Optum virtual. 
As I've made super clear over the last couple of quarters, really elevating our consumer focus is a top priority for the whole company. And that really speaks to ensuring that we're delivering simpler, more intuitive experiences that we're thinking about the journey of the consumer and the patient in an end-to-end sense, that we're making it easier for them to make all of the various sequential decisions. And we also want to meet the consumer where they want to be met, whether that be outside of a facility in their home, online or in person. 
And we also -- we fully recognize how the premium that patients and consumers in particular put on being able to talk to the physicians they know rather than rather than just any physician. And so how we start to pool all of that together is essentially reflected in many of the different initiatives we have. 
Over the last few quarters, you've seen us build up things like Optum Virtual, Dr. Decker will talk to you in a second. But things like Optum Store just been rolled out under the OptumRx organization really starts to bring together a ton of access for consumers in terms of what they're able to do with us.

The product with respect to Virtual First, to answer your specific question, we plan on rolling that out in 8, 9 markets in UnitedHealthcare at the end of this year. What it will basically be is think of it as sort of a virtual PCP with an OptumCare dock being the quarterback with UnitedHealthcare Navigate network back in and up for the physical access.

And you would have to expect that the answer is that some of it would have been unnecessary. I think at this distance, it's a little hard to really call that at this point. I mean there are some tantalizing signals in some of the trends. So if you look at emergency department use, for example, it looks pretty sustained down and doesn't seem to be coming back. 
And certainly, if you look at our Advisory Board surveys that we're running with many, many non-UHC providers and institutions across American Healthcare, people don't -- a lot of people don't expect that ED utilization to come back. Now that may be because they would be unnecessarily used. Maybe folks have realized that urgent care centers are a much better option. Maybe virtual is a much better option that they can get what they need at a much lower cost. 
So whether it's unnecessary, whether or not the pandemic has disturbed people's allegiance for certain types of sites of care and people are a little bit more open-minded about where to go, all of that, I think, is in play. I would say it's premature to call it. I think we're watching it really carefully. I could build those theories I just shared with you. I'm not going to tell you that those are [indiscernible].

As we discuss our enterprise today, I hope you sense its growing momentum as we advance on our path of improving the quality, cost and experience of health care for everyone we serve. Both Optum and UnitedHealth",617,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As we discuss our enterprise today, I hope you sense its growing momentum as we advance on our path of improving the quality, cost and experience of health care for everyone we serve. Both Optum and UnitedHealthcare grew and delivered on our long-standing strategy, and we've increased our outlook for the year to a range of $18.30 to $18.80 per share. 
We continue to prioritize 3 key themes that we believe will underpin the next era of growth for our enterprise: first, unlock the collaborative opportunities within and between Optum and UnitedHealthcare; second, increasingly apply technology to improve patient care and experience and to help the system run better; and third, strengthen our consumer focus, capabilities and value. 
During the quarter, we accelerated our efforts to develop and deploy new and innovative products, informed by the insights of both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. In areas such as oncology care delivery, rare disease drug management, Optum Virtual, Optum Financial Services and many others. We're doubling down on efforts to both expand and link services where it creates value for consumers and patients to make their health care journey easier, simpler and more intuitive. 
We constantly challenge ourselves to develop capabilities, which lead to improved care, better value and a simpler system. Our sales to clients and partners across all parts of the health system demonstrate the strong relevance of our innovation. And the strengthening of our sales pipeline is a key opportunity as we emerge from the COVID market pause. 
A good example of bringing our collective strengths together at scale is the Optum home and community care platform, through which we care for nearly 10 million people. This platform includes our well-known HouseCalls service, comprehensive post-acute care for smoother transitions to home and integrated primary and behavioral care for Medicare Advantage patients who prefer to receive their care at home. Home and community platform services can reduce post-acute medical care cost by quart, unnecessary readmissions by up to 1/5 and hospital admissions by up to 25%. 
In Medicaid, we're addressing consumer needs by expanding our long-term collaboration with public housing authorities, working with government agencies and community-based organizations to identify and address specific health care issues for people who are hard to reach and support. In just the past 6 months, we've introduced new partnerships in over 20 communities to close gaps in care and address health equity challenges. 
Using data and analytic capabilities, we're able to rapidly identify local health trends and gaps and then work with community partners to inform guidelines, training materials, processes and create better tools to advance health. We believe this will result in better health of community members and help to optimize limited state resources. These and other targeted initiatives on the social determinants of health are essential elements and illustrative of our natural and long-standing ESG impact.
Our recently published sustainability report captures the full range of efforts we've dedicated ourselves to in areas of crucial concern to our stakeholders, none more so than advancing health and health equity. This agenda is an essential part of our way of doing business. I'd like to thank our 330,000 colleagues from across the company for the passion and diligence they show every day in helping to deliver improvements in serving our members, clients and patients. I have great confidence that we're emerging from the last 18 months of disruption with an unprecedented set of opportunities to help improve the health system for all of those we can serve. And now I'll turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon, to provide more detail on the initiatives to drive performance across the organization"

In an enterprise with our breadth of market engagement, we have many ways to assess how we're doing. I'd like to share some of those metrics with you, picking up on Andrew's commentary on our 3 key strategic themes. 
First, collaboration. UnitedHealthcare's value proposition is rooted in lower costs, better outcomes and a better experience. Optum supports this value proposition for UnitedHealthcare and other health plans with ambulatory services, which patients and their doctors value. 
In this quarter, we met the ambulatory surgery needs of over 250,000 patients, delivering exceptional care in convenient and affordable settings with revenue growth approaching 20% over the non-pandemic affected 2019 second quarter. These centers are meeting higher acuity and more complex needs, such as total joint replacement spine and cardiovascular procedures, which are performed at an increasing number of centers. Our ambulatory settings received a consumer NPS of 92, and we deliver better and more consistent quality outcomes at about half the cost of traditional settings. 
OptumCare has over 1,600 clinics and is rapidly expanding virtual offerings to serve patients in settings where they feel the most comfortable and, importantly, with their own physician. Seniors served by OptumCare under our integrated care approach spend considerably more time with their primary care physicians than seniors in traditional Medicare and, as a result, spend 1/3 fewer days in a hospital. 
Second is our strategy to increase the application of technology to improve patient care and help the system run better. We recently announced the partnership with Bassett Healthcare, another strong example of how OptumInsight is helping health systems to expand and scale essential capabilities, including revenue cycle management and digital modernization to improve health outcomes and patients' health care experiences. We expect to continue to add new partnerships like this. 
Also at OptumInsight, we've been tackling the most resource-intensive operations through the deployment of advanced technology and other approaches. For example, we have transformed what were once largely manual chart review processes into highly automated operations. 
Third, we have been hard at work advancing our consumer capabilities. UnitedHealthcare has made significant advances in the management of complex conditions. We're focused on making sure that patients with the highest acute care needs are able to access the most appropriate site of care by assigning them advocates to help navigate the system. Nearly 1 million of these members are matched with a personal navigator to help them manage and improve their health. 
OptumRx continues to improve access and affordability of home delivery for patients, leading to significant improvements in continuity of care and having already reduced the cost to process and dispense prescriptions by nearly 20% in just the past 2 years. Also, along consumer cost savings lines, for those who prefer an in-store retail experience, we now offer tools to find the lowest cost prescriptions near them regardless of the health benefits -- of their health benefits coverage status. These tools can save self-paying consumers up to 80% on their medications. 
Consumer preference is also having an impact in behavioral health. Already this year, the OptumHealth behavioral platform has delivered over 500,000 virtual visits, an option we initiated in just the last year. Many consumers and clinicians prefer these virtual encounters since they offer enhanced accessibility, flexibility and simplicity. Care encounters delivered through our dedicated channel have a patient satisfaction of 98%.  
These are just a few of the many initiatives we are executing on as we apply technology, data and analytics to make our strategic growth agenda come alive. We look forward to updating you on our progress over the quarters to come. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex."

Our first half performance supports the foundation for strong and expanding growth for the remainder of this year and beyond. Before I review business performance, I'll offer a brief perspective on the pandemic-driven trends we're observing. The core takeaway is that our outlook for COVID-19 impact is consistent with our past commentary. The second quarter showed overall care activity continuing to trend toward baseline or normalized levels, albeit with variation across lines of business. For example, in commercial markets, care activity was above baseline as members were willing and able to obtain needed care, some of which was deferred from prior periods. Our public sector markets continue to run below baseline, even as we are actively encouraging people to get the care they need. We were gratified to see care activity for these populations begin to progress over the course of the quarter as vaccination rates advanced. We continue to estimate approximately $1.80 per share of unfavorable COVID-19 impacts for full year 2021 and to expect the majority of these effects to occur in the second half. 
Moving to overall business performance. OptumHealth's second quarter revenue and earnings increased 46% and 34%, respectively, year-over-year. Revenue per consumer grew by 43%, reflecting the impact of accountable arrangements and our expanding home and community health platform, combined with the growing complexity of the needs we're serving. Of the 20 million patients we serve through OptumCare, over 2 million are in fully accountable or capitated care arrangements, an increase of 17% from a year ago, and we expect this pacing to accelerate strongly in the years ahead. 
OptumInsight's revenue grew 12% in the quarter and earnings grew 36% with the revenue backlog increasing by $1.9 billion to $21.3 billion. Key growth drivers were managed services, the continued recovery of care activity to more normal levels and further implementations of technology-enabled services. In particular, we are seeing strong sales momentum in the services, software and analytics businesses, which serve care providers. 
OptumRx revenue and earnings increased 5% and 19% year-over-year, and script growth was 8%, with this comparison impacted by last year's pandemic-affected care patterns. Our expanding pharmacy care and specialty services continue to grow strongly now comprising just under half of OptumRx revenues. 
Turning to UnitedHealthcare. We are encouraged by the receptivity to our expanding set of responsive commercial benefits centered around Virtual First, on-demand and physician-led offerings. Year-to-date, we have added about 150,000 members in such innovative commercial offerings, even with the evolving and uneven labor market trends which impacted second quarter membership. Medicare Advantage membership has grown by 675,000 year-to-date, tracking well to our full year outlook. Our HouseCalls clinicians have been able to provide their vital services to seniors conducting over 1.1 million home visits in the first half, more than double the year ago level. 
People served in managed Medicaid programs grew by nearly 920,000 over the year ago quarter in part as state-based redetermination activities remained on hold. Our Medicaid offerings continue to deliver a positive consumer experience and demonstrable cost effectiveness for our state government partners, and we look for this momentum to build heading into next year. 
Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong with second quarter cash flows from operations at $5.5 billion or 1.3x net income. -- and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 40%. And in early June, our Board of Directors increased the dividend by 16%. 
As noted earlier, given the strength of our business performance, we've updated our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $18.30 to $18.80 per share. inclusive of the COVID-19 impact incorporated into our full year view. Within this, we expect the pacing through the second half to be fairly level. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew."

And I would say the overwhelming story for this year is, of course, the dynamic of COVID in terms of the various puts and takes, which are taking place under the surface. And as we've done for the last several quarters, we've tried to kind of dimension that within the $1.80. But as we've also said repeatedly, the bulk of that $1.80 sits in the rest of the year, the year to go between now and the end of 2021. And so really, really pleased with the momentum and underlying performance of the company in the first 2 quarters of this year but also respectful of uncertainties that remain around the COVID puts and takes. And -- And of course, and that all feeds into how we make the judgment on raising the earnings expectation for the rest of the year. 
I think where I sit, I feel great about that underlying performance. So far, broadly speaking, the COVID dynamic has played the way we would have anticipated more or less. But there's still a ways to go and there are uncertainties within that. And maybe, John, you might go a little further and take that $1.80 apart and maybe reflect a little bit on how you're seeing those different elements of the driver of that."

So within the $1.80, we still expect about 70% of that to occur within -- in the second half of the year. So the vast majority, a lot to be seen on how that $1.80 really plays out. Keep in mind, kind of the main elements of that comprises. It's the direct treatment and testing costs that we would see offset by elective care deferral that might continue to occur or not in the rest of the year; the potential for higher acuity for those that have missed or deferred care; and at least within 2021, the impact of the care deferrals that occurred last year. So those are all super important components here. Within those elements, the things to play out would be most around the direct treatment and testing costs and the potential for higher acuity and how much care occurs in the back half. 
The other elements within the $1.80, I would say, are more steady throughout the course of the year. So that point being around care deferral in 2020 and the related revenue impacts for 2021, those should be relatively steady and I would say are running in line with the expectations that were set out for you back in December. So I don't think we've had a surprise on that element within our outlook. And I would say the kind of economic impacts, also pretty relatively steady over the course of the year in terms of the quarterly progression. So those are really the elements we continue to look for. 
You're right. Look, we saw good strength in a lot of the business, growth across the platform, really, we could point to every business. But it's a look-out to really understanding how those trends play in the second half of the year. Thank you."

And with all of these sort of new options or what appear to be new options available to physicians, how are you convincing docs that Optum is the best solution? 
And lastly, and I know I apologize for the last part here, but -- is there an argument we made that OptumCare and not Optum overall, but just the Optum Care segment would be more valuable to shareholders as a stand-alone company because of the physician independence issue that comes up?"

And before I -- I'm going to ask Dr. Decker to make a few comments in a minute or 2 but maybe just make a couple of introductory observations. 
So first off, I think you're really starting to see OptumHealth broadly. And within that business, in particular, Optum Care and, of course, home And community really starting to demonstrate their capacity for growth because of the scale of the footprint that they now establish across the country. And I think you're starting to see these businesses move into a kind of critical mass dynamic. That's reflected in its overall growth. It's also reflected in this very rapid expansion of OptumHealth revenue per consumer up over 40% this quarter. That's reflective of the quality of services which are being delivered and the perceived value that they obviously reflect. So we feel very good about that. 
Your question around capacity constraints is a really good question. We continue to extend rapidly the number of physicians and clinicians in our organization either directly or through affiliation. This year, we expect to add about 10,000. We're well over halfway through that journey, so going super well on that front. 
I would say one of the key elements is really making sure that those practices as rapidly as possible start to develop the skills to be able to manage capitated risk, which is really what then drives a tremendous amount of the distinctive behavior and value creation for patients and, of course, for the system. That process, I think, has been continually refined. As you would be well aware, in the marketplace, people have tried different models. They don't always work super well. I'll maybe ask Dr. Decker in a second to dive a little bit more detail into some of the work they're doing there to accelerate that dimension of capacity because it's not simply having the practices and the clinicians. It's having that way of working which really drives the change in what we're able to do. 
As far as your last question is concerned, I actually think that the Optum Care clinics within the broader Optum and UHG organization, that's where some of the magic really sits here in terms of being able to leverage many different aspects. And as you see these elements of OptumHealth and Optum Care, in particular, develop, you're also seeing [Audio Gap] and health, if you will, being provided by other businesses across the organization. Payment integrity, good example, beginning to be adopted by parts of Optum Care. 
So with all of that, I'd like Dr. Decker, maybe just to go a little deeper on how we move or how we help practices develop the capabilities which allow them to deliver the value we're now seeing."

To Andrew's comment, we are increasingly bringing our depth and breadth in value-based care delivery to new markets that have been historically fee-for-service.

But we are now bringing the expertise in markets like Texas and Southern California that have been delivering value-based and full risk capitated care for years. And so that really is a differentiator for us. 
And the other piece I'd build on is Andrew's comment around how we are creating a comprehensive set of offerings that address virtually every aspect of an individual's health care journey from a focus on primary care and keeping you healthy and well to post-acute care to end-of-life care and complex care in all environments, virtual, home and in the clinic.

So you're quite right that a lot of what we're -- we focus on is, well, first and foremost, to try and understand what is the very best care that an individual needs and to make sure that they get access to that. And one of the big things we've been doing this year is trying to get people, particularly seniors, back into the system, those who may be held back because of the pandemic. And as you heard earlier, we're glad to see some of that move in, albeit some way to go. 
Now within that, we also recognize there are a whole series of places, where, frankly, there are better, more effective ways to deliver care. I'm going to pick out one very simple example just to build on what you described. So if I think about some of the work that's going on at OptumRx and within our Optum infusion business, you can take drugs where perhaps $10,000, $15,000 per treatment for a hospital outpatient, exactly the same drug being delivered by Optum at-home infusion, $3,500. I mean, just that's the kind of impact that we can deliver through really thoughtful application of location of delivery and the like. And that's just one example. UHC are very much focused on this in much of their guidance, and of course, Optum is building a variety of different capabilities. 
Having said all of that, I think the reality is it's very early days, even for us in terms of change in behavior against the overall trend of the health care system. So I think that baseline in of 2019 probably is the right rational piece. Over time, I think these practices will start to bear down on the overall trend of cost. But of course, that's -- that will happen as we see those capabilities spread more broadly as we see them get more adoption and that starts to change the price point in the marketplace for some of these treatments or therapies, which are frankly overpriced. And what our clients are looking for us to do, both through UnitedHealthcare and doctors who find ways to get great care at lower cost, and that's exactly what we're focused on doing. So Ricky, thanks so much for the question."

But even having said that, the 4% residual growth is great. And we feel very good about the performance of the OptumRx business across its breadth of businesses. So within the kind of core PBM, but also across all of its various other pharmacy services businesses, which the company has been invested in over the last several years.

So yes, I think as Andrew said, so maybe I'll take script volume quickly and then just to finish that off and then maybe talk a little bit about selling season. So as Andrew said, really, if you look at whether ours is indicative of other things you've seen, what I'd say is specific to us, what you've seen over the last year is, yes, about half of that is the rebound from compression. And the rest of that is really a little bit of vaccine volume, and Andrew gave you the number there but that really hits volumes for us more than anything else because of the -- just the ratio of revenue to script there. And then in addition to that, there's a continued double-digit growth in the pharmacy services businesses. So that's making up the bulk of the additional growth that you're seeing year-over-year there. 
As far as the split of acute maintenance, et cetera. So I guess I would say we just had this discussion about what baseline is. I guess, again, we're kind of watching this in quarterly progressions. But I'd basically say that we're seeing second quarter look more like '19 than it certainly did from the -- looking like second quarter of 2020. And we basically don't see anything unique there as far as acute versus -- as far as acute ratio kind of back to what we saw prepandemic for this quarter. 
Maybe let me switch quickly to selling season. So we're still in the midst of it this year, and that's for all segments that's for employer. It's for health plan, public sector and coalition. And I'd say, generally, same activity, maybe a little different pacing of decision-making right now, but really in the midst of it. The biggest thing I would say about the selling season is clients are very interested in solutions to address high cost of specialty drugs and getting to medications and therapies that really help on the medical and the pharmacy side. So for us, we're very focused on those solutions, and we're finding that our site of care services for alternative sites and alternative therapies like biosimilars, together with some of our specialty programs that work through OptumHealth and OptumRx and straddle the medical and pharmacy benefit, are really resonating, together with our really intense clinical consulting that we're bringing to the market right now. So we're finding that resonating in the selling season, and we think we've got a lot of value out there. So hopefully, that answers your question."

And then as you might expect, that trends up progressively every quarter, every quarter, you'd see rising in that overall level utilization and the expectations as we head into the end of the year. 
Embedded in that is also a view in terms of what happens with intensity, acuity levels. One comment that -- a question that we've often received is what are we seeing currently in acuity levels to progress. And part of the impact as we progress in the second half is an expectation that you do see rising acuity levels. I'd tell you, we haven't observed that yet, but it's still probably a little bit early to say. When we -- among the things we look at, we look at new cancer diagnoses, new cardiac diagnoses. Those are still running below baseline levels that we'd expect. But they're -- a view to that could continue to progress as we get into the back half of the year. 
The other element in terms of just thinking about utilization and rising in the back of the year is -- and ultimately, this is one of the calls, what occurs with COVID testing and treatment costs. Clearly, there's been the evidence of the new variants and their impact in other countries and then also moving into the U.S. And even in our own data, we can see that but I would tell you still fairly limited in terms of impact. And as I sit here and look at a number of members of our members that we have in receiving treatment today in hospital beds today as you say here this morning, still well below the levels even we sit here in mid-July, what we were seeing in the April level. but that could be a trend back factor also in the second half of the year as we see that progression."

A few factors on that and how timing might impact, though. So maybe just to refresh a little bit on that. Tim did a nice job describing the impacts in terms of -- the revenue impacts from particularly our Medicare Advantage members being able to be seen by their physicians. We are encouraged by what's going on in our HouseCalls activity, very strong receptivity to those. BT just mentioned, encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of seniors and their receptivity to even going in and seeing their physicians. That's all super important. 
I don't know if timing is so important on that piece. It just needs to occur during the year in terms of when that activity occurs. So that would be more the more important factor as it relates to 2022. Does it occur in 2021? Do they get in? So that's an important factor. 
Other factors here, I would say. So there's care that didn't occur in 2020 and probably hasn't occurred in '21 yet that was deferred and needs to occur. So that's more about also an element of, does it not occur at all in this year; does it work its way into 2022 and the potential for and kind of the resident impact of whether or not there's an increase in acuity or that -- from those populations. 
That -- those are really kind of the main elements, I would say, in terms of what I would call timing-related. The other elements are more just -- would be around this concept around the occurrence of COVID-19 incidents, direct treatment and testing costs, how that progresses over the back half of the year, too. But those would be the elements that would be sensitive to timing factors."

As I've made super clear over the last couple of quarters, really elevating our consumer focus is a top priority for the whole company. And that really speaks to ensuring that we're delivering simpler, more intuitive experiences that we're thinking about the journey of the consumer and the patient in an end-to-end sense, that we're making it easier for them to make all of the various sequential decisions. And we also want to meet the consumer where they want to be met, whether that be outside of a facility in their home, online or in person. 
And we also -- we fully recognize how the premium that patients and consumers in particular put on being able to talk to the physicians they know rather than  just any physician. And so how we start to pool all of that together is essentially reflected in many of the different initiatives we have. 
Over the last few quarters, you've seen us build up things like Optum Virtual, Dr. Decker will talk to you in a second. But things like Optum Store just been rolled out under the OptumRx organization really starts to bring together a ton of access for consumers in terms of what they're able to do with us.

The product with respect to Virtual First, to answer your specific question, we plan on rolling that out in 8, 9 markets in UnitedHealthcare at the end of this year.

And you would have to expect that the answer is that some of it would have been unnecessary. I think at this distance, it's a little hard to really call that at this point. I mean there are some tantalizing signals in some of the trends. So if you look at emergency department use, for example, it looks pretty sustained down and doesn't seem to be coming back. 
And certainly, if you look at our Advisory Board surveys that we're running with many, many non-UHC providers and institutions across American Healthcare, people don't -- a lot of people don't expect that ED utilization to come back. Now that may be because they would be unnecessarily used. Maybe folks have realized that urgent care centers are a much better option. Maybe virtual is a much better option that they can get what they need at a much lower cost. 
So whether it's unnecessary, whether or not the pandemic has disturbed people's allegiance for certain types of sites of care and people are a little bit more open-minded about where to go, all of that, I think, is in play. I would say it's premature to call it. I think we're watching it really carefully. I could build those theories I just shared with you. I'm not going to tell you that those are [indiscernible].

As we discuss our enterprise today, I hope you sense its growing momentum as we advance on our path of improving the quality, cost and experience of health care for everyone we serve. Both Optum and UnitedHealth",617,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As we discuss our enterprise today, I hope you sense its growing momentum as we advance on our path of improving the quality, cost and experience of health care for everyone we serve. Both Optum and UnitedHealthcare grew and delivered on our long-standing strategy. And we've increased our outlook for the year to a range of $18.30 to $18.80 per share.
We continue to prioritize 3 key themes that we believe will underpin the next era of growth for our enterprise: first, unlock the collaborative opportunities within and between Optum and UnitedHealthcare; second, increasingly apply technology to improve patient care and experience and to help the system run better; and third, strengthen our consumer focus, capabilities and value.
During the quarter, we accelerated our efforts to develop and deploy new and innovative products, informed by the insights of both Optum and UnitedHealthcare in areas such as oncology care delivery, rare disease drug management, Optum Virtual, Optum Financial Services and many others. We're doubling down on efforts to both expand and link services where it creates value for consumers and patients to make their health care journey easier, simpler and more intuitive.
We constantly challenge ourselves to develop capabilities which lead to improved care, better value and a simpler system. Our sales to clients and partners across all parts of the health system demonstrate the strong relevance of our innovation. And the strengthening of our sales pipeline is a key opportunity as we emerge from the COVID market pause.
A good example of bringing our collective strengths together at scale is the Optum home and community care platform, through which we care for nearly 10 million people. This platform includes our well-known HouseCalls service, comprehensive post-acute care for smoother transitions to home and integrated primary and behavioral care for Medicare Advantage patients who prefer to receive their care at home. Home and community platform services can reduce post-acute medical care cost by 1/4, unnecessary readmissions by up to 1/5 and hospital admissions by up to 25%.
In Medicaid, we're addressing consumer needs by expanding our long-term collaboration with public housing authorities, working with government agencies and community-based organizations to identify and address specific health care issues for people who are hard to reach and support. In just the past 6 months, we've introduced new partnerships in over 20 communities to close gaps in care and address health equity challenges.
Using data and analytic capabilities, we're able to rapidly identify local health trends and gaps and then work with community partners to inform guidelines, training materials, processes and create better tools to advance health. We believe this will result in better health of community members and help to optimize limited state resources.
These and other targeted initiatives on the social determinants of health are essential elements and illustrative of our natural and long-standing ESG impact. Our recently published sustainability report captures the full range of efforts we've dedicated ourselves to in areas of crucial concern to our stakeholders, none more so than advancing health and health equity. This agenda is an essential part of our way of doing business.
I'd like to thank our 330,000 colleagues from across the company for the passion and diligence they show every day in helping to deliver improvements in serving our members, clients and patients. I have great confidence that we're emerging from the last 18 months of disruption with an unprecedented set of opportunities to help improve the health system for all of those we can serve.
And now I'll turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon, to provide more detail on the initiatives to drive performance across the organization."

In an enterprise with our breadth of market engagement, we have many ways to assess how we're doing. I'd like to share some of those metrics with you, picking up on Andrew's commentary on our 3 key strategic themes. 
First, collaboration. UnitedHealthcare's value proposition is rooted in lower costs, better outcomes and a better experience. Optum supports this value proposition for UnitedHealthcare and other health plans with ambulatory services, which patients and their doctors value.
In this quarter, we met the ambulatory surgery needs of over 250,000 patients, delivering exceptional care in convenient and affordable settings, with revenue growth approaching 20% over the nonpandemic-affected 2019 second quarter. These centers are meeting higher acuity and more complex needs, such as total joint replacement spine and cardiovascular procedures, which are performed at an increasing number of centers. 
Our ambulatory settings received a consumer NPS of 92. And we deliver better and more consistent quality outcomes at about half the cost of traditional settings.
Optum Care has over 1,600 clinics and is rapidly expanding virtual offerings to serve patients in settings where they feel the most comfortable and, importantly, with their own physician. Seniors served by Optum Care under our integrated care approach spend considerably more time with their primary care physicians than seniors in traditional Medicare and, as a result, spend 1/3 fewer days in a hospital.
Second is our strategy to increase the application of technology to improve patient care and help the system run better. We recently announced the partnership with Bassett Healthcare, another strong example of how OptumInsight is helping health systems to expand and scale essential capabilities, including revenue cycle management and digital modernization to improve health outcomes and patients' health care experiences. We expect to continue to add new partnerships like this. 
Also at OptumInsight, we've been tackling the most resource-intensive operations through the deployment of advanced technology and other approaches. For example, we have transformed what were once largely manual chart review processes into highly automated operations.
Third, we have been hard at work advancing our consumer capabilities. UnitedHealthcare has made significant advances in the management of complex conditions. We're focused on making sure that patients with the highest acute care needs are able to access the most appropriate site of care by assigning them advocates to help navigate the system. Nearly 1 million of these members are matched with a personal navigator to help them manage and improve their health. 
OptumRx continues to improve access and affordability of home delivery for patients, leading to significant improvements in continuity of care and having already reduced the cost to process and dispense prescriptions by nearly 20% in just the past 2 years. Also, along consumer cost savings lines, for those who prefer an in-store retail experience, we now offer tools to find the lowest-cost prescriptions near them regardless of the health benefits -- of their health benefits coverage status. These tools can save self-paying consumers up to 80% on their medications.
Consumer preference is also having an impact in behavioral health. Already this year, the OptumHealth behavioral platform has delivered over 500,000 virtual visits, an option we initiated in just the last year. Many consumers and clinicians prefer these virtual encounters since they offer enhanced accessibility, flexibility and simplicity. Care encounters delivered through our dedicated channel have a patient satisfaction of 98%.
These are just a few of the many initiatives we are executing on as we apply technology, data and analytics to make our strategic growth agenda come alive. We look forward to updating you on our progress over the quarters to come.
With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex."

Our first half performance supports the foundation for strong and expanding growth for the remainder of this year and beyond. Before I review business performance, I'll offer a brief perspective on the pandemic-driven trends we're observing.
The core takeaway is that our outlook for COVID-19 impact is consistent with our past commentary. The second quarter showed overall care activity continuing to trend toward baseline or normalized levels albeit with variation across lines of business. For example, in commercial markets, care activity was above baseline as members were willing and able to obtain needed care, some of which was deferred from prior periods. Our public sector markets continue to run below baseline even as we are actively encouraging people to get the care they need. We were gratified to see care activity for these populations begin to progress over the course of the quarter as vaccination rates advanced.
We continue to estimate approximately $1.80 per share of unfavorable COVID-19 impacts for full year 2021 and to expect the majority of these effects to occur in the second half.
Moving to overall business performance. OptumHealth's second quarter revenue and earnings increased 46% and 34%, respectively, year-over-year. Revenue per consumer grew by 43%, reflecting the impact of accountable arrangements and our expanding home and community health platform, combined with the growing complexity of the needs we're serving. Of the 20 million patients we serve through Optum Care, over 2 million are in fully accountable or capitated care arrangements, an increase of 17% from a year ago. And we expect this pacing to accelerate strongly in the years ahead.
OptumInsight's revenue grew 12% in the quarter and earnings grew 36%, with the revenue backlog increasing by $1.9 billion to $21.3 billion. Key growth drivers were managed services, the continued recovery of care activity to more normal levels and further implementations of technology-enabled services. In particular, we are seeing strong sales momentum in the services, software and analytics businesses, which serve care providers.
OptumRx revenue and earnings increased 5% and 19% year-over-year and script growth was 8%, with this comparison impacted by last year's pandemic-affected care patterns. Our expanding pharmacy care and specialty services continue to grow strongly, now comprising just under half of OptumRx revenues.
Turning to UnitedHealthcare. We are encouraged by the receptivity to our expanding set of responsive commercial benefits, centered around virtual-first, on-demand and physician-led offerings. Year-to-date, we have added about 150,000 members in such innovative commercial offerings even with the evolving and uneven labor market trends which impacted second quarter membership.
Medicare Advantage membership has grown by 675,000 year-to-date, tracking well to our full year outlook. Our HouseCalls clinicians have been able to provide their vital services to seniors, conducting over 1.1 million home visits in the first half, more than double the year ago level.
People served in managed Medicaid programs grew by nearly 920,000 over the year ago quarter, in part as state-based redetermination activities remained on hold. Our Medicaid offerings continue to deliver a positive consumer experience and demonstrable cost effectiveness for our state government partners. And we look for this momentum to build, heading into next year.
Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong with second quarter cash flows from operations at $5.5 billion or 1.3x net income. And we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 40%. And in early June, our Board of Directors increased the dividend by 16%.
As noted earlier, given the strength of our business performance, we've updated our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $18.30 to $18.80 per share, inclusive of the COVID-19 impact incorporated into our full year view. Within this, we expect the pacing through the second half to be fairly level.
Now I'll turn it back to Andrew."

Obviously, still too early to give you kind of real shape in -- for 2022. So you won't be surprised we won't go there.
And I would say the overwhelming story for this year is, of course, the dynamic of COVID in terms of the various puts and takes which are taking place under the surface. And as we've done for the last several quarters, we've tried to kind of dimension that within the $1.80. But as we've also said repeatedly, the bulk of that $1.80 sits in the rest of the year, the year to go between now and the end of 2021.
And so really, really pleased with the momentum and underlying performance of the company in the first 2 quarters of this year but also respectful of uncertainties that remain around the COVID puts and takes. And, of course -- and that all feeds into how we make the judgment on raising the earnings expectation for the rest of the year.
I think where I sit, I feel great about that underlying performance. So far, broadly speaking, the COVID dynamic has played the way we would have anticipated, more or less. But there's still a ways to go and there are uncertainties within that. 
Maybe, John, you might go a little further and take that $1.80 apart and maybe reflect a little bit on how you're seeing those different elements of the driver of that."

So within the $1.80, we still expect about 70% of that to occur within -- in the second half of the year. So the vast majority, a lot to be seen on how that $1.80 really plays out.
Keep in mind kind of the main elements that, that comprises. It's the direct treatment and testing costs that we would see, offset by elective care deferral that might continue to occur or not in the rest of the year. The potential for higher acuity for those that have missed or deferred care. And at least within 2021, the impact of the care deferrals that occurred last year.
So those are all super important components here. Within those elements, the things to play out would be most around the direct treatment and testing costs and the potential for higher acuity and how much care occurs in the back half.
The other elements within the $1.80, I would say, are more steady throughout the course of the year, so that point being around care deferral in 2020 and the related revenue impacts for 2021. Those should be relatively steady and I would say are running in line with the expectations that were set out for you back in December. So I don't think we've had a surprise on that element within our outlook. And I would say the kind of economic impacts, also pretty relatively steady over the course of the year in terms of the quarterly progression.
So those are really the elements we continue to look for. You're right. Look, we saw good strength in a lot of the business, growth across the platform. Really, we could point to every business. But it's that look-out to really understanding how those trends play in the second half of the year. Thank you."

And before I -- I'm going to ask Dr. Decker to make a few comments in a minute or 2 but maybe just make a couple of introductory observations.So first off, I think you're really starting to see OptumHealth broa",471,"So Josh, thanks so much for the questions. And before I -- I'm going to ask Dr. Decker to make a few comments in a minute or 2 but maybe just make a couple of introductory observations.
So first off, I think you're really starting to see OptumHealth broadly. And within that business, in particular, Optum Care and, of course, home and community really starting to demonstrate their capacity for growth because of the scale of the footprint that they now establish across the country. And I think you're starting to see these businesses move into a kind of critical mass dynamic. That's reflected in its overall growth.
It's also reflected in this very rapid expansion of OptumHealth revenue per consumer, up over 40% this quarter. That's reflective of the quality of services which are being delivered and the perceived value that they obviously reflect. So we feel very good about that.
Your question around capacity constraints is a really good question. we continue to extend rapidly the number of physicians and clinicians in our organization either directly or through affiliation. This year, we expect to add about 10,000. We're well over halfway through that journey, so going super well on that front.
I would say one of the key elements is really making sure that those practices, as rapidly as possible, start to develop the skills to be able to manage capitated risk, which is really what then drives a tremendous amount of the distinctive behavior and value creation for patients and, of course, for the system. That process, I think, has been continually refined.
As you would be well aware, in the marketplace, people have tried different models. They don't always work super well. I'll maybe ask Dr. Decker in a second to dive a little bit more detail into some of the work they're doing there to accelerate that dimension of capacity because it's not simply having the practices and the clinicians. It's having that way of working, which really drives the change in what we're able to do.
As far as your last question is concerned, I actually think that the Optum Care clinics within the broader Optum and UHG organization, that's where some of the magic really sits here in terms of being able to leverage many different aspects. And as you see these elements of OptumHealth and Optum Care, in particular, develop, you're also seeing significant amounts of support and health, if you will, being provided by other businesses across the organization. Payment integrity, a good example, beginning to be adopted by parts of Optum Care.
So with all of that, I'd like Dr. Decker, maybe just to go a little deeper on how we move -- or how we help practices develop the capabilities which allow them to deliver the value we're now seeing."

To Andrew's comment, we are increasingly bringing our depth and breadth in value-based care delivery to new markets that have been historically fee-for-service.

But we are now bringing the expertise in markets like Texas and Southern California that have been delivering value-based and full risk capitated care for years. And so that really is a differentiator for us.
And the other piece I'd build on is Andrew's comment around how we are creating a comprehensive set of offerings that address virtually every aspect of an individual's health care journey from a focus on primary care and keeping you healthy and well to post-acute care to end-of-life care and complex care in all environments, virtual, home and in the clinic.

So you're quite right that a lot of what we're -- we focus on is, well, first and foremost, to try and understand what is the very best care that an individual needs and to make sure that they get access to that. And one of the big things we've been doing this year is trying to get people, particularly seniors, back into the system, those who may be held back because of the pandemic. And as you heard earlier, we're glad to see some of that move in albeit some way to go.
Now within that, we also recognize there are a whole series of places where, frankly, there are better, more effective ways to deliver care. I'm going to pick out one very simple example just to build on what you described. So if I think about some of the work that's going on at OptumRx and within our Optum infusion business, you can take drugs where perhaps $10,000, $15,000 per treatment for a hospital outpatient, exactly the same drug being delivered by Optum at-home infusion, $3,500.
I mean just -- that kind of -- that's the kind of impact that we can deliver through really thoughtful application of location of delivery and the like. And that's just one example. UHC are very much focused on this in much of their guidance. And of course, Optum is building a variety of different capabilities.
Having said all of that, I think the reality is it's very early days even for us in terms of change in behavior against the overall trend of the health care system. So I think that baseline of 2019 probably is the right rational piece. Over time, I think these practices will start to bear down on the overall trend of cost. But of course, that's -- that will happen as we see those capabilities spread more broadly, as we see them get more adoption and they start to change the price point in the marketplace for some of these treatments or therapies, which are frankly overpriced. And what our clients are looking for us to do, both through UnitedHealthcare and Optum, find ways to get great care at lower cost. And that's exactly what we're focused on doing. So Ricky, thanks so much for the question."

So as Andrew said, really, if you look at whether ours is indicative of other things you've seen, what I'd say is specific to us, what you've seen over the last year is yes, about half of that is the rebound from compression. And the rest of that is really a little bit of vaccine volume, and Andrew gave you the number there. But that really hits volumes for us more than anything else because of the -- just the ratio of revenue to script there. 
And then in addition to that, there's a continued double-digit growth in the pharmacy services businesses. So that's making up the bulk of the additional growth that you're seeing year-over-year there.
As far as the split of acute maintenance, et cetera, so I guess I would say we just had this discussion about what baseline is. I guess, again, we're kind of watching this in quarterly progressions. But I'd basically say that we're seeing second quarter look more like '19 than it certainly did from the -- looking like second quarter of 2020. And we basically don't see anything unique there as far as acute versus -- as far as acute ratio, kind of back to what we saw prepandemic for this quarter.
Maybe let me switch quickly to selling season. So we're still in the midst of it this year. And that's for all segments. That's for employer. It's for health plan, public sector and coalition. And I'd say, generally, same activity. Maybe a little different pacing of decision-making right now but really in the midst of it.
The biggest thing I would say about the selling season is clients are very interested in solutions to address high cost of specialty drugs and getting to medications and therapies that really help on the medical and the pharmacy side. So for us, we're very focused on those solutions. And we're finding that our site of care services for alternative sites and alternative therapies like biosimilars, together with some of our specialty programs that work through OptumHealth and OptumRx and straddle the medical and pharmacy benefit, are really resonating, together with our really intense clinical client consulting that we're bringing to the market right now. So we're finding that resonating in the selling season. And we think we've got a lot of value out there. So hopefully, that answers your question."

The impact they have in terms of helping improve adherence for highly complex patients, particularly those patients who are served through our Medicaid books of business, is super important.

But it's really important to have a real clear understanding of really how they should be used, what their value is in utilization. And Dr. Migliori already said really well, really understanding where CMS get recognized in that the MA population likely to be a very significant fraction of utilizers. We need to understand where all of that sits.
So I think this is potentially good news. But it's still early days and we have a lot more to learn before we can be more definitive than that. So can't be too much more helpful at this point, I'm afraid, Justin. But thank you so much for the question."

So then you blend a little bit, just a little bit below overall, right, when you blend the books and you weight our books across in terms of what we are seeing in the second quarter. And then as you might expect, that trends up progressively every quarter. Every quarter, you'd see rising in that overall level of utilization and the expectations as we head into the end of the year.
Embedded in that is also a view in terms of what happens with intensity, acuity levels. One comment that -- a question that we've often received is what are we seeing currently in acuity levels to progress. And part of the impact as we progress in the second half is an expectation that you do see rising acuity levels.
I'd tell you, we haven't observed that yet. But it's still probably a little bit early to say. When we -- among the things we look at, we look at new cancer diagnoses, new cardiac diagnoses. Those are still running below baseline levels that we'd expect. But they're -- a view to that could continue to progress as we get into the back half of the year.
The other element in terms of just thinking about utilization and rising in the back of the year is -- and then ultimately, this is one of the -- what occurs with COVID testing and treatment costs. Clearly, there's been the evidence of the new variants and their impact in other countries and then also moving into the U.S.
And even in our own data, we can see that but I would tell you still fairly limited in terms of impact. And as I sit here and look at the number of members -- of our members that we have in -- receiving treatment today in hospital beds today as we sit here this morning, still well below the levels even we sit here in mid-July, what we were seeing in the April levels. But that could be a trend back factor also in the second half of the year as we see that progression."

A few factors on that and how timing might impact, those. So maybe just to refresh a little bit on that. Tim did a nice job describing the impacts in terms of -- the revenue impacts from particularly our Medicare Advantage members being able to be seen by their physicians. We are encouraged by what's going on in our HouseCalls activity, very strong receptivity to those. BT just mentioned, encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of seniors and their receptivity to even going in and seeing their physicians. That's all super important.
I don't know if timing is so important on that piece. It just needs to occur during the year in terms of when that activity occurs. So that would be more -- the more important factor as it relates to 2022. Does it occur in 2021? Do they get in? So that's an important factor.
Other factors here, I would say. So there's care that didn't occur in 2020 and probably hasn't occurred in '21 yet that was deferred and needs to occur. So that's more about also an element of, does it not occur at all in this year, does it work its way into 2022 and the potential for that and kind of the resident impact of whether or not there's an increase in acuity or -- from those populations.
That -- those are really kind of the main elements, I would say, in terms of what I would call timing-related. The other elements are more just -- would be around this concept around the occurrence of COVID-19 incidents, direct treatment and testing costs, how that progresses over the back half of the year, too. But those would be the elements that would be sensitive to timing factors."

I'm going to ask Dirk in a second to make a couple of comments around the overall shift towards digital-first, virtual-first and may also ask Dr. Decker to refer to some -- further what's going on within OptumHealth, which is important around Optum Virtual. 
As I've made super clear over the last couple of quarters, really elevating our consumer focus is a top priority for the whole company. And that really speaks to ensuring that we're delivering simpler, more intuitive experiences, that we're thinking about the journey of the consumer and the patient in an end-to-end sense, that we're making it easier for them to make all of the various sequential decisions.
And we also want to meet the consumer where they want to be met, whether that be outside of a facility, in their home, online or in person. And we also -- we fully recognize how the premium that patients and consumers in particular put on being able to talk to the physicians they know rather than just any physician.
And so how we start to pool all of that together is essentially reflected in many of the different initiatives we have. Over the last few quarters, you've seen us build up things like Optum Virtual. Dr. Decker will talk to you in a second. But things like Optum Store, just been rolled out under the OptumRx organization, really start to bring together a ton of access for consumers in terms of what they're able to do with us.

The product with respect to virtual-first, to answer your specific question, we plan on rolling that out in 8, 9 markets in UnitedHealthcare at the end of this year. What it will basically be is think of it as sort of a virtual PCP with an Optum Care dock being the quarterback with UnitedHealthcare navigate network backing it up for the physical access.

Matt, thanks so much for the question. It's a really -- it's a great question. And you would have to expect that the answer is that some of it would have been unnecessary.
I think at this distance, it's a little hard to really call that at this point. I mean there are some tantalizing signals in some of the trends. So if you look at emergency department use, for example, it looks pretty sustained down and doesn't seem to be coming back. And certainly, if you look at our Advisory Board surveys that we're running with many, many non-UHC providers and institutions across American Healthcare, people don't -- a lot of people don't expect that ED utilization to come back.
Now that may be because they would be unnecessarily used. Maybe folks have realized that urgent care centers are a much better option. Maybe virtual is a much better option that they can get what they need at a much lower cost. So whether it's unnecessary, whether or not the pandemic has disturbed people's allegiance for certain types of sites of care and people are a little bit more open-minded about where to go, all of that, I think, is in play.
I would say it's premature to call it. I think we're watching it really carefully. I could build those theories I just shared with you. I'm not going to tell you that those are proven. I think there is tantalizing signals in the data. It's going to take another 6, 12 months before you can really settle out how this all plays.

John Rex and I will be subbing for Andrew this morning, and we have our management team with us as usual to help with your questions. 
We're here today to discuss third quarter results and the expanding opportunities we see looking ahead. As a result of the progress at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we have increased our 2021 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $18.65 to $18.90 per share. We continue to prioritize 3 themes Andrew has discussed before which are -- before which are foundational to the growth of our enterprise. First, unlocking the collaborative potential within Optum and UnitedHealthcare for the benefit of all; second, further developing our technology and data science platform to aid patient care and experience and to help the system run better; third, strengthening our consumer experience, capabilities and value. 
I'll briefly highlight a couple of items for you. You likely have seen the CMS Medicare Advantage Star -- Medicare Advantage Star Quality rating showing 95% of our UnitedHealthcare members will be in 4-star-rated plans or better for 2023, up from 78% for 2022 and a new high for our company. Within Optum Care, on behalf of the many payers we serve, 99% of Medicare Advantage patients will be in 4-star plans or better for 2023. A second important highlight in the quarter, we were encouraged by the ongoing strength in our employer and individual business, which has now grown by over 330,000 people this year with revenue up 7% year-over-year. We continue to see active interest in our product innovations, such as our All Savers level-funded offering and are encouraged by our competitiveness in the market and momentum heading into '22. We also elevated consumer connectivity by incorporating fitness offerings from industry-leading partners. 
OptumHealth continues to build momentum as well. Entering the open enrollment period for Medicare Advantage, we have more than 2.2 million people served under physician-led, fully accountable arrangements and expect '22 to be another year of record expansion in this key part of our portfolio. Our broad home-based clinical care initiatives at Optum and UnitedHealthcare are central to improving near and longer-term health outcomes for people with medical, behavioral and social needs. These efforts include Optum at Home, which delivers high-quality primary care services in the convenience of the home setting and support recovery after hospitalizations. Seniors served by our home and community offering experienced a 14% lower rate of hospital admissions and about a 4% higher rate of physician encounters. 
In addition to caring for people in their homes, we continue to expand capabilities in other optimal sites of care, including via digital means. Optum is distinctively enabling virtual care for patients using their own primary care physicians and with behavioral clinicians. For example, a physician engaging in a virtual visit with a patient can easily bring in a behavioral health professional for a real-time consultation. UnitedHealthcare is using Optum's virtual capabilities to introduce a new suite of digital-first products, offering a near seamless experience between virtual and traditional primary specialty and urgent care. 
We expect during 2022 and beyond to further build on these opportunities to connect and integrate multiple channels of care, simplify the experience for patients and providers and deliver quality care that is affordable and in the optimal setting. Let me now go a little deeper in a few areas to give you an assessment of how we're doing on the themes I mentioned at the outset. OptumInsight continues to drive better clinical and operational performance at the health system level. Last week, we reached a new multiyear partnership with a leading and innovative health system, SSM Health, whose 40,000 employees, 33 hospitals and post-acute facilities and 300 physician clinics serve the people of Missouri, Oklahoma, Wisconsin and Illinois. OptumInsight brings real value in helping systems strengthen and scale essential functions, such as care coordination, revenue cycle management and digital modernization, all to improve health outcomes and patient care experiences. 
These and similar efforts to simplify processes, reduce administrative burdens and help our partners focus -- help our partners focus more attention on their care -- on their core missions of patient care. OptumRx continues to deliver to health system partners, such as its new multiyear agreement with Point 32 Health, which serves more than 2 million people in New England through its founding organizations, Harbor Pilgrim Healthcare and [ TugsHealthPlan ]. OptumRx will provide integrated pharmacy benefit and specialty offerings that will enhance services and deliver improved affordability for their plan members. OptumRx is having a substantial impact through its community behavioral health pharmacies, which now serve nearly 700,000 people with mental health, addiction and other conditions through more than 600 dispensaries across 47 states. The pharmacies deliver a high-touch approach to care that contributes to a more than 90% medication adherence rate and lowers emergency room visits and hospitalizations by 18% and 40%, respectively, driving better outcomes and a lower total cost of care. 
Within our UnitedHealthcare government businesses, we have increased processing efficiency by 25% over the last year by using Optum technology to improve auto adjudication rates and intelligent work distribution to appropriately skilled channels. We have many such initiatives underway across the enterprise in affordability, provider experience and product development as we employ advanced technology and data analytics to drive even greater value for the people we serve and the health system. 
Before turning over the call to John, a quick word on our pending combination with Change Healthcare. We continue to work diligently to satisfy regulatory requests and now believe, based on our experience so far, the transaction should close in the first part of 2022. 
We are highly energized about the positive impact we can have working together with the exceptional change team, a team aligned with our mission and values and focused on delivering substantial benefits for the health care system. These benefits will include helping clinicians by simplifying access to real-time evidence-based guidance as they are serving patients, closing gaps in care more rapidly to improve health outcomes and lower cost, reducing unnecessary complexity by removing administrative waste and obstruction to make the care process simpler, more cost effective and more transparent. And bringing greater convenience and simplicity to managing consumer health finances, while ensuring care providers get paid more quickly and accurately. Optum and Change Healthcare's capabilities fundamentally are complementary and distinct. Because both companies already successfully serve health plans and state governments, care providers and consumers in a highly competitive market, we believe this combination will make the health care system work better for everyone and bring exceptional value to those we serve. With that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, John Rex."

This morning, we reported third quarter and year-to-date revenues of $72 million and $214 million, respectively, growth of 11% and 12% over last year. This growth was led by OptumHealth, primarily our care businesses. In the third quart",760,"Thank you, Dirk. 
This morning, we reported third quarter and year-to-date revenues of $72 million and $214 million, respectively, growth of 11% and 12% over last year. This growth was led by OptumHealth, primarily our care businesses. In the third quarter, the Optum platform comprised 54% of enterprise operating earnings and continues to show strong growth momentum. Our performance reflects the diverse and complementary strengths of our business, setting the stage for growth in the years ahead. Our updated full year '21 outlook includes unfavorable COVID impacts consistent with the expectations we have discussed throughout the year. During the third quarter, while direct COVID care and testing costs ran above the expectations we had nearly a year ago,  we again saw elective care offsetting the impacts of higher case rates, much like previous cycles in the pandemic. This quarter, there were approximately 60,000 COVID hospitalizations meaningfully above the second quarter, with the month of August peaking at nearly 30,000 and then declining in September. 
Looking at specific business performance. OptumHealth's third quarter revenue and earnings increased 32% and 37%, respectively, year-over-year. Revenue per consumer grew by 30%. This reflects the increasing impact and number of value-based relationships within OptumCare. The expansion of our in-home and community health platform as well as the growing acuity of the needs we can serve. 
OptumInsight's revenue grew 13% in the quarter, and earnings grew 15% as the revenue backlog increased by 12% to $22.3 billion. We see overall business development sourcing and activity levels increasing, particularly with care provider customers, and for our software and analytics offerings. OptumRx revenue and scripts grew 6% year-over-year and earnings 5%. OptumRx has seen both strong customer retention levels and sales success for the largely completed '22 selling season and early activity for '23. 
Turning to UnitedHealthcare. The third quarter showed increasing member growth in our commercial offerings, particularly in employer-sponsored benefits. Increased employment is a broad underlying contributor, but we are particularly encouraged by the growth we are achieving in our affordable consumer-centric offerings. Medicare Advantage membership has grown 745,000 this year. Inclusive of plans which serve dual special needs members, we expect to add a total of over 900,000 Medicare Advantage members. The number of people served through managed Medicaid grew by more than 1 million members over last year as we began to serve people in new regions such as North Carolina, Kentucky and Indiana, and as state-based redetermination activities remained paused. We were honored to begin serving people in the Missouri Medicaid expansion this month. Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong with third quarter cash flows from operations at $7.6 billion or 1.8x net income, and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 39%. As noted earlier, given the strength of our business performance,  this morning, we updated our 2021 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $18.65 to $18.90 per share. 
Now with the close of the third quarter, your attention understandably turns to next year. As is our custom, we will offer a few early observations here while reserving the majority of this conversation for our November 30 investor conference, which we hope will be held in person in New York. 
Our businesses are both growing and operating well with strong momentum heading into next year. While the pandemic-related impacts remain difficult to predict, given the current trends, we would expect a lower unfavorable COVID impact than experienced in '21. Still, as the dramatic variation over the last 20 months has demonstrated to all, prudent management suggests we should offer an outlook respectful of the fact that the current situation is without precedent. 
Taking all elements together at this distance, we see current analyst consensus as reasonably beginning to calibrate a '22 outlook. Envisioning that consensus as being toward the upper end of our initial adjusted earnings per share outlook range with the range being similar to that offered initially for '21.  The still untapped collaborative potential between UnitedHealthcare and Optum to benefit individuals in the system, the power of applied technology to advance care and service, improved opportunities in consumer health and experience and the passion of our people, these and so many other elements lead us to believe our performance expectations for the years ahead remain fully supportive of our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth outlook. We look forward to going into more detail on both our view of '22 and the many years of growth beyond at our investor conference. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.

And we're encouraged not only by what we have done by what's -- but also by what's on the horizon. Historically, you've looked at our combinations largely in a traditional Medicare Advantage space, and you're seeing us expand in the complex populations and duals, and  we're also really encouraged with what we're doing in the commercial marketplace as well. We've got some new offerings coming in that space. 
So I would say the key takeaway here is breadth and impact. We continue to scale and expand in that space. And it's important. We really see this value-based aligned care as a way to drive good value for those that we support and serve."

Thanks for the question. And as Dirk mentioned, we focus relentlessly on the quadruple aim, including lowering total cost of care, providing better outcomes and outstanding patient experiences, and we are relentless in monitoring specific data points that help deliver that -- those outcomes.

So we'll continue to drive that value proposition. 
And as I touched on in the previous question that I'll go a little deeper as you think about us with our home and community assets increasingly meeting people in their terms, in their homes to deliver components of of value-based and primary care, preventive care and wellness care and identify early conditions that otherwise might have led to an ER visit or hospitalization. 
You'll also see us continuing to bring on board very innovative behavioral health care delivery solutions that are integrated with the primary care providers that, again, identify and treat mental health and substance use disorders by identifying them early and treating them in lower acuity settings when that's appropriate.

So yes, a few perspectives on that as we think about utilization trends in the quarter. And I gave some broad indication just in terms of where we were with COVID inpatient stays and such for our members. Maybe to give a little kind of further commentary. So as we sit here today, about 5,000 of our members are in an inpatient setting for a COVID-related condition right now. And I'd say versus the peak that we experienced during the quarter, that's probably just a little more than 50% of the peak in that zone, probably a little of that we experienced over the course of the period. 
That fell across categories, probably categories much like you would have observed in the reports coming out nationally in terms of the types of individuals who are in these settings, an average age that was considerably younger than we saw in prior to that -- in prior periods for COVID. So similar to what we have noticed across the board. In terms of broad utilization trends, similar to what we would have described in 2Q or what we did describe where  we continue to see commercial members be more active in elective care and public sector or government program members a little bit less active. And so kind of similar, just trending at different levels, given the prevalence of COVID. It's been interesting over the course of the 20 months, there has been a consistent, fairly rapid reaction when COVID cases go up nationally in terms of the preference of patients to whether or not to seek elective care, that again happened this quarter, where it comes in fairly quickly in terms of the hesitation in the system to access.

One is in group growth was net positive for the quarter. Our wins versus losses was also positive for the third consecutive quarter, and obviously, the preferred 1 acquisition contributed to our overall growth. We're expecting continued commercial growth in 2022 across both our fully insured and self-funded segments. We're confident in the value story. It is resonating in the market. We're getting good traction with our broad product portfolio. And so products like Bind and Care Cash and Harmony and Motion and also areas are all contributing to that growth. 1/1/22 for Middle Market is obviously a little early to predict exactly how all those products will perform in the market, but we're very confident in our ability to continue to perform well in the commercial market for 2022."

And as you point out, the U.S. health care market is very tight right now. For us, in our care delivery assets, we are seeing good, both the retention, engagement and recruitment of physicians and care providers. 
A couple of examples I'll give you. We mentioned at the start of the year our intent to bring onboard 10,000 additional physicians to our ranks, and we've already brought on board about 8,000 year-to-date. So just as a high-level indicator, why -- what do we attribute this to? And I would say in partnership with Patricia Lewis and our human capital team, we're relentlessly focused on supporting our frontline care provider teams throughout the pandemic and they know this and have been deeply appreciative of it. And we work very hard, and this precedes the pandemic but has yielded dividends during the pandemic to support them in an environment that decreases clerical burden and allows them to focus on the work they love, which is actually taking care of patients, which is what we all want. 
So overall, we're managing through this. I won't kid you, it's tight, and we're keeping a close eye on it throughout all of our operations in our 43 states where we provide care. Thank you."

It's just a question when it comes in and year and how the how the benefits play. There's just timing impacts in terms of that when it would actually close during the year. But not incorporated in that outlook. 
As it relates to kind of the $1.80 that we articulated last year. Yes, we broke out a number of different components that were important in that element. And frankly, my hope would be we're not talking about a COVID number by the time we get into '22, that we move beyond that and we can move beyond to business as normal as we can while being always ready and to address the environment that's at hand.

Obviously, with the spike that we saw in September, there's a little bit of that, that we would expect to flow through in the fourth quarter, but that's fully accounted for in our outlook.

And I guess I'd call out a few things when I think about '22. First of all, we've made those investments. And so we're seeing that. We talked about Genoa and our community pharmacies and Dirk talked about this morning and how they're growing, not just in expanded sites, but our existing sites are continuing to show really strong growth as they expand services to existing members and expand in different types of health centers.

Yes, we're hearing that there's -- obviously, there's staffing shortages, obviously, many of the hospitals and other providers have to pay more for their input, and that's going to be reflected in the economics as we go forward. And of course, all that is reflected in how we price going forward. 
So yes, that occurs. 
Thank you for the question. With that, what I would like to close with is as follows: thanks, everybody, for your time and your questions today. We hope you're taking away the impression of a company that's confident in its opportunities and ability to grow. And we're deeply aware of where and how we need to improve, and we're fully committed to our mission of helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. We look forward to sharing with you more at our November 30 investor conference, hopefully, in person in New York. Thanks for your time today."

All went very well, and we expect him fully back in just a few days. I'm quite confident he is listening now, so I hope you're doing well, Boss.  
John Rex and I will be subbing for Andrew this morning, and we have our management team with us as usual to help with your questions.  
We're here today to discuss third quarter results and the expanding opportunities we see looking ahead. As a result of the progress at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we have increased our 2021 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $18.65 to $18.90 per share. We continue to prioritize 3 themes Andrew has discussed before which our -- before which are foundational to the growth of our enterprise. First, unlocking the collaborative potential within Optum and UnitedHealthcare for the benefit of all; second, further developing our technology and data science platform to aid patient care and experience and to help the system run better; third, strengthening our consumer experience, capabilities and value. I'll briefly highlight a couple of items for you. 
You will likely have seen the CMS Medicare Advantage Star -- Medicare Advantage Star Quality rating showing 95% of our UnitedHealthcare members will be in 4-star-rated plans or better for 2023, up from 78% for 2022 and a new high for our company. Within Optum Care, on behalf of the many payers we serve, 99% of Medicare Advantage patients will be in 4-star plans or better for 2023. A second important highlight in the quarter. We were encouraged by the ongoing strength in our employer and individual business, which has now grown by over 330,000 people this year with revenue up 7% year-over-year. We continue to see active interest in our product innovations, such as our All Savers level-funded offering and are encouraged by our competitiveness in the market and momentum heading into '22. We also elevated consumer connectivity by incorporating fitness offerings from industry-leading partners.  
OptumHealth continues to build momentum as well. Entering the open enrollment period for Medicare Advantage, we have more than 2.2 million people served under physician-led, fully accountable arrangements and expect '22 to be another year of record expansion in this key part of our portfolio. Our broad home-based clinical care initiatives at Optum and UnitedHealthcare are central to improving near and longer-term health outcomes for people with medical, behavioral and social needs. These efforts include Optum at Home, which delivers high-quality primary care services in the convenience of the home setting and support recovery after hospitalizations. Seniors served by our home and community offering experienced a 14% lower rate of hospital admissions and about a 4% higher rate of physician encounters.  
In addition to caring for people in their homes, we continue to expand capabilities in other optimal sites of care, including via digital means. Optum is distinctively enabling virtual care for patients using their own primary care physicians and with behavioral clinicians. For example, a physician engaging in a virtual visit with a patient can easily bring in a behavioral health professional for a real-time consultation. UnitedHealthcare is using Optum's virtual capabilities to introduce a new suite of digital-first products, offering a near seamless experience between virtual and traditional primary, specialty and urgent care.  
We expect during 2022 and beyond to further build on these opportunities to connect and integrate multiple channels of care, simplify the experience for patients and providers and deliver quality care that is affordable and in the optimal setting. Let me now go a little deeper in a few areas to give you an assessment of how we're doing on the themes I mentioned at the outset. OptumInsight continues to drive better clinical and operational performance at the health system level. Last week, we reached a new multiyear partnership with a leading and innovative health system, SSM Health, whose 40,000 employees, 33 hospitals and post-acute facilities and 300 physician clinics serve the people of Missouri, Oklahoma, Wisconsin and Illinois. OptumInsight brings real value in helping systems strengthen and scale essential functions, such as care coordination, revenue cycle management and digital modernization, all to improve health outcomes and patient's care experiences.  
These and similar efforts to simplify processes, reduce administrative burdens and help our partners focus -- help our partners focus more attention on their care -- on their core missions of patient care. OptumRx continues to deliver to health system partners, such as its new multiyear agreement with Point32Health, which serves more than 2 million people in New England through its founding organizations, Harbor Pilgrim Health Care and Tufts Health Plan. OptumRx will provide integrated pharmacy benefit and specialty offerings that will enhance services and deliver improved affordability for their plan members. OptumRx is having a substantial impact through its community behavioral health pharmacies, which now serve nearly 700,000 people with mental health, addiction and other conditions through more than 600 dispensaries across 47 states. The pharmacies deliver a high-touch approach to care that contributes to a more than 90% medication adherence rate and lowers emergency room visits and hospitalizations by 18% and 40%, respectively, driving better outcomes and a lower total cost of care.  
Within our UnitedHealthcare government businesses, we have increased processing efficiency by 25% over the last year by using Optum technology to improve auto adjudication rates and intelligent work distribution to appropriately skilled channels. We have many such initiatives underway across the enterprise in affordability, provider experience and product development as we employ advanced technology and data analytics to drive even greater value for the people we serve and the health system.  
Before turning over the call to John, a quick word on our pending combination with Change Healthcare. We continue to work diligently to satisfy regulatory requests and now believe, based on our experience so far, the transaction should close in the first part of 2022.  
We are highly energized about the positive impact we can have working together with the exceptional change team, a team aligned with our mission and values and focused on delivering substantial benefits for the health care system. These benefits will include helping clinicians by simplifying access to real-time evidence-based guidance as they are serving patients, closing gaps in care more rapidly to improve health outcomes and lower cost, reducing unnecessary complexity by removing administrative waste and obstruction to make the care process simpler, more cost effective and more transparent. And bringing greater convenience and simplicity to managing consumer health finances, while ensuring care providers get paid more quickly and accurately. Optum and Change Healthcare's capabilities fundamentally are complementary and distinct because both companies already successfully serve health plans and state governments, care providers and consumers in a highly competitive market. We believe this combination will make the health care system work better for everyone and bring exceptional value to those we serve. With that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, John Rex."
104673,1682559831,2406328,"UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 14, 2021",2021-10-14,"Earnings Calls","UnitedHealth Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dirk. This morning, we reported third quarter and year-to-date revenues of $72 million and $214 million, respectively, growth of 11% and 12% over last year. This growth was led by OptumHealth, primarily our care businesses. In the third quart",760,"Thank you, Dirk. 
This morning, we reported third quarter and year-to-date revenues of $72 million and $214 million, respectively, growth of 11% and 12% over last year. This growth was led by OptumHealth, primarily our care businesses. In the third quarter, the Optum platform comprised 54% of enterprise operating earnings and continues to show strong growth momentum. Our performance reflects the diverse and complementary strengths of our business, setting the stage for growth in the years ahead. Our updated full year '21 outlook includes unfavorable COVID impacts, consistent with the expectations we have discussed throughout the year. 
During the third quarter, while direct COVID care and testing costs ran above the expectations we had nearly a year ago, we again saw elective care offsetting the impacts of higher case rates, much like previous cycles in the pandemic. This quarter, there were approximately 60,000 COVID hospitalizations meaningfully above the second quarter, with the month of August peaking at nearly 30,000 and then declining in September. 
Looking at specific business performance. OptumHealth's third quarter revenue and earnings increased 32% and 37%, respectively, year-over-year. Revenue per consumer grew by 30%. This reflects the increasing impact and number of value-based relationships within OptumCare. The expansion of our in-home and community health platform as well as the growing acuity of the needs we can serve. 
OptumInsight's revenue grew 13% in the quarter, and earnings grew 15% as the revenue backlog increased by 12% to $22.3 billion. We see overall business development sourcing and activity levels increasing, particularly with care provider customers, and for our software and analytics offerings. OptumRx revenue and scripts grew 6% year-over-year and earnings, 5%. OptumRx has seen both strong customer retention levels and sales success for the largely completed '22 selling season and early activity for '23. 
Turning to UnitedHealthcare. The third quarter showed increasing member growth in our commercial offerings, particularly in employer-sponsored benefits. Increased employment is a broad underlying contributor, but we are particularly encouraged by the growth we are achieving in our affordable consumer-centric offerings. Medicare Advantage membership has grown 745,000 this year, inclusive of plans which serve dual special needs members. We expect to add a total of over 900,000 Medicare Advantage members. 
The number of people served through managed Medicaid grew by more than 1 million members over last year as we began to serve people in new regions such as North Carolina, Kentucky and Indiana, and as state-based redetermination activities remained paused. We were honored to begin serving people in the Missouri Medicaid expansion this month. Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong with third quarter cash flows from operations at $7.6 billion or 1.8x net income, and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 39%. As noted earlier, given the strength of our business performance,  this morning, we updated our 2021 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $18.65 to $18.90 per share. 
Now with the close of the third quarter, your attention understandably turns to next year. As is our custom, we will offer a few early observations here while reserving the majority of this conversation for our November 30 investor conference, which we hope will be held in person in New York. 
Our businesses are both growing and operating well with strong momentum heading into next year. While the pandemic-related impacts remain difficult to predict, given the current trends, we would expect a lower unfavorable COVID impact than experienced in '21. Still, as the dramatic variation over the last 20 months has demonstrated to all, prudent management suggests we should offer an outlook respectful of the fact that the current situation is without precedent. 
Taking all elements together at this distance, we see current analyst consensus as reasonably beginning to calibrate a '22 outlook. Envisioning that consensus as being toward the upper end of our initial adjusted earnings per share outlook range, with the range being similar to that offered initially for '21.  The still untapped collaborative potential between UnitedHealthcare and Optum to benefit individuals in the system, the power of applied technology to advance care and service, improved opportunity in consumer health and experience and the passion of our people. These and so many other elements lead us to believe our performance expectations for the years ahead remain fully supportive of our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth outlook. 
We look forward to going into more detail on both our view of '22 and the many years of growth beyond at our investor conference. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please."

And we're encouraged not only by what we have done by what's -- but also by what's on the horizon. Historically, you've looked at our combinations largely in a traditional Medicare Advantage space, and you're seeing us expand in the complex populations and duals. And we're also really encouraged with what we're doing in the commercial marketplace as well. We've got some new offerings coming in that space. 
So I would say the key takeaway here is breadth and impact. We continue to scale and expand in that space. And it's important. We really see this value-based aligned care as a way to drive good value for those that we support and serve."

Thanks for the question. And as Dirk mentioned, we focus relentlessly on the quadruple aim, including lowering total cost of care, providing better outcomes and outstanding patient experiences, and we are relentless in monitoring specific data points that help deliver that -- those outcomes. Specifically, what we see is the members that are in fully capitated arrangements overall have about a 30% lower hospitalization rate and about 40% lower skilled nursing facility occupation rate than their counterparts and fee-for-service Medicare, as an example. So we'll continue to drive that value proposition. 
And as I touched on the previous question that I'll go a little deeper. As you think about us with our home and community assets increasingly meeting people in their terms, in their homes to deliver components of value-based and primary care, preventive care and wellness care, and identify early conditions that otherwise might have led to an ER visit or hospitalization. 
You'll also see us continuing to bring on board very innovative behavioral health care delivery solutions that are integrated with the primary care providers that, again, identify and treat mental health and substance use disorders by identifying them early and treating them in lower acuity settings, when that's appropriate. So those are just a couple of examples of how we're creating value for those that we serve. Thank you."

So yes, a few perspectives on that as we think about utilization trends in the quarter. And I gave some broad indication just in terms of where we were with COVID inpatient stays and such for our members. Maybe to give a little kind of further commentary. So as we sit here today, about 5,000 of our members are in an inpatient setting for a COVID-related condition right now. And I'd say versus the peak that we experienced during the quarter, that's probably just a little more than 50% of the peak in that zone, probably a little of that we experienced over the course of the period. 
That fell across categories, probably categories much like you would have observed in the reports coming out nationally, in terms of the types of individuals who are in these settings. An average age that was considerably younger than we saw in prior to that -- in prior periods for COVID. So similar to what we have noticed across the board. In terms of broad utilization trends, similar to what we would have described in 2Q or what we did describe where  we continue to see commercial members be more active in elective care and public sector or government program members, a little bit less active. And so kind of similar, just trending at different levels, given the prevalence of COVID. It's been interesting over the course of the 20 months. There has been a consistent, fairly rapid reaction when COVID cases go up nationally in terms of the preference of patients to whether or not to seek elective care.

And as you point out, the U.S. health care market is very tight right now. For us, in our care delivery assets, we are seeing good, both the retention, engagement and recruitment of physicians and care providers. 
A couple of examples I'll give you. We mentioned at the start of the year, our intent to bring onboard 10,000 additional physicians to our ranks, and we've already brought on board about 8,000 year-to-date. So just as a high-level indicator, why -- what do we attribute this to? And I would say in partnership with Patricia Lewis and our human capital team, we're relentlessly focused on supporting our frontline care provider teams throughout the pandemic and they know this and have been deeply appreciative of it. 
And we work very hard, and this precedes the pandemic but has yielded dividends during the pandemic to support them in an environment that decreases clerical burden and allows them to focus on the work they love, which is actually taking care of patients, which is what we all want. So overall, we're managing through this. I won't kid you, it's tight, and we're keeping a close eye on it throughout all of our operations in our 43 states where we provide care. Thank you."

When that does complete, we've have no reason to expect that we wouldn't be trending along the same levels that we talked about prior when that does come in. It's just a question when it comes in and year and how the benefits play. There's just timing impacts in terms of that, when it would actually close during the year. But not incorporated in that outlook. 
As it relates to kind of the $1.80 that we articulated last year. Yes, we broke out a number of different components that were important in that element. And frankly, my hope would be -- we're not talking about a COVID number by the time we get into '22. That we move beyond that and we can move beyond to business as normal as we can while being always ready and to address the environment that's at hand.

So our pharmacy services growth, remember, that's our home delivery, specialty, infusion, the multidose as well as our direct-to-consumer community businesses. Those will continue to grow in '22. We see those sort of outpacing growth of the rest of OptumRx pharmacy. 
And I guess I'd call out a few things when I think about '22. First of all, we've made those investments. And so we're seeing that. We talked about Genoa and our community pharmacies and Dirk talked about this morning and how they're growing, not just in expanded sites, but our existing sites are continuing to show really strong growth as they expand services to existing members and expand in different types of health centers.

This was also a little bit more topical about a month ago with The Wall Street Journal putting a spotlight on it. So I guess I'm just curious if you have any updated high-level thoughts on MRA payments conceptually for the managed care industry overall. And do you see any potential reform of MRA near term? Or do you expect status quo going forward?"

Thank you very much for the question. First, let me point to the value proposition that Medicare Advantage provides. I think that's important context.

First, let me point to the value proposition that Medicare Advantage provides. I think that's important context. So I may serve 27 million Americans with very high-quality care. And compared to fee-for-service Medicare MA costs less, is more equitable, has better quality access and outcomes and greater coverage and benefits with nearly 100% consumer satisfaction. So very, very important to the care that seniors receive, and it's important that we preserve the stability of this program that so many people rely on. 
And when we think about the risk adjustment model in the payment system. The model has been critical to providing broad and equitable access to MA. Risk adjustment levels of playing field and ensures that there's no disincentive to care for the most vulnerable. So we really feel that it's an essential part of encouraging the right incentives in the program, and think that it's something to build on and broadly support that we need to think about how to build on these positive elements and aspects of the program for which this is one of them."

Yes, we're hearing that there's -- obviously, there's staffing shortages. Obviously, many of the hospitals and other providers have to pay more for their input, and that's going to be reflected in the economics as we go forward. And of course, all that is reflected in how we price going forward. So yes, that occurs.
