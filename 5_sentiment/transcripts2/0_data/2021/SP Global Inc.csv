The first thing I'd like to do is thank our people at S&P Global for their dedication and commitment throughout 2020. As the pandemic continues to take its toll across the globe, our people remain focused on supporting each other, our customers and our communities. Together, they continue to provide relevant and timely benchmarks data and research to help our clients navigate through this turbulent economy. So to all 23,000 of you, let me say thank you. 
Now let me turn to the key financial achievements in 2020. S&P Global delivered 10% organic revenue growth and 23% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. All 4 businesses contributed with growth in both revenue and adjusted operating profit. We generated $3.3 billion of free cash flow, excluding certain items, and returned $1.8 billion through share repurchases and dividends. In addition to the very strong financial results, we made significant progress on our key initiatives as well. The expertise in technology that we've developed over a number of years enabled the creation of new products, product enhancements and productivity improvements. By funding growth investments to leverage our technology, we were able to deliver the largest collection of new product launches I can remember. 
We also continued to expand our ESG and climate product offerings, including the new S&P Global ESG Scores. I'll share more about all of these new products in a moment. 
Another highlight was the completion of our Investor Day productivity target as we surpassed the target and achieved $120 million of annual savings. Upon completion, we then initiated a new $120 million program in October, which is targeted to be completed in 2 to 3 years. There are 2 common questions that investors have been asking for years. What will your results look like in a recession? And do you really have any more opportunities to improve margins? I think 2020 went a long way in answering both of those questions. 
To recap the financial results for the full year, organic revenue increased 10% to $7.4 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 18%, and our adjusted operating profit margin increased 310 basis points to 53.3%. In addition, shares outstanding decreased 2% over the past year, contributing to the 23% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. Ewout will review our fourth quarter financial performance in a moment. 
I'm particularly pleased that all 4 businesses contributed to the company's overall revenue growth and adjusted operating profit improvement. Ratings led the way with organic revenue up 15% and its adjusted operating profit margin of 460 basis points to 62.4%. The only business with a decline in its adjusted operating profit margin was S&P Dow Jones Indices at 69.1%. This was primarily due to higher legal expenses, ESG expansion and incentives. 
It's important to remember that our 2020 financial results are part of a solid track record of performance. Over the past 4 years, we've posted a compound annual growth rate of 7% for revenue, and we have averaged more than 250 basis points per year of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. And this has resulted in more than doubling of our adjusted diluted EPS over that time frame. 
We also made large strides in nonfinancial metrics in 2020 by enhancing the company's environmental performance and improving our social outreach. We issued our second annual TCFD report featuring 2019 carbon-adjusted EPS. We secured approval from the science-based target initiative for a new target to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2025. This is from a 2019 base. We are targeting to achieve net 0 by 2040. 
We supported work-from-home arrangements with flexibility for those simultaneously caring for children or elderly family. We enhanced benefits for sick leave, global care leave and days off for volunteering efforts and wellness. And the contributions by the S&P Global Foundation increased 170% to $11 million. These donations support COVID-19 relief, racial equity social justice, economic inclusion, environmental sustainability and gender equality. We've also made substantial progress on our external ESG initiatives. ESG revenue reached $65 million in 2020, a 40% increase over 2019. The new product launches in Ratings are all gaining momentum with a number of ESG evaluations, Green Evaluations and SAM benchmark shown here. 
We also saw an increase of 220 companies completing the corporate sustainability assessment. These assessments are integral to much of our ESG effort. 
Market Intelligence launched numerous products, including S&P Global ESG Scores covering 7,300 companies and Trucost climate analytics and environmental data that contain environmental data on 15,000 companies. These are both available on the Market Intelligence platform or as a data feed. 
In Indices, ESG exchange-traded funds assets under management increased by more than 200% to $20 billion. And the year was filled with new ESG Indices being introduced in our customers creating new ETFs and options. 
In Platts, the energy transition is becoming increasingly important. We continue to support the markets with new price assessments for commodities like battery metals and hydrogen. 
Last year, we told you about the shipping industry moving to low-sulfur fuel and our launch of new low-sulfur marine fuel price assessments. There are now a range of related future contracts based on our prices with open interest growing steadily. 
We also continued to advance our China initiatives in 2020. We introduced Mandarin language versions of both Ratings 360 and the Market Intelligence platform. We released a beta version of the China Credit Analytics Platform. This is an integrated desktop solution that generates credit insights on public and private companies using unique content and localized analytics aligned with the S&P Global standards. We completed 9 public ratings in the fourth quarter, including the first nonbank corporate rating, bringing the 2020 total to 22 ratings. We completed our registration-enabling ratings in the exchange bond market, which accounts for approximately 40% of the total number of bond issuance in China. 
It is also encouraging that the Chinese bond market continues to develop. We continued to see positive signs from the Chinese regulators who are driving change in the local credit ratings markets. In addition, following several recent high-profile defaults, there's an increased sensitivity and awareness among local market participants to the quality of credit ratings. 
Internally, 2020 has been dubbed the year of new product launches. I can't remember a year with so many launches. This was a direct result of the increase in investment spending over the past 2 years, combined with our exceptional technology expertise. The launches included Marketplace, the Snowflake partnership, Risk Age, Pro Spread and the Platts platform, all of which we have discussed on previous earnings calls. 
There are 2 new items we haven't discussed yet. The first is the launch of S&P Risk Casting Indices, which use artificial intelligence to adjust the weighting of equity and fixed income positions in response to market signals. The second is the S&P Kensho Moonshot Index, which measures a company's propensity to innovate. The index excludes the mega-cap technology names, instead focusing on the next generation of innovative companies. 
In addition, Ratings 360 launched comprehensive data models and tools for the CLO user base and enhance content for international and U.S. public finance. 
While we included the S&P Kensho Moonshot's Index on the last slide, we needed a separate slide to cover all of the new products, product enhancements and productivity improvements Kensho developed in 2020. These include Omnisearch on the Market Intelligence platform. A high-speed revamp of the Platts market on close process, utilizing AI, publication times for assessments were reduced by an average of 80%. We've converted 66 markets to the Kensho MOC process already, and we will continue to migrate additional markets in 2021; Kensho Extract, which enables information to be replicated exactly as found in the original document. Kensho's indices have also made great progress with the SPDR S&P Kensho new economies composite ETF, ending 2020 with over $2.3 billion in AUM, a tenfold increase this year. And we've made several Kensho solutions available in our recently launched marketplace. 
The first is Kensho Scribe, a tool that enabled us to create 36,000 transcripts last year while expanding our corporate coverage by 1,500 companies. This tool is now available for our clients to convert speech to text. The second is Kensho Link, a tool that enabled us to have data sets on 11 million entities from Credit Safe, Frequent and IP Query. This tool is also available to our clients to help link data sense. Taken together, cognitive automation from Kensho Link, Kensho Scribe and several other machine learning tools have delivered an estimated 700,000 hours of savings. 
While we have developed exceptional technology capabilities among our IT community, we have also made great strides to expand technological skills of all employees. A great example is robotic process automation or RPA. Employees from around the company have embraced RPA, taken internal classes and created their own bots generating an estimated savings of 300,000 hours in 2020. 
While all of the work that we do internally is what drives much of our success, key industry trends also help. The shift into passive investing continues. This chart shows the cumulative U.S. equity flows of $1.8 trillion in the past 10 years, and we are a prime beneficiary of this trend. If we look at ETF AUM associated with our indices, there has been an almost 150% increase over the past 5 years to $2 trillion. Over the long run, we believe this trend will continue. 
The increase in global issuance has been another positive trend for the company, while 2020 issuance in aggregate increased 13%. As is often the case, there are pockets of strength and pockets of weakness. Global investment grade in high yield were the strongest categories, increasing 26% and 27%, respectively. This is due to incredible activity in the U.S., which increased 53% and 66%, respectively. Meanwhile, both structured and leveraged loans lagged in 2020. 
The market clearly favored high-yield issuance over leveraged loans in 2020. Besides the decline in leveraged loan issuance in the U.S. and Europe, this slide depicts the percentage of loans that we rated, which was 91% in both the U.S. and Europe. 
I'd now like to shift the presentation to our outlook for 2021. Let's start with the latest view from our economists. They are forecasting global GDP growth of 5% in 2021, with growth accelerating during the year as vaccinations proceed and lockdowns recede. They believe fiscal and monetary policy will remain very accommodative and flexible. While the correlation between GDP and issuance was severed by the pandemic, we expect a long-term correlation to remain intact. 
The latest global refinancing study was issued earlier this week. The total amount of global debt maturity in this study is $11.3 trillion over the next 5 years. This is up 5% from the $10.8 trillion highlighted in last year's study. The chart on the right depicts the global high-yield debt maturing over the next 5 years. It totals to $3 trillion, up 20% from $2.5 trillion in last year's study. This bodes well for future high-yield issuance. After issuance growth of 15% in 2019 and 17% in 2020, our Ratings Research Group anticipates that issuance will decrease 3% in 2021. The forecast calls for gains in financials and structure [ of ] 4% and 3%, respectively, and decreases in nonfinancials and U.S. municipal issuance of 9% and 5%, respectively. Please note that this is an issuance forecast, not a revenue forecast. Despite the forecasted decline, supporting factors in 2021 include favorable financing conditions, increasing amounts of sovereign debt with negative yields and a renewed M&A pipeline for corporations. 
On this slide, I want to share some of the key initiatives that we're focused on in 2021. Asia and China, in particular, continue to be attractive markets for new product development and expanded capabilities. We want to continue to provide customers with new offerings, including the S&P Global platform, additional indices solutions, expanded Platts products and broadening Ratings 360 coverage to additional issuer categories. We also want to focus on innovation and technology. We will do this by bolstering our data and systems capabilities to support growth while leveraging technology for new products and improve customer experiences. And we will continue to enhance our data extraction and ingestion capabilities. 
We're especially pleased to integrate our company-wide ESG offerings, creating new ESG products and extending our existing ESG coverage universe. The most important initiative of the year will be our upcoming merger with IHS Markit. This is an incredibly transformative opportunity for our company and our customers. The combination of S&P Global and IHS Markit creates a strong company. We'll have increased scale and world-class products across numerous core markets, with a track record of deploying cutting-edge technology to accelerate our Powering the Markets of the Future strategy. The pro forma company will serve a global customer base across financial information services, ratings indices, commodities and energy and transportation and engineering. Together, we will offer differentiated data, analytics, research and benchmarks, important to the workflows of many of the world's leading companies and governments. We expect the combined company to deliver EBITDA synergies of approximately $680 million, resulting in a highly profitable combined company with continued opportunity for margin expansion. The acquisition is expected to generate a return on invested capital in excess of our weighted cost of capital after full synergy realization, consistent with our M&A philosophy. For the employees of both companies, we will combine 2 best-in-class workforces and deep expertise and complementary cultures focused on serving the global needs of our customers. I'm incredibly proud of the team we've built at S&P Global, and I look forward to welcoming the talented IHS Markit employees to S&P Global. 
There are 3 parallel paths that are underway to close the transaction and prepare for the combination. The first is shareholder approval. The Form S-4 was filed and became effective last month. This enabled us to establish record dates and schedule shareholder meetings. Both shareholder meetings are scheduled for March 11. The second is regulatory approval. We're working toward regulatory approval in the countries listed. We continue to expect closing in the second half of 2021. The third is pre-close integration planning. We have created integration teams focused on day 1 readiness. These teams are developing plans that focus on organizational integration, real estate consolidation, technology scale and efficiency, cross-selling and new product development. And we've created a value capture work stream, similar to what we established on our SNL acquisition to pursue and track synergies. 
The new company will have 6 businesses. Martina Cheung will lead Ratings. Martina will also be responsible for leading ESG across the company. Adam Kansler will lead Market Intelligence and Financial Services. Saugata Saha will lead Platts and Resources. Dan Draper will lead Indices. Edouard Tavernier will lead Transportation. In addition to being CFO, Ewout Steenbergen will lead consolidated markets and solutions. And after the merger is closed, John Berisford will lead all of our integration efforts together with Ewout. I'm optimistic that S&P Global has a great future as a stand-alone company with exceptional assets, technology and people. Combining our company with IHS Markit makes for an even brighter future. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?"
21719,701294302,2200441,"S&P Global Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and welcome to all of you on the call. Let me start with our fourth quarter financial results. Organic revenue increased 6%. Adjusted corporate and allocated expense decreased 21%, primarily due to the timing of charitable contributions,",2310,"Thank you, Doug, and welcome to all of you on the call. Let me start with our fourth quarter financial results. Organic revenue increased 6%. Adjusted corporate and allocated expense decreased 21%, primarily due to the timing of charitable contributions, lower professional fees and a reduction in the company's real estate footprint. Adjusted total expenses increased 11%, and I will come back to this on the next slide. 
Adjusted operating profit margin decreased 150 basis points due to the increase in total expenses. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the successful resolution of various tax audits and a true-up of prior period taxes. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 2%, and adjusted diluted EPS increased 7%. 
While total adjusted expenses for the full year increased 4%, for the fourth quarter, they increased 11%. This was primarily due to increased incentives as a result of strong 2020 financial performance, expenses related to the acquisitions of Greenwich Associates by CRISIL and the RobecoSAM ESG data and analytics platform and investments in growth initiatives and productivity programs. 
The non-GAAP adjustments this quarter collectively generated a net pretax loss of $247 million. They included $138 million associated with office lease, equipment and software impairments; $55 million in restructurings across the company; $24 million in IHS Markit merger costs; $2 million for Kensho retention-related expenses; and $29 million in deal-related amortization. The termination of office and equipment leases and the restructuring actions will result in annual savings of approximately $70 million. Approximately $20 million of these savings are part of the new $120 million productivity program. The balance is related to separate business efficiency initiatives. 
This quarter, all 4 divisions delivered increased revenue, with indices achieving double-digit growth. As I explained earlier, due to increased cost, adjusted operating profit margins were generally muted. For the full year, Ratings and Platts delivered superior adjusted operating profit margin improvement; Market Intelligence increased slightly with elevated investment spending; and Indices decreased slightly, primarily due to higher legal expenses and ESG investments. 
Each year, on our fourth quarter earnings call, we share changes in our headcount. In 2020, headcount increased 2%. This year, we separated enterprise technology headcount from corporate headcount. Corporate was the area with the largest headcount increase at 16%. This was the result of in-sourcing about 130 [ order-to-cash ] positions, resulting in annual savings of several million dollars. The only other area that had an outsized increase was Platts, which increased headcount 5%. This was due to investment spending to expand their commercial presence in Asia and fund their benchmark acceleration program as well as in-sourcing of IT contractors. 
Last year, we shared this slide and estimated that we would invest $150 million in growth initiatives in 2020. The projects that make up this total are listed on the left. We ended up spending $139 million, which was still an exceptional level of activity for the company. For 2021, we expect investment spending to moderate to $100 million. This activity, coupled with the merger with IHS Markit, should keep the organization fully engaged with exciting new projects and opportunities. 
On our third quarter earnings call, we introduced a new $120 million productivity program to be completed over the next 2 to 3 years. I'm pleased to report that we're off to a fast start, with $49 million of run rate savings already achieved. These were mainly from reduced real estate and changes to IT contracts as well as investments made to permanently reduce T&E. These run rate savings do not include the $20 million benefit from the impairments and restructuring actions taken at the end of 2020. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet has low leverage and surplus liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion. This is temporarily higher than necessary and will be reduced when we resume share repurchases; debt of $4.1 billion; an undrawn revolver capacity of $1.2 billion and no commercial paper outstanding. Our adjusted gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is consistent with our current leverage target. 
Free cash flow, excluding certain items, reached $3.3 billion in 2020, an increase of $740 million or 28% over the prior year period. In 2020, the company returned $1.2 billion to repurchase 4 million shares and paid dividends of $645 million. In aggregate, we returned 55% of free cash flow, excluding certain items. This fell short of our target of 75% as we had to curtail share repurchases due to the merger. If there is an open window and we have an opportunity, we will repurchase shares before the merger closes. If not, we anticipate resuming share repurchases after the merger is completed. 
Now let's turn to the division results, starting with S&P Dow Jones Indices. The segment delivered 10% revenue growth, primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices and data subscriptions. In the fourth quarter, we reported an 8% increase in adjusted expenses, primarily due to incentive compensation true-ups, increased headcount and application development spending; an 11% increase in adjusted segment operating profit; and an adjusted segment operating profit margin of 68.5%, an increase of 50 basis points. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 69.1%. 
S&P Dow Jones Indices delivered growth across all revenue channels this quarter. Asset-linked fees increased 12% with gains in ETFs and mutual funds, exchange-traded derivative revenue increased 3%. Data and custom subscriptions increased 7% due to an increase in end-of-day AC fee. 
Activity at the CBOE decreased in the fourth quarter with S&P 500 Index options activity decreasing 13% and fixed futures and options activity decreasing 1%. This was in contrast to increased activity at the CME where the equity complex volume increased 58%. Almost all of the gain at the CME was due to the successful launch of the Micro E-mini S&P 500 futures. Excluding this product, the volumes at the CME equity complex were essentially flat. 
Market Intelligence delivered organic revenue growth of 7% with strength in both renewals and new business. Usage of our key market platforms increased 13% year-over-year. Adjusted expenses increased 10% due to incentive compensation true-ups and higher commissions and royalties. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 2%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 160 basis points to 30.7%. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 32.4%. 
Looking across the Market Intelligence components, Desktop revenue grew 5%, excluding acquisitions and divestments. During 2020, Market Intelligence delivered significant enhancements to the MI platform. These included improved visualization, a customizable dashboard, integration of Kensho Omnisearch, an upgraded mobile experience and a cloud-based infrastructure for better performance. These enhancements help us meet the needs of many platform users and position us well for continued execution against our integrated desktop road map. 
Data Management Solutions revenue grew 10%, and Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 8%. Ratings reported revenue increased 7%. Organic revenue increased 5%, excluding the acquisitions of the ESG Data and Analytics platform from RobecoSAM and CRISIL's acquisition of Greenwich Associates. Adjusted expenses increased 17%, primarily due to incentive true-ups and acquisitions. This resulted in a 1% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 370 basis point decrease in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 460 basis points to 62.4%. Non-transaction revenue increased 15%. Organic nontransaction revenue increased 11%, primarily due to fees associated with surveillance, frequent issuer programs, rating evaluation service on increased M&A activity and higher new entity credit ratings activity. Transaction revenue was relatively flat as increases in bank loan ratings revenue were offset by a decrease in bond issuance compared to a very strong fourth quarter of 2019. As we have seen time and time again, the various parts of the Ratings business often move in opposite directions with some up and some down in any given quarter or year. This quarter, nontransaction revenue was strong, while transaction revenue was unchanged. 
Non-transaction revenue is generally a steady source of growth that are broke out to the upside in the fourth quarter. About 1/3 of the organic growth in the fourth quarter was from surveillance fees and frequent issuer programs that are more recurring in nature. About 1/3 was from large jumps in RES and new entity credit ratings, which we expect to continue to be strong in 2021. And about 1/3 was from other items. 
This slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributor to the increase in Ratings revenue was an 8% increase in corporates. In addition, financial services revenue increased 6%, structured finance decreased 6%, governments decreased 3% and the CRISIL and other category increased 8%. 
On the right side of the slide, you can see the changes in revenue within structured products. The largest change was in CMBS, which was due to a 64% decrease in global CMBS issuance. 
And now turning to Platts. Reported revenue increased 5%, with core subscriptions increasing 6% and Global Trading Services decreasing 5%. GTS revenue decreased, mainly due to lower natural gas and iron ore volumes, partially offset by increased LNG volumes. Also due to COVID, our conference business revenue was down about $1.5 million in the quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 7% due to incentive true-ups and growth investments. Adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 100 basis points to 51.7%. The trailing 4-quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 230 basis points to 54.7%. 
The fastest-growing categories during the quarter were petrochemicals, up 18%; and Power and Gas, up 6%. Petrochemicals had a favorable comparison to a weak fourth quarter of 2019. 
We recently filed the S-4 and received a handful of questions about the document. They were generally related to the 2 topics on this slide. The first question was, if the 2021 stand-alone adjusted diluted EPS in the S-4 was our guidance. It's not. The $12.36 figure in the S-4 assumes that we will continue to repurchase shares in 2021 as a stand-alone company. However, as we have stated, we think that it is unlikely we will resume share repurchases before the merger with IHS Markit closes. Therefore, our 2021 guidance assumes no share repurchases. 
The second difference is that the S-4 figures were based on our October internal forecast. Our initial 2021 guidance is based on our most recent internal forecast, which has improved outlook primarily due to increased growth in ACV and our subscription businesses and AUM in our Indices business. 
The second question was why the cash flow figures in the S-4 differ from the figures stated on the merger conference call and our normal free cash flow reporting. These are 2 different views of free cash flow. The S-4 provides an unlevered free cash flow forecast typically utilized to value companies via a discounted cash flow analysis. The difference between the unlevered free cash flow in the S-4 and the free cash flow in our guidance and discussed on our merger call is that the S-4 definition includes stock-based compensation expenses and acquisitions and excludes interest payments. 
We're not providing 2021 GAAP guidance because given the inherent uncertainty around the merger, management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of GAAP measures. 
And this slide depicts our adjusted guidance. While we expect that the merger will occur in the second half of this year, we are providing adjusted guidance on a stand-alone basis: Revenue increasing mid-single digits; corporate unallocated expense in the range of $140 million to $150 million, an increase over the $128 million in 2020 due to some expected normalization of pandemic-related cost savings; deal-related amortization of $95 million to $100 million, a decrease from the $123 million in 2020 as certain assets have been fully amortized; operating profit margin in a range of 53.8% to 54.3%, which is 50 to 100 basis points higher than in 2020; interest expense net, which includes both interest income and interest expense in the range of $120 million to $125 million. This is lower than the $141 million in 2020 due to the recent refinancing of a large portion of our outstanding debt; a tax rate in the range of 21.5% to 22.5%, which is consistent with the 21.5% reported in 2020; diluted EPS in a range of $12.25 to $12.45, a 5% to 7% increase over 2020. While this growth rate might seem modest, it is 29% to 31% higher than our 2019 EPS. That's an average of about 15% per year. We just happened to achieve most of this increase in 2020. Also keep in mind that these figures assume no share repurchases in 2021. And finally, free cash flow generation in a range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion, which is flat to up $100 million compared to 2020 due to improved business performance, partially offset by normalizing cash collections following a strong year with record low delinquencies in 2020. 
In addition to the slides that we have reviewed on this call, there is an appendix with additional fourth quarter slides that can be downloaded from the Investor Presentation section of the Investor Relations website. 
In conclusion, 2020 was a very strong year for S&P Global. Despite the recession, all of our businesses grew revenue, and we improved our adjusted operating margin by 310 basis points. Year after year, we have demonstrated our ability to grow revenue and adjusted operating margin, and we don't believe that we are close to being done. We remain encouraged about our future and have just introduced 2021 adjusted guidance that reflects our optimism. 
Finally, I want to echo Doug's comments about our employees. They continue to perform at an exceptional level in difficult circumstances. And Doug, myself and the rest of the leadership team applaud their tenacity and innovativeness. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

We've had great respect for Lance and for the team at IHS Markit. And so there's excitement across the board. And we see things very positive. 
One final comment. As you saw in the slide, we talked about parallel paths. One of those is integration planning.

So you think about that as 1 distribution channel for all of the very rich IHS Markit data. 
On the other hand, IHS Markit also has very powerful tools, which include workflow for financial institutions and for corporate and asset management industry, et cetera. So getting those 2 together is going to allow us to have a much more comprehensive strategy, both looking at the value that we bring, which you talk about is a price strategy, but I think it more a value strategy that expands that and then also ability to bring much more -- many more products and services to all of the different kinds of customers that we serve."

As we have said many times about the Ratings business, it doesn't always rain everywhere at the same time. So there are always components that are going up and several other components that are going down. But in aggregate, the outlook for Ratings looks always quite constructive. 
For 2021, overall, from a revenue perspective, we expect low- to mid-single-digit growth for Ratings. And that is particularly helped by nontransaction revenue. Nontransaction revenue, we're currently estimating to grow at a mid- to high single-digit level in 2021. That is being helped by higher surveillance fees based on more bonds outstanding based on the issuance levels last year; frequent issuer programs; rating evaluation services, which we expect to continue to be held by the M&A environment. And then in terms of a mix, there's always some elements that are going up and down. And then in addition to that, we should also see some benefit from new products. So overall, I think a very constructive outlook for Ratings. And again, overall, from a revenue perspective for the full year, low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth."

Think, for example, about the current period where the shareholders' vote is underway. So we would not be able to do share buybacks until the shareholders' meeting on March 11. Of course, we have also closed windows with respect to our quarterly results. And then we should not be in possession of material nonpublic information. So a combination of those elements might the windows that we can do buybacks quite limited. And therefore, we think it is unlikely we can do buybacks. But if there is an opportunity and from a legal perspective, we should be clear, we definitely would like to restart some of the buybacks. Otherwise, we will do that post close of the merger. There's definitely going to be, at that point in time, some catch-up buybacks because, of course, we're falling short towards our return targets at this point in time. And then as we have stated at the merger call, in terms of our new financial targets, we're expecting to return at least 85% of free cash flow going forward for the combined company. And the combined company from a free cash flow perspective should have a very strong profile north of 4 billion out of the gate in terms of free cash flow and growing to about 5 billion or north of 5 billion in a few years time. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we will have a very robust balance sheet in the future with a leverage ratio in a range of 2% to 2.5%. Of course, we'll have some minimum cash, but absolutely, we have currently excess cash, surplus cash that we will return to shareholders once we have the opportunity to do so."

If you think about what it's like to have the amount of data across both companies and you see the success we've had with Kensho the last few years, today, we highlighted many of the new areas that they've been providing great success. When we think about the data that IHS Markit brings, just as an example, there's 50,000 customers in 140 countries. They're serving 80% of the global Fortune 500; 94 of the largest companies in the U.S.; and then on top of that, with the pricing data, the reference data, private market solutions, the fixed income benchmarks and indices, and then all of that put together in a comprehensive data strategy with the data lake, that's going to give us an ability to take the Kensho capabilities and develop all types of new products and services. 
If you think about that, though, in addition, IHS Markit also brings its own high-quality data sciences teams. And across S&P Global, we also have other high-quality data sciences team.

We have a process around that. I'm going to hand that off to Ewout to talk more about that. But what's important for us is that we are managing the company for the long run. We think that there are opportunities for us to continue to grow in the Ratings business and Platts, Market Intelligence and Indices very specifically with the capabilities that we have today, expanding into new markets, like we've mentioned, Asia or China, new product capabilities or customer experience that we think are very important to continue with our differentiation that drives our growth. So we're committed to all of those organic investments that we see internally and to keep driving those. 
But as I just mentioned, there's also so many possibilities of bringing the 2 companies together. It's too early for us to plan those. As Ewout mentioned, we're 2 separate companies. We're managed separately, but we can start dimensioning those and working together to identify what those could be. That's one of the reasons we pulled back the investment from 150 to 100 this year because we didn't want to overextend people on areas that they might not be able to deliver once we start focusing on the integration.

And we're looking at all the growth initiatives that are being put forward. These are initiatives that should drive revenue growth going forward and should have a minimum level of investments because we don't want to look at all the small investments. So these should be larger growth initiatives for the company that should help with revenue growth in the future. And we make selections which of those are the most interesting, where we would allocate our resources. It's not only financial resources, more often, of course, product development resources, technology resources might be limiting factors there as well. And then ultimately, we allocate funding to those initiatives. And we are very encouraged about the growth of those initiatives. 
As Doug has mentioned during the prepared remarks, we have seen a lot of product launches in 2020. We are seeing good traction of those initiatives. So we're very encouraged at the level of innovation and new business development that we're having within the company. And we're continuing with that as well in 2021. 
Please keep in mind that although the overall investment number is dropping, it doesn't mean that those costs are going away because after 2 years, when an initiative is funded for a period of 2 years, it goes to a business-as-usual situation, and those costs will become part of the normal business-as-usual budget of the division. So it is not really a total expense drop. But the investments, the new investments in the first 2 years is going to be about $100 million in 2021. So still, I think a very good number, a strong number. And all of these initiatives from our perspective makes sense independently of the merger because they all are good initiatives that will help also the combined company in the future."

We have seen recently that the regulators have started to put in place some new discussions around eliminating the AA floor for the insurance industry. They're also looking at seeing if they're going to have a new approach to regulating the ratings industry. So there's also been some interest among specific market participants at a recent report we put out, which showed what the spread would be of a different bonds that you compare them to a ratings scales.

So Craig, let me start. This is something that we've thought a lot about. And when we were working on this idea with our management team and our Board of Directors, one of the most important questions that I asked, and we had good discussion with the Board is, do we have the capacity to undertake a transaction like this.

And one of the other questions we asked is, and what kind of talent will IHS Markit bring as well? And As we did our due diligence, and we already knew the team, but as we got to know them better, we were impressed that they were also going to bring a really high-quality management team that would be complementary to ours and that together, we could actually undertake something like this. 
But one thing that we've done over the past 5 years is we've put in place a very disciplined approach to managing the company. And it starts with an annual plan that we look at with the Board of Directors we agree on. It then leads to goals and objectives, which feed into our own performance -- individual performance goals as well as our divisional and functional performance goals. Those include areas that are customer, operations, people. So it's not only driven by financial performance. We also include operational targets, which includes risk management targets. So we've put in place a management system, which we think will be -- work very well with the IHS Markit team. And if we wouldn't have had the confidence that we had that process in place now for many years that we had been delivering and that we had the capacity to do something like this, and along with the quality of the teams coming along, we would not have undertaken something like this."

So that's why that difference between organic and reported nontransaction was a bit larger than normally you would see in a particular quarter, but that was driven by that particular acquisition. Therefore, 11% is more what you should look at from an ongoing basis organically. And then we said those 1/3 is coming from the revenues coming from -- non-transaction revenues from surveillance and another 1/3 from rating evaluation services that we also expect to be strong in 2021.

And another example would be something like we talked before about being able to ingest 11 million new company data from groups like [ Frequent ] into our private capital information. And something like that drives the ability for us to have unique data faster than any other organization. 
Another example of that would be something like Market On Close in Platts where we started off with 1 pilot and now we're up to 80 different commodities that are using a new process that gets our information to the market 80% faster.

IHS Markit also has the fixed income indices. And they've got information about plastics and other sorts of model metals that are used in batteries. So bringing these together are going to be something that are really new for us. And let me give you a couple of examples. 
Just imagine if you were a Chief Sustainability Officer, you mentioned the corporate clients. Corporate clients are increasingly, either through their treasure or directly a sustainability officer, looking at how their own company is going to perform and what is their own individual approach to running their sustainability programs. We're going to have the tools to provide them a rating. We're going to build them -- they're going to have the CSA. We're going to have the ability to provide them with more data to have benchmarking against other third parties. And then when you think about IHS Markit's ESG reporting repository, the carbon data that they bring that will allow them to have the workflow tools, we think that this is one of the areas that will actually allow us on our own, and then together with IHS Markit, to be really building a very relevant, very powerful ESG model. 
One thing I would end with is that we just launched a new ESG website. I would recommend that everybody go look at it. You can immediately look for ESG Scores of companies on it.

One of them is what I call private assets or being able to support the private equity industry. When we originally looked at this, we started looking at areas that were maybe a little bit more obvious in financial institutions and what we could do for debt capital markets for corporate treasurers. 
One of the areas that I see a lot of upside is in what we call private markets, private equity. Think about how much longer assets are staying private before they go public or the information that people would like to look at for their supply chain. And when you put the 2 companies together, you have tools that at IHS Markit, which for valuation, [ IVO ] and [ QVAO ], they've got portfolio monitoring tools, eye level. As you've heard me talk about earlier, we've been ingesting data from people like [ Preqin ] into our tools. And then we've got the information from 451 Research from money market directories, our Market Intelligence platform. And you put all these together, and it's going to be a very complete set of services of workflow tools valuation tools, reference data, fundamental data about corporations that we wouldn't have been able to do alone. And so that's one of the areas that I was quite excited about. 
I also mentioned what we'll be able to do with ESG. That's another area that's the upside. I think that is higher than what I originally would have thought. And then finally, when we look at energy transition, which sometimes I think of energy transition as part of ESG. But for climate change and the interest that this is generating, it's not always directly the same thing as ESG. This is another area that between what we've got in Market Intelligence and Ratings but add that in with what we have between Platts and the resources business at IHS Markit. There's going to be a lot of opportunities in new energy, new energy investments, all of the things that are involved in EV, which also bring some of the capacities from the transportation business at IHS Markit. So on energy transition, I think this is also another area that is well beyond what I'd probably originally contemplated."

But what we are seeing is particularly high growth of new initiatives, the ESG Scores, Green Evaluations, ESG Indices, fees. So particularly all the new initiatives are growing very fast. And all of that together is driving this revenue growth up going forward. And Doug has given you some of the statistics and data, for example, underneath some of the ETF AUMs that are using our ESG indices. So overall, I think it's really across the board. But at the current macro level, I think Platts is a significant component of the overall revenues."

We are very encouraged about the opportunities to bring the resources business of IHS Markit and Platts together. I think it's very complementary. I think that will be a very large benefit for our customers, with Platts having particularly a focus on price reporting, as you know, and that is quite steady and stable. 
The resources business of IHS Markit that is going through a transition from more upstream to more downstream, the upstream business has seen some headwinds and might continue for a shorter period of time. But particularly downstream analytics is doing very well. So the opportunities to bring that together and to look at the commercial opportunities for the combined company is actually very attractive. Think about what we can do with respect to metals and mining. Think about what we can do with respect to the analytics platforms bring that together for our customers, think about what we can do with the Data Lake and Platts Analytics roles by unlocking the value of the data of IHS Markit resources. So we're actually very encouraged. And we think despite some of the changes, structural changes in the industry, that we can help our customers, particularly also with energy transition."

I want to thank everybody for joining our call this morning and for all your questions and your support, as always. As you saw, 2020 was a very strong year for us during difficult circumstances. We made a lot of significant progress along the way with areas that we've been investing in over the last few years. As you know, we had put in place investment programs. And we started seeing them pay off, as we called it the year of the product launch. And it has to do with our technology, our innovation, productivity programs we put in place. We're very proud about what we're doing in China and the progress in advance that we're making there. Our ESG program is starting to really take off, and we think we're very well positioned. And then our own internal environmental performance and social outreach and our own ESG approach, we think, is something that's very important for our company. And of course, what is really most important for us this year is to continue to stay focused on the IHS Markit merger. We're so excited about that. We're always impressed with the people we'd meed with the capabilities, with the products, with the reach that they have. And we think that, that's going to allow us to have a very strong opportunity in 2021 and beyond. And as I've said all along, during last year and before, we could have never made this progress without our people and the talented people that we have that are working very hard especially in 2020 during uncertain and difficult circumstances. I want to thank all of our people again. Everyone has done a fantastic job. So thank you, everyone, for joining us again today. And we look forward to continuing to talk to you throughout the year.

Presenting on today's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
We issued a news release with our results earlier today. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.

In addition, as announced on November 30, S&P Global and IHS Markit entered into a definitive merger agreement. This call will touch on the transaction. Please note, this call does not constitute an offer to sell or buy or the solicitation of any offer to buy or sell any securities nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities law of any such jurisdiction.

The first thing I'd like to do is thank our people at S&P Global for their dedication and commitment throughout 2020. As the pandemic continues to take its toll across the globe, our people remain focused on supporting each other, our customers and our communities. Together, they continue to provide relevant and timely benchmarks, data and research to help our clients navigate through this turbulent economy. So to all 23,000 of you, let me say thank you.
Now let me turn to the key financial achievements in 2020. S&P Global delivered 10% organic revenue growth and 23% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. All 4 businesses contributed with growth in both revenue and adjusted operating profit. We generated $3.3 billion of free cash flow, excluding certain items, and returned $1.8 billion through share repurchases and dividends. 
In addition to the very strong financial results, we made significant progress on our key initiatives as well. The expertise in technology that we've developed over a number of years enabled the creation of new products, product enhancements and productivity improvements. By funding growth investments to leverage our technology, we were able to deliver the largest collection of new product launches I can remember. We also continued to expand our ESG and climate product offerings, including the new S&P Global ESG Scores. I'll share more about all of these new products in a moment.
Another highlight was the completion of our Investor Day productivity target as we surpassed the target and achieved $120 million of annual savings. Upon completion, we then initiated a new $120 million program in October, which is targeted to be completed in 2 to 3 years. 
There are 2 common questions that investors have been asking for years: What will your results look like in a recession? And do you really have any more opportunities to improve margins? I think 2020 went a long way in answering both of those questions.
To recap the financial results for the full year, organic revenue increased 10% to $7.4 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 18%, and our adjusted operating profit margin increased 310 basis points to 53.3%. In addition, shares outstanding decreased 2% over the past year, contributing to the 23% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. Ewout will review our fourth quarter financial performance in a moment.
I'm particularly pleased that all 4 businesses contributed to the company's overall revenue growth and adjusted operating profit improvement. Ratings led the way with organic revenue up 15% and its adjusted operating profit margin of 460 basis points to 62.4%. The only business with a decline in its adjusted operating profit margin was S&P Dow Jones Indices at 69.1%. This was primarily due to higher legal expenses, ESG expansion and incentives.
It's important to remember that our 2020 financial results are part of a solid track record of performance. Over the past 4 years, we've posted a compound annual growth rate of 7% for revenue, and we have averaged more than 250 basis points per year of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. And this has resulted in more than doubling of our adjusted diluted EPS over that time frame.
We also made large strides in nonfinancial metrics in 2020 by enhancing the company's environmental performance and improving our social outreach. We issued our second annual TCFD report featuring 2019 carbon-adjusted EPS. We secured approval from the Science Based Targets Initiative for a new target to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2025. This is from a 2019 base. We are targeting to achieve net 0 by 2040.
We supported work-from-home arrangements with flexibility for those simultaneously caring for children or elderly family. We enhanced benefits for sick leave, global care leave and days off for volunteering efforts and wellness. And the contributions by the S&P Global Foundation increased 170% to $11 million. These donations support COVID-19 relief, racial equity social justice, economic inclusion, environmental sustainability and gender equality. 
We've also made substantial progress on our external ESG initiatives. ESG revenue reached $65 million in 2020, a 40% increase over 2019. The new product launches in Ratings are all gaining momentum with a number of ESG evaluations, Green Evaluations and SAM benchmarks shown here. We also saw an increase of 220 companies completing the Corporate Sustainability Assessment. These assessments are integral to much of our ESG effort.
Market Intelligence launched numerous products, including S&P Global ESG Scores covering 7,300 companies and Trucost climate analytics and environmental data that contain environmental data on 15,000 companies. These are both available on the Market Intelligence platform or as a data feed.
In indices, ESG exchange-traded funds assets under management increased by more than 200% to $20 billion. And the year was filled with new ESG indices being introduced and our customers creating new ETFs and options. 
In Platts, the energy transition is becoming increasingly important. We continue to support the markets with new price assessments for commodities like battery metals and hydrogen. Last year, we told you about the shipping industry moving to low-sulfur fuel and our launch of new low-sulfur marine fuel price assessments. There are now a range of related future contracts based on our prices with open interest growing steadily. 
We also continued to advance our China initiatives in 2020. We introduced Mandarin language versions of both Ratings360 and the Market Intelligence platform. We released a beta version of the China Credit Analytics platform. This is an integrated desktop solution that generates credit insights on public and private companies using unique content and localized analytics aligned with the S&P Global standards. 
We completed 9 public ratings in the fourth quarter, including the first nonbank corporate rating, bringing the 2020 total to 22 ratings. We completed our registration-enabling ratings in the exchange bond market, which accounts for approximately 40% of the total number of bond issuance in China.
It is also encouraging that the Chinese bond market continues to develop. We continued to see positive signs from the Chinese regulators who are driving change in the local credit ratings markets. In addition, following several recent high-profile defaults, there's an increased sensitivity and awareness among local market participants to the quality of credit ratings.
Internally, 2020 has been dubbed the year of new product launches. I can't remember a year with so many launches. This was a direct result of the increase in investment spending over the past 2 years, combined with our exceptional technology expertise. The launches included Marketplace, the Snowflake partnership, RiskGauge, ProSpread and the Platts Platform, all of which we have discussed on previous earnings calls.
There are 2 new items we haven't discussed yet. The first is the launch of S&P Riskcasting Indices, which use artificial intelligence to adjust the weighting of equity and fixed income positions in response to market signals. The second is the S&P Kensho Moonshots Index, which measures a company's propensity to innovate. The index excludes the mega-cap technology names, instead focusing on the next generation of innovative companies. In addition, Ratings360 launched comprehensive data, models and tools for the CLO user base and enhanced content for international and U.S. public finance.
While we included the S&P Kensho Moonshots Index on the last slide, we needed a separate slide to cover all of the new products, product enhancements and productivity improvements Kensho developed in 2020. These include: Omnisearch on the Market Intelligence platform, a high-speed revamp of the Platts Market-on-Close process. Utilizing AI, publication times for assessments were reduced by an average of 80%. We've converted 66 markets to the Kensho MOC process already, and we will continue to migrate additional markets in 2021. Kensho Extract, which enables information to be replicated exactly as found in the original document. Kensho's indices have also made great progress with the SPDR S&P Kensho New Economies Composite ETF, ending 2020 with over $2.3 billion in AUM, a tenfold increase this year. And we've made several Kensho solutions available in our recently launched Marketplace.
The first is Kensho Scribe, a tool that enabled us to create 36,000 transcripts last year while expanding our corporate coverage by 1,500 companies. This tool is now available for our clients to convert speech to text. The second is Kensho Link, a tool that enabled us to have data sets on 11 million entities from Creditsafe, Preqin and IPqwery. This tool is also available to our clients to help link data sets. Taken together, cognitive automation from Kensho Link, Kensho Scribe and several other machine learning tools have delivered an estimated 700,000 hours of savings.
While we have developed exceptional technology capabilities among our IT community, we have also made great strides to expand technological skills of all employees. A great example is robotic process automation or RPA. Employees from around the company have embraced RPA, taken internal classes and created their own bots generating an estimated savings of 300,000 hours in 2020.
While all of the work that we do internally is what drives much of our success, key industry trends also help. The shift into passive investing continues. This chart shows the cumulative U.S. equity flows of $1.8 trillion in the past 10 years, and we are a prime beneficiary of this trend. If we look at ETF AUM associated with our indices, there has been an almost 150% increase over the past 5 years to $2 trillion. Over the long run, we believe this trend will continue.
The increase in global issuance has been another positive trend for the company. While 2020 issuance in aggregate increased 13%, as is often the case, there are pockets of strength and pockets of weakness. Global investment grade and high yield were the strongest categories, increasing 26% and 27%, respectively. This is due to incredible activity in the U.S., which increased 53% and 66%, respectively. Meanwhile, both structured and leveraged loans lagged in 2020.
The market clearly favored high-yield issuance over leveraged loans in 2020. Besides the decline in leveraged loan issuance in the U.S. and Europe, this slide depicts the percentage of loans that we rated, which was 91% in both the U.S. and Europe.
I'd now like to shift the presentation to our outlook for 2021. Let's start with the latest view from our economists. They are forecasting global GDP growth of 5% in 2021, with growth accelerating during the year as vaccinations proceed and lockdowns recede. They believe fiscal and monetary policy will remain very accommodative and flexible. While the correlation between GDP and issuance was severed by the pandemic, we expect the long-term correlation to remain intact.
The latest global refinancing study was issued earlier this week. The total amount of global debt maturity in this study is $11.3 trillion over the next 5 years. This is up 5% from the $10.8 trillion highlighted in last year's study. The chart on the right depicts the global high-yield debt maturing over the next 5 years. It totals to $3 trillion, up 20% from $2.5 trillion in last year's study. This bodes well for future high-yield issuance. 
After issuance growth of 15% in 2019 and 17% in 2020, our Ratings Research group anticipates that issuance will decrease 3% in 2021. The forecast calls for gains in financials and structured to 4% and 3%, respectively, and decreases in nonfinancials and U.S. municipals issuance of 9% and 5%, respectively. Please note that this is an issuance forecast, not a revenue forecast. Despite the forecasted decline, supporting factors in 2021 include favorable financing conditions, increasing amounts of sovereign debt with negative yields and a renewed M&A pipeline for corporations.
On this slide, I want to share some of the key initiatives that we're focused on in 2021. Asia, and China in particular, continue to be attractive markets for new product development and expanded capabilities. We want to continue to provide customers with new offerings, including the S&P Global platform, additional indices solutions, expanded Platts products and broadening Ratings360 coverage to additional issuer categories. We also want to focus on innovation and technology. We will do this by bolstering our data and systems capabilities to support growth while leveraging technology for new products and improve customer experiences. And we will continue to enhance our data extraction and ingestion capabilities. We're especially pleased to integrate our company-wide ESG offerings, creating new ESG products and extending our existing ESG coverage universe. 
The most important initiative of the year will be our upcoming merger with IHS Markit. This is an incredibly transformative opportunity for our company and our customers. The combination of S&P Global and IHS Markit creates a strong company. We'll have increased scale and world-class products across numerous core markets, with a track record of deploying cutting-edge technology to accelerate our Powering the Markets of the Future strategy. 
The pro forma company will serve a global customer base across financial information services, ratings, indices, commodities and energy, and transportation and engineering. Together, we will offer differentiated data, analytics, research and benchmarks important to the workflows of many of the world's leading companies and governments. 
We expect the combined company to deliver EBITA synergies of approximately $680 million, resulting in a highly profitable combined company with continued opportunity for margin expansion. The acquisition is expected to generate a return on invested capital in excess of our weighted cost of capital after full synergy realization, consistent with our M&A philosophy. 
For the employees of both companies, we will combine 2 best-in-class workforces and deep expertise and complementary cultures focused on serving the global needs of our customers. I'm incredibly proud of the team we've built at S&P Global, and I look forward to welcoming the talented IHS Markit employees to S&P Global.
There are 3 parallel paths that are underway to close the transaction and prepare for the combination. The first is shareholder approval. The Form S-4 was filed and became effective last month. This enabled us to establish record dates and schedule shareholder meetings. Both shareholder meetings are scheduled for March 11. 
The second is regulatory approval. We're working toward regulatory approval in the countries listed. We continue to expect closing in the second half of 2021. 
The third is pre-close integration planning. We have created integration teams focused on day-1 readiness. These teams are developing plans that focus on organizational integration, real estate consolidation, technology scale and efficiency, cross-selling and new product development. And we've created a value capture work stream, similar to what we established on our SNL acquisition to pursue and track synergies.
The new company will have 6 businesses. Martina Cheung will lead Ratings. Martina will also be responsible for leading ESG across the company. Adam Kansler will lead Market Intelligence and financial services. Saugata Saha will lead Platts and resources. Dan Draper will lead indices. Edouard Tavernier will lead Transportation. In addition to being CFO, Ewout Steenbergen will lead Consolidated Markets & Solutions. And after the merger is closed, John Berisford will lead all of our integration efforts together with Ewout. I'm optimistic that S&P Global has a great future as a stand-alone company with exceptional assets, technology and people. Combining our company with IHS Markit makes for an even brighter future.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?"
21719,701294302,2200646,"S&P Global Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and welcome to all of you on the call. Let me start with our fourth quarter financial results. Organic revenue increased 6%. Adjusted corporate and allocated expense decreased 21%, primarily due to the timing of charitable contributions,",2305,"Thank you, Doug, and welcome to all of you on the call. Let me start with our fourth quarter financial results. Organic revenue increased 6%. Adjusted corporate and allocated expense decreased 21%, primarily due to the timing of charitable contributions, lower professional fees and a reduction in the company's real estate footprint. Adjusted total expenses increased 11%, and I will come back to this on the next slide.
Adjusted operating profit margin decreased 150 basis points due to the increase in total expenses. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the successful resolution of various tax audits and a true-up of prior-period taxes. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 2%, and adjusted diluted EPS increased 7%.
While total adjusted expenses for the full year increased 4%, for the fourth quarter, they increased 11%. This was primarily due to increased incentives as a result of strong 2020 financial performance, expenses related to the acquisitions of Greenwich Associates by CRISIL and the RobecoSAM ESG data and analytics platform and investments in growth initiatives and productivity programs.
The non-GAAP adjustments this quarter collectively generated a net pretax loss of $247 million. They included $138 million associated with office lease, equipment and software impairments; $55 million in restructurings across the company; $24 million in IHS Markit merger costs; $2 million for Kensho retention-related expenses; and $29 million in deal-related amortization. The termination of office and equipment leases and the restructuring actions will result in annual savings of approximately $70 million. Approximately $20 million of these savings are part of the new $120 million productivity program. The balance is related to separate business efficiency initiatives.
This quarter, all 4 divisions delivered increased revenue, with indices achieving double-digit growth. As I explained earlier, due to increased cost, adjusted operating profit margins were generally muted. For the full year, Ratings and Platts delivered superior adjusted operating profit margin improvement; Market Intelligence increased slightly with elevated investment spending; and indices decreased slightly, primarily due to higher legal expenses and ESG investments.
Each year, on our fourth quarter earnings call, we share changes in our headcount. In 2020, headcount increased 2%. This year, we separated enterprise technology headcount from corporate headcount. Corporate was the area with the largest headcount increase at 16%. This was the result of insourcing about 130 order-to-cash positions, resulting in annual savings of several million dollars. The only other area that had an outsized increase was Platts, which increased headcount 5%. This was due to investment spending to expand their commercial presence in Asia and fund their benchmark acceleration program as well as insourcing of IT contractors.
Last year, we shared this slide and estimated that we would invest $150 million in growth initiatives in 2020. The projects that make up this total are listed on the left. We ended up spending $139 million, which was still an exceptional level of activity for the company. For 2021, we expect investment spending to moderate to $100 million. This activity, coupled with the merger with IHS Markit, should keep the organization fully engaged with exciting new projects and opportunities.
On our third quarter earnings call, we introduced a new $120 million productivity program to be completed over the next 2 to 3 years. I'm pleased to report that we're off to a fast start, with $49 million of run rate savings already achieved. These were mainly from reduced real estate and changes to IT contracts as well as investments made to permanently reduce T&E. These run rate savings do not include the $20 million benefit from the impairments and restructuring actions taken at the end of 2020.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet has low leverage and surplus liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion. This is temporarily higher than necessary and will be reduced when we resume share repurchases. Debt of $4.1 billion; an undrawn revolver capacity of $1.2 billion and no commercial paper outstanding. Our adjusted gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is consistent with our current leverage target.
Free cash flow, excluding certain items, reached $3.3 billion in 2020, an increase of $740 million or 28% over the prior year period. In 2020, the company returned $1.2 billion to repurchase 4 million shares and paid dividends of $645 million. In aggregate, we returned 55% of free cash flow, excluding certain items. This fell short of our target of 75% as we had to curtail share repurchases due to the merger. If there is an open window and we have an opportunity, we will repurchase shares before the merger closes. If not, we anticipate resuming share repurchases after the merger is completed.
Now let's turn to the division results, starting with S&P Dow Jones Indices. The segment delivered 10% revenue growth, primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices and data subscriptions. In the fourth quarter, we reported an 8% increase in adjusted expenses, primarily due to incentive compensation true-ups, increased headcount and application development spending; an 11% increase in adjusted segment operating profit; and an adjusted segment operating profit margin of 68.5%, an increase of 50 basis points. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 69.1%.
S&P Dow Jones Indices delivered growth across all revenue channels this quarter. Asset-linked fees increased 12% with gains in ETFs and mutual funds. Exchange-traded derivative revenue increased 3%. Data and custom subscriptions increased 7% due to an increase in end-of-day ACV. 
Activity at the CBOE decreased in the fourth quarter with S&P 500 Index options activity decreasing 13% and VIX futures and options activity decreasing 1%. This was in contrast to increased activity at the CME where the equity complex volume increased 58%. Almost all of the gain at the CME was due to the successful launch of the Micro E-mini S&P 500 futures. Excluding this product, the volumes at the CME equity complex were essentially flat. 
Market Intelligence delivered organic revenue growth of 7% with strength in both renewals and new business. Usage of our key market platforms increased 13% year-over-year. Adjusted expenses increased 10% due to incentive compensation true-ups and higher commissions and royalties. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 2%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 160 basis points to 30.7%. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 32.4%.
Looking across the Market Intelligence components, Desktop revenue grew 5%, excluding acquisitions and divestments. During 2020, Market Intelligence delivered significant enhancements to the MI platform. These included improved visualization, a customizable dashboard, integration of Kensho Omnisearch, an upgraded mobile experience and a cloud-based infrastructure for better performance. These enhancements help us meet the needs of many platform users and position us well for continued execution against our integrated desktop road map. Data Management Solutions revenue grew 10%, and Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 8%. 
Ratings reported revenue increased 7%. Organic revenue increased 5%, excluding the acquisitions of the ESG data and analytics platform from RobecoSAM and CRISIL's acquisition of Greenwich Associates. Adjusted expenses increased 17%, primarily due to incentive true-ups and acquisitions. This resulted in a 1% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 370 basis point decrease in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 460 basis points to 62.4%. 
Nontransaction revenue increased 15%. Organic nontransaction revenue increased 11%, primarily due to fees associated with surveillance, frequent issuer programs, rating evaluation service on increased M&A activity and higher new entity credit ratings activity. Transaction revenue was relatively flat as increases in bank loan ratings revenue were offset by a decrease in bond issuance compared to a very strong fourth quarter of 2019. 
As we have seen time and time again, the various parts of the Ratings business often move in opposite directions with some up and some down in any given quarter or year. This quarter, nontransaction revenue was strong, while transaction revenue was unchanged.
Nontransaction revenue is generally a steady source of growth that are broke out to the upside in the fourth quarter. About 1/3 of the organic growth in the fourth quarter was from surveillance fees and frequent issuer programs that are more recurring in nature. About 1/3 was from large jumps in RES and new entity credit ratings, which we expect to continue to be strong in 2021. And about 1/3 was from other items.
This slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributor to the increase in Ratings revenue was an 8% increase in corporates. In addition, financial services revenue increased 6%, structured finance decreased 6%, governments decreased 3% and the CRISIL and other category increased 8%. 
On the right side of the slide, you can see the changes in revenue within structured products. The largest change was in CMBS, which was due to a 64% decrease in global CMBS issuance. 
And now turning to Platts. Reported revenue increased 5%, with core subscriptions increasing 6% and Global Trading Services decreasing 5%. GTS revenue decreased, mainly due to lower natural gas and iron ore volumes, partially offset by increased LNG volumes. Also due to COVID, our conference business revenue was down about $1.5 million in the quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 7% due to incentive true-ups and growth investments. Adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 100 basis points to 51.7%. The trailing 4-quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 230 basis points to 54.7%. 
The fastest-growing categories during the quarter were petrochemicals, up 18%; and power and gas, up 6%. Petrochemicals had a favorable comparison to a weak fourth quarter of 2019.
We recently filed the S-4 and received a handful of questions about the document. They were generally related to the 2 topics on this slide. The first question was, if the 2021 stand-alone adjusted diluted EPS in the S-4 was our guidance. It's not. The $12.36 figure in the S-4 assumes that we will continue to repurchase shares in 2021 as a stand-alone company. However, as we have stated, we think that it is unlikely we will resume share repurchases before the merger with IHS Markit closes. Therefore, our 2021 guidance assumes no share repurchases.
The second difference is that the S-4 figures were based on our October internal forecast. Our initial 2021 guidance is based on our most recent internal forecast, which has improved outlook primarily due to increased growth in ACV and our subscription businesses and AUM in our indices business. 
The second question was why the cash flow figures in the S-4 differ from the figures stated on the merger conference call and our normal free cash flow reporting. These are 2 different views of free cash flow. The S-4 provides an unlevered free cash flow forecast typically utilized to value companies via a discounted cash flow analysis. The difference between the unlevered free cash flow in the S-4 and the free cash flow in our guidance and discussed on our merger call is that the S-4 definition includes stock-based compensation expenses and acquisitions and excludes interest payments. 
We're not providing 2021 GAAP guidance. Because given the inherent uncertainty around the merger, management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of GAAP measures. 
This slide depicts our adjusted guidance. While we expect that the merger will occur in the second half of this year, we are providing adjusted guidance on a stand-alone basis: revenue increasing mid-single digits; corporate unallocated expense in the range of $140 million to $150 million, an increase over the $128 million in 2020 due to some expected normalization of pandemic-related cost savings; deal-related amortization of $95 million to $100 million, a decrease from the $123 million in 2020 as certain assets have been fully amortized; operating profit margin in a range of 53.8% to 54.3%, which is 50 to 100 basis points higher than in 2020; interest expense net, which includes both interest income and interest expense in the range of $120 million to $125 million. This is lower than the $141 million in 2020 due to the recent refinancing of a large portion of our outstanding debt. 
A tax rate in the range of 21.5% to 22.5%, which is consistent with the 21.5% reported in 2020; diluted EPS in a range of $12.25 to $12.45, a 5% to 7% increase over 2020. While this growth rate might seem modest, it is 29% to 31% higher than our 2019 EPS. That's an average of about 15% per year. We just happened to achieve most of this increase in 2020. Also, keep in mind that these figures assume no share repurchases in 2021. And finally, free cash flow generation in a range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion, which is flat to up $100 million compared to 2020 due to improved business performance, partially offset by normalizing cash collections following a strong year with record low delinquencies in 2020. In addition to the slides that we have reviewed on this call, there is an appendix with additional fourth quarter slides that can be downloaded from the Investor Presentation section of the Investor Relations website.
In conclusion, 2020 was a very strong year for S&P Global. Despite the recession, all of our businesses grew revenue, and we improved our adjusted operating margin by 310 basis points. Year after year, we have demonstrated our ability to grow revenue and adjusted operating margin, and we don't believe that we are close to being done. We remain encouraged about our future and have just introduced 2021 adjusted guidance that reflects our optimism.
Finally, I wanted to echo Doug's comments about our employees. They continue to perform at an exceptional level in difficult circumstances. And Doug, myself and the rest of the leadership team applaud their tenacity and innovativeness. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

We've also seen a lot of excitement from the people that are interested in ESG. Our employees are also very excited about that. We know each other. We had worked together before between our index business. Their fixed income index business and our index business, people know each other there. We've had great respect for Lance and for the team at IHS Markit. And so there's excitement across the board, and we see things very positive. 
One final comment. As you saw in the slide, we talked about parallel paths. One of those is integration planning. So our teams have started to get to know each other through the integration work that we're planning for. And again, there's a lot of respect for each of the teams and a lot of progress being made there."

On the other hand, IHS Markit also has very powerful tools, which include workflow for financial institutions and for corporate and asset management industry, et cetera. So getting those 2 together is going to allow us to have a much more comprehensive strategy, both looking at the value that we bring, which you talk about as a price strategy, but I think of more as a value strategy that expands that, and then also ability to bring much more -- many more products and services to all of the different kinds of customers that we serve."

As we have said many times about the Ratings business, it doesn't always rain everywhere at the same time. So there are always components that are going up and several other components that are going down. But in aggregate, the outlook for Ratings looks always quite constructive. 
For 2021, overall, from a revenue perspective, we expect low- to mid-single-digit growth for Ratings. And that is particularly helped by nontransaction revenue. Nontransaction revenue, we're currently estimating to grow at a mid- to high single-digit level in 2021. That is being helped by higher surveillance fees based on more bonds outstanding based on the issuance levels last year; frequent issuer programs; Rating Evaluation Services, which we expect to continue to be helped by the M&A environment. 
And then in terms of a mix, there's always some elements that are going up and down. And then in addition to that, we should also see some benefit from new products. So overall, I think a very constructive outlook for Ratings. And again, overall, from a revenue perspective for the full year, low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth."

Think, for example, about the current period where the shareholders' vote is underway. So we would not be able to do share buybacks until the shareholders' meeting on March 11. 
Of course, we have also closed windows with respect to our quarterly results. And then we should not be in possession of material nonpublic information. So a combination of those elements might make the windows that we can do buybacks quite limited. And therefore, we think it is unlikely we can do buybacks. But if there is an opportunity, and from a legal perspective we should be clear, we definitely would like to restart some of the buybacks. 
Otherwise, we will do that post close of the merger. There's definitely going to be, at that point in time, some catch-up buybacks because, of course, we're falling short towards our return targets at this point in time. And then as we have stated at the merger call, in terms of our new financial targets, we're expecting to return at least 85% of free cash flow going forward for the combined company. And the combined company from a free cash flow perspective should have a very strong profile north of $4 billion out of the gate in terms of free cash flow and growing to about $5 billion or north of $5 billion in a few years' time. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we will have a very robust balance sheet in the future with a leverage ratio in a range of 2% to 2.5%. Of course, we'll have some minimum cash. But absolutely, we have currently excess cash, surplus cash that we will return to shareholders once we have the opportunity to do so."

When we think about the data that IHS Markit brings, just as an example, there's 50,000 customers in 140 countries. They're serving 80% of the global Fortune 500; 94 of the largest companies in the U.S.; and then on top of that, with the pricing data, the reference data, the private market solutions, the fixed income benchmarks and indices. And then all of that put together in a comprehensive data strategy with the Data Lake, that's going to give us an ability to take the Kensho capabilities and develop all types of new products and services.
If you think about that, though, in addition, IHS Markit also brings its own high-quality data sciences teams. And across S&P Global, we also have other high-quality data sciences team.

We have a process around that. I'm going to hand that off to Ewout to talk more about that. 
But what's important for us is that we are managing the company for the long run. We think that there are opportunities for us to continue to grow in the Ratings business and Platts, Market Intelligence and indices very specifically with the capabilities that we have today; expanding into new markets, like we've mentioned, Asia or China; new product capabilities or customer experience that we think are very important to continue with our differentiation that drives our growth. So we're committed to all of those organic investments that we see internally and to keep driving those.
But as I just mentioned, there's also so many possibilities of bringing the 2 companies together. It's too early for us to plan those. As Ewout mentioned, we're 2 separate companies. We're managed separately. But we can start dimensioning those and working together to identify what those could be.

And we're looking at all the growth initiatives that are being put forward. These are initiatives that should drive revenue growth going forward and should have a minimum level of investments because we don't want to look at all the small investments. So these should be larger growth initiatives for the company that should help with revenue growth in the future. 
And we make selections which of those are the most interesting, where we would allocate our resources. It's not only financial resources, more often, of course, product development resources, technology resources might be limiting factors there as well. And then ultimately, we allocate funding to those initiatives. 
And we are very encouraged about the growth of those initiatives. As Doug has mentioned during the prepared remarks, we have seen a lot of product launches in 2020. We are seeing good traction of those initiatives. So we're very encouraged at the level of innovation and new business development that we're having within the company. And we're continuing with that as well in 2021.
Please keep in mind that although the overall investment number is dropping, it doesn't mean that those costs are going away because after 2 years, when an initiative is funded for a period of 2 years, it goes to a business-as-usual situation, and those costs will become part of the normal business-as-usual budget of the division. 
So it is not really a total expense drop. But the investments, the new investments in the first 2 years is going to be about $100 million in 2021. So still, I think a very good number, a strong number. And all of these initiatives from our perspective make sense independently of the merger because they all are good initiatives that will help also the combined company in the future."

As you can see from the growth in the markets, the growth is coming across many, many different types of asset classes, including fixed income and equities, global equities, commodities real estate, et cetera. And so we want to be able to approach all of the different channels that we have with this broader set of capabilities and broader set of indices. And so it's not going to be so much a change in distribution strategy. It's a change in the capabilities and the breadth of the different kinds of products we'll be able to provide."

So Craig, let me start. This is something that we've thought a lot about. And when we were working on this idea with our management team and our Board of Directors, one of the most important questions that I asked, and we had good discussion with the Board is, do we have the capacity to undertake a transaction like this. And that includes our management capacity, our people, our team, our technology. What are the lessons learned we've had? Do we have, in particular, the ability to undertake an integration like this? 
And one of the other questions we asked is, and what kind of talent will IHS Markit bring as well? And as we did our due diligence -- and we already knew the team, but as we got to know them better, we were impressed that they were also going to bring a really high-quality management team that would be complementary to ours. And that together, we could actually undertake something like this.
But one thing that we've done over the past 5 years is we've put in place a very disciplined approach to managing the company. And it starts with an annual plan that we look at with the Board of Directors, we agree on. It then leads to goals and objectives, which feed into our own performance -- individual performance goals as well as our divisional and functional performance goals. Those include areas that are customer, operations, people. So it's not only driven by financial performance. We also include operational targets, which includes risk management targets. 
So we put in place a management system, which we think will be -- work very well with the IHS Markit team. And if we wouldn't have had the confidence that we had that process in place now for many years, that we had been delivering and that we had the capacity to do something like this, and along with the quality of the teams coming along, we would not have undertaken something like this."

But if you just annualize that $451 million you had for nontransaction in Ratings and you apply that for all of next year on a year-over-year basis, that would be up about 11%.

Greenwich Associates has a certain pattern in terms of recognizing revenues and expenses that is mostly in the fourth quarter of every year, given their level of activity. So that's why that difference between organic and reported nontransaction was a bit larger than normally you would see in a particular quarter, but that was driven by that particular acquisition. Therefore, 11% is more what you should look at from an ongoing basis organically. 
And then we said those 1/3 is coming from the revenues coming from -- nontransaction revenues from surveillance and another 1/3 from Rating Evaluation Services that we also expect to be strong in 2021. So therefore, the mid- to high single-digit growth outlook for nontransaction this year."

It gives you a superior ability to gather data from the markets and to link it. And so that, again, is something that drives retention.
And another example would be something like we talked before about being able to ingest 11 million new company data from groups like Preqin into our private capital information. And something like that drives the ability for us to have unique data faster than any other organization. 
Another example of that would be something like Market-on-Close in Platts, where we started off with 1 pilot and now we're up to 80 different commodities that are using a new process that gets our information to the market 80% faster.

So bringing these together are going to be something that are really new for us. 
And let me give you a couple of examples. Just imagine if you were a chief sustainability officer. You mentioned the corporate clients. Corporate clients are increasingly, either through their treasurer or directly a sustainability officer, looking at how their own company is going to perform and what is their own individual approach to running their sustainability programs. We're going to have the tools to provide them a rating. We're going to build them -- they're going to have the CSA. We're going to have the ability to provide them with more data to have benchmarking against other third parties.

One thing I would end with is that we just launched a new ESG website. I would recommend that everybody go look at it. You can immediately look for ESG scores of companies on it.

But we do see that this year, there should be a very different mix than we've seen in prior years."

One of them is what I'd call private assets or being able to support the private equity industry. When we originally looked at this, we started looking at areas that were maybe a little bit more obvious, in financial institutions and what we could do for debt capital markets, for corporate treasurers.
One of the areas that I see a lot of upside is in what we call private markets, private equity. Think about how much longer assets are staying private before they go public or the information that people would like to look at for their supply chain. And when you put the 2 companies together, you have tools that at IHS Markit, which -- for valuation, iVAL and Qval. They've got portfolio monitoring tools, iLEVEL. As you've heard me talk about earlier, we've been ingesting data from people like Preqin into our tools. And then we've got the information from 451 Research, from money market directories, our Market Intelligence platform. And you put all these together, and it's going to be a very complete set of services of workflow tools, valuation tools, reference data, fundamental data about corporations that we wouldn't have been able to do alone. And so that's one of the areas that I was quite excited about. I also mentioned what we'll be able to do with ESG. That's another area that's the upside. I think there is higher than what I originally would have thought. 
And then finally, when we look at energy transition, which -- sometimes I think of energy transition as part of ESG. But for climate change and the interest that this is generating, it's not always directly the same thing as ESG. This is another area that between what we've got in Market Intelligence and Ratings, but add that in with what we have between Platts and the resources business at IHS Markit, there's going to be a lot of opportunities in new energy, new energy investments, all of the things that are involved in EV, which also will bring some of the capacities from the Transportation business at IHS Markit. So on energy transition, I think this is also another area that is well beyond what I'd probably originally contemplated."

The resources business of IHS Markit, that is going through a transition from more upstream to more downstream. The upstream business has seen some headwinds and might continue for a shorter period of time. But particularly downstream analytics is doing very well. 
So the opportunities to bring that together and to look at the commercial opportunities for the combined company is actually very attractive. Think about what we can do with respect to metals and mining. Think about what we can do with respect to the analytics platforms, bringing that together for our customers. Think about what we can do with the Data Lake and Platts Analytics growth by unlocking the value of the data of IHS Markit resources. So we're actually very encouraged.

We made a lot of significant progress along the way with areas that we've been investing in over the last few years. 
As you know, we had put in place investment programs. And we started seeing them pay off, as we called it the year of the product launch. And it has to do with our technology, our innovation, productivity programs we put in place. We're very proud about what we're doing in China and the progress and advances that we're making there. 
Our ESG program is starting to really take off, and we think we're very well positioned. And then our own internal environmental performance and social outreach and our own ESG approach, we think, is something that's very important for our company.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the essential nature of our products has demonstrated the resilience of our business model. As the economy improves, our colleagues continue to launch innovative new products to help our customers with the ratings benchmarks, data and insights they need to navigate the recovery. We continue to prioritize the safety of our colleagues, and I want to thank them again for their dedication and commitment in these extremely unusual and challenging times. 
Now let me begin with our first quarter financial highlights. S&P Global is off to a great start in 2021 as we delivered exceptional first quarter results. Revenue increased 13%, and all 4 businesses delivered revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin improvement. Ratings once again delivered the strongest revenue growth from a surge in leveraged loans, high-yield issuance and structured finance. Adjusted expense growth was limited to less than 2%, thanks to our ongoing productivity program and lower T&E. 
It's very rare when we increase guidance on our first quarter earnings call. However, we expect additional growth in Ratings from strong issuance of high-yield and structured finance and in indices from the higher level of AUM and equities. Therefore, we're raising our annual guidance for 2021. Ewout will provide details in a moment. 
I would also like to share some additional highlights from the first quarter. We issued a report highlighting the performance of our Ratings in 2020, which demonstrated that our Ratings showed their value as indicators of creditworthiness and relative default risk. Our investment in growth initiatives continues to result in new product launches, particularly in ESG, Platts benchmarks, Kensho and our Marketplace. Our China Ratings business is gaining momentum, and we just entered into the first sustainability linked banking facility in the U.S. information services space. We'll provide further details on all these accomplishments on today's call. 
The most important initiative of the year will be our upcoming merger with IHS Markit. This is an incredibly transformative opportunity for our company and our customers. The combination of S&P Global and IHS Markit creates a very strong company. We will have increased scale and world-class products across numerous core markets with a track record of deploying cutting-edge technology to accelerate our Powering the Markets of the Future strategy. Together, we can offer our customers differentiated data, analytics, research and benchmarks, important to the workflows of many of the world's leading companies. I'm incredibly proud of the team we've built at S&P Global, and I look forward to welcoming the talented IHS Markit employees to our company. 
There are 3 parallel paths that are underway to close the transaction and prepare for the combination. Our progress is on track, and we continue to expect closing in the second half of 2021. 
The first was shareholder approval. The recent shareholder votes at both companies was overwhelmingly passed with 99% of the votes in favor of the merger. The second is regulatory approval. We're working toward regulatory approval in the countries listed. The third is pre-close integration planning. The integration teams continue to prepare for day 1 readiness. These teams are developing plans that focus on organization integration, real estate consolidation, technology, scale and efficiency, cross-selling and new product development. And the value capture work stream is preparing to pursue and track synergies. We've been doing a lot of work to make sure that when our companies are united, we have the culture, purpose and values in place to position us for success. 
To recap the financial results for the first quarter, revenue increased 13% to $2 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 23% and our adjusted operating profit margin increased 450 basis points to 57.6%. As you know, we measure and track adjusted operating profit margin on a trailing 4-quarter basis, which increased 300 basis points to 54.5%. 
In addition, diluted shares outstanding decreased 1% over last year, contributing to a 24% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. Each quarter, we highlight a few key drivers to our business and important projects underway. This quarter, let me start with Ratings' bond issuance trends. 
During the first quarter, global bond issuance increased 9%. Turning to the data. In the U.S., bond issuance in aggregate increased 4% as investment grade decreased 17%. High yield increased 111%. Public finance increased 9% and structured finance increased 17%, mostly due to a 63% increase in CLOs. European bond issuance increased 23% as investment grade increased 22%. High yield increased 53% and structured finance increased 6%, mostly due to more than a tripling of CLO volume. In Asia, bond issuance increased 11% overall. 
The data on this slide only bond issuance. When we include the volumes, overall global issuance increased 13%. Since bank loan ratings are an important element of Ratings revenue, and they're not included in our bond issuance slide, we like to disclose this bank loan rating revenue each quarter. In the first quarter, bank loan rating revenue surged 70% to $148 million. In fact, first quarter revenue from leveraged loans is more than half the leveraged loan revenue in all of 2020. 
The next 2 slides look at the combined high-yield issuance and leveraged loan volume for the U.S. and Europe. Data is not readily available for the rest of the world. This slide shows that over the last 3 years, the combination of global leverage loan and high-yield issuance has averaged $244 billion per quarter. The first quarter of 2021 reached a quarterly record of $465 billion, nearly twice the quarterly average for the past 3 years. 
This slide depicts the combination of high-yield issuance and the [indiscernible]. The category with the largest increase was refinancing, some of which could include pull forward. M&A and LBO activity and buybacks and dividends also increased. 
The CLO market had the busiest quarter on record in both the U.S. and Europe, with twice the volume of new issuances in the first quarter of last year. We believe that investor demand for floating rate instruments, their search for yield and the relatively strong CLO performance during 2020 pandemic have contributed to increased CLO issuance this year. 
While it's exciting to see increases in issuance, what's always more important to us is how our ratings perform. 2020 was a tumultuous year, yet our ratings performed as designed. In February, S&P Global Ratings issued a report entitled Credit Trend review of ratings performance highlights resilience in 2020. We pulled this chart from the report. You can see that the level of results were in line with the main quarter of the ratings with lower-rated issuers having higher levels of default. You will notice that the graph only includes high-yield issuers. This is because in 2020, not one single issuer that was rated investment grade by S&P Ratings at the beginning of 2020 defaulted. Importantly, amid challenging economic circumstances our ratings in 2020 showed their values indicators of creditworthiness and relative to fault risk. 
Turning to our investments in growth initiatives. Let me start with ESG. We continue to make advances with our ESG franchise across the board. After recording ESG revenue of $65 million in 2020, we're off to a good start in the first quarter with revenue up more than 40% to $21 million. 
In Ratings, in the first quarter, we completed 18 ESG evaluations, 6 green evaluations and 53 SAM benchmark engagements. This compares to 40 ESG evaluations, [indiscernible] evaluations, [ 76 ] engagements completed in all of 2020. We also launched new social and sustainability framework alignment opinions. 
In Market Intelligence, our ESG scores have been enhanced. 400 data points have been made available for each company that we score. The additional data points will provide clients with a better understanding of company's environmental reporting disclosures, biodiversity commitments, CO2 and greenhouse emissions, waste and hazardous disposal, energy consumption and water usage. For the social dimension, it will now be possible to determine whether companies disclose safety policies, human rights commitments, code of ethics and whether social reporting disclosures have been independently audited. The new data sets will also provide greater insights on the governance and economic dimensions and help obtain better understanding of companies' code of conduct and policies addressing anti-crime. corruption and bribery governance of the Board and executive compensation ownership, reality disclosures, risk and supply chain management and tax strategy and reporting. 
Market Intelligence also launched an ESG data solution to support the European Commission's sustainable finance disclosure requirements, enabling market participants to meet these disclosure requirements. 
In indices, we had $22.9 billion of ESG ETF AUM at the end of the first quarter. This is an increase of more than 400% since the end of the first quarter of last year. Our indices business also launched ESG versions of our S&P MidCap 400 and S&P Small Cap 600 indices. In addition, UBS licensed the S&P 500 ESG Elite Index for new ETF, and Barclays licensed the S&P Euro USA 50 Low Carbon ESG Select Equal Weight Index for use in structured products. 
Platts has been very active as well as a launch of assessment and carbon credit [indiscernible] . You may be wondering why we include a copper assessment is in the ESG product. It's because this new assessment will help support the need for increased solar, wind, energy storage systems, electric vehicle and EV charging stations, all of which require large amounts of copper. For example, an electric vehicle uses approximately 175 pounds of copper. 
Platts also launched hydro-treated vegetable oil price assessments. HVO, also known as renewable diesel in America, is a biomass-derived fuel suitable for diesel engines. It is made of nonpetroleum renewable resources such as natural fat, vegetable oil and greases and can be blended in traditional diesel or used as a substitute. 
And finally, Platts launched daily assessments for low-carbon aluminum and zero carbon aluminum which will complement existing Platts European price offerings for high-grade primary aluminum. These prices are [indiscernible] quantified cost and manage risk for the opportunities associated with a growing focus on carbon reduction strategies amid increasing global regulation. 
On Earth Day last week, S&P Global launched a new ESG brand, Sustainable One, your single source of essential sustainability intelligence. With the wide array of ESG capabilities that we have and the fact that many of our customers are interested in multiple products from different divisions, we have unified our ESG efforts across the company. This includes product development, technology, channel partnerships, distribution, marketing, sales and client support. We believe that this new brand will help convey S&P Global's commitment and leadership position in ESG. 
Outside of ESG, let me highlight a few other new product launches and product enhancements. We launched Kensho Nerd, short for name, entity recognition and disambiguation. Nerd was developed by the company's natural language processing team, which specializes in machine learning research and engineering related to analyzing and understanding human language. This is the first entity extraction system specifically optimized for business-related documents. Nerd makes it easier for users to analyze unstructured text, for example, investigating suppliers and competitors mentioned in company filings; and enables them to drill down instantaneously to the documents they need to see. 
We launched the S&P -- 5 Index, which is designed to measure the performance of a multi-asset risk parity strategy with a 5% target volatility. The index allocates risk equally among 7 equity, fixed income and commodity indices and further mitigates equity market volatility by dynamically allocating to S&P VIX future indices. 
With about 100 different data sets available on the Marketplace we launched last year, we created product finder to help clients find what they're looking for based on their job function, topic, use case and workflow. For example, someone working in investment banking and deal origination can receive different results from a search than a corporate client in a supply chain role. 
Platts expanded its presence in shipping with the new APSI 5 Dry Bulk Weighted Index for Supramax class bulkers. APSI 5 is the dry bulk freight market's first regional weighted average index, capturing the Asia Pacific trade on Supramax bulkers. This product continues to fill out our shipping products. 
One of the most important aspects of managing benchmarks is to ensure that they are periodically updated to reflect underlying market conditions. When streams of oil benchmark become depleted, they need to be replaced. After consulting with market participants, Platts is progressing work to add West Texas Intermediate Midland as an additional stream to Dated Brent. Since the 1980s, Dated Brent as active as the benchmark for and is currently used to price approximately 60% of global waterborne crude. This change will provide significant additional volume and ensure the continued robustness of the Brent complex. 
Let me now turn to our outlook for global issuance and GDP. After issuance growth of 15% in 2019 and 17% in 2020, our Ratings Research Group initial 2021 forecast called for a decrease of 3%. The updated forecast issued earlier this week now calls for a decrease of 2%, excluding international public finance. There were 2 changes. Structured Finance went from a 3% gain to a 6% gain and nonfinancials went from a 9% decrease to a 7.5% decrease. Please note that this is a bond issuance forecast. This is not a revenue forecast. For example, it doesn't address non-transaction revenue and doesn't include leveraged loan activity. 
There are clearly puts and takes when we think about 2021 issuance. For example, the bulk of the first quarter's corporate issuance came from repeat issuers who may have exhausted their funding needs early this year on the anticipation of rising rates. However, there are several items that should support upcoming issuance, including a rebound in economic growth, very favorable financing conditions, large amounts of sovereign debt with negative yields and a growing pipeline of pending M&A deals. 
We have revised our 2021 global GDP growth forecast, up by 50 basis points to 5.5%. The economic recovery looks set to accelerate in mid-2021, particularly in the U.S. on back of a massive fiscal stimulus plan, although a high degree of unevenness and uncertainty persists. At issue is the pace of vaccinations in the spread of virus variants. The U.S. and U.K. have taken the lead in vaccinations. A slow rollout is hampering the rebound in Europe, and we expect slow vaccination rollouts to cause the recovery in several key emerging markets to lag. 
Our economists view orderly reflation as a positive development for both the economy and credit. We also believe that rising yields on the back of a robust recovery is a positive as opposed to rising yields solely on inflation concern, moving away from very low rates lessens the search for yield and lessens distortions to financial and nonfinancial asset prices. And finally, Platts is forecasting that oil will remain above $60 a barrel through 2022. This bodes well for the health of the oil industry. 
I will now turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?"

Doug covered the highlights of strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. I will take a moment to cover a few other items. 
While there were some acquisitions and divestitures since the first quarter of 2020, the revenue associated with them was not large enough to result in a difference between reported and organic revenue growth. Adjusted total expenses only increased 2%, thanks to ongoing productivity programs and lower T&E. Keep in mind that while T&E remains almost nonexistent, the year-over-year benefits will no longer exist beginning in the second quarter. 
The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation and an increase in taxes on foreign operations. While the effective tax rate fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of discrete tax adjustments, our full year tax rate guidance remains unchanged. 
Our diluted shares outstanding declined by 1.7 million shares. This was the result of shares repurchased before we put the share repurchase programs due to the pending merger. 
During the quarter, changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact on adjusted EPS of $0.03. The only meaningful impact was in Ratings, where adjusted operating profit was positively impacted by $9 million. 
We are introducing 3 new categories to provide insight into the type of expenses that are going to be incurred related to the pending merger. The first category is transaction cost, These are costs related to completing the merger. They include legal fees, investment banking fees and filing fees. The second category is integration costs, These are costs to operationalize the integration. They include consulting, infrastructure and retention cost. The third category is cost to achieve. These are costs needed to enable expense and revenue synergies. They include lease terminations, severance, contract exit fees and costs related to product development, marketing and distribution enhancements. 
In the first quarter, the non-GAAP adjustments collectively totaled to a net pretax loss of $81 million. They included $9 million for merger transaction costs, $40 million from merger integration costs. There were no merger cost to achieve this quarter, these will begin to occur around the closing of the merger, a $2 million gain for an adjustment on the prior year period divestiture, $2 million for Kensho retention-related expenses and $31 million in deal-related amortization. 
This quarter, all 4 divisions delivered increased revenue and adjusted operating profit. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted operating profit margin increased significantly in Ratings, Platts and Market Intelligence, while indices had a small decrease. I will provide color on the individual business results in a moment. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet has low leverage and ample liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $4.5 billion, debt of $4.1 billion, an undrawn revolver capacity of $1.5 billion and no commercial paper outstanding. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA improved since the end of last year to 1.8x. 
We recently entered into the first sustainability-linked banking facility in the U.S. information services sector, linking our line of credit to our emission reduction targets verified by the Science Based Targets Initiative is another tangible example of our commitment to becoming net zero by 2040. 
Free cash flow, excluding certain items, was [ $780 million ] in the first quarter, an increase of $100 million or 16% over the prior year period. Due to the pending merger with IHS Markit, share repurchases have been curtailed. If there is an open window and we have an opportunity, we will repurchase shares before the merger closes. If not, we anticipate resuming share repurchases after the merger is completed. 
Now let's turn to the division results. Ratings revenue increased 23%. This revenue growth was driven by the increase in issuance Doug already discussed. Adjusted expenses increased 9%. And excluding changes in foreign exchange rates and the acquisition of Greenwich Associates by CRISIL, adjusted expenses increased 5%, primarily due to increased salary and incentives, partially offset by lower T&E. These resulted in a 32% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 440 basis point increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 340 basis points to 63.6%. Please keep in mind that the 67.5% adjusted segment operating profit margin achieved in the first quarter is temporarily elevated based on the surge of issuance in high-yield, levered loans and structured finance. 
In China, we see momentum and interest in our ratings picking up. In fact, we completed 18 ratings in the first quarter compared to 22 in all last year. Normal transaction revenue increased 10%, primarily due to growth at CRISIL, fees associated with surveillance as well as elevated new entity ratings and Ratings Evaluation Services activity. Notably, revenue from Ratings Evaluation Services and new entity ratings each increased approximately 30%. In fact, there were 217 new entity ratings this quarter, the highest quarterly total in over 2 years. This was due to investors' quest for yield and increased risk appetite, enabling increasingly weaker credits to raise debt. Transaction revenue increased 35% primarily due to substantial levels of high-yield issuance, bank loan ratings and structured finance. 
This slide depicts Ratings revenue by the end markets. The largest contributor to the increase in Ratings revenue was a 27% increase in corporates. In addition, financial services revenue increased 10%. Structured finance increased 34%. Governments increased 18%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 8%. On the right side of the slide, you can see the changes in revenue within structured finance. A clear driver of growth was a 70% increase in CLO revenue. 
Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The segment delivered 4% revenue growth primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices and data subscriptions substantially offset by reduced exchange-traded derivative activity. In the first quarter, adjusted expenses only increased 2%. This was particularly low as the first quarter of 2020 had elevated expenses, including a $4 million catch-up charge on past royalties. The adjusted segment operating profit increased 5%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 70 basis points to 71.3%. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 69.3%. 
Revenue growth was mixed this quarter. Asset-linked fees increased 15% with gains in ETFs, mutual funds and insurance and over-the-counter derivative activity. Exchange-traded derivative revenue decreased 24% on reduced trading volumes. The first quarter of last year saw extraordinary volatility related to the pandemic market collection, creating a very difficult comparison. Data and custom subscriptions only increased 1% due to a catch-up in real-time customer reporting in the first quarter last year. 
For our indices division, over the past year, ETF net inflows were $125 billion and market appreciation totaled $749 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.2 trillion, which is 65% higher compared to 1 year ago when the market was near its pandemic low. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 30% year-over-year. Sequentially versus the end of 2020, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $73 billion and market appreciation totaled $143 billion. 
As I just noted, exchange-rated derivative revenue faced a difficult comparison. Activity at the CBOE decreased in the first quarter with S&P 500 Index options activity decreasing 29% and fixed futures and options activity decreasing 23%. Activity at the CME equity complex decreased 6%. 
Market Intelligence delivered reported and organic revenue growth of 4%. Collectively, revenue from recently launched products increased by over 40%. This was primarily from ESG, Panjiva aftermarket research, marketplace and SME data. Adjusted expenses were flat as recent productivity initiatives and lower T&E offset salary growth and higher investment spending. Investment spending continues, particularly with the Marketplace and SME initiatives. 
Adjusted segment operating profit increased 13% and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 260 basis points to 33.5%. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 120 basis points to 33.1%. 
Looking across the Market Intelligence components, Desktop revenue grew 2%. Data Management Solutions revenue grew 9% and Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 6%. Based on our ACV trends, we expect Desktop to grow low to mid-single digits for the full year and both Data Management Solutions and Credit Risk Solutions to grow high single digit this year. 
And now turning to Platts. Reported revenue increased 5%. Our core subscriptions increased 6%. Over the past year, oil prices have increased, resulting in a customer base that is healthier and our retention rates remain in the mid-90s. Global Trading Services decreased 4% and compared to a very strong first quarter of 2020. GTS revenue decreased mainly due to lower petroleum and natural gas volumes partially offset by increased LNG volume. Adjusted expenses improved 7% due to lower T&E, rent and bad debt provision. Please note that we expect expenses to pick up in the second quarter as Platts investment spending increases. Adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 520 basis points to 58.1%. The trailing 4-quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 280 basis points to 56%. 
On our first quarter earnings call last year, Doug noted that the first ever Kensho-powered price assessments went live. One year later, we now have 19 markets that have Kensho-powered price assessments. This has resulted in more than a 75% reduction in publishing time. 
This quarter, because shipping has increasingly become an important product offering for Platts customers, we're introducing shipping as a new category. Shipping is essential to commodities trading with 90% of global trade transported by sea. S&P Global Platts has been in the business of providing transparency to the shipping market for more than 35 years. These assessments are used by market participants for physical benchmarking and 5 are listed by exchanges as the basis of derivative contracts. 
In 2014, Platts expanded its freight offering into the dry freight market with daily assessment of freight rates for key commodity trade routes for products such as iron ore, coal, grains, sugar, bauxite and alumina. Platts now publishes hundreds of daily freight rate assessments covering all major shipping markets. 
To help you with your models, we have provided historical quarterly information on the new reporting basis in the appendix of this slide deck. And finally, while every category on this slide grew revenue during the quarter, the fastest growth was in petrochemicals. 
We're not providing 2021 GAAP guidance because given the inherent uncertainty around the merger, management cannot reliably predict all the necessary components of GAAP measures. And this slide depicts our adjusted guidance. While we expect that the merger will occur in the second half of this year, we're providing adjusted guidance on a stand-alone basis. The second column shows our new 2021 adjusted guidance with all the line items that James highlighted. We're making these changes because we now have expectations for greater revenue growth primarily due to improved outlooks in Ratings and indices. While we expect greater revenue growth, it's not enough to change our revenue guidance. Therefore, our revenue guidance remains a mid-single-digit increase. Operating profit margin has increased by 20 basis points to a range of 54% to 54.5%, and this results in a $0.30 increase in adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a new range of $12.55 to $12.75. And finally, free cash flow generation has been increased by $100 million to a range of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion. 
In conclusion, we're off to a great start to 2021 with exceptional first quarter results. Vaccinations are rolling out. The global economy is poised for accelerated growth, and our customers are benefiting from these improvements. During this pandemic, we have been working hard to ensure the safety of our employees, and I want to end by thanking them for their perseverance, creativity and passion and by thanking all of you for your continued investment in S&P Global. 
And with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

Definitely, the way we look at our current cash balances is that this is temporarily elevated. We are thinking about the following in terms of what we are planning to do going forward. First of all, once we have an open window, The likelihood is low that the open window will be before the merger will close. So that means after the merger closed, more likely. 
What we will do is, first, we have an opportunity to catch up with respect to our capital return  targets from the last few quarters because clearly, we have not been able to deliver on those targets given these limitations. And then going forward, we have the new capital return target of at least 85%. So what you may expect is a kind of a catch-up after the merger will close and then ongoing an increased level of capital return to our shareholders. I can't give you exact numbers and amounts, so I can't quantify this for you. But philosophically, this is the direction of our thinking."

And therefore, the period-over-period a differential looked relatively small with a growth of just 1%. Strategically, this is definitely an area we would like to grow. So the 1% is unusually low and should not be the basis what to expect going forward. We should expect much higher growth from data and custom subscriptions. And we would like to grow this because we think it's a good balance in the overall revenue mix for the index business, where we have, as you know, fees over assets under management. We have the derivative trading fees and recurring revenue. Subscription-like revenues in the index business is definitely an area we will grow as well, so unusually low at 1% and the expectation should be much higher growth going forward."

Well, first of all, as you know, we saw a very strong increase in results in the first quarter, just to give you a few numbers to put them in context. As an example, investment grade in the U.S. was down 17%, and you think about that being down 17%. At the same time, investment grade in Europe was up 22%. High yield in the U.S. was up 111%. High yield in Europe was up 53%. Structured finance globally was up 5% but a couple of tidbits there. In the U.S., CLOs were up 63%, and in Europe, CLOs were up 300%. And bank loans were also up 70% as well. So you could see a mix of different aspects of what we're up and what we're down. 
We think that in the investment grade, both in the U.S. and Europe, that there probably wasn't necessarily pull forward, to use that phrase, because you saw the 17% down in the U.S. but there was definitely an interest in investment -- noninvestment-grade issuers as well as structured finance to look at the -- what they believe is going to be upcoming economic growth. Rates and spreads have been quite attractive. Spreads are at an all-time historical low, in some cases, or lows over the last 2 or 3 years. And there's also potentially some expectations that inflation starts coming in the market that interest rates will start going up again. 
But as you know, in our forecast that we just gave you, we saw at the original forecast that the corporates would be down about 9%. We now see them down about 7.5% for the forecast for the year. Financial services that originally were going to be up about 5%, we see them now up around 4%. It hasn't changed that much. Structured finance is where we saw a bigger swing, originally up 3% and up now about 6%. So when you look at the total, we had originally forecasted that the issuance for 2021 would be down about 3%, and now we think it's going to be about down about 2%. As I started off, it's always hard to tell what pull forward is and what's coming in this pull forward, but it's possible that there could have been some in the high-yield space, in particular."

We know that it always takes a big time to see the revenue ramp up. And of course, from an overall basis, These numbers are still relatively small. But think about the data marketplace is doing very well, and we see very nice growth. Actually, the revenues in the first quarter were more or less the same of the total revenues we booked over the full year 2020. The same applies for SME, ESG, private company data. So overall, I think, is clearly very, very good initiatives, and we see a lot of traction.

But let me give you a quick update on ratings. Last year, we had 22 ratings that were issued in the full year of 2020. And this year, in the first quarter alone, we issued 18 ratings. We believe that the market participants are really interested and increasingly interested in the quality of the ratings themselves, the underlying ratings. As I've talked about over time, we've assembled a very, very strong team. The market is building up over time. We see that the market has started attracting more offshore investors as well as the foreign banks that are coming in with their wholly owned or controlled subsidiaries, which is bringing new capital and new approach to the markets. 
But what we're out doing is educating the market. We're doing literally hundreds of meetings a week. And when we have seminars or events when we've rolled out some new research, we're getting thousands of people joining that. One thing that I'm very pleased with is that, in addition to having such a strong team is that the ratings that we've done when you look over the last 2 years, We've now rated financial structured products, our first nonfinancial corporation and the breadth of our ratings goes from AAA to BBB, We're getting a lot of really good attention, a lot of high traction to our websites, et cetera.

The following year is also going to be quite strong because those other markets that haven't had the vaccinations yet will continue to improve as well. So global growth over the next couple of years in the 4% to 5% range, which bode well for our businesses. 
One of the biggest trends we look at is -- what we talk about is as markets become capital markets around the world. And the question we just had about China is an important one for us as China savers move from just investing in real estate to putting money into financial assets into pension insurance and savings program. As foreign investors move into China, we're seeing a much more advanced capital markets. The European trends over the last couple of years, we've always talked about them but they've been very strong the last couple of years, and we've seen them incredibly strong in the last couple of quarters of becoming more like capital markets. 
Now one final comment. When we take a step back and we think about our strategy that's called Powering the Markets of the Future, it allows us to take all of the different capabilities of S&P Global, whether it's the rating agency, it's the index business. And now when we think about the addition of the IHS Markit capabilities, we'll have -- right now, we'll move from up to 76% of our business will be coming from subscription or subscription-like recurring revenue services. that will give us some stability as we head into potentially high-growth markets over the next couple of years, but as well any sort of choppiness that could come from either fiscal policy or coming out of the very low interest rate environment, et cetera. But we watch very carefully the external environment. We think our businesses are well prepared to support of financial markets and our customers. And we always then incorporate that into our planning of where we invest and how we set up our budgets."

This time, they did. We look at a few of the key factors which drove that. Clearly, there is a lot of capital chasing deals. We see that the M&A pipeline has increased to a level which is -- it's not quite historic but it's getting there. And there's a lot of M&A pipeline that is out there. It's from a combination of private equity firms, strategic investments as well as the SPACs. And that brings along with it revenue for us, which is not just an issuance revenue from loans and from high-yield bonds. We also see from new issuer fees as well as Ratings Evaluation Services that comes from that kind of a pipeline. But we see going forward this year, as I mentioned earlier, the overall corporate sector, we think, is going to be down with the investment-grade issuers not being very active in the market, especially in the U.S. And with the high-yield probably leveling out, we don't know exactly what's going to happen with rates and spreads. But you're right that they do usually move in opposite directions. 
There's one other point I want to make. There has been demand for loans from investors that are looking for potential increase in interest rates. You saw that the 10-year yield had started climbing over the last 3 or 4 months. And so there's a lot of demand from investors for loans which are floating rate They want to, in a sense, kind of hedge their interest rate exposure and have floating rate exposure. So it's embedded in our outlook for the rest of the year and are -- as well as our What we see is our forecast for issuance. But you're right that they don't always move lockstep in this quarter, they did."

And it's -- as we call it, it's your single source of essential sustainability intelligence. Across all of S&P Global, we're now coordinating our ESG initiatives, and we have over 500 people that are dedicated full time to this. 
But to dig a little bit deeper into what you mentioned about Platts, Platts is building up an expertise and energy transition as well as transportation that you heard us talk about shipping a few minutes ago. And when it comes to energy transition, you think about the move from coal to renewables as maybe the ends of the spectrum. But in between, there is a whole new set of opportunities for Platts to be looking at, many of them were already in. Hydrogen is an example. We have a hydrogen benchmark. We're the first one with a hydrogen benchmark. There is something called clean oil. There's clean natural gas. What that means is that clean oil has had the entire value chain of the delivery of that oil has been rebuilt to ensure that you can capture all of the methane, that there's no leakage along the way. So there's ways that refineries are run, that storage systems and pipelines are run. And we're able to provide the research and the data and the analytics and the benchmarks against something like clean oil. 
We also -- in Platts, we mentioned earlier on the call about copper. There's a whole set of new metals which are quite important to the energy transition, As an example, copper, which there's 175 pounds at least of copper in an electric vehicle. You also have lithium in the batteries So these are areas where we also see a lot of opportunities for the benchmarks to be used from a combination of new power grids from the metals that are in them from the clean energy that is going to be clean transition energy. 
Finally, I'd like to mention that with the merger with IHS Markit, they also bring along a set of new products and services that bringing together will strengthen our ESG franchise at IHS Markit, they have additional research that comes from their transportation business, which is going to be quite valuable for the Platts business and the energy transition. They also have a carbon registry. They've got a set of other carbon research products and then generally, other research and news on energy transition and ESG, which are going to be quite valuable to us. So we think we're very well positioned. We've just launched the Sustainable One brand. We have an organization in place with over 500 people, and we're ready to really start growing."

They're talking about climate and they're talking about ESG. And we see that there is a need for people to have clear, simple, concise, comparable, consistent data and analytics around climate around ESG. As you know, we did an acquisition of Trucost about 3.5 years ago, and it brought to us the premier set of data and analytics around carbon, around climate, around physical risk as well as waste, water and other types of analytical information. We also have physical risk. We have SDGs, sustainable development goals. as ways that we can do analytics on that. 
But going to your -- the first part of your question, we just announced an agreement with State Street, where we're providing them information from true cost that can be embedded in all of their modeling. All of their clients will be able to use that intelligence and that risk information and build it into State Street's existing client-focused ESG services. State Street has about $40 trillion of clients of assets under management that their clients hold So we're going to be able to be providing that functionality. What it does is it allows those clients to have access to the carbon footprint and other environmental data that will map to their portfolios. 
As you know, a lot of organizations are increasingly using the task force-related climate-related financial disclosure reporting. And you can take the Trucost data that carbon is earning at risk, the Paris alignment, the physical risk data, the general carbon information and build it right into that kind of modeling. So we're very pleased with that partnership with State Street.

It's on everyone's minds that we needed to do some specific research around crypto. And one of the groups where we can do that where there's a lot of relevance is within the index business. 
So this actually goes back for more than just the last few weeks or last few quarters. We've been researching crypto for a while and hadn't felt that it had the  seriousness and the ability to be hedged, the ability for crypto to be really understood, to be traded to have the liquidity in it. It was quite speculative, and we had not launched any products up until now. We haven't launched any products yet; we're close to. But because crypto is becoming more mainstream, it's beyond just Bitcoin there's many other sources -- you can trade them on other exchanges. There are some companies now that have been listed that are crypto companies that have the standards of being a listed company. You've got some of the exchanges have started having futures and forwards. You're starting to see some of the conditions that would allow us to develop some products. 
As of now, our revenue model would be similar to the revenue model we have on other indices, which would either be AUM-based fees. or it would come from data that we would sell to the markets that could use the data from a product or an index like that. But an area that's quite promising, but it's really -- it's starting at 0. So I can't give you much of a projection of what the revenue might look like because it's starting so low but something that we feel like we need to be understanding and learning and building into our portfolio of products."

IHS Markit also has been expanding margin. And you've given us post-deal synergy targets. But I guess my question is did the expense synergy targets incorporate running similar productivity programs that you've run at S&P in recent years at IHS post close? Or would those types of productivity programs be incremental to the targets that you've provided? And if so, does it appear to be a significant opportunity for you?"

And first of all, welcome to the call, and thank you for initiating your coverage of S&P Global. We're very pleased with that. With respect to your question about our expense management philosophy, first of all, both companies today already have philosophies in place. As you know, we have our productivity program on the S&P Global side, where we're aiming now at the $120 million cost takeout. And IHS Markit is having a particular target with respect to margin expansion of 100 basis points on an annual basis. 
What we are planning to do once we bring the 2 companies together is to, of course, focus on the overall expense synergies that we have mentioned to you before. That's going to be a large program. In order to achieve that, that's a period of 2 to 3 years that we are fully able to achieve those expense synergies, although the ramp-up will go fast. We are probably in year 2 at a level of 80% of the expense synergies. 
But philosophically, on top of that, you may expect us to continue to look at opportunities where we find scale across all of the different divisions that we'll have going forward. As you know, we are in a business where scale really matters particularly with all the technology investments that are needed, and we have an opportunity to leverage that across the company. We also will continue to benefit from operating leverage, just the benefit of growing the top line faster then your expense line. The incremental margin on the next dollar of revenue that comes into the company should always be higher than your average margin because you don't have your fixed cost that you need to cover anymore. So philosophically, may expect us to continue to be very focused on taking benefit of efficiencies and skills on top of all the existing programs and commitments that we already have in place."

As you mentioned, very healthy revenue development during the quarter. If you think about the recurring part, the subscription part of the business, it was growing 6%, a little bit held back by the Global Trading Services. But that is understandable because Global Trading Services was really elevated in the first quarter of last year. a little bit similar to the ETDs within the index business. When the markets show a lot of volatility, there's a lot of trading hedging that is happening And the hedge programs are helping the GTS revenues to go up. But if you look at it in perspective, GTS was, in fact, higher on a stand-alone basis this quarter than the last 3 quarters itself. So nothing from our perspective that we look at GTS that we think that, that wouldn't be helpful going forward. It's just that the comp 1 year ago was so high. 
So all in all, if you put it together, we see healthy developments, good retention rates in the mid-90s, good commercial activity. The book of business that is building up well, we like that. That  ACV and subscription level is at that 6-ish percent at the moment. So overall, mid-single digits is the outlook for Platts for this year in terms of revenue growth. But overall, incrementally, we are definitely positive on the outlook of this business given where are the commodities markets and the health of the customer base as well."

And now you've broken out shipping, which is another potentially fast growth area.

The way we look at it is that what's critical for us is to be the most relevant benchmark research, analytics, news organization for commodity solutions, We think about it, as you just described, the peak oil is going to be a while away. People still forecast that could be 8, 10, 15, sometimes people say even 20 years away. It depends a little bit on some of the programs around the world for energy transition and climate change. But when we look at that, we believe that there will be a lot of different types of services and commodities that are going to be taking the place of what is today oil that's used in transportation and manufacturing, et cetera. 
So that's one of the reasons we've invested in our ESG products and services. We also look at power grids. We're looking at renewable energy, at power generation. As you've heard us over time, we've also expanded into agriculture. We've looked at metals and mining. So we think that there's 2 aspects to this. One of them is the diversification, generally speaking, of taking the expertise we have in commodities and expanding that to other commodity classes. And we hope that, that brings us growth over time. And then the second is filling the gap of the needs of what's going to happen in climate and energy transition and moving very rapidly and aggressively all of the spaces that will be the opportunities there like carbon registries, carbon pricing, hydrogen, et cetera. So it's kind of 2 different angles. on the same way. It's the growth horizontally and then it's filling the space for all of the opportunities related to ESG."

When you look at our overall program for the integration with IHS Markit, there is a major emphasis on technology transition, and there's a few different categories. 
The first is what I would start with that relates to just pure infrastructure, how do we run our rails, who are our major service providers of our desktops, of our communication services of our cloud. And so there's a program on that is -- provides us the way that we run our business and everything around the business. And as you know, at S&P Global, over the last 4 years, we have put in place a centralized program to manage our data centers, our cloud transformation and all of that. And we're able to take that learning and also take what IHS Markit has done along the same way and very quickly look at a program to bring all of that together. 
The second aspect of technology relates to delivering services to customers, and that's where we have a very similar approach where within the businesses, we have development teams, client services teams, client experience teams. And we're working on looking at the merger of those organizations in the divisions. As an example, like the Market Intelligence and Financial Services division, there's a whole set of work streams around how are we going to use the Desktop, which is the Market Intelligence, Cap IQ desktop; how are we going to use the workflow and the service and products that IHS Markit has and how you take the data and how you work those together. So that's a whole another set of work streams that we have. 
And then the third work streams relate to risk management, cyber risk. And we have an absolutely aligned attitude and policies on ensuring that we always operate at the highest standards of risk and control and compliance as well as ensuring that we're ahead of any sort of cyber risk. 
And then the fourth is data sciences and artificial intelligence, natural language processing, et cetera. We have Kensho, which has been a fantastic organization that joined S&P Global 3 years ago. And what they've been able to achieve is really unprecedented. And we talked right now about NERD on this call. But as you know, Kensho has had a really strong track record at S&P Global. And at IHS Markit, they have the data lake, and as well, they also have data sciences teams as we do across all the businesses So thinking about that community of data sciences and ways to think about the most modern approach to running technology. So we have teams working in parallel, working together across all of those different work streams. We think this is one of the advantages of the scale of the business overall. We can really take advantage of large global scale and technology, and we can also take advantage of large global scale of our data science, of our machine learning, our natural language processing, and so we're very excited. This is going to be one of the most important upsides of working with IHS Markit."

No offering of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933.  
In connection with the proposed transaction, S&P Global and IHS Markit has filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which includes a joint proxy statement and a prospectus.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in our filings with the SEC and on our website.  
I would also like to call your attention to European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company. 
We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be delivered to Dave Guarino at (201) 755-5334.  
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?"

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the essential nature of our products has demonstrated the resilience of our business model. As the economy improves, our colleagues continue to launch innovative new products to help our customers with the ratings, benchmarks, data and insights they need to navigate the recovery. We continue to prioritize the safety of our colleagues, and I want to thank them again for their dedication and commitment in these extremely unusual and challenging times.  
Now let me begin with our first quarter financial highlights. S&P Global is off to a great start in 2021 as we delivered exceptional first quarter results. Revenue increased 13%, and all 4 businesses delivered revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin improvement. Ratings once again delivered the strongest revenue growth from a surge in leveraged loans, high-yield issuance and structured finance. Adjusted expense growth was limited to less than 2%, thanks to our ongoing productivity program and lower T&E.  
It's very rare when we increase guidance on our first quarter earnings call. However, we expect additional growth in Ratings from strong issuance of high-yield and structured finance and in Indices from the higher level of AUM and equities. Therefore, we're raising our annual guidance for 2021. Ewout will provide details in a moment.  
I would also like to share some additional highlights from the first quarter. We issued a report highlighting the performance of our ratings in 2020, which demonstrated that our ratings showed their value as indicators of creditworthiness and relative default risk. Our investment in growth initiatives continues to result in new product launches particularly in ESG, Platts benchmarks, Kensho and our Marketplace. Our China Ratings business is gaining momentum, and we just entered into the first sustainability-linked banking facility in the U.S. information services space. We'll provide further details on all these accomplishments on today's call.  
The most important initiative of the year will be our upcoming merger with IHS Markit. This is an incredibly transformative opportunity for our company and our customers. The combination of S&P Global and IHS Markit creates a very strong company. We will have increased scale and world-class products across numerous core markets with a track record of deploying cutting-edge technology to accelerate our Powering the Markets of the Future strategy. Together, we can offer our customers differentiated data, analytics, research and benchmarks, important to the workflows of many of the world's leading companies. I'm incredibly proud of the team we've built at S&P Global, and I look forward to welcoming the talented IHS Markit employees to our company.  
There are 3 parallel paths that are underway to close the transaction and prepare for the combination. Our progress is on track, and we continue to expect closing in the second half of 2021. The first was shareholder approval. The recent shareholder votes at both companies was overwhelmingly passed with 99% of the votes in favor of the merger.  
The second is regulatory approval. We're working toward regulatory approval in the countries listed. The third is pre-close integration planning. The integration teams continue to prepare for day 1 readiness. These teams are developing plans that focus on organization integration, real estate consolidation, technology, scale and efficiency, cross-selling and new product development. And the value capture work stream is preparing to pursue and track synergies. We've been doing a lot of work to make sure that when our companies are united, we have the culture, purpose and values in place to position us for success.  
To recap the financial results for the first quarter, revenue increased 13% to $2 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 23%, and our adjusted operating profit margin increased 450 basis points to 57.6%. As you know, we measure and track adjusted operating profit margin on a trailing 4-quarter basis, which increased 300 basis points to 54.5%. In addition, diluted shares outstanding decreased 1% over last year, contributing to a 24% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. 
Each quarter, we highlight a few key drivers to our business and important projects underway. This quarter, let me start with Ratings bond issuance trends. During the first quarter, global bond issuance increased 9%. 
Turning to the data. In the U.S., bond issuance in aggregate increased 4% as investment-grade decreased 17%, high-yield increased 111%, public finance increased 9% and structured finance increased 17% mostly due to a 63% increase in CLOs. European bond issuance increased 23% as investment-grade increased 22%, high-yield increased 53% and structured finance increased 6% mostly due to more than a tripling of CLO volume. In Asia, bond issuance increased 11% overall. 
The data on this slide only depicts the bond issuance. When we include [Technical Difficulty] volumes, overall global issuance increased 13%. 
Since bank loan ratings are an important element of Ratings revenue and they're not included in our bond issuance slide, we like to disclose this bank loan rating revenue each quarter. In the first quarter, bank loan rating revenue surged 70% to $148 million. In fact, first quarter revenue from leveraged loans is more than half the leveraged loan revenue in all of 2020.  
The next 2 slides look at the combined high-yield issuance and leveraged loan volume for the U.S. and Europe. Data is not readily available for the rest of the world. This slide shows that over the last 3 years, the combination of global leveraged loan and high-yield issuance has averaged $244 billion per quarter. The first quarter of 2021 reached a quarterly record of $465 billion, nearly twice the quarterly average for the past 3 years.  
This slide depicts the combination of high-yield issuance and [Technical Difficulty]. The category with the largest increase was refinancing, some of which could include pull forward. M&A and LBO activity and buybacks and dividends also increased.  
The CLO market had the busiest quarter on record in both the U.S. and Europe, with twice the volume of new issuances in the first quarter of last year. We believe that investor demand for floating-rate instruments, their search for yield and the relatively strong CLO performance during 2020 pandemic had contributed to increased CLO issuance this year. 
Whilst exciting to see increases in issuance, what's always more important to us is how our ratings perform. 2020 was a tumultuous year, yet our ratings performed as designed. 
In February, S&P Global Ratings issued a report entitled Credit Trends: Review of Ratings Performance Highlights Resilience In 2020. We pulled this chart from the report. You can see that the level of [Technical Difficulty] were in line with the rank order of the ratings with lower-rated issuers having higher levels of default. 
You will notice that the graph only includes high-yield issuers. This is because, in 2020, not one single issuer that was rated investment-grade by S&P Ratings at the beginning of 2020 defaulted. Importantly, amid challenging economic circumstances our ratings in 2020 showed their value as indicators of creditworthiness and relative default risk.  
Turning to our investments in growth initiatives. Let me start with ESG. We continue to make advances with our ESG franchise across the board. After recording ESG revenue of $65 million in 2020, we're off to a good start in the first quarter with revenue up more than 40% to $21 million.  
In Ratings, in the first quarter, we completed 18 ESG evaluations, 6 Green Evaluations and 53 SAM benchmark engagements. This compares to 40 ESG evaluations, [ 24 ] Green Evaluations and [Technical Difficulty] SAM benchmark engagements completed in all of 2020. We also launched new social and sustainability Framework Alignment Opinions. 
In Market Intelligence, our ESG scores have been enhanced. 400 data points have been made available for each company that we score. The additional data points will provide clients with a better understanding of companies' environmental reporting disclosures, biodiversity commitments, CO2 and greenhouse emissions, waste and hazardous disposal, energy consumption and water usage. 
For the social dimension, it will now be possible to determine whether companies disclose safety policies, human rights commitments, code of ethics and whether social reporting disclosures have been independently audited. The new data sets will also provide greater insights on the governance and economic dimensions and help obtain better understanding of companies' codes of conduct and policies addressing anticrime, corruption and bribery, governance of the Board and executive compensation, ownership, [Technical Difficulty] disclosures, risk and supply chain management and tax strategy and reporting. Market Intelligence also launched an ESG data solution to support the European Commission's sustainable finance disclosure requirements, enabling market participants to meet these disclosure requirements.  
In Indices, we had $22.9 billion of ESG ETF AUM at the end of the first quarter. This is an increase of more than 400% since the end of the first quarter of last year. Our Indices business also launched ESG versions of our S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600 indices. In addition, UBS licensed the S&P 500 ESG Elite Index for a new ETF, and Barclays licensed the  S&P EuroUSA 50 Low Carbon ESG Select Equal Weight Index for use in structured products.  
Platts has been very active as well with the launch of assessments for carbon credit [Technical Difficulty]. You may be wondering why we include a copper assessment as an ESG product. It's because this new assessment will help support the need for increased solar, wind, energy storage systems, electric vehicle and EV charging stations, all of which require large amounts of copper. For example, an electric vehicle uses approximately 175 pounds of copper.  
Platts also launched hydro-treated vegetable oil price assessments. HVO, also known as renewable diesel in America, is a biomass-derived fuel suitable for diesel engines. It is made of nonpetroleum renewable resources such as natural fat, vegetable oil and greases and can be blended in traditional diesel or used as a substitute.  
And finally, Platts launched daily assessments for low-carbon aluminum and zero carbon aluminum, which will complement existing Platts European price offerings for high-grade primary aluminum. [Technical Difficulty] quantify cost and manage risk for the opportunities associated with a growing focus on carbon reduction strategies amid increasing global regulation.  
On Earth Day last week, S&P Global launched a new ESG brand, Sustainable1, your single source of essential sustainability intelligence. With the wide array of ESG capabilities that we have and the fact that many of our customers are interested in multiple products from different divisions, we have unified our ESG efforts across the company. This includes product development, technology, channel partnerships, distribution, marketing, sales and client support. We believe that this new brand will help convey S&P Global's commitment and leadership position in ESG.  
Outside of ESG, let me highlight a few other new product launches and product enhancements. We launched Kensho NERD, short for Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation. NERD was developed by the company's natural language processing team, which specializes in machine learning research and engineering related to analyzing and understanding human language. This is the first entity extraction system specifically optimized for business-related documents. NERD makes it easier for users to analyze unstructured text, for example, investigating suppliers and competitors mentioned in company filings, and enables them to drill down instantaneously to the documents they need to see.  
We launched the S&P MAESTRO 5 Index, which is designed to measure the performance of a multi-asset risk parity strategy with a 5% target volatility. The index allocates risk equally among 7 equity, fixed income and commodity indices and further mitigates equity market volatility by dynamically allocating to S&P VIX future indices. 
With about 100 different data sets available on the Marketplace we launched last year, we created Product Finder to help clients find what they're looking for based on their job function, topic, use case and workflow. For example, someone working in investment banking and deal origination can receive different results from a search than a corporate client in a supply chain role.  
Platts expanded its presence in shipping with the new APSI 5 dry bulk weighted index for Supramax class bulkers. APSI 5 is the dry bulk freight market's first regional weighted average index capturing the Asia Pacific trade on Supramax bulkers. This product continues to fill out our shipping products.  
One of the most important aspects of managing benchmarks is to ensure that they are periodically updated to reflect underlying market conditions. When streams of oil that feed a benchmark become depleted, they need to be replaced. After consulting with market participants, Platts is progressing work to add West Texas Intermediate Midland as an additional stream to Dated Brent. Since the 1980s, Dated Brent has acted as the benchmark for and is currently used to price approximately 60% of global waterborne crude. This change will provide significant additional volume and ensure the continued robustness of the Brent complex.  
Let me now turn to our outlook for global issuance and GDP. After issuance growth of 15% in 2019 and 17% in 2020, our ratings research group initial 2021 forecast called for a decrease of 3%. The updated forecast issued earlier this week now calls for a decrease of 2% excluding international public finance. There were 2 changes. Structured finance went from a 3% gain to a 6% gain and non-financials went from a 9% decrease to a 7.5% decrease. 
Please note that this is a bond issuance forecast. This is not a revenue forecast. For example, it doesn't address non-transaction revenue and doesn't include leveraged loan activity.  
There are clearly puts and takes when we think about 2021 issuance. For example, the bulk of the first quarter's corporate issuance came from repeat issuers who may have exhausted their funding needs early this year on the anticipation of rising rates. However, there are several items that should support upcoming issuance, including a rebound in economic growth, very favorable financing conditions, large amounts of sovereign debt with negative yields and a growing pipeline of pending M&A deals.  
We have revised our 2021 global GDP growth forecast, up by 50 basis points to 5.5%. The economic recovery looks set to accelerate in mid-2021, particularly in the U.S. on back of a massive fiscal stimulus plan, although a high degree of unevenness and uncertainty persists. An issue is the pace of vaccinations and the spread of virus variants. The U.S. and U.K. have taken the lead in vaccinations. A slow rollout is hampering the rebound in Europe, and we expect slow vaccination rollouts to cause the recovery in several key emerging markets to lag. 
Our economists view orderly reflation as a positive development for both the economy and credit. We also believe that rising yields on the back of a robust recovery is a positive as opposed to rising yields solely on inflation concern. Moving away from very low rates lessens the search for yield and lessens distortions to financial and nonfinancial asset prices. And finally, Platts is forecasting that oil will remain above $60 a barrel through 2022. This bodes well for the health of the oil industry. 
I will now turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who's going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?"
21719,710491568,2262971,"S&P Global Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug. Let me start with our first quarter financial results. Doug covered the highlights of strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. I will take a moment to cover a few other items.  While there were some acquisitions and divest",1995,"Thank you, Doug. Let me start with our first quarter financial results. Doug covered the highlights of strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. I will take a moment to cover a few other items.  
While there were some acquisitions and divestitures since the first quarter of 2020, the revenue associated with them was not large enough to result in a difference between reported and organic revenue growth. Adjusted total expenses only increased 2%, thanks to ongoing productivity programs and lower T&E. Keep in mind that while T&E remains almost nonexistent, the year-over-year benefits will no longer exist beginning in the second quarter.  
The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation and an increase in taxes on foreign operations. While the effective tax rate fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of discrete tax adjustments, our full year tax rate guidance remains unchanged. 
Our diluted shares outstanding declined by 1.7 million shares. This was the result of shares repurchased before we paused the share repurchase programs due to the pending merger. During the quarter, changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact on adjusted EPS of $0.03. The only meaningful impact was in Ratings, where adjusted operating profit was positively impacted by $9 million. 
We are introducing 3 new categories to provide insight into the type of expenses that are going to be incurred related to the pending merger. The first category is transaction costs. These are costs related to completing the merger. They include legal fees, investment banking fees and filing fees. 
The second category is integration costs. These are costs to operationalize the integration. They include consulting, infrastructure and retention costs. The third category is cost to achieve. These are costs needed to enable expense and revenue synergies. They include lease terminations, severance, contract exit fees and costs related to product development, marketing and distribution enhancements.  
In the first quarter, the non-GAAP adjustments collectively totaled to a net pretax loss of $81 million. They included $9 million for merger transaction costs; $40 million for merger integration costs; there were no merger costs to achieve this quarter, these will begin to occur around the closing of the merger; a $2 million gain for an adjustment on the prior year period divestiture; $2 million for Kensho retention-related expenses; and $31 million in deal-related amortization.  
This quarter, all 4 divisions delivered increased revenue and adjusted operating profit. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted operating profit margin increased significantly in Ratings, Platts and Market Intelligence while Indices had a small decrease. I will provide color on the individual business results in a moment.  
Now turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet has low leverage and ample liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $4.5 billion, debt of $4.1 billion, an undrawn revolver capacity of $1.5 billion and no commercial paper outstanding. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA improved since the end of last year to 1.8x.  
We recently entered into the first sustainability-linked banking facility in the U.S. information services sector. Linking our line of credit to our emission reduction targets verified by the Science Based Targets Initiative is another tangible example of our commitment to becoming net zero by 2040.  
Free cash flow excluding certain items was $718 million in the first quarter, an increase of $100 million or 16% over the prior year period. Due to the pending merger with IHS Markit, share repurchases have been curtailed. If there is an open window and we have an opportunity, we will repurchase shares before the merger closes. If not, we anticipate resuming share repurchases after the merger is completed.  
Now let's turn to the division results. Ratings revenue increased 23%. This revenue growth was driven by the increase in issuance Doug already discussed. Adjusted expenses increased 9%. Excluding changes in foreign exchange rates and the acquisition of Greenwich Associates by CRISIL, adjusted expenses increased 5% primarily due to increased salary and incentives, partially offset by lower T&E. 
These resulted in a 32% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 440 basis point increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 340 basis points to 63.6%. Please keep in mind that the 67.5% adjusted segment operating profit margin achieved in the first quarter is temporarily elevated based on the surge of issuance in high-yield, levered loans and structured finance.  
In China, we see momentum and interest in our ratings picking up. In fact, we completed 18 ratings in the first quarter compared to 22 in all last year. 
Non-transaction revenue increased 10% primarily due to growth at CRISIL, fees associated with surveillance as well as elevated new entity ratings and Ratings Evaluation Services activity. Notably, revenue from Ratings Evaluation Services and new entity ratings each increased approximately 30%. In fact, there were 217 new entity ratings this quarter, the highest quarterly total in over 2 years. This was due to investors' quest for yield and increased risk appetite, enabling increasingly weaker credits to raise debt. Transaction revenue increased 35% primarily due to substantial levels of high-yield issuance, bank loan ratings and structured finance. 
This slide depicts Ratings revenue by the end markets. The largest contributor to the increase in Ratings revenue was a 27% increase in corporates. In addition, financial services revenue increased 10%, structured finance increased 34%, governments increased 18% and the CRISIL and other category increased 8%. On the right side of the slide, you can see the changes in revenue within structured finance. The clear driver of growth was a 70% increase in CLO revenue.  
Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The segment delivered 4% revenue growth primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices and data subscriptions, substantially offset by reduced exchange-traded derivative activity. In the first quarter, adjusted expenses only increased 2%. This was particularly low as the first quarter of 2020 had elevated expenses, including a $4 million catch-up charge on past royalties. The adjusted segment operating profit increased 5%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 70 basis points to 71.3%. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 69.3%. 
Revenue growth was mixed this quarter. Asset-linked fees increased 15% with gains in ETFs, mutual funds and insurance and over-the-counter derivative activity. Exchange-traded derivative revenue decreased 24% on reduced trading volumes. The first quarter of last year saw extraordinary volatility related to the pandemic market correction, creating a very difficult comparison. Data and custom subscriptions only increased 1% due to a catch-up in real-time customer reporting in the first quarter last year.  
For our Indices division, over the past year, ETF net inflows were $125 billion and market appreciation totaled $749 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.2 trillion, which is 65% higher compared to 1 year ago when the market was near its pandemic low. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 30% year-over-year. Sequentially, versus the end of 2020, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $73 billion and market appreciation totaled $143 billion.  
As I just noted, exchange-rated derivative revenue faced a difficult comparison. Activity at the CBOE decreased in the first quarter with S&P 500 Index options activity decreasing 29% and VIX futures and options activity decreasing 23%. Activity at the CME equity complex decreased 6%.  
Market Intelligence delivered reported and organic revenue growth of 4%. Collectively, revenue from recently launched products increased by over 40%. This was primarily from ESG, Panjiva aftermarket research, Marketplace and SME data. Adjusted expenses were flat as recent productivity initiatives and lower T&E offset salary growth and higher investment spending. Investment spending continues, particularly with the Marketplace and SME initiatives.  
Adjusted segment operating profit increased 13%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 260 basis points to 33.5%. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 120 basis points to 33.1%.  
Looking across the Market Intelligence components, Desktop revenue grew 2%. Data Management Solutions revenue grew 9% and Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 6%. Based on our ACV trends, we expect Desktop to grow low to mid-single digits for the full year and both Data Management Solutions and Credit Risk Solutions to grow high single digit this year.  
And now turning to Platts. Reported revenue increased 5%. Our core subscriptions increased 6%. Over the past year, oil prices have increased, resulting in a customer base that is healthier, and our retention rates remained in the mid-90s. Global Trading Services decreased 4% compared to a very strong first quarter of 2020. GTS revenue decreased mainly due to lower petroleum and natural gas volumes partially offset by increased LNG volume. 
Adjusted expenses improved 7% due to lower T&E, rent and bad debt provision. Please note that we expect expenses to pick up in the second quarter as Platts investment spending increases. Adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 520 basis points to 58.1%. The trailing 4-quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 280 basis points to 56%.  
On our first quarter earnings call last year, Doug noted that the first-ever Kensho-powered price assessments went live. One year later, we now have 19 markets that have Kensho-powered price assessments. This has resulted in more than a 75% reduction in publishing time. 
This quarter, because shipping has increasingly become an important product offering for Platts customers, we're introducing shipping as a new category. Shipping is essential to commodities trading with 90% of global trade transported by sea. S&P Global Platts has been in the business of providing transparency to the shipping market for more than 35 years. These assessments are used by market participants for physical benchmarking, and 5 are listed by exchanges as the basis of derivative contracts.  
In 2014, Platts expanded its freight offering into the dry freight market with daily assessment of freight rates for key commodity trade routes for products such as iron ore, coal, grains, sugar, bauxite and alumina. Platts now publishes hundreds of daily freight rate assessments covering all major shipping markets. To help you with your models, we have provided historical quarterly information on the new reporting basis in the appendix of this slide deck. And finally, while every category on this slide grew revenue during the quarter, the fastest growth was in petrochemicals.  
We're not providing 2021 GAAP guidance because, given the inherent uncertainty around the merger, management cannot reliably predict all the necessary components of GAAP measures. This slide depicts our adjusted guidance. While we expect that the merger will occur in the second half of this year, we're providing adjusted guidance on a stand-alone basis. The second column shows our new 2021 adjusted guidance with all the line items that James highlighted. 
We're making these changes because we now have expectations for greater revenue growth primarily due to improved outlooks in Ratings and Indices. While we expect greater revenue growth, it's not enough to change our revenue guidance. Therefore, our revenue guidance remains a mid-single-digit increase.  
Operating profit margin is increased by 20 basis points to a range of 54% to 54.5%, and this results in a $0.30 increase in adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a new range of $12.55 to $12.75. And finally, free cash flow generation has been increased by $100 million to a range of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion.  
In conclusion, we're off to a great start to 2021 with exceptional first quarter results. Vaccinations are rolling out. The global economy is poised for accelerated growth, and our customers are benefiting from these improvements. During this pandemic, we have been working hard to ensure the safety of our employees, and I want to end by thanking them for their perseverance, creativity and passion and by thanking all of you for your continued investment in S&P Global.

We are thinking about the following in terms of what we are planning to do going forward. 
First of all, once we have an open window, the likelihood is low that the open window will be before the merger will close so that means after the merger close is more likely, what we will do is, first, we have an opportunity to catch up with respect to our capital return targets from the last few quarters because, clearly, we have not been able to deliver on those targets given these limitations. And then going forward, we have the new capital return target of at least 85%. So what you may expect is a kind of a catch-up after the merger will close and then ongoing, an increased level of capital return to our shareholders.

And therefore, the period-over-period differential looked relatively small with a growth of just 1%. Strategically, this is definitely an area we would like to grow, so the 1% is unusually low and should not be the basis of what to expect going forward. We should expect much higher growth from data and custom subscriptions. 
And we would like to grow this because we think it's a good balance in the overall revenue mix for the index business, where we have, as you know, fees over assets under management, we have the derivative trading fees. And recurring revenue, subscription-like revenues in the index business is definitely an area we will grow as well. So unusually low at 1% and the expectation should be much higher growth going forward."

Well, first of all, as you know, we saw a very strong increase in results in the first quarter. Just to give you a few numbers to put them in context. As an example, investment-grade in the U.S. was down 17%, and you think about that being down 17%. At the same time, investment-grade in Europe was up 22%. 
High-yield in the U.S. was up 111%. High-yield in Europe was up 53%. Structured finance globally was up 5% but a couple of tidbits there. In the U.S., CLOs were up 63%, and in Europe, CLOs were up 300%. And bank loans were also up 70% as well. So you could see a mix of different aspects of what were up and what were down. 
We think that in the investment-grade, both in the U.S. and Europe, that there probably wasn't necessarily pull forward, to use that phrase, because you saw the 17% down in the U.S. but there was definitely an interest in investment -- non-investment-grade issuers as well as structured finance to look at the -- what they believe is going to be upcoming economic growth. Rates and spreads have been quite attractive. Spreads are at an all-time historical low in some cases or lows over the last 2 or 3 years. And there's also potentially some expectations that inflation starts coming in the market and interest rates will start going up again. 
But as you know, in our forecast that we just gave you, we saw at the original forecast that the corporates would be down about 9%. We now see them down about 7.5% for the forecast for the year. Financial services that originally were going to be up about 5%, we see them now up around 4%. It hasn't changed that much. Structured finance is where we saw a bigger swing, originally up 3% and up now about 6%. 
So when you look at the total, we had originally forecasted that the issuance for 2021 would be down about 3% and now we think it's going to be about -- down about 2%. As I started off, it's always hard to tell what pull forward is and what's coming in this pull forward, but it's possible that there could have been some in the high-yield space in particular."

Think about the Desktop that has seen some uneven recovery in various regions, particularly, therefore, the COVID impact from 2020, impact from the past ACV. But what we are seeing is a really healthy commercial activity now, and therefore, you heard us guiding to still low to mid-single-digit growth for revenue -- for Desktop revenue this year and high single-digit growth for Data Management Solutions and Credit Risk Solutions. 
Specifically with respect to the growth initiatives, we're very excited about all the new initiatives and the investments we are making. We know that it always takes a bit of time to see the revenue ramp up, and of course, from an overall basis, these numbers are still relatively small. But think about that Data Marketplace is doing very well, and we see very nice growth. Actually, the revenues in the first quarter were more or less the same of the total revenues we booked over the full year 2020. The same applies for SME, ESG, private company data. 
So overall, I think, it's clearly very, very good initiatives, and we see a lot of traction. Overall, Market Intelligence growth is expected at mid- to high single digit for the full year 2021, so mid- to high single-digit growth for the full year 2021, which we think is a very healthy growth for this business and clearly helped by some of those initiatives."

And we typically talk about Ratings, but we have other initiatives. We're investing with Platts. We're investing in our index business. And recently, we've had some very good traction with our credit portal from Market Intelligence. 
But let me give you a quick update on Ratings. Last year, we had 22 ratings that were issued in the full year of 2020, and this year, in the first quarter alone, we issued 18 ratings. We believe that the market participants are really interested and increasingly interested in the quality of the ratings themselves, the underlying ratings. As I've talked about over time, we've assembled a very, very strong team. 
The market is building up over time. We see that the market has started attracting more offshore investors as well as the foreign banks that are coming in with their wholly owned or controlled subsidiaries, which is bringing new capital and new approach to the markets. But what we're out doing is educating the market. We're doing literally hundreds of meetings a week. And when we have seminars or events when we've rolled out some new research, we're getting thousands of people joining that. 
One thing that I'm very pleased with is that -- in addition to having such a strong team, is that the ratings that we've done when you look over the last 2 years. We've now rated financial structured products, our first nonfinancial corporation, and the breadth of our ratings goes from AAA to BBB. We're getting a lot of really good attention, a lot of high traction to our websites, et cetera. So we see China as a long-run investment but off to a really good start."

As we showed you in the slides themselves, we think that the economy globally is recovering, although it's going to be a choppy recovery. You've got the U.S. growing at 6.5% this year on the back of a very, very successful vaccination program. China is going to be growing at 8%. Actually, the government says themselves they're going to grow at double digit, at a 10% rate. But you also see that Europe and India and some other markets might not be growing at a very quick rate. 
But overall, given the pull of the U.S. and China and other markets that are recovering pretty quickly like the U.K., we think that the growth this year is going to be 5.5% globally. The following year is also going to be quite strong because those other markets that haven't had the vaccinations yet will continue to improve as well. So global growth over the next couple of years in the 4% to 5% range, which bode well for our businesses. 
One of the biggest trends we look at is and what we talk about is as markets become capital markets around the world. And the question we just had about China is an important one for us, as China savers move from just investing in real estate to putting money into financial assets, into pension, insurance and savings program. As foreign investors move into China, we're seeing a much more advanced capital markets. 
The European trends over the last couple of years, we've always talked about them, but they've been very strong the last couple of years. And we've seen them incredibly strong in the last couple of quarters and becoming more like capital markets. 
Now one final comment. When we take a step back and we think about our strategy that's called Powering the Markets of the Future, it allows us to take all of the different capabilities of S&P Global, whether it's the rating agency, it's the index business. And now when we think about the addition of the IHS Markit capabilities, we'll have -- right now, we'll move from -- up to 76% of our business will be coming from subscription or subscription-like recurring revenue services. That will give us some stability as we head into potentially high-growth markets over the next couple of years but as well any sort of choppiness that could come from either fiscal policy or coming out of the very low interest rate environment, et cetera. 
But we watch very carefully the external environment. We think our businesses are well prepared to support the growth of financial markets and our customers. And we always then incorporate that into our planning of where we invest and how we set up our budgets."

This time, they did. 
We look at a few of the key factors which drove that. Clearly, there is a lot of capital-chasing deals. We see that the M&A pipeline has increased to a level which is it's not quite historic but it's getting there, and there's a lot of M&A pipeline that is out there. It's from a combination of private equity firms, strategic investments as well as the SPACs, and that brings along with it revenue for us, which is not just an issuance revenue from loans and from high-yield bonds. We also see from new issuer fees as well as Ratings Evaluation Services that comes from that kind of a pipeline. 
But we see going forward this year, as I mentioned earlier, the overall corporate sector, we think, is going to be down with the investment-grade issuers not being very active in the market, especially in the U.S. And with the high-yield probably leveling out, we don't know exactly what's going to happen with rates and spreads. But you're right that they do usually move in opposite directions. 
There's one other point I want to make. There has been demand for loans from investors that are looking for potential increase in interest rates. You saw that the 10-year yield had started climbing over the last 3 or 4 months. And so there's a lot of demand from investors for loans which are floating rate. They want to, in a sense, kind of hedge their interest rate exposure and have floating-rate exposure. So it's embedded in our outlook for the rest of the year and are -- as well as our -- what we see is our forecast for issuance. But you're right that they don't always move lockstep, and this quarter, they did."

Well, first of all, we are very pleased with the progress we're making on our ESG franchise. As you probably saw last week, on April 22, on Earth Day, we announced a new brand, Sustainable1, for our ESG efforts across the entire company. And it's -- as we call it, it's your single source of essential sustainability intelligence. Across all of S&P Global, we're now coordinating our ESG initiatives, and we have over 500 people that are dedicated full time to this. 
But to dig a little bit deeper into what you mentioned about Platts. Platts is building up an expertise in energy transition as well as transportation, and you heard us talk about shipping a few minutes ago. And when it comes to energy transition, you think about the move from coal to renewables as maybe the end of the spectrum. But in between, there is a whole new set of opportunities for Platts to be looking at, many of them we're already in. 
Hydrogen is an example. We have a hydrogen benchmark. We're the first one with a hydrogen benchmark. There is something called clean oil. There's clean natural gas. What that means is that clean oil has had -- the entire value chain of the delivery of that oil has been rebuilt to ensure that you can capture all of the methane, that there's no leakage along the way, so there's ways that refineries are run, that storage systems and pipelines are run. And we're able to provide the research and the data and the analytics and the benchmarks against something like clean oil. 
We also -- in Platts, we mentioned earlier on the call about copper. There's a whole set of new metals which are quite important to the energy transition; as an example, copper, which there's 175 pounds at least of copper in an electric vehicle. You also have lithium in the batteries. So these are areas where we also see a lot of opportunities for the benchmarks to be used from a combination of new power grids, from the metals that are in them, from the clean energy that is going to be clean transition energy. 
Finally, I'd like to mention that with the merger with IHS Markit, they also bring along a set of new products and services that bringing together will strengthen our ESG franchise. At IHS Markit, they have additional research that comes from their transportation business, which is going to be quite valuable for the Platts business in the energy transition. They also have a carbon registry. They've got a set of other carbon research products and then generally, other research and news on energy transition and ESG, which are going to be quite valuable to us. 
So we think we're very well positioned. We've just launched the Sustainable1 brand. We have an organization in place with over 500 people, and we're ready to really start growing."

But clearly, going forward, what we would expect to be the new normal with new ways of working, hybrid working, more virtual tools, it's correct that we wouldn't expect the whole $85 million to come back. Our best estimate would be maybe a haircut of, let's say, 25%, so maybe around $60 million or so that should be a T&E kind of level after the whole COVID situation is over. 
Some of the benefits of that are already captured in our productivity program, so a part of the $120 million productivity program. But clearly, we expect overall more efficiency due to a different way of working going forward and the lessons that we have learned of being able to operate over the last 12 to 15 months. 
By the way, the same applies to real estate. We clearly expect also real estate expenses to come down. We don't need the extensive footprint that we have today because we would expect people to be spending less days at the office going forward.

Thank you, Owen. Let me take that question. Well, when we think about the energy transition and now in a much more broad way and you look at all the different initiatives going on around the globe, one of the most important dialogues that we have no matter where we go -- any meeting I go to, whether it's with central bankers, ministers of finance, it's with corporate bankers, investment bankers, with corporate executives, people are talking about energy transition, they're talking about climate and they're talking about ESG. And we see that there is a need for people to have clear, simple, concise, comparable, consistent data and analytics around climate, around ESG. 
As you know, we did an acquisition of Trucost about 3.5 years ago, and it brought to us the premier set of data and analytics around carbon, around climate, around physical risk as well as waste, water and other types of analytical information. We also have physical risk. We have SDGs, sustainable development goals as ways that we can do analytics on that. 
But going to your -- the first part of your question. We just announced an agreement with State Street, where we're providing them information from Trucost that can be embedded in all of their modeling. All of their clients will be able to use that intelligence and that risk information and build it into State Street's existing client-focused ESG services. State Street has about $40 trillion of clients -- of assets under management that their clients hold. So we're going to be able to be providing that functionality. 
What it does is it allows those clients to have access to the carbon footprint and other environmental data that will map to their portfolios. As you know, a lot of organizations are increasingly using the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure reporting. And you can take the Trucost data, the Carbon Earnings at Risk, the Paris alignment, the physical risk data, the general carbon information and build it right into that kind of modeling. So we're very pleased with that partnership with State Street. We see this as a start of many, many other partnerships and something that for us is quite important and one of our most important strategic initiatives in the entire company."

It's not nearly as far along as something like ESG is. Crypto is just, just starting. And we feel that it's such an important asset class, it's on everyone's minds, that we needed to do some specific research around crypto. And one of the groups where we can do that, where there's a lot of relevance is within the index business. 
So this actually goes back for more than just the last few weeks or last few quarters. We've been researching crypto for a while and hadn't felt that it had the seriousness and the ability to be hedged, the ability for crypto to be really understood, to be traded, to have the liquidity in it. It was quite speculative, and we had not launched any products up until now. We haven't launched any products yet, we're close to. 
But because crypto is becoming more mainstream, it's beyond just Bitcoin. There's many other sources. They're -- you can trade them on other exchanges. There are some companies now that have listed that are crypto companies that have the standards of being a listed company. You've got -- some of the exchanges have started having futures and forwards. You're starting to see some of the conditions that would allow us to develop some products. 
As of now, our revenue model would be similar to the revenue model we have on other indices, which would either be AUM-based fees or it would come from data that we would sell to the markets that could use the data from a product or an index like that. But -- an area that's quite promising but it's really -- it's starting at 0. So I can't give you much of a projection of what the revenue might look like because it's starting so low, but something that we feel like we need to be understanding and learning and building into our portfolio of products."

We're very pleased with that. 
With respect to your question about our expense management philosophy, first of all, both companies today already have philosophies in place. As you know, we have our productivity program on the S&P Global side, where we're aiming now at the $120 million cost takeout. And IHS Markit is having a particular target with respect to margin expansion of 100 basis points on an annual basis. 
What we are planning to do once we bring the 2 companies together is to, of course, focus on the overall expense synergies that we have mentioned to you before. That's going to be a large program. In order to achieve that -- that's a period of 2 to 3 years that we are fully able to achieve those expense synergies, although the ramp-up will go fast. We are probably in year 2 at a level of 80% of the expense synergies. 
But philosophically, on top of that, you may expect us to continue to look at opportunities where we find scale across all of the different divisions that we'll have going forward. As you know, we are in a business where scale really matters particularly with all the technology investments that are needed, and we have an opportunity to leverage that across the company. We also will continue to benefit from operating leverage, just the benefit of growing the top line faster than your expense line. The incremental margin on the next dollar of revenue that comes into the company should always be higher than your average margin because you don't have your fixed cost that you need to cover anymore. So philosophically, you may expect us to continue to be very focused on taking benefit of efficiencies and scales on top of all the existing programs and commitments that we already have in place."

As you mentioned, very healthy revenue development during the quarter. If you think about the recurring part, the subscription part of the business, it was growing 6%, a little bit held back by the Global Trading Services. 
But that is understandable because Global Trading Services was really elevated in the first quarter of last year, a little bit similar to the ETDs within the index business. When the markets show a lot of volatility, there's a lot of trading, hedging that is happening. And the hedge programs are helping the GTS revenues to go up. But if you look at it in perspective, GTS was, in fact, higher on a stand-alone basis this quarter than the last 3 quarters itself. So nothing from our perspective when we look at GTS that we think that, that wouldn't be helpful going forward. It's just that the comp 1 year ago was so high. 
So all in all, if you put it together, we see healthy developments, good retention rates in the mid-90s, good commercial activity. The book of business, that is building up well. We like that. The ACV and subscription level is at that 6-ish percent at the moment. So overall, mid-single digits is the outlook for Platts for this year in terms of revenue growth.

The way we look at it is that what's critical for us is to be the most relevant benchmark, research, analytics, news organization for commodity solutions, We think about it as you just described. The peak oil is going to be a while away. People still forecast that could be 8, 10, 15 sometimes people say even 20 years away. It depends a little bit on some of the programs around the world for energy transition and climate change. 
But when we look at that, we believe that there will be a lot of different types of services and commodities that are going to be taking the place of what is today oil that's used in transportation and manufacturing, et cetera. So that's one of the reasons we've invested in our ESG products and services. We also look at power grids. We're looking at renewable energy, at power generation. As you've heard us over time, we've also expanded into agriculture. We've looked at metals and mining. 
So we think that there's 2 aspects to this. One of them is the diversification, generally speaking, of taking the expertise we have in commodities and expanding that to other commodity classes. And we hope that, that brings us growth over time. And then the second is filling the gap of the needs of what's going to happen in climate and energy transition and moving very rapidly and aggressively into all of the spaces that will be the opportunities there like carbon registries, carbon pricing, hydrogen, et cetera. So it's kind of 2 different angles on the same way. It's the growth horizontally, and then it's filling the space for all of the opportunities related to ESG."

When you look at our overall program for the integration with IHS Markit, there is a major emphasis on technology transition, and there's a few different categories. The first is what I would start with that relates to just pure infrastructure, how do we run our rails, who are our major service providers of our desktops, of our communication services, of our cloud. 
And so there's a program on that is -- provides us the way that we run our business and everything around the business. And as you know, at S&P Global, over the last 4 years, we have put in place a centralized program to manage our data centers, our cloud transformation and all of that. And we're able to take that learning and also take what IHS Markit has done along the same way and very quickly look at a program to bring all of that together. 
The second aspect of technology relates to delivering services to customers, and that's where we have a very similar approach, where within the businesses, we have development teams, client services teams, client experience teams. And we're working on looking at the merger of those organizations in the divisions; as an example, like the Market Intelligence and Financial Services division. There's a whole set of work streams around how are we going to use the Desktop, which is the Market Intelligence/CapIQ Desktop; how are we going to use the workflow and the service and products that IHS Markit has and how you take the data and how you work those together. So that's a whole another set of work streams that we have. 
And then the third work streams relate to risk management, cyber risk. And we have an absolutely aligned attitude and policies on ensuring that we always operate at the highest standards of risk and control and compliance as well as ensuring that we're ahead of any sort of cyber risk. 
And then the fourth is data sciences and artificial intelligence, natural language processing, et cetera. We have Kensho, which has been a fantastic organization that joined S&P Global 3 years ago. And what they've been able to achieve is really unprecedented. And we talked right now about NERD on this call. But as you know, Kensho has had a really strong track record at S&P Global. And at IHS Markit, they have the data lake, and as well, they also have data sciences teams as we do across all the businesses so thinking about that community of data sciences and ways to think about the most modern approach to running technology. 
So we have teams working in parallel, working together across all of those different work streams. We think this is one of the advantages of the scale of the business overall. We can really take advantage of large global scale and technology, and we can also take advantage of large global scale of our data science, of our machine learning, our natural language processing. And so we're very excited. This is going to be one of the most important upsides of working with IHS Markit."

We issued a news release with our results earlier today. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.  
Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  
In addition, as we announced late last year, S&P Global and IHS Markit entered into a definitive merger agreement. In March, shareholders of both companies overwhelmingly voted in favor of the merger. The merger is pending regulatory approval, and we expect to close in the second half of 2021. This call will touch on the merger but does not constitute an offer to sell or buy or the solicitation of any offer to buy or sell any securities nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which this offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities law of any such jurisdiction. No offering of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933.  
In connection with the proposed transaction, S&P Global and IHS Markit has filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which includes a joint proxy statement and a prospectus. S&P Global and IHS Markit have filed other documents regarding the proposed transaction with the SEC. Investors and security holders of S&P Global or IHS Markit stock are urged to carefully read the entire registration statement and joint proxy statement/prospectus, which is available on our website and sec.gov.  
In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we provide adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management's. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
This call, especially the discussion of our outlook, contains statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in our filings with the SEC and on our website.  
I would also like to call your attention to European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company. 
We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be delivered to Dave Guarino at (201) 755-5334.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the essential nature of our products has demonstrated the resilience of our business model. As the economy improves, our colleagues continue to launch innovative new products to help our customers with the ratings, benchmarks, data and insights they need to navigate the recovery. We continue to prioritize the safety of our colleagues, and I want to thank them again for their dedication and commitment in these extremely unusual and challenging times.  
Now let me begin with our first quarter financial highlights. S&P Global is off to a great start in 2021 as we delivered exceptional first quarter results. Revenue increased 13%, and all 4 businesses delivered revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin improvement. Ratings once again delivered the strongest revenue growth from a surge in leveraged loans, high-yield issuance and structured finance. Adjusted expense growth was limited to less than 2%, thanks to our ongoing productivity program and lower T&E.  
It's very rare when we increase guidance on our first quarter earnings call. However, we expect additional growth in Ratings from strong issuance of high-yield and structured finance and in Indices from the higher level of AUM and equities. Therefore, we're raising our annual guidance for 2021. Ewout will provide details in a moment.  
I would also like to share some additional highlights from the first quarter. We issued a report highlighting the performance of our ratings in 2020, which demonstrated that our ratings showed their value as indicators of creditworthiness and relative default risk. Our investment in growth initiatives continues to result in new product launches particularly in ESG, Platts benchmarks, Kensho and our Marketplace. Our China Ratings business is gaining momentum, and we just entered into the first sustainability-linked banking facility in the U.S. information services space. We'll provide further details on all these accomplishments on today's call.  
The most important initiative of the year will be our upcoming merger with IHS Markit. This is an incredibly transformative opportunity for our company and our customers. The combination of S&P Global and IHS Markit creates a very strong company. We will have increased scale and world-class products across numerous core markets with a track record of deploying cutting-edge technology to accelerate our Powering the Markets of the Future strategy. Together, we can offer our customers differentiated data, analytics, research and benchmarks, important to the workflows of many of the world's leading companies. I'm incredibly proud of the team we've built at S&P Global, and I look forward to welcoming the talented IHS Markit employees to our company.  
There are 3 parallel paths that are underway to close the transaction and prepare for the combination. Our progress is on track, and we continue to expect closing in the second half of 2021. The first was shareholder approval. The recent shareholder votes at both companies was overwhelmingly passed with 99% of the votes in favor of the merger.  
The second is regulatory approval. We're working toward regulatory approval in the countries listed. The third is pre-close integration planning. The integration teams continue to prepare for day 1 readiness. These teams are developing plans that focus on organization integration, real estate consolidation, technology, scale and efficiency, cross-selling and new product development. And the value capture work stream is preparing to pursue and track synergies. We've been doing a lot of work to make sure that when our companies are united, we have the culture, purpose and values in place to position us for success.  
To recap the financial results for the first quarter, revenue increased 13% to $2 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 23%, and our adjusted operating profit margin increased 450 basis points to 57.6%. As you know, we measure and track adjusted operating profit margin on a trailing 4-quarter basis, which increased 300 basis points to 54.5%. In addition, diluted shares outstanding decreased 1% over last year, contributing to a 24% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. 
Each quarter, we highlight a few key drivers to our business and important projects underway. This quarter, let me start with Ratings bond issuance trends. During the first quarter, global bond issuance increased 9%. 
Turning to the data. In the U.S., bond issuance in aggregate increased 4% as investment-grade decreased 17%, high-yield increased 111%, public finance increased 9% and structured finance increased 17% mostly due to a 63% increase in CLOs. European bond issuance increased 23% as investment-grade increased 22%, high-yield increased 53% and structured finance increased 6% mostly due to more than a tripling of CLO volume. In Asia, bond issuance increased 11% overall. 
The data on this slide only depicts bond issuance. When we include bank loan volumes, overall global issuance increased 13%. 
Since bank loan ratings are an important element of Ratings revenue and they're not included in our bond issuance slide, we like to disclose this bank loan rating revenue each quarter. In the first quarter, bank loan rating revenue surged 70% to $148 million. In fact, first quarter revenue from leveraged loans is more than half the leveraged loan revenue in all of 2020.  
The next 2 slides look at the combined high-yield issuance and leveraged loan volume for the U.S. and Europe. Data is not readily available for the rest of the world. This slide shows that over the last 3 years, the combination of global leveraged loan and high-yield issuance has averaged $244 billion per quarter. The first quarter of 2021 reached a quarterly record of $465 billion, nearly twice the quarterly average for the past 3 years.  
This slide depicts the combination of high-yield issuance and leverage loan volume in terms of the use of proceeds of the funds raised. The category with the largest increase was refinancing, some of which could include pull forward. M&A and LBO activity and buybacks and dividends also increased.  
The CLO market had the busiest quarter on record in both the U.S. and Europe, with twice the volume of new issuances in the first quarter of last year. We believe that investor demand for floating-rate instruments, their search for yield and the relatively strong CLO performance during 2020 pandemic had contributed to increased CLO issuance this year. 
Whilst exciting to see increases in issuance, what's always more important to us is how our ratings perform. 2020 was a tumultuous year, yet our ratings performed as designed. 
In February, S&P Global Ratings issued a report entitled Credit Trends: Review of Ratings Performance Highlights Resilience In 2020. We pulled this chart from the report. You can see that the level of issuer defaults was in line with the rank order of the ratings with lower-rated issuers having higher levels of default. 
You will notice that the graph only includes high-yield issuers. This is because, in 2020, not one single issuer that was rated investment-grade by S&P Ratings at the beginning of 2020 defaulted. Importantly, amid challenging economic circumstances our ratings in 2020 showed their value as indicators of creditworthiness and relative default risk.  
Turning to our investments in growth initiatives. Let me start with ESG. We continue to make advances with our ESG franchise across the board. After recording ESG revenue of $65 million in 2020, we're off to a good start in the first quarter with revenue up more than 40% to $21 million.  
In Ratings, in the first quarter, we completed 18 ESG evaluations, 6 Green Evaluations and 53 SAM benchmark engagements. This compares to 40 ESG evaluations, 24 Green Evaluations and 76 SAM benchmark engagements completed in all of 2020. We also launched new social and sustainability Framework Alignment Opinions. 
In Market Intelligence, our ESG scores have been enhanced. 400 data points have been made available for each company that we score. The additional data points will provide clients with a better understanding of companies' environmental reporting disclosures, biodiversity commitments, CO2 and greenhouse emissions, waste and hazardous disposal, energy consumption and water usage. 
For the social dimension, it will now be possible to determine whether companies disclose safety policies, human rights commitments, code of ethics and whether social reporting disclosures have been independently audited. The new data sets will also provide greater insights on the governance and economic dimensions and help obtain better understanding of companies' codes of conduct and policies addressing anticrime, corruption and bribery, governance of the Board and executive compensation, ownership, diversity, materiality disclosures, risk and supply chain management and tax strategy and reporting. Market Intelligence also launched an ESG data solution to support the European Commission's sustainable finance disclosure requirements, enabling market participants to meet these disclosure requirements.  
In Indices, we had $22.9 billion of ESG ETF AUM at the end of the first quarter. This is an increase of more than 400% since the end of the first quarter of last year. Our Indices business also launched ESG versions of our S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600 indices. In addition, UBS licensed the S&P 500 ESG Elite Index for a new ETF, and Barclays licensed the  S&P EuroUSA 50 Low Carbon ESG Select Equal Weight Index for use in structured products.  
Platts has been very active as well with the launch of assessments on carbon credits and copper concentrate. You may be wondering why we include a copper assessment as an ESG product. It's because this new assessment will help support the need for increased solar, wind, energy storage systems, electric vehicle and EV charging stations, all of which require large amounts of copper. For example, an electric vehicle uses approximately 175 pounds of copper.  
Platts also launched hydro-treated vegetable oil price assessments. HVO, also known as renewable diesel in America, is a biomass-derived fuel suitable for diesel engines. It is made of nonpetroleum renewable resources such as natural fat, vegetable oil and greases and can be blended in traditional diesel or used as a substitute.  
And finally, Platts launched daily assessments for low-carbon aluminum and zero carbon aluminum, which will complement existing Platts European price offerings for high-grade primary aluminum. These new prices are designed to help the market quantify cost and manage risk for the opportunities associated with a growing focus on carbon reduction strategies amid increasing global regulation.  
On Earth Day last week, S&P Global launched a new ESG brand, Sustainable1, your single source of essential sustainability intelligence. With the wide array of ESG capabilities that we have and the fact that many of our customers are interested in multiple products from different divisions, we have unified our ESG efforts across the company. This includes product development, technology, channel partnerships, distribution, marketing, sales and client support. We believe that this new brand will help convey S&P Global's commitment and leadership position in ESG.  
Outside of ESG, let me highlight a few other new product launches and product enhancements. We launched Kensho NERD, short for Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation. NERD was developed by the company's natural language processing team, which specializes in machine learning research and engineering related to analyzing and understanding human language. This is the first entity extraction system specifically optimized for business-related documents. NERD makes it easier for users to analyze unstructured text, for example, investigating suppliers and competitors mentioned in company filings, and enables them to drill down instantaneously to the documents they need to see.  
We launched the S&P MAESTRO 5 Index, which is designed to measure the performance of a multi-asset risk parity strategy with a 5% target volatility. The index allocates risk equally among 7 equity, fixed income and commodity indices and further mitigates equity market volatility by dynamically allocating to S&P VIX future indices. 
With about 100 different data sets available on the Marketplace we launched last year, we created Product Finder to help clients find what they're looking for based on their job function, topic, use case and workflow. For example, someone working in investment banking and deal origination can receive different results from a search than a corporate client in a supply chain role.  
Platts expanded its presence in shipping with the new APSI 5 dry bulk weighted index for Supramax class bulkers. APSI 5 is the dry bulk freight market's first regional weighted average index capturing the Asia Pacific trade on Supramax bulkers. This product continues to fill out our shipping products.  
One of the most important aspects of managing benchmarks is to ensure that they are periodically updated to reflect underlying market conditions. When streams of oil that feed a benchmark become depleted, they need to be replaced. After consulting with market participants, Platts is progressing work to add West Texas Intermediate Midland as an additional stream to Dated Brent. Since the 1980s, Dated Brent has acted as the benchmark for and is currently used to price approximately 60% of global waterborne crude. This change will provide significant additional volume and ensure the continued robustness of the Brent complex.  
Let me now turn to our outlook for global issuance and GDP. After issuance growth of 15% in 2019 and 17% in 2020, our ratings research group initial 2021 forecast called for a decrease of 3%. The updated forecast issued earlier this week now calls for a decrease of 2% excluding international public finance. There were 2 changes. Structured finance went from a 3% gain to a 6% gain and non-financials went from a 9% decrease to a 7.5% decrease. 
Please note that this is a bond issuance forecast. This is not a revenue forecast. For example, it doesn't address non-transaction revenue and doesn't include leveraged loan activity.  
There are clearly puts and takes when we think about 2021 issuance. For example, the bulk of the first quarter's corporate issuance came from repeat issuers who may have exhausted their funding needs early this year on the anticipation of rising rates. However, there are several items that should support upcoming issuance, including a rebound in economic growth, very favorable financing conditions, large amounts of sovereign debt with negative yields and a growing pipeline of pending M&A deals.  
We have revised our 2021 global GDP growth forecast, up by 50 basis points to 5.5%. The economic recovery looks set to accelerate in mid-2021, particularly in the U.S. on back of a massive fiscal stimulus plan, although a high degree of unevenness and uncertainty persists. An issue is the pace of vaccinations and the spread of virus variants. The U.S. and U.K. have taken the lead in vaccinations. A slow rollout is hampering the rebound in Europe, and we expect slow vaccination rollouts to cause the recovery in several key emerging markets to lag. 
Our economists view orderly reflation as a positive development for both the economy and credit. We also believe that rising yields on the back of a robust recovery is a positive as opposed to rising yields solely on inflation concern. Moving away from very low rates lessens the search for yield and lessens distortions to financial and nonfinancial asset prices. And finally, Platts is forecasting that oil will remain above $60 a barrel through 2022. This bodes well for the health of the oil industry. 
I will now turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who's going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?"
21719,710491568,2270073,"S&P Global Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","S&P Global Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Doug. Let me start with our first quarter financial results. Doug covered the highlights of strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. I will take a moment to cover a few other items.  While there were some acquisitions and divest",1995,"Thank you, Doug. Let me start with our first quarter financial results. Doug covered the highlights of strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. I will take a moment to cover a few other items.  
While there were some acquisitions and divestitures since the first quarter of 2020, the revenue associated with them was not large enough to result in a difference between reported and organic revenue growth. Adjusted total expenses only increased 2%, thanks to ongoing productivity programs and lower T&E. Keep in mind that while T&E remains almost nonexistent, the year-over-year benefits will no longer exist beginning in the second quarter.  
The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation and an increase in taxes on foreign operations. While the effective tax rate fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of discrete tax adjustments, our full year tax rate guidance remains unchanged. 
Our diluted shares outstanding declined by 1.7 million shares. This was the result of shares repurchased before we paused the share repurchase programs due to the pending merger. During the quarter, changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact on adjusted EPS of $0.03. The only meaningful impact was in Ratings, where adjusted operating profit was positively impacted by $9 million. 
We are introducing 3 new categories to provide insight into the type of expenses that are going to be incurred related to the pending merger. The first category is transaction costs. These are costs related to completing the merger. They include legal fees, investment banking fees and filing fees. 
The second category is integration costs. These are costs to operationalize the integration. They include consulting, infrastructure and retention costs. The third category is cost to achieve. These are costs needed to enable expense and revenue synergies. They include lease terminations, severance, contract exit fees and costs related to product development, marketing and distribution enhancements.  
In the first quarter, the non-GAAP adjustments collectively totaled to a net pretax loss of $81 million. They included $9 million for merger transaction costs; $40 million for merger integration costs; there were no merger costs to achieve this quarter, these will begin to occur around the closing of the merger; a $2 million gain for an adjustment on the prior year period divestiture; $2 million for Kensho retention-related expenses; and $31 million in deal-related amortization.  
This quarter, all 4 divisions delivered increased revenue and adjusted operating profit. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted operating profit margin increased significantly in Ratings, Platts and Market Intelligence while Indices had a small decrease. I will provide color on the individual business results in a moment.  
Now turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet has low leverage and ample liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $4.5 billion, debt of $4.1 billion, an undrawn revolver capacity of $1.5 billion and no commercial paper outstanding. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA improved since the end of last year to 1.8x.  
We recently entered into the first sustainability-linked banking facility in the U.S. information services sector. Linking our line of credit to our emission reduction targets verified by the Science Based Targets Initiative is another tangible example of our commitment to becoming net zero by 2040.  
Free cash flow excluding certain items was $718 million in the first quarter, an increase of $100 million or 16% over the prior year period. Due to the pending merger with IHS Markit, share repurchases have been curtailed. If there is an open window and we have an opportunity, we will repurchase shares before the merger closes. If not, we anticipate resuming share repurchases after the merger is completed.  
Now let's turn to the division results. Ratings revenue increased 23%. This revenue growth was driven by the increase in issuance Doug already discussed. Adjusted expenses increased 9%. Excluding changes in foreign exchange rates and the acquisition of Greenwich Associates by CRISIL, adjusted expenses increased 5% primarily due to increased salary and incentives, partially offset by lower T&E. 
These resulted in a 32% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 440 basis point increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 340 basis points to 63.6%. Please keep in mind that the 67.5% adjusted segment operating profit margin achieved in the first quarter is temporarily elevated based on the surge of issuance in high-yield, levered loans and structured finance.  
In China, we see momentum and interest in our ratings picking up. In fact, we completed 18 ratings in the first quarter compared to 22 in all last year. 
Non-transaction revenue increased 10% primarily due to growth at CRISIL, fees associated with surveillance as well as elevated new entity ratings and Ratings Evaluation Services activity. Notably, revenue from Ratings Evaluation Services and new entity ratings each increased approximately 30%. In fact, there were 217 new entity ratings this quarter, the highest quarterly total in over 2 years. This was due to investors' quest for yield and increased risk appetite, enabling increasingly weaker credits to raise debt. Transaction revenue increased 35% primarily due to substantial levels of high-yield issuance, bank loan ratings and structured finance. 
This slide depicts Ratings revenue by the end markets. The largest contributor to the increase in Ratings revenue was a 27% increase in corporates. In addition, financial services revenue increased 10%, structured finance increased 34%, governments increased 18% and the CRISIL and other category increased 8%. On the right side of the slide, you can see the changes in revenue within structured finance. The clear driver of growth was a 70% increase in CLO revenue.  
Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The segment delivered 4% revenue growth primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices and data subscriptions, substantially offset by reduced exchange-traded derivative activity. In the first quarter, adjusted expenses only increased 2%. This was particularly low as the first quarter of 2020 had elevated expenses, including a $4 million catch-up charge on past royalties. The adjusted segment operating profit increased 5%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 70 basis points to 71.3%. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 69.3%. 
Revenue growth was mixed this quarter. Asset-linked fees increased 15% with gains in ETFs, mutual funds and insurance and over-the-counter derivative activity. Exchange-traded derivative revenue decreased 24% on reduced trading volumes. The first quarter of last year saw extraordinary volatility related to the pandemic market correction, creating a very difficult comparison. Data and custom subscriptions only increased 1% due to a catch-up in real-time customer reporting in the first quarter last year.  
For our Indices division, over the past year, ETF net inflows were $125 billion and market appreciation totaled $749 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.2 trillion, which is 65% higher compared to 1 year ago when the market was near its pandemic low. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 30% year-over-year. Sequentially, versus the end of 2020, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $73 billion and market appreciation totaled $143 billion.  
As I just noted, exchange-rated derivative revenue faced a difficult comparison. Activity at the CBOE decreased in the first quarter with S&P 500 Index options activity decreasing 29% and VIX futures and options activity decreasing 23%. Activity at the CME equity complex decreased 6%.  
Market Intelligence delivered reported and organic revenue growth of 4%. Collectively, revenue from recently launched products increased by over 40%. This was primarily from ESG, Panjiva aftermarket research, Marketplace and SME data. Adjusted expenses were flat as recent productivity initiatives and lower T&E offset salary growth and higher investment spending. Investment spending continues, particularly with the Marketplace and SME initiatives.  
Adjusted segment operating profit increased 13%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 260 basis points to 33.5%. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 120 basis points to 33.1%.  
Looking across the Market Intelligence components, Desktop revenue grew 2%. Data Management Solutions revenue grew 9% and Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 6%. Based on our ACV trends, we expect Desktop to grow low to mid-single digits for the full year and both Data Management Solutions and Credit Risk Solutions to grow high single digit this year.  
And now turning to Platts. Reported revenue increased 5%. Our core subscriptions increased 6%. Over the past year, oil prices have increased, resulting in a customer base that is healthier, and our retention rates remained in the mid-90s. Global Trading Services decreased 4% compared to a very strong first quarter of 2020. GTS revenue decreased mainly due to lower petroleum and natural gas volumes partially offset by increased LNG volume. 
Adjusted expenses improved 7% due to lower T&E, rent and bad debt provision. Please note that we expect expenses to pick up in the second quarter as Platts investment spending increases. Adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 520 basis points to 58.1%. The trailing 4-quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 280 basis points to 56%.  
On our first quarter earnings call last year, Doug noted that the first-ever Kensho-powered price assessments went live. One year later, we now have 19 markets that have Kensho-powered price assessments. This has resulted in more than a 75% reduction in publishing time. 
This quarter, because shipping has increasingly become an important product offering for Platts customers, we're introducing shipping as a new category. Shipping is essential to commodities trading with 90% of global trade transported by sea. S&P Global Platts has been in the business of providing transparency to the shipping market for more than 35 years. These assessments are used by market participants for physical benchmarking, and 5 are listed by exchanges as the basis of derivative contracts.  
In 2014, Platts expanded its freight offering into the dry freight market with daily assessment of freight rates for key commodity trade routes for products such as iron ore, coal, grains, sugar, bauxite and alumina. Platts now publishes hundreds of daily freight rate assessments covering all major shipping markets. To help you with your models, we have provided historical quarterly information on the new reporting basis in the appendix of this slide deck. And finally, while every category on this slide grew revenue during the quarter, the fastest growth was in petrochemicals.  
We're not providing 2021 GAAP guidance because, given the inherent uncertainty around the merger, management cannot reliably predict all the necessary components of GAAP measures. This slide depicts our adjusted guidance. While we expect that the merger will occur in the second half of this year, we're providing adjusted guidance on a stand-alone basis. The second column shows our new 2021 adjusted guidance with all the line items that James highlighted. 
We're making these changes because we now have expectations for greater revenue growth primarily due to improved outlooks in Ratings and Indices. While we expect greater revenue growth, it's not enough to change our revenue guidance. Therefore, our revenue guidance remains a mid-single-digit increase.  
Operating profit margin is increased by 20 basis points to a range of 54% to 54.5%, and this results in a $0.30 increase in adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a new range of $12.55 to $12.75. And finally, free cash flow generation has been increased by $100 million to a range of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion.  
In conclusion, we're off to a great start to 2021 with exceptional first quarter results. Vaccinations are rolling out. The global economy is poised for accelerated growth, and our customers are benefiting from these improvements. During this pandemic, we have been working hard to ensure the safety of our employees, and I want to end by thanking them for their perseverance, creativity and passion and by thanking all of you for your continued investment in S&P Global.  
And with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

We are thinking about the following in terms of what we are planning to do going forward. 
First of all, once we have an open window, the likelihood is low that the open window will be before the merger will close so that means after the merger close is more likely, what we will do is, first, we have an opportunity to catch up with respect to our capital return targets from the last few quarters because, clearly, we have not been able to deliver on those targets given these limitations. And then going forward, we have the new capital return target of at least 85%. So what you may expect is a kind of a catch-up after the merger will close and then ongoing, an increased level of capital return to our shareholders. 
I can't give you exact numbers and amounts so I can't quantify this for you. But philosophically, this is the direction of our thinking."

And therefore, the period-over-period differential looked relatively small with a growth of just 1%. Strategically, this is definitely an area we would like to grow, so the 1% is unusually low and should not be the basis of what to expect going forward. We should expect much higher growth from data and custom subscriptions. 
And we would like to grow this because we think it's a good balance in the overall revenue mix for the index business, where we have, as you know, fees over assets under management, we have the derivative trading fees. And recurring revenue, subscription-like revenues in the index business is definitely an area we will grow as well.

Well, first of all, as you know, we saw a very strong increase in results in the first quarter. Just to give you a few numbers to put them in context. As an example, investment-grade in the U.S. was down 17%, and you think about that being down 17%. At the same time, investment-grade in Europe was up 22%. 
High-yield in the U.S. was up 111%. High-yield in Europe was up 53%. Structured finance globally was up 5% but a couple of tidbits there. In the U.S., CLOs were up 63%, and in Europe, CLOs were up 300%. And bank loans were also up 70% as well. So you could see a mix of different aspects of what were up and what were down. 
We think that in the investment-grade, both in the U.S. and Europe, that there probably wasn't necessarily pull forward, to use that phrase, because you saw the 17% down in the U.S. but there was definitely an interest in investment -- non-investment-grade issuers as well as structured finance to look at the -- what they believe is going to be upcoming economic growth. Rates and spreads have been quite attractive. Spreads are at an all-time historical low in some cases or lows over the last 2 or 3 years. And there's also potentially some expectations that inflation starts coming in the market and interest rates will start going up again. 
But as you know, in our forecast that we just gave you, we saw at the original forecast that the corporates would be down about 9%. We now see them down about 7.5% for the forecast for the year. Financial services that originally were going to be up about 5%, we see them now up around 4%. It hasn't changed that much. Structured finance is where we saw a bigger swing, originally up 3% and up now about 6%. 
So when you look at the total, we had originally forecasted that the issuance for 2021 would be down about 3% and now we think it's going to be about -- down about 2%. As I started off, it's always hard to tell what pull forward is and what's coming in this pull forward, but it's possible that there could have been some in the high-yield space in particular."

The 67% level is clearly elevated due to the surge in the issuance environment and shouldn't be seen as the new normal.

But what we are seeing is a really healthy commercial activity now, and therefore, you heard us guiding to still low to mid-single-digit growth for revenue -- for Desktop revenue this year and high single-digit growth for Data Management Solutions and Credit Risk Solutions. 
Specifically with respect to the growth initiatives, we're very excited about all the new initiatives and the investments we are making. We know that it always takes a bit of time to see the revenue ramp up, and of course, from an overall basis, these numbers are still relatively small. But think about that Data Marketplace is doing very well, and we see very nice growth. Actually, the revenues in the first quarter were more or less the same of the total revenues we booked over the full year 2020. The same applies for SME, ESG, private company data. 
So overall, I think, it's clearly very, very good initiatives, and we see a lot of traction. Overall, Market Intelligence growth is expected at mid- to high single digit for the full year 2021, so mid- to high single-digit growth for the full year 2021, which we think is a very healthy growth for this business and clearly helped by some of those initiatives."

And we typically talk about Ratings, but we have other initiatives. We're investing with Platts. We're investing in our index business. And recently, we've had some very good traction with our credit portal from Market Intelligence. 
But let me give you a quick update on Ratings. Last year, we had 22 ratings that were issued in the full year of 2020, and this year, in the first quarter alone, we issued 18 ratings. We believe that the market participants are really interested and increasingly interested in the quality of the ratings themselves, the underlying ratings. As I've talked about over time, we've assembled a very, very strong team. 
The market is building up over time. We see that the market has started attracting more offshore investors as well as the foreign banks that are coming in with their wholly owned or controlled subsidiaries, which is bringing new capital and new approach to the markets. But what we're out doing is educating the market. We're doing literally hundreds of meetings a week. And when we have seminars or events when we've rolled out some new research, we're getting thousands of people joining that. 
One thing that I'm very pleased with is that -- in addition to having such a strong team, is that the ratings that we've done when you look over the last 2 years.

As we showed you in the slides themselves, we think that the economy globally is recovering, although it's going to be a choppy recovery. You've got the U.S. growing at 6.5% this year on the back of a very, very successful vaccination program. China is going to be growing at 8%. Actually, the government says themselves they're going to grow at double digit, at a 10% rate. But you also see that Europe and India and some other markets might not be growing at a very quick rate. 
But overall, given the pull of the U.S. and China and other markets that are recovering pretty quickly like the U.K., we think that the growth this year is going to be 5.5% globally. The following year is also going to be quite strong because those other markets that haven't had the vaccinations yet will continue to improve as well. So global growth over the next couple of years in the 4% to 5% range, which bode well for our businesses. 
One of the biggest trends we look at is and what we talk about is as markets become capital markets around the world. And the question we just had about China is an important one for us, as China savers move from just investing in real estate to putting money into financial assets, into pension, insurance and savings program. As foreign investors move into China, we're seeing a much more advanced capital markets. 
The European trends over the last couple of years, we've always talked about them, but they've been very strong the last couple of years. And we've seen them incredibly strong in the last couple of quarters and becoming more like capital markets. 
Now one final comment. When we take a step back and we think about our strategy that's called Powering the Markets of the Future, it allows us to take all of the different capabilities of S&P Global, whether it's the rating agency, it's the index business. And now when we think about the addition of the IHS Markit capabilities, we'll have -- right now, we'll move from -- up to 76% of our business will be coming from subscription or subscription-like recurring revenue services. That will give us some stability as we head into potentially high-growth markets over the next couple of years but as well any sort of choppiness that could come from either fiscal policy or coming out of the very low interest rate environment, et cetera. 
But we watch very carefully the external environment. We think our businesses are well prepared to support the growth of financial markets and our customers. And we always then incorporate that into our planning of where we invest and how we set up our budgets."

We also had the large ship which was stuck in the Suez Canal. 
So not only is there a heightened demand for information about shipping, it's been in the news, and we felt like our very high growth rate there gives us an emphasis and a focus to continue to invest there and grow there.

This time, they did. 
We look at a few of the key factors which drove that. Clearly, there is a lot of capital-chasing deals. We see that the M&A pipeline has increased to a level which is it's not quite historic but it's getting there, and there's a lot of M&A pipeline that is out there. It's from a combination of private equity firms, strategic investments as well as the SPACs, and that brings along with it revenue for us, which is not just an issuance revenue from loans and from high-yield bonds. We also see from new issuer fees as well as Ratings Evaluation Services that comes from that kind of a pipeline. 
But we see going forward this year, as I mentioned earlier, the overall corporate sector, we think, is going to be down with the investment-grade issuers not being very active in the market, especially in the U.S. And with the high-yield probably leveling out, we don't know exactly what's going to happen with rates and spreads. But you're right that they do usually move in opposite directions. 
There's one other point I want to make. There has been demand for loans from investors that are looking for potential increase in interest rates. You saw that the 10-year yield had started climbing over the last 3 or 4 months. And so there's a lot of demand from investors for loans which are floating rate. They want to, in a sense, kind of hedge their interest rate exposure and have floating-rate exposure. So it's embedded in our outlook for the rest of the year and are -- as well as our -- what we see is our forecast for issuance. But you're right that they don't always move lockstep, and this quarter, they did."

Well, first of all, we are very pleased with the progress we're making on our ESG franchise.

And it's -- as we call it, it's your single source of essential sustainability intelligence. Across all of S&P Global, we're now coordinating our ESG initiatives, and we have over 500 people that are dedicated full time to this. 
But to dig a little bit deeper into what you mentioned about Platts. Platts is building up an expertise in energy transition as well as transportation, and you heard us talk about shipping a few minutes ago. And when it comes to energy transition, you think about the move from coal to renewables as maybe the end of the spectrum. But in between, there is a whole new set of opportunities for Platts to be looking at, many of them we're already in. 
Hydrogen is an example. We have a hydrogen benchmark. We're the first one with a hydrogen benchmark. There is something called clean oil. There's clean natural gas. What that means is that clean oil has had -- the entire value chain of the delivery of that oil has been rebuilt to ensure that you can capture all of the methane, that there's no leakage along the way, so there's ways that refineries are run, that storage systems and pipelines are run. And we're able to provide the research and the data and the analytics and the benchmarks against something like clean oil. 
We also -- in Platts, we mentioned earlier on the call about copper. There's a whole set of new metals which are quite important to the energy transition; as an example, copper, which there's 175 pounds at least of copper in an electric vehicle. You also have lithium in the batteries. So these are areas where we also see a lot of opportunities for the benchmarks to be used from a combination of new power grids, from the metals that are in them, from the clean energy that is going to be clean transition energy. 
Finally, I'd like to mention that with the merger with IHS Markit, they also bring along a set of new products and services that bringing together will strengthen our ESG franchise. At IHS Markit, they have additional research that comes from their transportation business, which is going to be quite valuable for the Platts business in the energy transition. They also have a carbon registry. They've got a set of other carbon research products and then generally, other research and news on energy transition and ESG, which are going to be quite valuable to us. 
So we think we're very well positioned. We've just launched the Sustainable1 brand. We have an organization in place with over 500 people, and we're ready to really start growing."

Some of the benefits of that are already captured in our productivity program, so a part of the $120 million productivity program.

As you know, we did an acquisition of Trucost about 3.5 years ago, and it brought to us the premier set of data and analytics around carbon, around climate, around physical risk as well as waste, water and other types of analytical information. We also have physical risk. We have SDGs, sustainable development goals as ways that we can do analytics on that. 
But going to your -- the first part of your question. We just announced an agreement with State Street, where we're providing them information from Trucost that can be embedded in all of their modeling. All of their clients will be able to use that intelligence and that risk information and build it into State Street's existing client-focused ESG services. State Street has about $40 trillion of clients -- of assets under management that their clients hold. So we're going to be able to be providing that functionality. 
What it does is it allows those clients to have access to the carbon footprint and other environmental data that will map to their portfolios. As you know, a lot of organizations are increasingly using the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure reporting. And you can take the Trucost data, the Carbon Earnings at Risk, the Paris alignment, the physical risk data, the general carbon information and build it right into that kind of modeling. So we're very pleased with that partnership with State Street. We see this as a start of many, many other partnerships and something that for us is quite important and one of our most important strategic initiatives in the entire company."

It's not nearly as far along as something like ESG is. Crypto is just, just starting. And we feel that it's such an important asset class, it's on everyone's minds, that we needed to do some specific research around crypto. And one of the groups where we can do that, where there's a lot of relevance is within the index business. 
So this actually goes back for more than just the last few weeks or last few quarters. We've been researching crypto for a while and hadn't felt that it had the seriousness and the ability to be hedged, the ability for crypto to be really understood, to be traded, to have the liquidity in it. It was quite speculative, and we had not launched any products up until now. We haven't launched any products yet, we're close to. 
But because crypto is becoming more mainstream, it's beyond just Bitcoin. There's many other sources. They're -- you can trade them on other exchanges. There are some companies now that have listed that are crypto companies that have the standards of being a listed company. You've got -- some of the exchanges have started having futures and forwards. You're starting to see some of the conditions that would allow us to develop some products. 
As of now, our revenue model would be similar to the revenue model we have on other indices, which would either be AUM-based fees or it would come from data that we would sell to the markets that could use the data from a product or an index like that. But -- an area that's quite promising but it's really -- it's starting at 0. So I can't give you much of a projection of what the revenue might look like because it's starting so low, but something that we feel like we need to be understanding and learning and building into our portfolio of products."

We're very pleased with that. 
With respect to your question about our expense management philosophy, first of all, both companies today already have philosophies in place. As you know, we have our productivity program on the S&P Global side, where we're aiming now at the $120 million cost takeout. And IHS Markit is having a particular target with respect to margin expansion of 100 basis points on an annual basis. 
What we are planning to do once we bring the 2 companies together is to, of course, focus on the overall expense synergies that we have mentioned to you before. That's going to be a large program. In order to achieve that -- that's a period of 2 to 3 years that we are fully able to achieve those expense synergies, although the ramp-up will go fast. We are probably in year 2 at a level of 80% of the expense synergies. 
But philosophically, on top of that, you may expect us to continue to look at opportunities where we find scale across all of the different divisions that we'll have going forward. As you know, we are in a business where scale really matters particularly with all the technology investments that are needed, and we have an opportunity to leverage that across the company. We also will continue to benefit from operating leverage, just the benefit of growing the top line faster than your expense line. The incremental margin on the next dollar of revenue that comes into the company should always be higher than your average margin because you don't have your fixed cost that you need to cover anymore. So philosophically, you may expect us to continue to be very focused on taking benefit of efficiencies and scales on top of all the existing programs and commitments that we already have in place."

As you mentioned, very healthy revenue development during the quarter. If you think about the recurring part, the subscription part of the business, it was growing 6%, a little bit held back by the Global Trading Services. 
But that is understandable because Global Trading Services was really elevated in the first quarter of last year, a little bit similar to the ETDs within the index business. When the markets show a lot of volatility, there's a lot of trading, hedging that is happening. And the hedge programs are helping the GTS revenues to go up. But if you look at it in perspective, GTS was, in fact, higher on a stand-alone basis this quarter than the last 3 quarters itself. So nothing from our perspective when we look at GTS that we think that, that wouldn't be helpful going forward. It's just that the comp 1 year ago was so high. 
So all in all, if you put it together, we see healthy developments, good retention rates in the mid-90s, good commercial activity. The book of business, that is building up well. We like that. The ACV and subscription level is at that 6-ish percent at the moment. So overall, mid-single digits is the outlook for Platts for this year in terms of revenue growth. But overall, incrementally, we are definitely positive on the outlook of this business given where are the commodities markets and the health of the customer base as well."

And now you've broken out shipping, which is another potentially fast-growth area.

The way we look at it is that what's critical for us is to be the most relevant benchmark, research, analytics, news organization for commodity solutions, We think about it as you just described. The peak oil is going to be a while away. People still forecast that could be 8, 10, 15 sometimes people say even 20 years away. It depends a little bit on some of the programs around the world for energy transition and climate change. 
But when we look at that, we believe that there will be a lot of different types of services and commodities that are going to be taking the place of what is today oil that's used in transportation and manufacturing, et cetera. So that's one of the reasons we've invested in our ESG products and services. We also look at power grids. We're looking at renewable energy, at power generation. As you've heard us over time, we've also expanded into agriculture. We've looked at metals and mining. 
So we think that there's 2 aspects to this. One of them is the diversification, generally speaking, of taking the expertise we have in commodities and expanding that to other commodity classes. And we hope that, that brings us growth over time. And then the second is filling the gap of the needs of what's going to happen in climate and energy transition and moving very rapidly and aggressively into all of the spaces that will be the opportunities there like carbon registries, carbon pricing, hydrogen, et cetera. So it's kind of 2 different angles on the same way. It's the growth horizontally, and then it's filling the space for all of the opportunities related to ESG."

When you look at our overall program for the integration with IHS Markit, there is a major emphasis on technology transition, and there's a few different categories. The first is what I would start with that relates to just pure infrastructure, how do we run our rails, who are our major service providers of our desktops, of our communication services, of our cloud. 
And so there's a program on that is -- provides us the way that we run our business and everything around the business. And as you know, at S&P Global, over the last 4 years, we have put in place a centralized program to manage our data centers, our cloud transformation and all of that. And we're able to take that learning and also take what IHS Markit has done along the same way and very quickly look at a program to bring all of that together. 
The second aspect of technology relates to delivering services to customers, and that's where we have a very similar approach, where within the businesses, we have development teams, client services teams, client experience teams. And we're working on looking at the merger of those organizations in the divisions; as an example, like the Market Intelligence and Financial Services division. There's a whole set of work streams around how are we going to use the Desktop, which is the Market Intelligence/CapIQ Desktop; how are we going to use the workflow and the service and products that IHS Markit has and how you take the data and how you work those together. So that's a whole another set of work streams that we have. 
And then the third work streams relate to risk management, cyber risk. And we have an absolutely aligned attitude and policies on ensuring that we always operate at the highest standards of risk and control and compliance as well as ensuring that we're ahead of any sort of cyber risk. 
And then the fourth is data sciences and artificial intelligence, natural language processing, et cetera. We have Kensho, which has been a fantastic organization that joined S&P Global 3 years ago. And what they've been able to achieve is really unprecedented. And we talked right now about NERD on this call. But as you know, Kensho has had a really strong track record at S&P Global. And at IHS Markit, they have the data lake, and as well, they also have data sciences teams as we do across all the businesses so thinking about that community of data sciences and ways to think about the most modern approach to running technology. 
So we have teams working in parallel, working together across all of those different work streams. We think this is one of the advantages of the scale of the business overall. We can really take advantage of large global scale and technology, and we can also take advantage of large global scale of our data science, of our machine learning, our natural language processing. And so we're very excited. This is going to be one of the most important upsides of working with IHS Markit."

Presenting on today's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
We issued a news release with our results earlier today. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com. 
Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in today's conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
In addition, as announced late last year, S&P Global and IHS Markit entered into a definitive merger agreement. In March, shareholders of both companies overwhelmingly voted in favor of the merger. The merger is pending regulatory approval, and we currently expect to close in the fourth quarter of 2021. This call will touch on the merger, but does not constitute an offer to sell or buy or the solicitation of any offer to buy or sell any securities nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities law of any such jurisdiction. No offering of securities shall be made except by means of prospectus meeting requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933. 
In connection with the proposed transaction, S&P Global and IHS Markit has filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which includes a joint proxy statement and prospectus. S&P Global and IHS Markit have filed other documents regarding the proposed transaction with the SEC. Investors and security holders of S&P Global or IHS Markit stock are urged carefully read the entire registration statement and joint proxy statement prospectus, which is available on our website and sec.gov. 
In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management. 
The earnings release and the slides contain exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This call, especially a discussion of our outlook, contains statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in our filings with the SEC and on our website. 
I would also like to call your attention to a European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on investor and potentially the company. 
We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Ola Fadahunsi at (212) 438-2296. 
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?"

Welcome to today's earnings call. At the beginning of the quarter, we knew that the earnings in the second quarter of 2020 had been very strong due to a surge in liquidity driven investment-grade issuance and from management actions we took to reduce spending to deal with the incredible uncertainty from the COVID pandemic. 
It's remarkable that the financial results we reported today surpassed those of a year ago. These results don't just happen. Our people make them happen, and I want to thank them all. 
Now let's turn to our second quarter financial highlights. We reported very strong financial results with revenue increasing 8% and all 4 businesses delivering revenue and adjusted operating profit growth. Indices delivered the strongest revenue growth based on the large gains in ETF AUM. 
Adjusted expense growth was higher than normal at 9% largely due to significant cost controls in the prior period due to the pandemic and increased performance-related incentives this quarter. After raising guidance on our first quarter earnings call, we're raising 2021 guidance again based on these strong results and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Ewout will provide details in a moment. 
I'd also like to share some additional highlights from the second quarter. The most important initiative of the year continues to be our upcoming merger with IHS Markit. This is an incredibly transformative opportunity for our company and our customers. 
Momentum for the merger with IHS Markit continues to build. Countless employees from both companies are working together on numerous integration planning work streams. 
We continue to engage with global regulators in anticipation of closing the merger in the fourth quarter of 2021. While we don't have any new updates on the merger to share with you today, I can assure you that considerable progress is being made. 
The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average celebrated 125 years this quarter, and we introduced several new ESG-related products. We'll provide further details on these accomplishments on today's call. 
And finally, CRISIL named Amish Mehta as the new Managing Director and CEO effective October 1. Amish joined CRISIL as President and Chief Financial Officer in 2014 and assumed his current responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer in 2017. He has over 2 decades of diverse experience across telecommunications, oil and gas and business advisory services. Amish will succeed Ashu Suyash, who has decided to move on to set up her own venture. 
Over the last 6 years, Ashu has led CRISIL's transformation to become a leading, agile and innovative global analytics company. Under her leadership, CRISIL has not only consolidated its ratings leadership position but also grown its global business. Ashu has been at the forefront of the ESG agenda for CRISIL and the launch of several new offerings and platforms in India in the global markets. I'd like to express our deep appreciation of Ashu's leadership and contributions. 
To recap the financial results for the second quarter, revenue increased 8% to $2.1 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 8%, and our adjusted operating profit margin declined 40 basis points to 58.3%. 
As you know, we measure and track adjusted operating profit margin on a trailing 4-quarter basis, which increased 90 basis points to 54.5%. As a result, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 6%. 
Each quarter, we highlight a few key business drivers and important projects underway. This quarter, let's start with ratings bond issuance trends. During the second quarter, global bond issuance decreased 9%. In the U.S., bond issuance in aggregate decreased 19% as investment-grade decreased 51%, high-yield decreased 8%, public finance decreased 7%, while structured finance increased 229% due to large increases in every category, particularly CLOs, which increased 580%. 
European bond issuance decreased 11% as investment-grade decreased 32%, high-yield increased 104%, and structured finance increased 74% with gains in every asset class except ABS. Of particular note were CLOs, which increased more than 300%. In Asia, bond issuance increased 8% overall. 
The data on this slide only depicts bond issuance. When we include bank loan volumes, overall global issuance decreased 2%. One of the first questions investors ask whenever there is a strong quarter of issuance is how much of this was pull-forward? On this slide, we show the profile of bond maturity data from different points in time. 
As you can see, the upcoming maturities in the second half of this year and in the next few years have not changed much in the past 6 months. So despite the flurry of issuance in the last few months, there doesn't appear to have been much pull-forward activity. 
Since bank loan ratings are an important element of Ratings revenue, and they're not included in our bond issuance slide, we like to disclose our bank loan rating revenue each quarter. The bank loan market continues to see strong demand amid the reopening of the economy and the vaccination rollout as potential inflation puts the floating rate asset class in focus. With an incredibly strong CLO market and retail investors continuing to pour money into loan ETFs and mutual funds, the market has easily digested these elevated volumes. 
In fact, assets at leverage loan funds jumped to an 18-month high at the end of June. All of this has contributed to an unprecedented level of bank loan rating revenue this year with the first half of 2021 already exceeding all last year. Second quarter revenue was $157 million, more than triple the second quarter of 2020. 
The next 2 slides look at the combined high-yield issuance and leveraged loan volume for the U.S. and Europe. Data is not readily available for the rest of the world. 
This slide shows that the combination of global leveraged loan and high-yield issuance in the first and second quarters of 2021 has dramatically exceeded any quarterly total in the past 3 years. This slide depicts the combination of high-yield issuance and leveraged loan volume by the use of proceeds of the funds raised. The category with the largest increase in the second quarter was M&A and LBO activity. 
The leveraged loan market and the CLO market are dependent on one another as many of the leveraged loans end up in CLOs. The CLO market continued at a torrid pace in the second quarter. Investor demand for floating rate investments, their search for yield and the relatively strong CLO performance during the 2020 pandemic have contributed to increased CLO issuance this year. 
There are not a lot of companies in the world still selling a product they created 125 years ago. But on May 26, 1896, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was launched. Still serving as Wall Street's bellwether, at the end of 2020, $37 billion of ETF AUM was indexed or benchmarked against this iconic Dow Jones Index. 
At the time of the Dow's introduction, investing in the stock market was considered highly speculative activity. And so in its early years, the Dow achieved little prominence outside of Wall Street. Ironically, it was the market crash of 1929 that brought the Dow's reputation to the attention of everyday investors as the index lost nearly 30% of its value over the course of 2 days. 
Before that, investors had been more focused on their individual stocks. But after the crash, investors were more interested in following general market conditions that Dow made that possible. 
Each year, S&P Dow Jones Indices releases the annual survey of assets. This chart depicts the highlights of that survey for 2020. Asset levels in actively managed funds that benchmark against our indices increased 23% to $11.4 trillion. Assets and passive funds invested in products indexed to our indices increased 17% to $7.5 trillion. 
Numerous indices support the $7.5 trillion, including the S&P 500, the largest with $5.4 trillion in assets. There are several other notable categories with considerable AUM growth, including sector indices that increased 24%. Global indices has increased 62% and fixed income indices, which grew 86%. 
Just over a year ago, we featured the launch of the S&P Global Marketplace on our earnings call. Today, I'd like to share with you the tremendous reception it has received by our clients. The site currently features 130 million tiles of content and solutions, representing all 4 divisions and Kensho. So far, we have booked 189 deals, and there have been 600,000 page views. 
We also recently launched Marketplace Workbench in partnership with Databricks, allowing clients access to a modern cloud-based platform for big data testing and analysis. This slide also depicts the most popular categories and the client types with the most active users. Congratulations to all those involved in creating a site that uses unique technology to simplify our client's ability to identify, access, evaluate and utilize unique data and solutions. If you haven't visited marketplace.spglobal.com yet, I encourage you to do so. 
Turning to our investments in ESG. We continue to launch new products and grow our ESG franchise across the company. After recording ESG revenue of $65 million in 2020, we delivered revenue of $43 million in the first half of this year, with second quarter revenue increased over 50% to $22 million versus the prior period. 
With the launch of social and sustainability framework alignment opinions that we introduced on our call last quarter, Ratings now has 4 products. Overall, Ratings completed 13 ESG evaluations, 11 Green Evaluations 16 SAM benchmark engagements and 10 social and sustainability framework alignment opinions in the quarter. 
Market Intelligence launched electric quarterly reports tracking U.S. power purchase agreements. These provide our clients with broad new insights in how energy revenues and renewable power purchase agreement pricing are trending. 
Market Intelligence also entered into an agreement to provide Trucost carbon and environmental data to State Street's clients. These clients will access functionality, including mapping carbon footprint and other environmental data portfolios, TCFD reporting features, applying Trucost Carbon's Earnings at Risk, Paris alignment and physical risk data intelligence. 
We launched a climate credit analytics product in partnership with Oliver Wyman to help banks comply with climate stress testing regulations. And we launched an SFDR data solution that allows firms operating in the European Union to meet newly formed sustainable finance disclosure regulation requirements by drawing on a wide range of ESG data sets from across S&P Global. 
In Indices, we had $25.8 billion of ESG ETF AUM at the end of the second quarter. This is an increase of 290% since the end of the second quarter of last year. Our Indices business also launched ESG Dividend Aristocrats Index series, partnered with Evolve, for the launch of index ETFs that offset the carbon footprint of stocks and worked with a German federal pension plan that reallocated EUR 9 billion of assets to equity indices utilizing our EU climate transition benchmark. 
Platts began publishing daily carbon credit price assessments, reflecting nature-based carbon credit and household device carbon credit projects that are intended to bring additional transparency to carbon prices and carbon trading activity. Platts launched the world's first daily carbon neutral LNG price assessment, which involves offsetting the carbon emissions through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits. Platts also strengthened its global suite of hydrogen prices with new hydrogen price assessments for the U.K. and a new 2-degree warming scenario to the market-leading global integrated energy model. 
Let me now turn to our outlook for global issuance and GDP. After issuance growth of 15% in 2019 and 17% in 2020, our Ratings Research Group's prior 2021 forecast called for a decrease of 2%. The latest forecast was issued earlier this week and calls for a decrease of 1% without international public finance. 
The level of issuance in 2020 remains, in aggregate, hard to beat, but the 2021 total should still come in at a historically high total, likely surpassing 2019. The 2 largest changes compared to the forecast last quarter includes structured finance, which went from a 6% gain to a 20% gain; and nonfinancials, which went from a 7.5% decrease to a 12% decrease. 
Please note that this is a bond issuance forecast. This is not a revenue forecast. For example, it doesn't address nontransaction revenue and doesn't include leverage loan activity. 
The peak of the pandemic appears to be behind us, particularly for the most advanced economies as vaccinations become widely available, severe COVID-19 cases fall and economies reopen. But we still see inevitable fits and starts with COVID risk still elevated. This is happening earlier and faster than previously assumed, driving both growth and inflation. 
The macro outlook continues to improve. We have raised our global growth forecast by 40 basis points to 5.9% in 2021. This reflects stronger performance across the board in the first half of the year. Our 2022 to 2024 outlook shows a stronger U.S. but lagging emerging markets. 
Risks are shifting from the pandemic to the pace of the recovery. In particular, rising inflation in the U.S. and some emerging markets points to a possible bumpy transition from the ultra-low rates and easy financing conditions to the post COVID-19 steady state. And with economies on demand, policy normalization and sustainability are coming into sharper focus. 
Finally, Platts is forecasting that oil will remain above $65 a barrel through 2021. This is positive for the health of the oil industry. 
I will now turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?"

While there were some modest divestitures since the",1807,"Thank you. Let me start with our second quarter financial results. Doug covered the highlights of strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. I will take a moment to cover a few other items. 
While there were some modest divestitures since the second quarter of 2020, the revenue associated with them was not large enough to result in a difference between reported and organic revenue growth. Adjusted total expenses increased 9%, and I'll provide some additional color on this in the next slide. 
Our net interest expense declined 20% due to the refinancing of a substantial portion of our debt last year. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate was due to an increase in taxes on foreign operations and the successful resolution of tax examinations in the prior year. Our full year tax rate guidance remains unchanged. 
Our adjusted expense growth during the quarter was larger than normal at 9%. There are several reasons: first, second quarter 2020 expenses were impacted by pandemic-related management actions taken last year; second, due to strong financial results year-to-date, performance-related costs, including incentives, commissions and royalties, have increased; third, ForEx increased expenses; finally, I want to make it clear that our business-as-usual expenses remain under control. 
During the quarter, changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact on adjusted EPS of $0.03. The only meaningful impact was in Ratings, where adjusted operating profit was positively impacted by $15 million. 
Last quarter, we introduced 3 new categories to provide insights into the type of expenses that are going to be incurred related to the pending merger. The first category is transaction costs. These are costs related to completing the merger. They include legal fees, investment banking fees and filing fees. 
The second category is integration costs. These are costs to operationalize the integration. They include consulting, infrastructure and retention cost. 
The third category is cost to achieve. These are costs needed to enable expense and revenue synergies. They include lease terminations, severance, contract exit fees and investments related to product development, marketing and distribution enhancements. 
During the second quarter, the non-GAAP adjustments collectively totaled to a net pretax loss of $75 million. They included $9 million for merger transaction costs, primarily legal fees; $39 million from merger integration costs, primarily consulting fees; $2 million for cost to achieve; a $3 million lease impairment; and $22 million in deal-related amortization. And there was an after-tax adjustment with respect to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities related to a U.K. income tax rate change. 
This quarter, all 4 divisions delivered increased revenue and adjusted operating profit. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted operating profit margin increased significantly in Platts and Market Intelligence, while Ratings had a modest gain and Indices had a decrease of 100 basis points. I'll provide color on the individual business results in a moment. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet has low leverage and ample liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $5.2 billion, debt of $4.1 billion, an undrawn revolver capacity of $1.5 billion and no commercial paper outstanding. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA improved since the end of last year to 1.8x. 
Free cash flow, excluding certain items, was $1.6 billion in the first half of 2021, an increase of more than $100 million or 8% over the prior year period. Due to the pending merger with IHS Markit, share repurchases have been suspended. 
Now let's turn to the division results. Ratings revenue increased 7% as strong investment-grade comps were more than offset by strength in bank loan ratings, structured finance and nontransaction activity. Adjusted expenses increased 10%, primarily due to increased incentives, salaries and ForEx. These resulted in a 5% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 100 basis point decrease in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 63.4%. 
Please keep in mind that the 68.1% adjusted segment operating profit margin achieved in the second quarter is temporarily elevated based on the surge of issuance in high-yield, leverage loans and structured finance. 
In China, we see continued momentum and interest in our ratings. We completed 13 ratings in the second quarter and 31 in the first half of 2021 compared to 22 in all last year. Nontransaction revenue increased 19% primarily due to a more than tripling in new entity ratings revenue, growth in fees associated with surveillance and Rating Evaluation Service revenue that more than doubled due to heightened levels of M&A activity. Investors search for yields and increased risk appetite continues to enable weaker credits to raise debt. Transaction revenue decreased with a substantial decline in investment-grade bond issuance from last year's record quarter, mostly offset by an increase in bank loan ratings activity, structured finance and high-yield bond issuance. 
This slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributor to the increase in Ratings revenue was the 86% increase in structured finance, driven by CLOs, ABS, CMBS and RMBS. In addition, corporates declined 2%. Financial services revenue increased 4%, governments increased 5%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 12%. 
Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The segment delivered 16% revenue growth primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices. In the second quarter, adjusted expenses increased 19% largely due to increased incentives, salaries, royalties and new product investments. The adjusted segment operating profit increased 15%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 80 basis points to 71.1%. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin remained strong, but decreased 100 basis points to 69.2%. 
Revenue growth was mixed this quarter. Asset-linked fees increased 28%, primarily from gains in ETFs, augmented by smaller gains in mutual funds and insurance and over-the-counter derivative activity. Exchange-rated derivative revenue decreased 20% on reduced trading volumes. The second quarter of last year had elevated volatility related to the pandemic and the stock market recovery. Data and custom subscriptions increased 11%. 
While the prominence of our U.S. indices is widely understood, we have been partnering with exchanges around the world to expand our international presence. These include relationships with exchanges in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Korea and others. 
This chart is a new disclosure that depicts the steady progress we are making to grow revenue in these markets. The revenue is split across asset-linked fees and data and custom subscriptions. 
For our Indices division, over the past year, ETF net inflows were $173 billion, and market appreciation totaled $653 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.4 trillion, which is 51% higher compared to 1 year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 56% year-over-year. Sequentially versus the end of the first quarter, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $64 billion, and market appreciation totaled $158 billion. 
As I just noted, exchange-rated derivative revenue faced a strong comparison. Nevertheless, activity at the CBOE increased in the second quarter with S&P 500 index options activity increasing 8% and fixed futures and options activity increasing 43%. Activity at the CME equity complex decreased 12%. 
And here is another new disclosure. You have seen that the revenue from exchange-rated derivative activity can be very volatile from quarter-to-quarter. What I don't think is apparent is the strong underlying annual growth that has taken place. This chart depicts a 7-year CAGR of 9%. While the trend line is not perfectly upward sloping, the annual growth is much more consistent than the quarterly figures might suggest. 
Market Intelligence delivered revenue growth of 8%. More than 1/3 of the revenue growth was from recent product investments, which increased by more than 40%. This was primarily from ESG and 451 Research, Panjiva, S&P Global Marketplace, aftermarket research and SME data. 
Adjusted expenses increased 6% primarily due to cost of sales and royalties. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 11%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 100 basis points to 35.4%. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 100 basis points to 33.4%. 
Looking across the Market Intelligence, there was solid growth in each category. Desktop revenue grew 5%. Data Management Solutions revenue grew 13%, and Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 10%. 
And now turning to Platts. Reported revenue increased 9%, an uplift over recent quarters. Our core subscriptions increased 9%, including about $2 million in benefits from the timing of contract renewals. It is notable that more than 1/4 of the growth came from new products, including ESG and LNG. 
Oil prices and commodity prices in general are at a level where most of our customers can profitably operate. Global Trading Services increased 4% mainly due to strong LNG and petroleum volumes, partially offset by lower natural gas volumes. 
Adjusted expenses increased 10% primarily due to incentives, growth initiatives and commissions, and the adjusted segment operating profit increased 8%. Adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 57.9%. The trailing 4-quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 170 basis points to 55.9%. While petrochemicals was the fastest-growing category this quarter, every category delivered meaningful growth. 
And one final new disclosure. Here, you can see the impressive revenue growth that Global Trading Services has delivered over the past 10 years. While this category is volatile from quarter-to-quarter, it has demonstrated a 10-year CAGR of 18%. 
We're not providing 2021 GAAP guidance because given the inherent uncertainty around the merger, management cannot reliably predict all the necessary components of GAAP measures. And this slide depicts our adjusted guidance. While we expect that the merger will occur in the fourth quarter of this year, we're providing adjusted guidance on a stand-alone basis. 
The third column shows our new 2021 adjusted guidance with all the line items that changed highlighted. We're making these changes because we now expect greater revenue growth primarily due to improved outlooks in Ratings and Indices. Therefore, our revenue guidance is increased from a mid-single-digit increase to a high single-digit increase. Corporate unallocated is decreased by $5 million to a new range of $135 million to $145 million due to less project spending than originally anticipated. Operating profit margin is increased by 40 basis points to a new range of 54.4% to 54.9%. And this results in a $0.40 increase to adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a new range of $12.95 to $13.15. And finally, free cash flow generation has been increased by $100 million to a range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion. 
In conclusion, 2021 is turning out to be a very strong year for the company. All our businesses are delivering solid growth. We continue to expand our ESG product offerings, and we are very excited about the upcoming merger with IHS Markit. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

And then for 2024, the forecast is that will exceed $300 million in total ESG revenues. So we're growing very rapidly, and we are quite positive about the outlook."

And for the full year, the best direction I can give to you is think about margin for the full year in line with where we are for a trailing 4-quarter basis. 
From a longer-term perspective, we don't have new aspirational margin targets for our divisions. We think the right moment to announce those is after completion of the merger with IHS Markit. But a couple of factors that you have to take into consideration. Of course, there continue to be positive secular trends behind the Ratings business. As long as GDP is going up and we see positive economic momentum, there will be positive revenue growth for the Ratings business. 
Also, of course, all our businesses have always operating leverage. So operating leverage will be a benefit. We do think, over time, we need to invest in some analytical capacity because of the level of volumes that we're seeing. But that's a good problem to have. So some investments need to be made in analytical capacity. So that is the best I can give to you with respect to the outlook. But overall, I would say very strong results by the Ratings business and really topping a very strong year last year."

So the data security law for onshore businesses should -- we should be able to meet those requirements because we're building new businesses from scratch, and they're onshore businesses. 
Related to the general business environment, clearly, there's a lot of noise at the macro level between the United States and China. We pay attention to that very closely.

And this last quarter had some of the largest swings I've ever seen since I've been in this company of different asset classes of issuance. 
As an example, the -- in the U.S., corporates were down 63% year-on-year of issuance. Europe was down 35% in corporates. Investment-grade globally was down 26%, although high-yield was up 27%. You saw some of the numbers. CLOs were up almost 500% globally, 580% in the U.S. So we saw a lot of swings. 
But we take a step back and we look at a few really important factors for going forward on issuance, both for what's going to be the rest of the year, which we mentioned, we expect will be down about 1% for total issuance. And I'll come back to that in a second. But we look at economic growth, which is starting to become very robust. We do think it will level out once we get through the pandemic, but at a pretty robust level for the U.S., Europe and Asia. That's beneficial for us. 
Once debt goes on to balance sheets as bonds or as rated loans, it typically continues to be rated loans or a rated bond. So we see the pipeline of that. That's been increasing. In addition, we watch things like mergers and acquisitions, which are very robust right now, which are helping the current environment, especially for high-yield and loans. 
But when you look at the ability for markets around the world to shift from being bank markets to capital markets, you look at overall economic growth. You look at low interest rates, which we expect are going to continue for some time in the major developed markets. These are all things that are beneficial for our long-term outlook for Ratings. 
Since you did ask the question very briefly on 2021 forecast, we expect that the overall market is going to be down about 1%. Last quarter, we said that was going to be down about 2%. So that's a short-term view. That doesn't include loans, which we still think are also going to be robust for the rest of the year."

So first of all, let me go through the components then of that 1% down. We look at the corporates, and we -- corporate so far are down this year, about 12% overall. As I mentioned earlier so far this year in corporates, they're down 4",613,"Yes. Thanks, George. So first of all, let me go through the components then of that 1% down. We look at the corporates, and we -- corporate so far are down this year, about 12% overall. As I mentioned earlier so far this year in corporates, they're down 40% in the second quarter. But we expect that overall, they're going to be down about 12%. So that's that category. 
Financial services have actually been a little bit more robust than we had originally expected. We thought they were going to be up about 4%. But we think it will go up as high as 10%, but our midpoint is about 7.5%. 
Just as an anecdote on that, the last quarter, Bank of America issued $28 billion. JPMorgan issued $23 billion. It looks like the banks are starting to use our balance sheets again. And in Europe, all of the largest -- of the 10 largest issuers in Europe that were all in the $4 billion to $6 billion range, almost all of those exception of one were a financial institution. So we think financial issuance will be up for the year. 
Structured finance, we think, will be up about 20% for the year. We see that the structured finance market is still going quite strong. As we mentioned in the second quarter, it was up over 147% overall. We don't think that, that pace will continue in structured finance, but we see it up 20%. We had originally said in our prior forecast it would be up about 6% in 2021 as opposed to now raising it to 20%. 
We look at public finance. We still think that's going to be down about 5%. Public finance issuers have not been as active. If there is an infrastructure program approved in Washington and we do see a revitalization of infrastructure investment in the U.S., public finance will probably go along with that. 
So overall, we see bond issuance down about 1% when you add all of that up together. We think that loans are going to continue to be strong. I don't have a specific number for the year what they're going to be up, but they'll continue to be up. You saw the numbers of how strong they've been compared to the prior years. But the pipeline is strong. The M&A pipeline is strong. 
When it comes to interest rates, interest rates are still quite low. Spreads are low, and interest rates are low. Spreads are not at the lowest they've ever been, but they're close to low areas, especially after the spike that we saw last year in the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter when the pandemic first started. So we do think that there's going to be a lot of strength in loans and then subsequently from that CLOs as well for the rest of the year. 
Just one other tidbit. We see that in the ABS area, which goes between the loans and ABS, we see a lot of activity related to autos, related to corporate banks, corporate restructurings of their balance sheets, et cetera. So we still see a lot of activity, interest rate-driven. But recall that last year, there was a lot of liquidity issuance that was driven by investment-grade corporates. That has basically gone away, and you saw that from the big drop. And that's been substituted now by loans, by structured finance, by ABS, et cetera. We think that, that's going to continue for the rest of the year. And then as I mentioned in an earlier question, we see that all of this positions us well for the long run."

And I think you probably can derive from that the outlook for the second half of the year. 
So for Ratings, we are now expecting revenue growth at a high single-digit level. So that's up from mid last quarter to now high single digits. Market Intelligence is still at a level of mid- to high single digit. Platts has gone up from mid- to mid- to high single-digit revenue growth. And the index business now we are expecting low double-digit revenue growth. That's up from high single digits to low double digits. 
So 3 of the 4 segments we're increasing the revenue outlook for the full year. And then also for the company as a whole, the revenue outlook has been increased to high single-digit growth."

Kensho, in the meantime, has developed a complete AI toolkit for unstructured data with many different elements that are in that toolkit about entity linking, data extraction, speech to text, search, Codex, named entity recognition, many other initiatives that have been developed. And those tools are being used across the company. 
Let me give you 2 specific examples, including the one that you were referring to with respect to Scribe. So Scribe is the speech-to-text algorithm engine. And we are using that for our own businesses, for example, for our earnings call transcript business. And the more you can teach those algorithms based on the actual activity, the better they become, the stronger is your engine. So all of our activities with respect to our earnings call transcript business is now being done through Kensho Scribe. And the quality is really very high at the moment and further improving over time. 
That's indeed being sold now also to external customers. So we have a few external customers now that are interested in this engine because it's one of the best products that is out there. And so we are actually very excited about the fact that Kensho can now pivot to external customers as well with some of its products. 
Let me give you a second example. This is about Market-on-Close in the Platts business. At 26 markets now this is being implemented, and we have reduced 75% of the time between the market close and publishing our prices, which is, of course, very important for our customers because the closer that time gap, the better it is for them, 14 markets still to go. 
So in other words, Kensho initiatives are continuing, and we continue to be very excited about the transformative nature that Kensho is bringing to S&P Global."

When we look at the IHS Markit merger and when we originally conceived of it and as we continue to go through our analysis to work on our integration planning, we see that there's lots of opportunities across the company. It goes well beyond just the data. There are many different ways that we can have complementary data usage. 
As an example, the fixed income indices is one of the ones that we talk a lot about because they have fixed income data. They've got the fixed income business that already exists. They have the reference data. So we can quickly put their index business together with ours, increase our asset class coverage as well as innovate in new areas like multi-asset class indices. 
So beyond just the data usage and the data linkage across the company, there's many more opportunities. As an example, deploying some of IHS Markit's software, software tools, workflow tools, things that we don't have as much at S&P Global, bringing that expertise into 2 markets -- into new markets like ESG, like climate. We're very excited about things like that. 
So the combination goes well beyond data. Data is fundamental to it. Bringing those data together like their Data Lake and our Marketplace reference data that can be used across our company, that's sort of a nice to have. It's necessary. But beyond that, to be sufficient and to really make this exciting, it goes also into analytics, into research, into software tools, et cetera. So we continue to be excited about this. And data is fundamental to it, but it goes well beyond that."

But there's -- if you want to think it's almost like a supply and a demand issue. There's an incredible amount of supply of liquidity. A lot of that liquidity is positioning for a higher rate or an inflationary market, which means that they've moved into floating rate instruments. And so you see a large amount of funds have moved into floating rate instruments, which means that there's a lot of liquidity available for floating rate loans and CLOs. So you can see that there's been a shift of liquidity in that direction. 
But when we look at this more in the longer run, there is a debt cycle, which is -- we're going through right now, but that's going on to people's balance sheets. There is a large amount of that issuance has been investment-grade, and the investment-grade has been holding up. The debt levels and interest rate coverage levels are still strong. We've been holding to our standards for what would be an investment-grade issuer. 
And then when you look at the many, many high-yield issuers who have been coming out, clearly, the market understands the risk they're taking when they invest in a deep, high-yield issuance. But we think that when you look at some of the slides that we showed today of the balance sheets, of the maturity schedules which are coming up that this bodes well in the long run for the overall markets. 
That doesn't mean that every single quarter is going to be -- always be up. We saw this quarter a lot of movement of some very strong growth in some areas, a lot of decreases in others. And we expect that we're going to see that, especially as the markets reaccommodate."

Buybacks, we would probably not be able or most likely not be able to do buybacks before the completion of the merger. Then our thinking at the moment is that after completion of the merger, we do a catch-up. And a catch-up is in relation to those period that we're not able to return capital to our shareholders at the level of our capital targets, the at least 75% return of capital targets that we were not able to achieve since the mid of last year till the fourth quarter of this year. 
Also, you have to take into account there that IHS Markit itself cannot do any share buybacks. So you have to take that in consideration as well as potential proceeds of some of the divestitures. 
I would like to do that catch-up because we would like to go as quickly as possible into the rhythm of our new capital return target of at least 85% of our free cash flow. And the combined company will be a company that very soon after the completion will get to a level of approximately $5 billion or north of $5 billion of free cash flow, very significant amount. So we would like to go back into a normal rhythm as quickly as possible. 
I can't give you specific numbers. I know there's a big question on The Street about numbers in terms of the buybacks and the catch-up. I can't give you specific numbers.

Well, first of all, I'm encouraged to see that there is a bipartisan process going on in Washington around infrastructure. It's something that we need in this country, both the bipartisanship as well as investment in infrastructure. 
We think that there will be a few potential benefits from that. The first is just general economic growth. We have done a lot of research and analysis on infrastructure over the years, and infrastructure generally leads to growth beyond just the investment in infrastructure itself. We estimate that it's somewhere about 1.7 to 1.9x additional economic growth that comes from infrastructure. 
So when you build an airport, around an airport, you get rental cars, you get gas stations, you get activity inside the airport from people buying food and gifts, et cetera. So we see that there is a potential economic benefit, which should help growth. It also helps jobs. 
All of that helps business climate generally, which obviously is beneficial to us. More specifically, if there is an infrastructure bill, we do think that despite much of it being discussed as being funded by the public sector that there will be opportunities for public-private partnerships, which would bring with them potentially debt financing. The municipal bond market could take on more activity if there's going to be local investment in infrastructure. And then the companies themselves, construction companies, the large projects, they're going to need financing as they go through the projects themselves. 
So we think that this will be, in general, beneficial to the overall economy. I think it's a good signal from Washington. And then overall, it could have some benefits to us, particularly for the Ratings business."

So investing in new product initiatives, we believe, is a very positive thing for the index business. And that is exactly what we are doing at this point in time. We're investing in ESG indices.

Welcome to today's earnings call. At the beginning of the quarter, we knew that the earnings in the second quarter of 2020 had been very strong due to a surge in liquidity-driven investment-grade issuance and from management actions we took to reduce spending to deal with the incredible uncertainty from the COVID pandemic. It's remarkable that the financial results we reported today surpassed those of a year ago. These results don't just happen. Our people make them happen, and I want to thank them all.
Now let's turn to our second quarter financial highlights. We reported very strong financial results, with revenue increasing 8% and all 4 businesses delivering revenue and adjusted operating profit growth. Indices delivered the strongest revenue growth based on the large gains in ETF AUM.
Adjusted expense growth was higher than normal at 9% largely due to significant cost controls in the prior period due to the pandemic and increased performance-related incentives this quarter. After raising guidance on our first quarter earnings call, we're raising 2021 guidance again based on these strong results and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Ewout will provide details in a moment.
I'd also like to share some additional highlights from the second quarter. The most important initiative of the year continues to be our upcoming merger with IHS Markit. This is an incredibly transformative opportunity for our company and our customers. Momentum for the merger with IHS Markit continues to build. Countless employees from both companies are working together on numerous integration planning work streams.
We continue to engage with global regulators in anticipation of closing the merger in the fourth quarter of 2021. While we don't have any new updates on the merger to share with you today, I can assure you that considerable progress is being made.
The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average celebrated 125 years this quarter, and we introduced several new ESG-related products. We'll provide further details on these accomplishments on today's call.
And finally, CRISIL named Amish Mehta as the new Managing Director and CEO effective October 1. Amish joined CRISIL as President and Chief Financial Officer in 2014 and assumed his current responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer in 2017. He has over 2 decades of diverse experience across telecommunications, oil and gas and business advisory services. Amish will succeed Ashu Suyash, who has decided to move on to set up her own venture.
Over the last 6 years, Ashu has led CRISIL's transformation to become a leading, agile and innovative global analytics company. Under her leadership, CRISIL has not only consolidated its ratings leadership position but also grown its global business. Ashu has been at the forefront of the ESG agenda for CRISIL and the launch of several new offerings and platforms in India and the global markets. I'd like to express our deep appreciation of Ashu's leadership and contributions.
To recap the financial results for the second quarter, revenue increased 8% to $2.1 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 8%, and our adjusted operating profit margin declined 40 basis points to 58.3%. As you know, we measure and track adjusted operating profit margin on a trailing 4-quarter basis, which increased 90 basis points to 54.5%. As a result, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 6%.
Each quarter, we highlight a few key business drivers and important projects underway. This quarter, let's start with ratings bond issuance trends. During the second quarter, global bond issuance decreased 9%. In the U.S., bond issuance in aggregate decreased 19% as investment-grade decreased 51%, high-yield decreased 8%, public finance decreased 7%, while structured finance increased 229% due to large increases in every category, particularly CLOs, which increased 580%.
European bond issuance decreased 11% as investment-grade decreased 32%, high-yield increased 104%, and structured finance increased 74% with gains in every asset class except ABS. Of particular note were CLOs, which increased more than 300%. In Asia, bond issuance increased 8% overall.
The data on this slide only depicts bond issuance. When we include bank loan volumes, overall global issuance decreased 2%.
One of the first questions investors ask whenever there is a strong quarter of issuance is how much of this was pull-forward? On this slide, we show the profile of bond maturity data from different points in time. As you can see, the upcoming maturities in the second half of this year and in the next few years have not changed much in the past 6 months. So despite the flurry of issuance in the last few months, there doesn't appear to have been much pull-forward activity.
Since bank loan ratings are an important element of ratings revenue, and they're not included in our bond issuance slide, we like to disclose our bank loan rating revenue each quarter. The bank loan market continues to see strong demand amid the reopening of the economy and the vaccination rollout as potential inflation puts the floating rate asset class in focus. With an incredibly strong CLO market and retail investors continuing to pour money into loan ETFs and mutual funds, the market has easily digested these elevated volumes. In fact, assets at leverage loan funds jumped to an 18-month high at the end of June. All of this has contributed to an unprecedented level of bank loan rating revenue this year, with the first half of 2021 already exceeding all last year. Second quarter revenue was $157 million, more than triple the second quarter of 2020.
The next 2 slides look at the combined high-yield issuance and leveraged loan volume for the U.S. and Europe. Data is not readily available for the rest of the world.
This slide shows that the combination of global leveraged loan and high-yield issuance in the first and second quarters of 2021 has dramatically exceeded any quarterly total in the past 3 years.
This slide depicts the combination of high-yield issuance and leveraged loan volume by the use of proceeds of the funds raised. The category with the largest increase in the second quarter was M&A and LBO activity.
The leveraged loan market and the CLO market are dependent on one another as many of the leveraged loans end up in CLOs. The CLO market continued at a torrid pace in the second quarter. Investor demand for floating rate investments, their search for yield and the relatively strong CLO performance during the 2020 pandemic have contributed to increased CLO issuance this year.
There are not a lot of companies in the world still selling a product they created 125 years ago. But on May 26, 1896, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was launched. Still serving as Wall Street's bellwether, at the end of 2020, $37 billion of ETF AUM was indexed or benchmarked against this iconic Dow Jones Index.
At the time of the Dow's introduction, investing in the stock market was considered highly speculative activity. And so in its early years, the Dow achieved little prominence outside of Wall Street. Ironically, it was the market crash of 1929 that brought the Dow's reputation to the attention of everyday investors as the index lost nearly 30% of its value over the course of 2 days. Before that, investors had been more focused on their individual stocks. But after the crash, investors were more interested in following general market conditions that Dow made that possible.
Each year, S&P Dow Jones Indices releases the annual survey of assets. This chart depicts the highlights of that survey for 2020. Asset levels in actively managed funds that benchmark against our indices increased 23% to $11.4 trillion. Assets and passive funds invested in products indexed to our indices increased 17% to $7.5 trillion.
Numerous indices support the $7.5 trillion, including the S&P 500, the largest with $5.4 trillion in assets. There are several other notable categories with considerable AUM growth, including sector indices that increased 24%, global indices that increased 62% and fixed income indices, which grew 86%.
Just over a year ago, we featured the launch of the S&P Global Marketplace on our earnings call. Today, I'd like to share with you the tremendous reception it has received by our clients. The site currently features 139 tiles of content and solutions, representing all 4 divisions and Kensho. So far, we have booked 189 deals, and there have been 600,000 page views.
We also recently launched Marketplace Workbench in partnership with Databricks, allowing clients access to a modern cloud-based platform for big data testing and analysis. This slide also depicts the most popular categories and the client types with the most active users. Congratulations to all those involved in creating a site that uses unique technology to simplify our clients' ability to identify, access, evaluate and utilize unique data and solutions. If you haven't visited marketplace.spglobal.com yet, I encourage you to do so.
Turning to our investments in ESG. We continue to launch new products and grow our ESG franchise across the company. After recording ESG revenue of $65 million in 2020, we delivered revenue of $43 million in the first half of this year, with second quarter revenue increased over 50% to $22 million versus the prior period.
With the launch of social and sustainability framework alignment opinions that we introduced on our call last quarter, Ratings now has 4 products. Overall, Ratings completed 13 ESG Evaluations, 11 Green Evaluations, 16 SAM benchmark engagements and 10 social and sustainability framework alignment opinions in the quarter.
Market Intelligence launched electric quarterly reports tracking U.S. power purchase agreements. These provide our clients with broad new insights in how energy revenues and renewable power purchase agreement pricing are trending. Market Intelligence also entered into an agreement to provide Trucost carbon and environmental data to State Street's clients. These clients will access functionality, including mapping carbon footprint and other environmental data portfolios, TCFD reporting features, applying Trucost Carbon's Earnings at Risk, Paris alignment and physical risk data intelligence.
We launched a climate credit analytics product in partnership with Oliver Wyman to help banks comply with climate stress testing regulations. And we launched an SFDR data solution that allows firms operating in the European Union to meet newly formed sustainable finance disclosure regulation requirements by drawing on a wide range of ESG data sets from across S&P Global.
In Indices, we had $25.8 billion of ESG ETF AUM at the end of the second quarter. This is an increase of 290% since the end of the second quarter of last year. Our Indices business also launched ESG Dividend Aristocrats Index series, partnered with Evolve, for the launch of index ETFs that offset the carbon footprint of stocks and worked with a German federal pension plan that reallocated EUR 9 billion of assets to equity indices utilizing our EU climate transition benchmark.
Platts began publishing daily carbon credit price assessments, reflecting nature-based carbon credit and household device carbon credit projects that are intended to bring additional transparency to carbon prices and carbon trading activity. Platts launched the world's first daily carbon neutral LNG price assessment, which involves offsetting the carbon emissions through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits. Platts also strengthened its global suite of hydrogen prices with new hydrogen price assessments for the U.K. and a new 2-degree warming scenario to the market-leading global integrated energy model.
Let me now turn to our outlook for global issuance and GDP. After issuance growth of 15% in 2019 and 17% in 2020, our Ratings Research Group's prior 2021 forecast called for a decrease of 2%. The latest forecast was issued earlier this week and calls for a decrease of 1% without international public finance.
The level of issuance in 2020 remains, in aggregate, hard to beat, but the 2021 total should still come in at a historically high total, likely surpassing 2019. The 2 largest changes compared to the forecast last quarter include structured finance, which went from a 6% gain to a 20% gain; and nonfinancials, which went from a 7.5% decrease to a 12% decrease. Please note that this is a bond issuance forecast. This is not a revenue forecast. For example, it doesn't address nontransaction revenue and doesn't include leveraged loan activity.
The peak of the pandemic appears to be behind us, particularly for the most advanced economies as vaccinations become widely available, severe COVID-19 cases fall and economies reopen. But we still see inevitable fits and starts with COVID risk still elevated. This is happening earlier and faster than previously assumed, driving both growth and inflation.
The macro outlook continues to improve. We have raised our global growth forecast by 40 basis points to 5.9% in 2021. This reflects stronger performance across the board in the first half of the year. Our 2022 to 2024 outlook shows a stronger U.S. but lagging emerging markets.
Risks are shifting from the pandemic to the pace of the recovery. In particular, rising inflation in the U.S. and some emerging markets points to a possible bumpy transition from the ultra-low rates and easy financing conditions to the post-COVID-19 steady state. And with economies on demand, policy normalization and sustainability are coming into sharper focus.
Finally, Platts is forecasting that oil will remain above $65 a barrel through 2021. This is positive for the health of the oil industry.
I will now turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?"

Doug covered the highlights of strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. I will take a moment to cover a few other items.
While there were some modest divestitures since the second quarter of 2020, the revenue associated with them was not large enough to result in a difference between reported and organic revenue growth.
Adjusted total expenses increased 9%, and I'll provide some additional color on this in the next slide.
Our net interest expense declined 20% due to the refinancing of a substantial portion of our debt last year.
The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate was due to an increase in taxes on foreign operations and the successful resolution of tax examinations in the prior year. Our full year tax rate guidance remains unchanged.
Our adjusted expense growth during the quarter was larger than normal at 9%. There are several reasons. First, second quarter 2020 expenses were impacted by pandemic-related management actions taken last year. Second, due to strong financial results year-to-date, performance-related costs, including incentives, commissions and royalties, have increased. Third, ForEx increased expenses. Finally, I want to make it clear that our business-as-usual expenses remain under control.
During the quarter, changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact on adjusted EPS of $0.03. The only meaningful impact was in Ratings, where adjusted operating profit was positively impacted by $15 million.
Last quarter, we introduced 3 new categories to provide insights into the type of expenses that are going to be incurred related to the pending merger. The first category is transaction costs. These are costs related to completing the merger. They include legal fees, investment banking fees and filing fees.
The second category is integration costs. These are costs to operationalize the integration. They include consulting, infrastructure and retention costs.
The third category is costs to achieve. These are costs needed to enable expense and revenue synergies. They include lease terminations, severance, contract exit fees and investments related to product development, marketing and distribution enhancements.
During the second quarter, the non-GAAP adjustments collectively totaled to a net pretax loss of $75 million. They included $9 million for merger transaction costs, primarily legal fees; $39 million from merger integration costs, primarily consulting fees; $2 million for cost to achieve; a $3 million lease impairment; and $22 million in deal-related amortization. And there was an after-tax adjustment with respect to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities related to a U.K. income tax rate change.
This quarter, all 4 divisions delivered increased revenue and adjusted operating profit. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted operating profit margin increased significantly in Platts and Market Intelligence, while Ratings had a modest gain and Indices had a decrease of 100 basis points. I'll provide color on the individual business results in a moment.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet has low leverage and ample liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $5.2 billion, debt of $4.1 billion, an undrawn revolver capacity of $1.5 billion and no commercial paper outstanding. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA improved since the end of last year to 1.8x.
Free cash flow, excluding certain items, was $1.6 billion in the first half of 2021, an increase of more than $100 million or 8% over the prior year period. Due to the pending merger with IHS Markit, share repurchases have been suspended.
Now let's turn to the division results. Ratings revenue increased 7% as strong investment-grade comps were more than offset by strength in bank loan ratings, structured finance and nontransaction activity. Adjusted expenses increased 10%, primarily due to increased incentives, salaries and ForEx. These resulted in a 5% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 100 basis point decrease in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 63.4%. Please keep in mind that the 68.1% adjusted segment operating profit margin achieved in the second quarter is temporarily elevated based on the surge of issuance in high-yield, leveraged loans and structured finance.
In China, we see continued momentum and interest in our ratings. We completed 13 ratings in the second quarter and 31 in the first half of 2021 compared to 22 in all last year.
Nontransaction revenue increased 19%, primarily due to a more than tripling in new entity ratings revenue, growth in fees associated with surveillance and Rating Evaluation Service revenue that more than doubled due to heightened levels of M&A activity. Investors' search for yields and increased risk appetite continues to enable weaker credits to raise debt.
Transaction revenue decreased with a substantial decline in investment-grade bond issuance from last year's record quarter, mostly offset by an increase in bank loan ratings activity, structured finance and high-yield bond issuance.
This slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributor to the increase in Ratings revenue was the 86% increase in structured finance driven by CLOs, ABS, CMBS and RMBS. In addition, corporates declined 2%, financial services revenue increased 4%, governments increased 5%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 12%.
Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The segment delivered 16% revenue growth primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices. In the second quarter, adjusted expenses increased 19% largely due to increased incentives, salaries, royalties and new product investments. The adjusted segment operating profit increased 15%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 80 basis points to 71.1%. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin remained strong but decreased 100 basis points to 69.2%.
Revenue growth was mixed this quarter. Asset-linked fees increased 28% primarily from gains in ETFs, augmented by smaller gains in mutual funds and insurance and over-the-counter derivative activity. Exchange-traded derivative revenue decreased 20% on reduced trading volumes. The second quarter of last year had elevated volatility related to the pandemic and the stock market recovery. Data and custom subscriptions increased 11%.
While the prominence of our U.S. indices is widely understood, we have been partnering with exchanges around the world to expand our international presence. These include relationships with exchanges in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Korea and others.
This chart is a new disclosure that depicts the steady progress we are making to grow revenue in these markets. The revenue is split across asset-linked fees and data and custom subscriptions.
For our Indices division, over the past year, ETF net inflows were $173 billion, and market appreciation totaled $653 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.4 trillion, which is 51% higher compared to 1 year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 56% year-over-year. Sequentially versus the end of the first quarter, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $64 billion, and market appreciation totaled $158 billion.
As I just noted, exchange-traded derivative revenue faced a strong comparison. Nevertheless, activity at the CBOE increased in the second quarter, with S&P 500 index options activity increasing 8% and VIX futures and options activity increasing 43%. Activity at the CME equity complex decreased 12%.
And here is another new disclosure. You have seen that the revenue from exchange-traded derivative activity can be very volatile from quarter-to-quarter. What I don't think is apparent is the strong underlying annual growth that has taken place. This chart depicts a 7-year CAGR of 9%. While the trend line is not perfectly upward sloping, the annual growth is much more consistent than the quarterly figures might suggest.
Market Intelligence delivered revenue growth of 8%. More than 1/3 of the revenue growth was from recent product investments, which increased by more than 40%. This was primarily from ESG, 451 Research, Panjiva, S&P Global Marketplace, aftermarket research and SME data.
Adjusted expenses increased 6% primarily due to cost of sales and royalties. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 11%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 100 basis points to 35.4%. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 100 basis points to 33.4%.
Looking across Market Intelligence, there was solid growth in each category. Desktop revenue grew 5%. Data Management Solutions revenue grew 13%, and Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 10%.
And now turning to Platts. Reported revenue increased 9%, an uplift over recent quarters. Our core subscriptions increased 9%, including about $2 million in benefits from the timing of contract renewals. It is notable that more than 1/4 of the growth came from new products, including ESG and LNG. Oil prices and commodity prices in general are at a level where most of our customers can profitably operate.
Global Trading Services increased 4% mainly due to strong LNG and petroleum volumes, partially offset by lower natural gas volumes.
Adjusted expenses increased 10% primarily due to incentives, growth initiatives and commissions, and the adjusted segment operating profit increased 8%. Adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 57.9%. The trailing 4-quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 170 basis points to 55.9%. While petrochemicals was the fastest-growing category this quarter, every category delivered meaningful growth.
And one final new disclosure. Here, you can see the impressive revenue growth that Global Trading Services has delivered over the past 10 years. While this category is volatile from quarter-to-quarter, it has demonstrated a 10-year CAGR of 18%.
We're not providing 2021 GAAP guidance because given the inherent uncertainty around the merger, management cannot reliably predict all the necessary components of GAAP measures.
And this slide depicts our adjusted guidance. While we expect that the merger will occur in the fourth quarter of this year, we're providing adjusted guidance on a stand-alone basis.
The third column shows our new 2021 adjusted guidance, with all the line items that changed highlighted. We're making these changes because we now expect greater revenue growth primarily due to improved outlooks in Ratings and Indices. Therefore, our revenue guidance is increased from a mid-single-digit increase to a high single-digit increase. Corporate unallocated is decreased by $5 million to a new range of $135 million to $145 million due to less project spending than originally anticipated. Operating profit margin is increased by 40 basis points to a new range of 54.4% to 54.9%. And this results in a $0.40 increase to adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a new range of $12.95 to $13.15. And finally, free cash flow generation has been increased by $100 million to a range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion.
In conclusion, 2021 is turning out to be a very strong year for the company. All our businesses are delivering solid growth. We continue to expand our ESG product offerings, and we are very excited about the upcoming merger with IHS Markit.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

So we see high demand in the market. We're having great engagement with our customers. We continue to develop new products and, in particular, around climate.

And for the full year, the best direction I can give to you is think about margin for the full year in line with where we are for a trailing 4-quarter basis.
From a longer-term perspective, we don't have new aspirational margin targets for our divisions. We think the right moment to announce those is after completion of the merger with IHS Markit. But a couple of factors that you have to take into consideration. Of course, there continue to be positive secular trends behind the Ratings business. As long as GDP is going up and we see positive economic momentum, there will be positive revenue growth for the Ratings business.
Also, of course, all our businesses have always operating leverage. So operating leverage will be a benefit. We do think, over time, we need to invest in some analytical capacity because of the level of volumes that we're seeing. But that's a good problem to have. So some investments need to be made in analytical capacity.
So that is the best I can give to you with respect to the outlook. But overall, I would say very strong results by the Ratings business and really topping a very strong year last year."

Yes, we have -- as you know, we built a domestic rating agency in China. 2 years ago when we launched that, we had the decision to go with a wholly owned subsidiary. In addition, we've been expanding our business with Market Intelligence on the ground as well, building an onshore China business.
We understand that the new data security law, which is going to be going into place in September, is related to managing domestic information. Since we've been building our businesses onshore as domestic onshore businesses, we think that we'll be able to meet the requirements of the domestic law. So the data security law for onshore businesses should -- we should be able to meet those requirements because we're building new businesses from scratch, and they're onshore businesses.
Related to the general business environment, clearly, there's a lot of noise at the macro level between the United States and China. We pay attention to that very closely. But at the financial services sector, we still see very open regulators. They're open to bringing in foreign players into the market. We continue to see foreign banks and foreign asset managers get licenses of 51% to 100% own licenses.

And this last quarter had some of the largest swings I've ever seen since I've been in this company of different asset classes of issuance. As an example, the -- in the U.S., corporates were down 63% year-on-year of issuance. Europe was down 35% in corporates. Investment-grade globally was down 26%, although high-yield was up 27%. You saw some of the numbers. CLOs were up almost 500% globally, 580% in the U.S. So we saw a lot of swings.
But we take a step back and we look at a few really important factors for going forward on issuance, both for what's going to be the rest of the year, which we mentioned we expect will be down about 1% for total issuance. And I'll come back to that in a second. But we look at economic growth, which is starting to become very robust. We do think it will level out once we get through the pandemic but at a pretty robust level for the U.S., Europe and Asia. That's beneficial for us.
Once debt goes on to balance sheets as bonds or as rated loans, it typically continues to be rated loans or a rated bond. So we see the pipeline of that, that's been increasing. In addition, we watch things like mergers and acquisitions, which are very robust right now, which are helping the current environment, especially for high-yield and loans.
But when you look at the ability for markets around the world to shift from being bank markets to capital markets, you look at overall economic growth, you look at low interest rates, which we expect are going to continue for some time in the major developed markets, these are all things that are beneficial for our long-term outlook for Ratings.
Since you did ask the question very briefly on 2021 forecast, we expect that the overall market is going to be down about 1%. Last quarter, we said that was going to be down about 2%. So that's a short-term view. That doesn't include loans, which we still think are also going to be robust for the rest of the year."

The market for cryptocurrency assets, it's growing. You can see that there's a lot of interest in it. And this also goes beyond just crypto into obviously as well blockchain. We announced the first indices in partnership using the data pricing from a company called Lukka that we have an investment in.

I can't talk too much about IHS Markit, but they have a stated productivity and efficiency program to expand margins by 100 basis points every year. Of course, that will be all combined into synergies and expense synergies that we're going to achieve after the completion of the transaction.
I cannot give you any update on those numbers.

We look at the corporates, and we -- corporates so far are down this year about 12% overall, as I mentioned earlier. So far this year, in corporates, they're down 40% in the second quarter. But we expect that overall, they're going to be down about 12%. So that's that category.
Financial services have actually been a little bit more robust than we had originally expected. We thought they were going to be up about 4%, but we think it will go up as high as 10%, but our midpoint is about 7.5%.
Just as an anecdote on that. The last quarter, Bank of America issued $28 billion. JPMorgan issued $23 billion. It looks like the banks are starting to use our balance sheets again. And in Europe, all of the largest -- of the 10 largest issuers in Europe that were all in the $4 billion to $6 billion range, almost all of those, exception of one, were a financial institution. So we think financial issuance will be up for the year.
Structured finance, we think, will be up about 20% for the year. We see that the structured finance market is still going quite strong. As we mentioned in the second quarter, it was up over 147% overall. We don't think that, that pace will continue in structured finance, but we see it up 20%. We had originally said in our prior forecast it would be up about 6% in 2021 as opposed to now raising it to 20%.
We look at public finance. We still think that's going to be down about 5%. Public finance issuers have not been as active. If there is an infrastructure program approved in Washington and we do see a revitalization of infrastructure investment in the U.S., public finance will probably go along with that. So overall, we see bond issuance down about 1% when you add all of that up together.
We think that loans are going to continue to be strong. I don't have a specific number for the year what they're going to be up, but they'll continue to be up. You saw the numbers of how strong they've been compared to the prior years. But the pipeline is strong. The M&A pipeline is strong.
When it comes to interest rates, interest rates are still quite low. Spreads are low, and interest rates are low. Spreads are not at the lowest they've ever been, but they're close to low areas, especially after the spike that we saw last year in the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter when the pandemic first started. So we do think that there's going to be a lot of strength in loans and then subsequently from that CLOs as well for the rest of the year.
Just one other tidbit. We see that in the ABS area, which goes between the loans and ABS, we see a lot of activity related to autos, related to corporate banks, corporate restructurings of their balance sheets, et cetera. So we still see a lot of activity, interest rate-driven. But recall that last year, there was a lot of liquidity issuance that was driven by investment-grade corporates. That has basically gone away, and you saw that from the big drop. And that's been substituted now by loans, by structured finance, by ABS, et cetera. We think that, that's going to continue for the rest of the year. And then as I mentioned in an earlier question, we see that all of this positions us well for the long run."

I only give you guidance for a full year basis. And I think you probably can derive from that the outlook for the second half of the year.
So for Ratings, we are now expecting revenue growth at a high single-digit level. So that's up from mid last quarter to now high single digits. Market Intelligence is still at a level of mid- to high single digits. Platts has gone up from mid- to mid- to high single-digit revenue growth. And the index business now we are expecting low double-digit revenue growth. That's up from high single digits to low double digits.
So 3 of the 4 segments we're increasing the revenue outlook for the full year. And then also for the company as a whole, the revenue outlook has been increased to high single-digit growth."

Kensho, in the meantime, has developed a complete AI toolkit for unstructured data with many different elements that are in that toolkit about entity linking, data extraction, speech to text, search, Codex, named entity recognition, many other initiatives that have been developed. And those tools are being used across the company.
Let me give you 2 specific examples, including the one that you were referring to with respect to Scribe. So Scribe is the speech-to-text algorithm engine. And we are using that for our own businesses, for example, for our earnings call transcript business. And the more you can teach those algorithms based on the actual activity, the better they become, the stronger is your engine. So all of our activities with respect to our earnings call transcript business is now being done through Kensho Scribe. And the quality is really very high at the moment and further improving over time.
That's indeed being sold now also to external customers. So we have a few external customers now that are interested in this engine because it's one of the best products that is out there. And so we are actually very excited about the fact that Kensho can now pivot to external customers as well with some of its products.
Let me give you a second example. This is about Market-on-Close in the Platts business. At 26 markets now this is being implemented, and we have reduced 75% of the time between the market close and publishing our prices, which is, of course, very important for our customers because the closer that time gap, the better it is for them, 14 markets still to go.
So in other words, Kensho initiatives are continuing, and we continue to be very excited about the transformative nature that Kensho is bringing to S&P Global."

When we look at the IHS Markit merger and when we originally conceived of it and as we continue to go through our analysis to work on our integration planning, we see that there's lots of opportunities across the company. It goes well beyond just the data. There are many different ways that we can have complementary data usage.
As an example, the fixed income indices is one of the ones that we talk a lot about because they have fixed income data. They've got the fixed income business that already exists. They have the reference data. So we can quickly put their index business together with ours, increase our asset class coverage as well as innovate in new areas like multi-asset class indices.
So beyond just the data usage and the data linkage across the company, there's many more opportunities. As an example, deploying some of IHS Markit's software, software tools, workflow tools, things that we don't have as much at S&P Global, bringing that expertise into 2 markets -- into new markets like ESG, like climate, we're very excited about things like that.
So the combination goes well beyond data. Data is fundamental to it. Bringing those data together like their Data Lake and our Marketplace reference data that can be used across our company, that's sort of a nice to have. It's necessary. But beyond that, to be sufficient and to really make this exciting, it goes also into analytics, into research, into software tools, et cetera. So we continue to be excited about this. And data is fundamental to it, but it goes well beyond that."

But there's -- if you want to think it's almost like a supply and a demand issue. There's an incredible amount of supply of liquidity. A lot of that liquidity is positioning for a higher rate or an inflationary market, which means that they've moved into floating rate instruments. And so you see a large amount of funds have moved into floating rate instruments, which means that there's a lot of liquidity available for floating rate loans and CLOs. So you can see that there's been a shift of liquidity in that direction.
But when we look at this more in the longer run, there is a debt cycle, which is -- we're going through right now, but that's going on to people's balance sheets. There is a large amount of that issuance has been investment-grade, and the investment-grade has been holding up. The debt levels and interest rate coverage levels are still strong. We've been holding to our standards for what would be an investment-grade issuer. And then when you look at the many, many high-yield issuers who have been coming out, clearly, the market understands the risk they're taking when they invest in a deep, high-yield issuance.
But we think that when you look at some of the slides that we showed today of the balance sheets, of the maturity schedules which are coming up, that this bodes well in the long run for the overall markets. That doesn't mean that every single quarter is going to be -- always be up. We saw this quarter a lot of movement of some very strong growth in some areas, a lot of decreases in others.

Buybacks, we would probably not be able or most likely not be able to do buybacks before the completion of the merger. Then our thinking at the moment is that after completion of the merger, we do a catch-up. And a catch-up is in relation to the loss period that we're not able to return capital to our shareholders at the level of our capital targets, the at least 75% return of capital targets that we were not able to achieve since the mid of last year until the fourth quarter of this year.
Also, you have to take into account there that IHS Markit itself cannot do any share buybacks. So you have to take that in consideration, as well as potential proceeds of some of the divestitures.
We would like to do that catch-up because we would like to go as quickly as possible into the rhythm of our new capital return target of at least 85% of our free cash flow. And the combined company will be a company that very soon, after the completion, will get to a level of approximately $5 billion or north of $5 billion of free cash flow, very significant amount. So we would like to go back into a normal rhythm as quickly as possible.
I can't give you specific numbers. I know there's a big question on The Street about numbers in terms of the buybacks and the catch-up. I can't give you specific numbers.

Well, first of all, I'm encouraged to see that there is a bipartisan process going on in Washington around infrastructure. It's something that we need in this country, both the bipartisanship as well as investment in infrastructure.
We think that there will be a few potential benefits from that. The first is just general economic growth. We have done a lot of research and analysis on infrastructure over the years, and infrastructure generally leads to growth beyond just the investment in infrastructure itself. We estimate that it's somewhere about 1.7 to 1.9x additional economic growth that comes from infrastructure.
So when you build an airport, around an airport, you get rental cars, you get gas stations, you get activity inside the airport from people buying food and gifts, et cetera. So we see that there is a potential economic benefit, which should help growth. It also helps jobs. All of that helps business climate generally, which obviously is beneficial to us.
More specifically, if there is an infrastructure bill, we do think that despite much of it being discussed as being funded by the public sector that there will be opportunities for public-private partnerships, which would bring with them potentially debt financing. The municipal bond market could take on more activity if there's going to be local investment in infrastructure. And then the companies themselves, construction companies, the large projects, they're going to need financing as they go through the projects themselves.
So we think that this will be, in general, beneficial to the overall economy. I think it's a good signal from Washington. And then overall, it could have some benefits to us, particularly for the Ratings business."

So investing in new product initiatives, we believe, is a very positive thing for the index business. And that is exactly what we are doing at this point in time. We're investing in ESG indices.

We issued a news release with our results earlier today. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com. 
Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in today's conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. In this regard, we direct listeners the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
In addition, as announced late last year, S&P Global and IHS Markit entered into a definitive merger agreement. In March, shareholders of both companies overwhelmingly voted in favor of the merger. The merger is pending regulatory approval, and we currently expect to close in the first quarter of 2022. This call will touch on the merger, but does not constitute an offer to sell or buy or the solicitation of any offer to buy or sell any securities nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities law of any such jurisdiction. No offering of securities shall be made except by means of prospectus made in requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933. 
In connection with the proposed transaction, S&P Global and IHS Markit has filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which include a joint proxy statement and a prospectus. S&P Global and IHS Markit have filed other documents regarding the proposed transaction with the SEC. Investors and security holders of S&P Global or IHS Markit stock are urged to carefully read the entire registration statement and joint proxy statement prospectus, which is available on our website and sec.gov. 
In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management. 
The earnings release and the slides contain exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This call, especially the discussion of our outlook, contains statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in our filings with the SEC and on our website. 
I would also like to call your attention to a European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company. 
We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Ola Fadahunsi at (212) 438-2296.

Indices delivered the strongest revenue growth for the second straight quarter due to large gains in ETF AUM. Adjusted expenses increased 7% largely due to investment spending, commissions and royalties. 
After raising guidance on both the first quarter and second quarter earnings calls, we're raising 2021 guidance again based on these strong results and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Ewout will provide details in a moment. 
I would also like to share some additional highlights from the third quarter. The most important initiative of the year continues to be our upcoming merger with IHS Markit. This is an incredibly transformative opportunity for our company and our customers. The regulatory path to closing merger is now becoming clear. 
We launched S&P Capital IQ Pro and Platts Dimensions Pro. And Sustainable1, our ESG business, is gaining momentum as we build internal capabilities and product offerings expand. I'll come back to all of these highlights in more detail, but let's start with the merger. 
When we announced the merger in November 2020, we noted that we needed regulatory approval in 5 jurisdictions: Canada, the European Union, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. We've made substantial progress with all these regulators, and there are a number of remedies we must undertake in order to complete the merger. 
IHS Markit must divest the OPIS, the Coal, Metals & Mining and the PetChem Wire businesses. The sale of these assets to News Corp has already been announced. In addition, IHS Markit must divest its Base Chemicals business. S&P Global must divest CUSIP Global Services and Leveraged Commentary and Data together with the related family of leveraged loan indices. 
S&P Global and IHS Markit will begin the process of selling these additional businesses shortly. In order to provide time to undertake these sales processes, we now expect to close the merger in the first quarter of 2022. Collectively, the revenue from all of the businesses being divested is approximately $425 million, and the margins for each of these businesses are higher than the margins for each of the divisions they're in. 
In a moment, Ewout will provide an update on our merger synergy expectations. And you will see that despite these divestitures, we are raising both our cost and revenue synergy targets. 
To recap the financial results for the third quarter, revenue increased 13% to $2.1 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 18%, and our adjusted operating profit margin increased 250 basis points to 55.4%. 
As you know, we measure and track adjusted operating profit margin on a trailing 4-quarter basis, which increased 130 basis points to 55.1%. As a result, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 24%. 
Each quarter, we highlight a few key business drivers and important projects underway. This quarter, let's start with ratings bond issuance trends. During the third quarter, global bond issuance increased 3%. In the U.S., bond issuance in aggregate increased 6% as investment grade decreased 12%, high yield decreased 16%, public finance decreased 24% while structured finance increased 105% due to large increases in every category, particularly CLOs, which increased 340%. 
European bond issuance increased 4% as investment grade decreased 7%, high yield decreased 4% and structured finance increased 70% with gains in every asset class except RMBS. Of particular note, CMBS increased 375%. 
In Asia, bond issuance decreased 2% overall. The data on this slide only depicts bond issuance. When we include new bank loan volumes, overall global issuance increased 9%. 
The next 2 slides look at the combined high-yield issuance and leveraged loan volume for the U.S. and Europe. Data is not readily available for the rest of the world. This slide shows that the combination of global leveraged loan and high-yield issuance in the third quarter continued to be very strong, surpassing every quarter in 2018, '19 and '20. 
This slide depicts the combination of high-yield issuance and leveraged loan volume by the use of proceeds of the funds raised. This quarter, both general corporate purpose and refinancing-related issuance was lower than the third quarter of 2020. The surge in activity is entirely due to M&A, LBOs, buybacks and dividends. These are opportunistic categories that aren't pull forward. The surge in issuance is not pulling forward issuance from future years, and it is additive to future financing needs. 
Since bank loan ratings are an important element of Ratings revenue, we like to disclose our bank loan ratings revenue each quarter. The unprecedented strength of bank loan ratings revenue continued in the third quarter, and year-to-date revenues already surpassed any of the previous 10 full years. 
The leveraged loan market and the CLO market are dependent on one another as many of the leveraged loans end up in CLOs. As you can see here, CLO issuance continued to accelerate in the third quarter. 
During the third quarter, we rebranded our Market Intelligence platform as S&P Capital IQ Pro. This recognizes the value of the Capital IQ brand as we continue to upgrade the platform with additional content and functionality. We currently have approximately 290,000 active Desktop users, of which 90,000 are utilizing S&P Capital IQ Pro. 
The inaugural release of S&P Capital IQ Pro includes a number of capabilities not found in the Market Intelligence platform. A new Kensho-enabled document viewer incorporates AI-based search to speed up users' discovery of text-based insights across filings and transcripts. It's based on technology that Kensho originally developed for U.S. security and military agencies and is now reengineered for S&P Capital IQ Pro. For example, it gives investors the ability to quickly screen comments made over years of earnings calls within minutes. 
The new platform features frequent coverage of private markets, including data around fundraising trends, dry powder, fund performance and LP investor allocations. Also included is the ability for users to screen on nontraditional industry criteria, such as crypto, therapeutics and clean tech. 
S&P Capital IQ Pro also includes Ratings' direct coverage of corporates and financial institutions. Our users can now incorporate the full suite of S&P Capital IQ Pro tools and functionality and interact with S&P Global Ratings content in ways not previously possible. 
Platts has been on a long journey to consolidate its product platforms as well with the acquisitions of BENTEK, Eclipse, cFlow, Petromedia and others. There's been a tremendous effort to consolidate all of these capabilities into a single platform. 
This quarter, Platts introduced Platts Dimensions Pro, which provides users with a seamless one-stop shop experience across Platts benchmark price assessments, news and analytics, spanning 13 commodities, including energy transition. And like S&P Capital IQ Pro, this content is available on a web-based portal that is mobile-friendly via machine-to-machine delivery and as an Excel added. 
Periodically, we like to provide updates on new product launches. The first 2 charts on this slide depict the acceptance by market participants of our JKM marker for liquefied natural gas and our low sulfur marine fuel assessment. Both have exhibited very strong growth recently. 
The chart on the right shows the cumulative number of new assessments we have launched in the energy transition space in the last 4 years. These include a new suite of Australian hydrogen prices covering what is expected to be one of the key producers of this future fuel; the methane performance certificate, which reflects production of natural gas in the U.S. with 0 methane emissions; and upstream values for the measured carbon emissions associated with crude oil production and transportation, covering an initial suite of 14 crudes from around the world and aiming to provide the backbone for low carbon crude trading. Buyers can start to make active choices based on the relative carbon impact of different crude sources with this crude carbon intensity product. 
Turning to our investments in ESG. Our Sustainable1 milestones and product launches continue to build. Third quarter Sustainable1 revenue increased 58% to $24 million versus the prior period. 
With the launch of second-party opinion, Ratings now has 5 products Overall, Ratings completed 10 ESG Evaluations, 13 Green Evaluations, 13 SAM benchmark engagements and 11 social and sustainability framework alignment opinions in the quarter. 
In Market Intelligence, we're close to wrapping up the annual CSA survey. And so far in 2021, corporate participation increased 34% to over 1,800 companies. On the back of these surveys, we relaunched our S&P Global ESG scores on 8,000 companies during the quarter. We're targeting to have scores of more than 11,000 companies by the end of this year's assessment cycle in the first quarter of 2022. 
In Indices, we had $26.5 billion of ESG ETF AUM at the end of the third quarter. This is an increase of 178% since the end of the third quarter of last year. Our Indices business also added to its ESG Indices offerings with the launch of the S&P NZX 50 Tilted Index with the New Zealand Stock Exchange. Platts added products to both its suite of carbon assessments and its recycled plastic offerings. 
And finally, S&P Global is a founding member of Novata, a new technology platform designed to provide private equity firms and the private markets with ESG measurement, data collection and benchmarking capabilities to help improve the management and tracking of ESG performance. 
By providing rich detailed data on a wide array of ESG topics, the corporate sustainability assessment is an integral part of our ESG scores. Since we purchased the capability for RobecoSAM in late 2019, we've expanded the number of corporate participants by about 500 companies. And the group has almost doubled corporate participation in the last 4 years. Today's participating companies represent 45% of global market capitalization. 
In addition, you can see this is a global endeavor. We view the CSA input as a key differentiator to our Sustainable1 efforts. 
Let me now turn to our outlook for global issuance and GDP. The 2021 issuance forecast continued to creep higher and is now relatively flat versus 2020 issuance. The latest forecast was issued earlier this week and also covers 2022 issuance for the first time. 
2022 issuance is forecast to decline 2%. This is based on a 7% decrease in nonfinancial corporates, a 1% increase in financial services, a 3% increase in structured finance and a 2% increase in U.S. public finance. 
Looking forward, inflation concerns, prospects for rising rates, high cash balances and possible tax reform all translate to headwinds for issuance in 2022. We expect that they will lead to a second year of contraction in issuance totals. 
Please note that this is a bond issuance forecast. This is not a revenue forecast. For example, it doesn't address nontransaction revenue and doesn't include leveraged loan activity. 
The macro outlook is little changed from 3 months ago. Our economists expect growth to moderate in 2022 with growth in Europe and many emerging markets improving, while growth rates drop in the U.S. and China. Commodity prices have rebound due to strong retail sales, weather events and supply chain imbalances. However, inflation pressures appear to be peaking with some emerging market central banks raising rates, U.S. Federal Reserve moving up its tapering time line and the ECB firmly on hold for now. 
Finally, Platts Analytics believes that current fundamentals should remain supportive of oil prices in the mid-70s. This is positive for the health of the oil industry. 
I will now turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?"

While we have excellent third quarter results and an exciting merger pending, I would like to start my discussion today with our latest thinking around our merger synergy targets. There has been an extensive effort throughout the company",1672,"Thank you, Doug. While we have excellent third quarter results and an exciting merger pending, I would like to start my discussion today with our latest thinking around our merger synergy targets. There has been an extensive effort throughout the company to identify and validate potential merger synergies. While the initial synergy targets that we introduced at the time of the merger announcement were developed by a very limited number of senior managers, the latest figures take into consideration in-depth planning and analysis by countless employees across both companies. 
We have increased our total synergy target and now estimate that there will be $530 million to $580 million of cost synergies and $330 million to $360 million of revenue synergies. As you can see in the slide, this takes into consideration new synergies identified as well as those who we'll no longer be able to achieve due to required divestitures. Correspondingly, the proceeds of the divestitures will contribute to additional capacity for share repurchases. 
I also want to point out that on a run rate basis, we have already achieved approximately $25 million of these synergies. This is primarily from not backfilling open positions created through normal attrition. 
Today, we're only providing an update on the merger synergy targets. We'll give you a full update on the financial targets of the merged company after we complete the transaction. 
Turning to our third quarter financial results. Doug covered the highlights of strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. I will take a moment to cover a few other items. 
Adjusted corporate unallocated expenses increased 18% due to company-owned life insurance proceeds in the prior period. Our net interest expense improved 13% due to the refinancing of a substantial portion of our debt last year. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to a refinement of tax accruals on foreign operations related to both a prior and current period. 
During the quarter, changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact on adjusted EPS of $0.02. The only meaningful impact was in Ratings, where adjusted operating profit was positively impacted by $5 million. 
In the second quarter, we introduced 3 new categories to provide insights into the type of expenses that are going to be incurred related to the pending merger. The first category is transaction cost. These are costs related to completing the merger. They include legal fees, investment banking fees and filing fees. 
The second category is integration cost. These are costs to operationalize the integration. They include consulting, infrastructure and retention costs. 
The third category is cost to achieve. These are costs needed to enable expense and revenue synergies. They include lease terminations, severance, contract exit fees and investments related to product development, marketing and distribution enhancements. 
During the third quarter, the non-GAAP adjustments collectively totaled to a net pretax loss of $73 million. They included $9 million for merger transaction costs, primarily legal fees; $45 million for merger integration costs, primarily consulting fees; a $3 million gain on the sale of an office building in India; and $21 million in deal-related amortization. 
This quarter, all 4 divisions delivered solid gains in revenue and adjusted operating profit with Indices delivering the largest gains. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted operating profit margin increased in all 4 divisions with Indices leading with a gain of 170 basis points. I'll provide color on the individual business results in a moment. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong with low leverage and ample liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 billion and debt of $4.1 billion. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA improved since the end of last year to 1.8x. 
Free cash flow, excluding certain items, was $2.6 billion in the first 9 months of 2021, an increase of more than $300 million or 15% over the prior year period. Due to the pending merger with IHS Markit, share repurchases have been suspended. 
Now let's turn to the division results and begin with S&P Dow Jones Indices, which delivered extraordinary revenue growth of 28% primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices. Please note that the ETF revenue included a $5 million breakup fee due to the termination of our indices as the basis for several ETFs. 
In the third quarter, adjusted expenses increased 4% largely due to royalties and compensation, partially offset by reduced legal costs. The adjusted segment operating profit increased a whopping 40%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 660 basis points to 71.8%. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 170 basis points to 70.7%. 
Every category increased revenue this quarter. Asset-linked fees increased 36% primarily from gains in ETFs, augmented by gains in mutual funds and insurance and over-the-counter derivative activity that exceeded 20%. Exchange-traded derivative revenue increased 15% on increased trading volumes at the CBOE. Data and custom subscriptions increased 8%. 
For our Indices division, over the past year, ETF net inflows were $223 billion, and market appreciation totaled $524 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.5 trillion, which is 43% higher compared to 1 year ago. 
Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 48% year-over-year. Sequentially versus the end of the second quarter, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $55 billion, and market depreciation totaled $16 billion. Exchange-rated derivative activity was mixed during the quarter. Activity at the CBOE increased with S&P 500 Index options activity increasing 39% and fixed futures and options activity increasing 31%. Activity at the CME equity complex decreased 6% due primarily to a 22% decrease in Micro E-mini volumes. 
Ratings delivered very strong revenue growth, increasing 14% with strength in bank loan ratings, structured finance and nontransaction activity. Adjusted expenses increased 9% primarily due to increased salaries, headcount at CRISIL, growth initiatives and incentives. This resulted in a 17% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 160 basis point increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 63.8%. 
In China, we see continued momentum and interest in our ratings. We completed 15 ratings in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 46 compared to 22 in all last year. Nontransaction revenue increased 15% primarily due to growth in fees associated with surveillance, increased new entity ratings activity, CRISIL and Rating Evaluation Services revenue. Transaction revenue increased as a 150% increase in bank loan ratings activity and strong structured product issuance more than offset a decline in corporate bond issuance. 
This slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributor to the increase in Ratings revenue was the 48% increase in structured finance driven by CLOs, CMBS and ABS. In addition, corporates increased 14%, financial services increased 8%, government decreased 12%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 14%. 
Market Intelligence delivered reported revenue growth of 7% and 8% on an organic basis. More than 1/3 of the revenue growth was from recent product investments, which increased by 40% led by ESG and the S&P Global Marketplace. Adjusted expenses increased 4% primarily due to higher investment spending, particularly in ESG, S&P Global Marketplace, SME and China, additional infrastructure spending supporting our cloud initiatives and S&P Capital IQ Pro and data which is primarily license fees tied to aftermarket research revenue. 
Adjusted segment operating profit increased 13%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 35.7%. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 90 basis points to 33.8%. 
Looking across Market Intelligence saw a solid growth in each category. Desktop revenue grew 6%, Data Management Solutions revenue grew 12%, Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 7%. 
And now turning to Platts. Reported revenue increased 8%. Our core subscriptions increased 7%. It's notable that more than 1/3 of the growth came from new products, primarily EFG and LNG. 
Global Trading Services had a great quarter, increasing 14% mainly due to strong LNG and petroleum volumes. GTS activity often picks up when commodity prices become more volatile. Adjusted expenses increased 11% primarily due to growth initiatives, incentives and commissions. In addition, expenses in the third quarter last year were aided by management actions. 
Adjusted segment operating profit increased 5%, and adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 110 basis points to 54.6%. The trailing 4-quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 70 basis points to 55.6%. 
While there was revenue growth in every category, petrochemicals, natural gas, power and renewables and shipping all delivered double-digit growth. 
Because the company now anticipates closing the merger with IHS Markit in the first quarter of 2022, we're able to provide 2021 GAAP guidance for the first time. This slide depicts our new GAAP guidance. 
And this slide depicts our adjusted guidance. Third column shows our new 2021 adjusted guidance with all the line items that changed highlighted. We're making these changes primarily due to greater revenue growth in Ratings and Indices. 
Therefore, our revenue guidance has increased from high single-digit increase to a low double-digit increase. Corporate unallocated is increased by $5 million to a new range of $140 million to $150 million due to increased incentives and a charitable contribution. 
Operating profit margin is increased by a range of 40 to 60 basis points to a new range of 55% to 55.5%. This results in a $0.50 to $0.55 increase to adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a new range of $13.50 to $13.65. And finally, free cash flow generation has been increased by $100 million to a range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion. 
In conclusion, 2021 is turning out to be an exceptionally strong year for the company. All our businesses are delivering solid growth. We continue to expand our ESG product offerings, and we are making great progress on the upcoming merger with IHS Markit. 
And with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

What it brings is the ability to, first of all, consolidate many, many different information sources that we've had in the company across the years. It has a much better interface that you've seen if you started using it. It also incorporates new Kensho capabilities and improved search. It also has the data for ESG. It's easier to use for our risk services data.

You saw the very strong issuance in loans, which is driven by M&A. We've seen so far in the quarter, we saw a drop of corporates U.S. of 30%, while we saw an increase of structured finance of over 100%. So that's -- those are really big swings. 
We do see that the M&A activity should continue forward. There's a lot of M&A activity in the pipeline, which would bode well for loan issuance. That's not something that's in the bond forecast itself. But in the bond forecast, we see that in corporate, it's going to be down about 7%. There continues to be a strong liquidity for those types of issuers. The trend is right now, there's not a very big pipeline of issuance of corporates that we see. 
Financial services had strength the last couple of quarters. As you saw this quarter, financial institutions was up about 5%. In the U.S., it was actually up about 30%. So you did see some strength in that. So we do think that there's going to be some continuation, up about 1% -- sorry, it's 1% for 2022. 
For structured finance, we do think that there's going to be some continuation of interest in CLOs, but I'm not sure if that will continue across all asset classes with about a 3% increase. U.S. public finance close to flat, around 2% up. And then finally, total, when you look across all of those, given the volume of corporates, which we had down 7%, that would bring the total down about 2% in 2022. 
And as we said on the call, this is an initial issuance forecast of bonds. It's not a revenue forecast."

First, with respect to the revenue outlook for ESG for the full year, yes, we're still expecting to come in approximately $100 million of revenues for the full year. And one of the reasons is that there is some seasonality with respect to SAM revenues. Usually, it's a bit higher in the fourth quarter. 
So we're year-to-date at $67 million of ESG revenues. And again then we expect this to go up in the fourth quarter to approximately $100 million for the full year. So we are on track with respect to our forecast on the 40% CAGR that we expect over the next few years. And you see that we have a lot of positive momentum, a lot of new product launches, a lot of new initiatives going on, a lot of investments in ESG initiatives. So let me hand it over here to Doug."

So this is something that we're looking at across the board in all the different aspects of how markets are starting to use ESG data. You should expect that we're going to continue to invest in this area. You should hear from us every quarter that we've spent some money or invested in a different division to increase our sales force, our technical capabilities.

So let me expand a bit on that. 
You recall when we announced the transaction, we said that we had $350 million of revenue synergies and $480 million of cost synergies. That was based on very thorough process during due diligence. However, that was done by a smaller group of senior executives because, of course, a smaller group of people were aware that we're working on that transaction. 
Since then, we have had work streams in place and 4 submission rounds with respect to synergies through a very rigorous process. And we have been able to look much deeper into all the synergy categories from integrating corporate functions to optimizing real estate and technology, going very deep in procurement through clean room activities, procurement I already mentioned, eliminating duplicative costs. So many of those areas. And based on all of that very detailed work, we are confident now that we can raise those synergy targets, both for cost and revenues."

But let me give you some more details about the outlook for the remainder of the year. 
So what you see, Andrew, is a bit of direction of different initiatives going in opposite direction. So -- but first, we have the productivity program, where we take benefit so far this year from an expense growth perspective as well as the prerealized synergies on the S&P Global side that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. And of course, we're also taking benefit from the operating leverage. 
But what goes in the opposite direction is the strategic investments we are making in the strategic initiatives, for example, in ESG, for example, in the energy transition in Platts. And then also our variable expenses are going up. I consider those good expenses because they are directly linked to our sales levels and our revenue levels. So think about incentive compensation, commissions and cost of sales. 
So we expect those underlying trends to continue in the fourth quarter. Specifically, I would like to call out Platts because the Platts expenses might be a little higher in the fourth quarter, similar to what you saw in the third quarter because here you see particularly those variable expenses being a bit higher as well as the investments in the new initiatives. 
But that is also paying off because, as we mentioned, 1/3 of the revenue growth in Platts is coming from those new products. I hope that's helpful."

You're absolutely right that we're building up significant cash as a company. And our thinking about returning that because, obviously, this is temporarily elevated, returning that cash, the thinking about that is the following. 
So first, we have a catch-up to do because for the last 1.5 years, we have not been able to do share buybacks. And the same applies, by the way, for IHS Markit. So IHS Markit can also not do share buyback, so it's also building up its cash position. 
Then what we should add is some of the proceeds of the divestitures that will help with the capital return capacity. And then very quickly after the completion of the transaction, we would like to move to our new capital return target of at least 85% of free cash flow. 
So if you add up all of those pieces, then we're speaking about a very meaningful capital return number that we will be able to achieve after the completion of the transaction. I cannot give you a numerical answer on that right now. But what we are planning to do is give you the financial targets of the combined company in the first quarter, again after we complete the merger. 
With respect to your second part of the question, the cost to achieve. So we are looking still at those 3 different categories with respect to our merger-related costs. So we have transaction costs, integration costs and cost to achieve. 
Cost to achieve in my view, are, of course, the best category of cost because it's an investment to ultimately achieve those synergies. What we are looking at in terms of the overall best estimates with respect to the spend, the integration cost and the cost to achieve combined, we're looking at approximately 1.1x the overall cost and revenue synergies. So that's our best estimate in terms of what we expected to spend for integration and cost to achieve. But again, that is an investment in order to achieve ultimately those higher synergy numbers."

We see a big uptick in people attending our webinars, downloading our research. And we've also been pleased that we've been able to rate companies across the entire credit sector from AAA to BBB and then different types of companies, financial, structured products and our first nonfinancial corporates. 
But more to your question about the environment, we continue to see the financial regulators are very interested in reforming and updating their financial markets. We would see that when it comes to the ratings industry, there's interest in seeing more from us. They're talking about some reforms that would make the ratings industry more transparent and make it -- change some of the floors for what would be defined as a noninvestment-grade rating. 
But very importantly, we also see a whole slew of international financial firms getting licenses to operate 100% owned or more than 51% owned operations in China. Recently, Goldman Sachs received approval to take full ownership of its securities JV. Others include Fidelity, JPMorgan, Citi, BlackRock, et cetera. So we do think that in the financial markets, we see a very different rhetoric and a willingness to open and reform the markets compared to what you see sometimes in other parts of the market."

We have about 6 months from now to close the LCD and the loan indices. And those are not conditions to close the transaction, CUSIP is. 
And then with the CMA in the U.K., we also have the condition of the OPIS transaction and now something else is being added, that's called Base Chemicals. And we heard from them this morning that in general, they approve of that as a remedy that they would expect meets the needs.

Let me give you a couple of examples of that so that you can get more a feel behind it. 
So first, a lot of work has been underway in what we call the procurement clean room. So about $2.5 billion of spend of both companies has been analyzed there, 25,000 active contracts. And that has led to some opportunities, further opportunities that have been identified. Also, there is a clean room for cross-sell, and we have found about 200 synergies with respect to cross-sell through that clean room activity. 
And then what we did not expect before were certain synergy benefits from segments that we basically did not have on the list before. So we now have synergies also being identified in Ratings, in transportation, in CMS and in CRISIL. So those are a couple of examples. But I would say, in general, really more opportunities in all of the areas across both organizations and of course, then the combined company in the future."

Well, as you know, these are businesses that the EC and the CMA have looked at with a lot of depth. They go to the market, they go to market participants to ask them to look at the businesses as we bring them together and to give them feedback as to what would look -- what would be the competitiveness of those businesses. 
So when it comes to the discussion with the EC, they determined that CUSIP and LCD and loan indices would create some sort of an additional competitive advantage. And in the discussions with them and looking at their understanding and belief of the market position, we agreed that, that would be a remedy that would meet their needs to ensure that we didn't have a dominant position in the market. 
So this is a -- this is something that they look at. You can actually read their letter that has been published that they have a very short couple of paragraphs that describe their views of that and how they feel about it. But they've also given us what they call an approval with conditions, which we think was a very positive aspect. 
Similarly, with the CMA, they go to market, they listen to market participants. And they came back with a discussion about the Base Chemicals business that would also create a competitive issue in the U.K. And in discussions and negotiations with them, we also agreed that, that would be a condition that we would meet in order to get approval on the transaction. 
So these are what the regulators do. They look at the market, they speak with market participants, and then we discuss these with them. And in these cases, we've agreed that we would make these divestitures in order to close the deal. 
You asked about conditionality. It's our understanding in the case of the CMA, we would need to have a buyer identified that they would vet of the Base Chemicals business and also the OPIS business in which we already have a buyer. And in the case of the EC, we'd have to have a buyer identified for the OPIS and related businesses, which we already have. 
And then for CUSIP, we'd have to have a buyer we have identified and vetted before we can close the deal. But for LCD and loan indices, we have 6 months from now, and we could close the deal without having a buyer for that transaction."

One is related to something you mentioned, and that is that as we improve our capabilities, make it easier to find data to search it, to chart it, to download it, et cetera, that makes the products more sticky. It makes more people use the product. It brings more people to the platform, which is a virtuous cycle, which then allows us to have stronger negotiations when it comes to price increases. 
So there is not necessarily a direct increase that comes from the launch of these platforms, but it does give us that virtuous cycle. In addition, it makes it easier for -- to plug in and add new data sets, which do sometimes bring new contracts and new revenue along with those. 
In addition, you asked about the expense side of this. As we redeploy resources from turning off and changing older platforms, it allows us to either have an expense save or, in many cases, it allows us to redeploy those programmers and developers into areas where the highest growth opportunities like what we've talked about earlier, something on ESG, private markets, the areas that we're quite excited about with the merger with IHS Markit, how we're going to be able to bring energy transition products, further credit and risk products, et cetera.

So the way how you can solve for that partially is through so-called clean rooms, where you have a separate, segregated area where people can look into those specific details. But that can never be shared with any of the respective organizations. 
So definitely, after we are able to complete the transaction, we have an opportunity to look even more deeper into all of that and further make those synergy numbers more robust compared to what we have now. But again, as I said before, we think that we have a very rigorous process in place. 
We have already had 4 submission rounds, bottom-up substantiation of all of the synergies. We'll have a fifth round before the ultimate completion of the transaction. And then definitely, of course, we'll then learn more after we can start to operate as a combined company."

We issued a news release with our results earlier today. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.
Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in today's conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  
In addition, as announced late last year, S&P Global and IHS Markit entered into a definitive merger agreement. In March, shareholders of both companies overwhelmingly voted in favor of the merger. The merger is pending regulatory approval, and we currently expect to close in the first quarter of 2022. This call will touch on the merger, but does not constitute an offer to sell or buy or the solicitation of any offer to buy or sell any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities law of any such jurisdiction. No offering of securities shall be made except by means of prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933.
In connection with the proposed transaction, S&P Global and IHS Markit has filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which includes a joint proxy statement and a prospectus. S&P Global and IHS Markit have filed other documents regarding the proposed transaction with the SEC. Investors and security holders of S&P Global or IHS Markit stock are urged to carefully read the entire registration statement and joint proxy statement/prospectus, which is available on our website and sec.gov.
In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management.  
The earnings release and the slides contain exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This call, especially the discussion of our outlook, contains statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in our filings with the SEC and on our website.  
I would also like to call your attention to a European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company.
We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Ola Fadahunsi at (212) 438-2296.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?"

Welcome to today's third quarter earnings call. I'd like to start with some of the highlights of the quarter.

Welcome to today's third quarter earnings call. I'd like to start with some of the highlights of the quarter. We reported exceptional financial results with revenue increasing 13% and all 4 businesses delivering strong revenue and adjusted operating profit growth. Indices delivered the strongest revenue growth for the second straight quarter due to large gains in ETF AUM. Adjusted expenses increased 7% largely due to investment spending, commissions and royalties.
After raising guidance on both the first quarter and second quarter earnings calls, we're raising 2021 guidance again based on these strong results and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Ewout will provide details in a moment.
I would also like to share some additional highlights from the third quarter. The most important initiative of the year continues to be our upcoming merger with IHS Markit. This is an incredibly transformative opportunity for our company and our customers. The regulatory path to closing the merger is now becoming clear.  
We launched S&P Capital IQ Pro and Platts Dimensions Pro. And Sustainable1, our ESG business, is gaining momentum as we build internal capabilities and product offerings expand. I'll come back to all of these highlights in more detail, but let's start with the merger.
When we announced the merger in November 2020, we noted that we needed regulatory approval in 5 jurisdictions: Canada, the European Union, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. We've made substantial progress with all these regulators, and there are a number of remedies we must undertake in order to complete the merger.
IHS Markit must divest the OPIS, the Coal, Metals & Mining and the PetChem Wire businesses. The sale of these assets to News Corp has already been announced. In addition, IHS Markit must divest its Base Chemicals business. S&P Global must divest CUSIP Global Services and Leveraged Commentary and Data, together with related family of leveraged loan indices.
S&P Global and IHS Markit will begin the process of selling these additional businesses shortly. In order to provide time to undertake these sales processes, we now expect to close the merger in the first quarter of 2022. Collectively, the revenue from all of the businesses being divested is approximately $425 million, and the margins for each of these businesses are higher than the margins for each of the divisions they're in.  
In a moment, Ewout will provide an update on our merger synergy expectations. And you will see that despite these divestitures, we are raising both our cost and revenue synergy targets.
To recap the financial results for the third quarter, revenue increased 13% to $2.1 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 18%, and our adjusted operating profit margin increased 250 basis points to 55.4%.
As you know, we measure and track adjusted operating profit margin on trailing 4-quarter basis, which increased 130 basis points to 55.1%. As a result, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 24%.  
Each quarter, we highlight a few key business drivers and important projects underway. This quarter, let's start with ratings bond issuance trends. During the third quarter, global bond issuance increased 3%. In the U.S., bond issuance in aggregate increased 6% as investment grade decreased 12%, high yield decreased 16%, public finance decreased 24% while structured finance increased 105% due to large increases in every category, particularly CLOs, which increased 340%.
European bond issuance increased 4% as investment-grade decreased 7%, high-yield decreased 4% and structured finance increased 70% with gains in every asset class except RMBS. Of particular note, CMBS increased 375%.
In Asia, bond issuance decreased 2% overall. The data on this slide only depicts bond issuance. When we include new bank loan volumes, overall global issuance increased 9%.
The next 2 slides look at the combined high-yield issuance and leveraged loan volume for the U.S. and Europe. Data is not readily available for the rest of the world. This slide shows that the combination of global leveraged loan and high-yield issuance in the third quarter continued to be very strong, surpassing every quarter in 2018, '19 and '20.
This slide depicts the combination of high-yield issuance and leveraged loan volume by the use of proceeds of the funds raised. This quarter, both general corporate purpose and refinancing-related issuance was lower than the third quarter of 2020. The surge in activity is entirely due to M&A, LBOs, buybacks and dividends. These are opportunistic categories that aren't pull forward. The surge in issuance is not pulling forward issuance from future years, and it is additive to future financing needs.  
Since bank loan ratings are an important element of Ratings revenue, we like to disclose our bank loan ratings revenue each quarter. The unprecedented strength of bank loan ratings revenue continued in the third quarter, and year-to-date revenues already surpassed any of the previous 10 full years.
The leveraged loan market and the CLO market are dependent on one another as many of the leveraged loans end up in CLOs. As you can see here, CLO issuance continued to accelerate in the third quarter.
During the third quarter, we rebranded our Market Intelligence platform as S&P Capital IQ Pro. This recognizes the value of the Capital IQ brand as we continue to upgrade the platform with additional content and functionality. We currently have approximately 290,000 active Desktop users, of which 90,000 are utilizing S&P Capital IQ Pro.
The inaugural release of S&P Capital IQ Pro includes a number of capabilities not found in the Market Intelligence platform. A new Kensho-enabled Document Viewer incorporates AI-based search to speed up users' discovery of text-based insights across filings and transcripts. It's based on technology that Kensho originally developed for U.S. security and military agencies and is now reengineered for S&P Capital IQ Pro. For example, it gives investors the ability to quickly screen comments made over years of earnings calls within minutes.
The new platform features frequent coverage of private markets, including data around fundraising trends, dry powder, fund performance and LP investor allocations. Also included is the ability for users to screen on nontraditional industry criteria, such as crypto, therapeutics and clean tech.  
S&P Capital IQ Pro also includes Ratings' direct coverage of corporates and financial institutions. Our users can now incorporate the full suite of S&P Capital IQ Pro tools and functionality and interact with S&P Global Ratings content in ways not previously possible.
Platts has been on a long journey to consolidate its product platforms as well with the acquisitions of BENTEK, Eclipse, cFlow, Petromedia and others. There's been a tremendous effort to consolidate all of these capabilities into a single platform.
This quarter, Platts introduced Platts Dimensions Pro, which provides users with a seamless one-stop shop experience across Platts benchmark price assessments, news and analytics, spanning 13 commodities, including energy transition. And like S&P Capital IQ Pro, this content is available on a web-based portal that is mobile-friendly via machine-to-machine delivery and as an Excel Add-In.  
Periodically, we like to provide updates on new product launches. The first 2 charts on this slide depict the acceptance by market participants of our JKM marker for liquefied natural gas and our low sulfur marine fuel assessment. Both have exhibited very strong growth recently.
The chart on the right shows the cumulative number of new assessments we have launched in the energy transition space in the last 4 years. These include a new suite of Australian hydrogen prices covering what is expected to be one of the key producers of this future fuel.  
The methane performance certificate, which reflects production of natural gas in the U.S. with 0 methane emissions and upstream values for the measured carbon emissions associated with crude oil production and transportation, covering an initial suite of 14 crudes from around the world and aiming to provide the backbone for low-carbon crude trading. Buyers can start to make active choices based on the relative carbon impact of different crude sources with this crude carbon intensity product.  
Turning to our investments in ESG. Our Sustainable1 milestones and product launches continue to build. Third quarter Sustainable1 revenue increased 58% to $24 million versus the prior period.
With the launch of Second Party Opinions, ratings now has 5 products Overall, Ratings completed 10 ESG evaluations, 13 Green evaluations, 13 SAM Benchmark Engagements and 11 Social & Sustainability Framework Alignment Opinions in the quarter.  
In Market Intelligence, we're close to wrapping up the annual CSA survey. And so far in 2021, corporate participation increased 34% to over 1,800 companies. On the back of these surveys, we relaunched our S&P Global ESG scores on 8,000 companies during the quarter. We're targeting to have scores on more than 11,000 companies by the end of this year's assessment cycle in the first quarter of 2022.  
In Indices, we had $26.5 billion of ESG ETF AUM at the end of the third quarter. This is an increase of 178% since the end of the third quarter of last year. Our Indices business also added to its ESG Indices offerings with the launch of the S&P/NZX 50 Tilted Index with the New Zealand Stock Exchange. Platts added products to both its suite of carbon assessments and its recycled plastic offerings.
And finally, S&P Global is a founding member of Novata, a new technology platform designed to provide private equity firms and the private markets with ESG measurement, data collection and benchmarking capabilities to help improve the management and tracking of ESG performance.  
By providing rich detailed data on a wide array of ESG topics, the Corporate Sustainability Assessment is an integral part of our ESG scores. Since we purchased the capability from RobecoSAM in late 2019, we've expanded the number of corporate participants by about 500 companies. And the group has almost doubled corporate participation in the last 4 years. Today's participating companies represent 45% of global market capitalization.  
In addition, you can see this is a global endeavor. We view the CSA input as a key differentiator to our Sustainable1 efforts.  
Let me now turn to our outlook for global issuance and GDP. The 2021 issuance forecast continued to creep higher and is now relatively flat versus 2020 issuance. The latest forecast was issued earlier this week and also covers 2022 issuance for the first time.  
2022 issuance is forecast to decline 2%. This is based on a 7% decrease in nonfinancial corporates, a 1% increase in financial services, a 3% increase in structured finance and a 2% increase in U.S. public finance.  
Looking forward, inflation concerns, prospects for rising rates, high cash balances and possible tax reform, all translate to headwinds for issuance in 2022. We expect that they will lead to a second year of contraction in issuance totals.
Please note that this is a bond issuance forecast. This is not a revenue forecast. For example, it doesn't address nontransaction revenue and doesn't include leveraged loan activity.  
The macro outlook is little changed from 3 months ago. Our economists expect growth to moderate in 2022 with growth in Europe and many emerging markets improving, while growth rates drop in the U.S. and China. Commodity prices have rebound due to strong retail sales, weather events and supply chain imbalances. However, inflation pressures appear to be peaking with some emerging market central banks raising rates, U.S. Federal Reserve moving up its tapering time line and the ECB firmly on hold for now.  
Finally, Platts Analytics believes that current fundamentals should remain supportive of oil prices in the mid-70s. This is positive for the health of the oil industry.
I will now turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?"

While we have excellent third quarter results and an exciting merger pending, I would like to start my discussion today with our latest thinking around our merger synergy targets.

While we have excellent third quarter results and an exciting merger pending, I would like to start my discussion today with our latest thinking around our merger synergy targets. There has been an extensive effort throughout the company to identify and validate potential merger synergies. While the initial synergy targets that we introduced at the time of the merger announcement were developed by a very limited number of senior managers, the latest figures take into consideration in-depth planning and analysis by countless employees across both companies.
We have increased our total synergy target and now estimate that there will be $530 million to $580 million of cost synergies and $330 million to $360 million of revenue synergies. As you can see in the slide, this takes into consideration new synergies identified as well as those who we'll no longer be able to achieve due to required divestitures. Correspondingly, the proceeds of the divestitures will contribute to additional capacity for share repurchases.
I also want to point out that on a run rate basis, we have already achieved approximately $25 million of these synergies. This is primarily from not backfilling open positions created through normal attrition.
Today, we're only providing an update on the merger synergy targets. We'll give you a full update on the financial targets of the merged company after we complete the transaction.  
Turning to our third quarter financial results. Doug covered the highlights of strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. I will take a moment to cover a few other items.  
Adjusted corporate unallocated expenses increased 18% due to company-owned life insurance proceeds in the prior period. Our net interest expense improved 13% due to the refinancing of a substantial portion of our debt last year. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to a refinement of tax accruals on foreign operations related to both a prior and current period.
During the quarter, changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact on adjusted EPS of $0.02. The only meaningful impact was in Ratings, where adjusted operating profit was positively impacted by $5 million.
In the second quarter, we introduced 3 new categories to provide insights into the type of expenses that are going to be incurred related to the pending merger. The first category is transaction cost. These are costs related to completing the merger. They include legal fees, investment banking fees and filing fees. The second category is integration cost. These are costs to operationalize the integration. They include consulting, infrastructure and retention costs. The third category is cost to achieve. These are costs needed to enable expense and revenue synergies. They include lease terminations, severance, contract exit fees and investments related to product development, marketing and distribution enhancements.
During the third quarter, the non-GAAP adjustments collectively totaled to a net pretax loss of $73 million. They included $9 million for merger transaction costs, primarily legal fees; $45 million for merger integration costs, primarily consulting fees; a $3 million gain on the sale of an office building in India; and $21 million in deal-related amortization.  
This quarter, all 4 divisions delivered solid gains in revenue and adjusted operating profit with Indices delivering the largest gains. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted operating profit margin increased in all 4 divisions with Indices leading with a gain of 170 basis points. I'll provide color on the individual business results in a moment.  
Now turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong with low leverage and ample liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 billion and debt of $4.1 billion. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA improved since the end of last year to 1.8x.
Free cash flow, excluding certain items, was $2.6 billion in the first 9 months of 2021, an increase of more than $300 million or 15% over the prior year period. Due to the pending merger with IHS Markit, share repurchases have been suspended.
Now let's turn to the division results and begin with S&P Dow Jones Indices, which delivered extraordinary revenue growth of 28% primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices. Please note that the ETF revenue included a $5 million breakup fee due to the termination of our indices as the basis for several ETFs.  
In the third quarter, adjusted expenses increased 4% largely due to royalties and compensation, partially offset by reduced legal costs. The adjusted segment operating profit increased a whopping 40%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 660 basis points to 71.8%. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 170 basis points to 70.7%.  
Every category increased revenue this quarter. Asset-linked fees increased 36% primarily from gains in ETFs, augmented by gains in mutual funds and insurance and over-the-counter derivative activity that exceeded 20%. Exchange-traded derivative revenue increased 15% on increased trading volumes at the CBOE. Data and custom subscriptions increased 8%.  
For our Indices division, over the past year, ETF net inflows were $223 billion, and market appreciation totaled $524 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.5 trillion, which is 43% higher compared to 1 year ago.  
Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 48% year-over-year. Sequentially versus the end of the second quarter, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $55 billion, and market depreciation totaled $16 billion. Exchange-traded derivative activity was mixed during the quarter. Activity at the CBOE increased with S&P 500 Index options activity increasing 39% and VIX futures and options activity increasing 31%. Activity at the CME equity complex decreased 6% due primarily to a 22% decrease in Micro E-mini volumes.  
Ratings delivered very strong revenue growth, increasing 14% with strength in bank loan ratings, structured finance and nontransaction activity. Adjusted expenses increased 9% primarily due to increased salaries, headcount at CRISIL, growth initiatives and incentives. This resulted in a 17% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 160 basis point increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 63.8%.  
In China, we see continued momentum and interest in our ratings. We completed 15 ratings in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 46 compared to 22 in all last year. Nontransaction revenue increased 15% primarily due to growth in fees associated with surveillance, increased new entity ratings activity, CRISIL and Rating Evaluation Services revenue. Transaction revenue increased as a 150% increase in bank loan ratings activity and strong structured product issuance more than offset a decline in corporate bond issuance.  
This slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributor to the increase in Ratings revenue was the 48% increase in structured finance driven by CLOs, CMBS and ABS. In addition, corporates increased 14%, financial services increased 8%, government decreased 12%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 14%.
Market Intelligence delivered reported revenue growth of 7% and 8% on an organic basis. More than 1/3 of the revenue growth was from recent product investments, which increased by 40% led by ESG and the S&P Global Marketplace. Adjusted expenses increased 4% primarily due to higher investment spending, particularly in ESG, S&P Global Marketplace, SME and China, additional infrastructure spending supporting our cloud initiatives and S&P Capital IQ Pro and data which is primarily license fees tied to aftermarket research revenue. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 13%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 35.7%. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 90 basis points to 33.8%.  
Looking across Market Intelligence, there was solid growth in each category. Desktop revenue grew 6%, Data Management Solutions revenue grew 12%, Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 7%.  
And now turning to Platts. Reported revenue increased 8%. Our core subscriptions increased 7%. It's notable that more than 1/3 of the growth came from new products, primarily ESG and LNG.  
Global Trading Services had a great quarter, increasing 14% mainly due to strong LNG and petroleum volumes. GTS activity often picks up when commodity prices become more volatile. Adjusted expenses increased 11% primarily due to growth initiatives, incentives and commissions. In addition, expenses in the third quarter last year were aided by management actions.  
Adjusted segment operating profit increased 5%, and adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 110 basis points to 54.6%. The trailing 4-quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 70 basis points to 55.6%. While there was revenue growth in every category, petrochemicals, natural gas, power and renewables and shipping, all delivered double-digit growth.  
Because the company now anticipates closing the merger with IHS Markit in the first quarter of 2022, we're able to provide 2021 GAAP guidance for the first time. This slide depicts our new GAAP guidance.  
And this slide depicts our adjusted guidance. Third column shows our new 2021 adjusted guidance with all the line items that changed highlighted. We're making these changes primarily due to greater revenue growth in Ratings and Indices.  
Therefore, our revenue guidance has increased from high single-digit increase to a low double-digit increase. Corporate unallocated is increased by $5 million to a new range of $140 million to $150 million due to increased incentives and a charitable contribution.  
Operating profit margin is increased by a range of 40 to 60 basis points to a new range of 55% to 55.5%. This results in a $0.50 to $0.55 increase to adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a new range of $13.50 to $13.65. And finally, free cash flow generation has been increased by $100 million to a range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion.  
In conclusion, 2021 is turning out to be an exceptionally strong year for the company. All our businesses are delivering solid growth. We continue to expand our ESG product offerings, and we are making great progress on the upcoming merger with IHS Markit.  
And with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions."

You saw the very strong issuance in loans, which is driven by M&A. We've seen so far, in the quarter, we saw a drop of corporates in U.S. of 30%, while we saw an increase of structured finance of over 100%. So that's -- those are really big swings. 
We do see that the M&A activity should continue forward. There's a lot of M&A activity in the pipeline, which would bode well for loan issuance. That's not something that's in the bond forecast itself. But in the bond forecast, we see that in corporates, it's going to be down about 7%. There continues to be a strong liquidity for those types of issuers. The trend is right now, there's not a very big pipeline of issuance of corporates that we see. 
Financial services had, had strength the last couple of quarters. As you saw this quarter, financial institutions was up about 5%. In the U.S., it was actually up about 30%. So you did see some strength in that. So we do think that there's going to be some continuation, up about 1% -- sorry, it's 1% for 2022. 
For structured finance, we do think that there's going to be some continuation of interest in CLOs, but I'm not sure if that will continue across all asset classes with about a 3% increase. U.S. public finance close to flat, around 2% up. And then finally, total, when you look across all of those, given the volume of corporates, which we had down 7%, that would bring the total down about 2% in 2022.

First, with respect to the revenue outlook for ESG for the full year, yes, we're still expecting to come in approximately $100 million of revenues for the full year. And one of the reasons is that there is some seasonality with respect to SAM revenues. Usually, it's a bit higher in the fourth quarter. 
So we're year-to-date at $67 million of ESG revenues. And again then we expect this to go up in the fourth quarter to approximately $100 million for the full year. So we are on track with respect to our forecast on the 40% CAGR that we expect over the next few years. And you see that we have a lot of positive momentum, a lot of new product launches, a lot of new initiatives going on, a lot of investments in ESG initiatives. So let me hand it over here to Doug."

As you saw, we launched the partnership with the Ford Foundation, Hamilton Lane and Omidyar for the Novata platform for the private markets and private equity. So we're looking across all the different types of opportunities to bring ESG data into the market so you have the most transparency, the most comprehensive, consistent approach to providing those ESG solutions to the market.
So this is something that we're looking at across the board in all the different aspects of how markets are starting to use ESG data. You should expect that we're going to continue to invest in this area. You should hear from us every quarter that we've spent some money or invested in a different division to increase our sales force, our technical capabilities.

So let me expand a bit on that. 
You recall when we announced the transaction, we said that we had $350 million of revenue synergies and $480 million of cost synergies. That was based on very thorough process during due diligence. However, that was done by a smaller group of senior executives because, of course, a smaller group of people were aware that we're working on that transaction.
Since then, we have had work streams in place and 4 submission rounds with respect to synergies through a very rigorous process. And we have been able to look much deeper into all the synergy categories from integrating corporate functions to optimizing real estate and technology, going very deep in procurement through clean room activities, procurement, I already mentioned, eliminating duplicative costs. So many of those areas. And based on all of that very detailed work, we are confident now that we can raise those synergy targets, both for cost and revenues."

But let me give you some more details about the outlook for the remainder of the year. 
So what you see, Andrew, is a bit of direction of different initiatives going in opposite direction. So at first, we have the productivity program, where we take benefit so far this year from an expense growth perspective as well as the prerealized synergies on the S&P Global side that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. And of course, we're also taking benefit from the operating leverage. 
But what goes in the opposite direction is the strategic investments we are making and the strategic initiatives, for example in ESG, for example in the energy transition in Platts, and then also our variable expenses are going up. I consider those good expenses because they are directly linked to our sales levels and our revenue levels. So think about incentive compensation, commissions and cost of sales. 
So we expect those underlying trends to continue in the fourth quarter. Specifically, I would like to call out Platts because the Platts expenses might be a little higher in the fourth quarter, similar to what you saw in the third quarter because here you see particularly those variable expenses being a bit higher as well as the investments in the new initiatives.
But that is also paying off because, as we mentioned, 1/3 of the revenue growth in Platts is coming from those new products. I hope that's helpful."

You're absolutely right that we're building up significant cash as a company. And our thinking about returning that because, obviously, this is temporarily elevated, returning that cash, the thinking about that is the following.
So first, we have a catch-up to do because for the last 1.5 years, we have not been able to do share buybacks. And the same applies, by the way, for IHS Markit. So IHS Markit can also not do share buyback, so it's also building up its cash position. 
Then what we should add is some of the proceeds of the divestitures that will help with the capital return capacity. And then very quickly after the completion of the transaction, we would like to move to our new capital return target of at least 85% of free cash flow. 
So if you add up all of those pieces, then we're speaking about a very meaningful capital return number that we will be able to achieve after the completion of the transaction. I cannot give you a numerical answer on that right now. But what we are planning to do is give you the financial targets of the combined company in the first quarter, again after we complete the merger. 
With respect to your second part of the question, the cost to achieve. So we are looking still at those 3 different categories with respect to our merger-related costs. So we have transaction cost, integration cost and cost to achieve. 
Cost to achieve in my view, are, of course, the best category of cost because it's an investment to ultimately achieve those synergies. What we are looking at in terms of the overall best estimates with respect to the spend, the integration cost and the cost to achieve combined, we're looking at approximately 1.1x the overall cost and revenue synergies. So that's our best estimate in terms of what we expected to spend for integration and cost to achieve. But again, that is an investment in order to achieve ultimately those higher synergy numbers."

We see a big uptick in people attending our webinars, downloading our research. And we've also been pleased that we've been able to rate companies across the entire credit sector from AAA to BBB and then different types of companies, financial, structured products and our first nonfinancial corporates. 
But more to your question about the environment, we continue to see the financial regulators are very interested in reforming and updating their financial markets. We would see that when it comes to the ratings industry, there's interest in seeing more from us. They're talking about some reforms that would make the ratings industry more transparent and make it -- change some of the floors for what would be defined as a noninvestment-grade rating. 
But very importantly, we also see a whole slew of international financial firms getting licenses to operate 100% owned or more than 51% owned operations in China. Recently, Goldman Sachs received approval to take full ownership of its securities JV. Others include Fidelity, JPMorgan, Citi, BlackRock, et cetera. So we do think that in the financial markets, we see a very different rhetoric and a willingness to open and reform the markets compared to what you see sometimes in other parts of the markets."

We have about 6 months from now to close the LCD and the loan indices. And those are not conditions to close the transaction, CUSIP is. 
And then with the CMA in the U.K., we also have the condition of the OPIS transaction and now something else is being added, that's called base chemicals. And we heard from them this morning that in general, they approve of that as a remedy that they would expect meets the needs.

What you see is -- underneath is a couple of developments. First, we are seeing that surveillance fees are going up. That is being helped last year by the very high level of bond issuance activity and this year, of course, by bank loan rating activity where we also are receiving surveillance fees. So indeed, some part of that, you may expect to also continue in the future beyond 2021.
Then what we also see is a lot of activity with respect to initial credit ratings this year, Rating Evaluation Service, which is helped by the M&A environment. And then CRISIL also is doing very well and is also showing very healthy growth. So all of the underlying categories in nontransaction revenue doing very well."

We, by the way, see this both as a risk as -- and as an opportunity because if there are a lot of people on the move in the labor market, it's also a clear opportunity to pick up some really good talent as a company. Moreover, with the hybrid working model that we are introducing, we also think that it is attractive as an employer that we can offer that. And it also offers a possibility to look at talent in a much wider geographical area that we're looking at before.
So we're closely monitoring this. At this point in time, our economists believe that the inflation pressure should be transitory. So that's more our base case. But we're definitely running stress tests to think about if inflation would be more permanent, what that would mean for the company and what management actions we can take."

Let me give you a couple of examples of that so that you can get a more feel behind it. 
So first, a lot of work has been underway in what we call the procurement's clean room. So about $2.5 billion of spend of both companies has been analyzed there, 25,000 active contracts. And that has led to some opportunities, further opportunities that have been identified. Also, there is a clean room for cross-sell, and we have found about 200 synergies with respect to cross-sell through that clean room activity. 
And then what we did not expect before were certain synergy benefits from segments that we basically did not have on the list before. So we now have synergies also being identified in Ratings, in Transportation, in CMS and in CRISIL. So those are a couple of examples.

Well, as you know, these are businesses that the EC and the CMA have looked at with a lot of depth. They go to the market, they go to market participants to ask them to look at the businesses as we bring them together and to give them feedback as to what would look -- what would be the competitiveness of those businesses. 
So when it comes to the discussion with the EC, they determined that CUSIP and LCD and the loan indices would create some sort of an additional competitive advantage. And in the discussions with them and looking at their understanding and belief of the market position, we agreed that, that would be a remedy that would meet their needs to ensure that we didn't have a dominant position in the market. 
So this is a -- this is something that they look at. You can actually read their letter that has been published that they have a very short couple of paragraphs that describe their views of that and how they feel about it. But they've also given us what they call an approval with conditions, which we think was a very positive aspect. 
Similarly, with the CMA, they go to market, they listen to market participants. And they came back with a discussion about the base chemicals business that would also create a competitive issue in the U.K. And in discussions and negotiations with them, we also agreed that, that would be a condition that we would meet in order to get approval on the transaction.
So these are what the regulators do. They look at the market, they speak with market participants, and then we discuss these with them. And in these cases, we've agreed that we would make these divestitures in order to close the deal. 
You asked about conditionality. It's our understanding in the case of the CMA, we would need to have a buyer identified that they would vet of the base chemicals business and also the OPIS business in which we already have a buyer. And in the case of the EC, we'd have to have a buyer identified for the OPIS and related businesses, which we already have.
And then for CUSIP, we'd have to have a buyer we have identified and vetted before we can close the deal. But for LCD and loan indices, we have 6 months from now, and we could close the deal without having a buyer for that transaction."

One is related to something you mentioned, and that is as we improve our capabilities, make it easier to find data to search it, to chart it, to download it, et cetera, that makes the products more sticky.

So there is not necessarily a direct increase that comes from the launch of these platforms, but it does give us that virtuous cycle. In addition, it makes it easier for -- to plug in and add new data sets, which do sometimes bring new contracts and new revenue along with those.
In addition, you asked about the expense side of this. As we redeploy resources from turning off and changing older platforms, it allows us to either have an expense save or, in many cases, it allows us to redeploy those programmers and developers into areas where the highest growth opportunities like what we've talked about earlier, something on ESG, private markets, the areas that we're quite excited about with the merger with IHS Markit, how we're going to be able to bring energy transition products, further credit and risk products, et cetera.

And as you saw, we had very strong performance in the third quarter. We delivered exceptional financial results with a 13% top line growth, an adjusted diluted EPS of 24% growth. 
We launched new product platforms. We advanced our ESG propositions and many, many more things going on. And as we're able to talk about, we're moving forward on the IHS Markit merger. This is something that we're very excited about. The path towards regulatory approval is getting clear. 
We now have to execute on the divestitures that we discussed today to achieve the full value. But also, we don't want to rush. We want to have time to close and also to make sure that we can execute those transactions well. 
As you know, we also have integration planning going on, which is identifying synergies. But more importantly, it's also identifying strategies for our businesses, how we're going to work together, how we're going to address the needs of our customers, how we're going to be bringing together technology and very importantly, data and then most importantly, our people and our culture. And all of this work is going extremely well. 
But today on this call, I also want to thank our people. They've been working now for 600 days. It sounds like a lot. It's 600 days people have been working from home and working remotely, starting to come back to the offices. And when they do, I'd love to welcome them depending on which offices we are around the world. 
But our people have been dedicated. They've been working hard. They've been able to deliver the kind of results that you saw earlier as well as work on this exciting transformation for the company with the merger. 
They've been diligent. They're helping rethink and reimagine the future of the work. And I want to thank them for all of their dedication and commitment to making this company what it is and looking forward to the future for building an even better company. 
And then finally, I want to thank everyone on the call, the analysts for your questions and also the shareholders for your support. And thank you very much. Looking forward to a great fourth quarter and the holidays at the end of the year. Thanks, everyone."
