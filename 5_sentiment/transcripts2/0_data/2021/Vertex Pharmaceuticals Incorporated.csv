36235,702044327,2187366,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2021",2021-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated","Executives","I'll begin this evening's call with comments on our 2020 performance and then turn to the pipeline, including an overview of a number of our R&D programs and upcoming milestones. 2020 was an unprecedented year for governments, businesses and people around",1243,"I'll begin this evening's call with comments on our 2020 performance and then turn to the pipeline, including an overview of a number of our R&D programs and upcoming milestones. 2020 was an unprecedented year for governments, businesses and people around the globe. It was also a remarkable year for Vertex. Despite the challenges we all faced against the backdrop of the pandemic, Vertex delivered extraordinary commercial performance generating $6.2 billion in product revenues, representing more than 50% growth compared to 2019. We also meaningfully advanced the pipeline and significantly strengthened our financial position. 
Vertex has discovered and developed medicines that have transformed the treatment of cystic fibrosis. And the latest of these, TRIKAFTA, or Kaftrio, as it's known in the EU, has the potential to treat up to 90% of patients with cystic fibrosis. In 2020, the first full year after TRIKAFTA approval in the U.S., the number of patients with CF treated with our medicines increased substantially. And by the end of the year, the vast majority of eligible patients 12 years and older in the U.S. were on TRIKAFTA. 
In Q3, we received early approval for Kaftrio in the EU and also secured reimbursement in England. By the end of the year, with direct access at marketing authorization in Germany, portfolio agreements in Ireland and Denmark and the reimbursement deal in the U.K., thousands of patients across the EU gained access to Kaftrio. In terms of next steps in CF, we have line of sight to continued significant growth as we expand access to the triple combination to more patients in the EU, to cure approvals in new geographies as well as extend treatment to patients with rare mutations and younger populations, starting with the 6 to 11 year olds in the U.S. We're also advancing additional small molecule combination regimen and other approaches that will further define our long-term leadership in CF. Our goal remains to bring transformative therapies to all people with this disease. 
2020 was also an important year for our pipeline. We delivered proof-of-concept in 2 disease areas and advanced several clinical programs, spanning multiple modalities and we are now poised to move the VX-880 program into the clinic for type 1 diabetes, our seventh disease area in clinical development and our first cell-based therapy. 
Turning to our financial position, which continues to strengthen. As we treat more patients, our revenues and profitability are growing, and we finished the year with $6.7 billion in cash. We are steadfast in our belief that the best way to drive continued growth and create long-term value is to reinvest this capital in innovation, both internal and external. With respect to external innovation, our strategy remains the same. Invest in assets that complement our internal CF pipeline, seek assets that fit our R&D strategy and identify tools to add to our toolkit. What has changed is our position in CF and our growing financial firepower. Given where we are with TRIKAFTA and Kaftrio, plus line of sight to novel regimens and treatment for the last 10% and given our balance sheet, we are now in a position to focus on assets that fit our R&D strategy and consider assets in mid and late stage. 
Moving on to an update on the pipeline. I'll focus on our R&D portfolio outside of CF and provide additional detail, including upcoming milestones on a number of programs. In total, we are active in clinical development in 7 disease areas, spanning multiple modalities, including small molecule, gene editing and cell therapy with each program holding the potential to transform the course of the targeted disease. 
I'll start with CTX001, our most clinically derisked program outside of CF, which we are developing with our partner, CRISPR Therapeutics. In December, groundbreaking clinical data in sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented in a plenary session at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting. These data demonstrated proof-of-concept and showed that CTX001 has the potential to be a onetime functional cure for people living with these diseases. 
We're also pleased to share that the first patient treated in the thalassemia study recently completed 2 years of follow-up and has enrolled in the long-term follow-up study. We are advancing through clinical development with urgency, and our goal is to be able to bring this therapy to patients as soon as possible. 
Over the course of 2021, there are 3 key milestones that will mark our progress with CTX001. First, the presentation of additional clinical data for more patients and for a longer duration of follow-up that will further define the efficacy and durability of this therapy, the completion of enrollment of our 2 ongoing studies of CTX001 and third, the progression of our discussions with regulators about the data needed for a filing package for approval of CTX001. 
In our alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, or AATD program, we're focused on the development of small molecule correctors to address the Z-AAT protein folding defect, the underlying cause of this disease. And thereby, treat both lung and liver manifestations of the disease. Our most advanced molecules, VX-864, which is progressing through a dose-ranging Phase II proof-of-concept study. The goal of the study is to assess safety, PK and levels of functional AAT protein. The study continues to enroll in dose patients, and we expect to have the results in the first half of this year. Consistent with our portfolio approach, that is to say our strategy of advancing multiple molecules simultaneously through early clinical development for each target across our disease areas, we are also on track to advance an additional small molecule AAT corrector into the clinic in 2021. 
Our lead molecule in the APOL1-mediated FSGS, VX-147, is also currently being studied in a Phase II proof-of-concept study, evaluating the safety, PK and reduction of proteinuria over 13 weeks. We expect to have results from this study in 2021. We also have a second molecule for APOL1-mediated kidney disease that is now completing Phase I. 
In our pain program, we have a molecule that continues to progress through Phase I, and we have at least 1 additional NaV1.8 inhibitor that we expect to enter the clinic this year. 
Lastly, we submitted the IND for VX-880, our first cell therapy for type 1 diabetes towards the end of last year, and we are very pleased that the FDA recently cleared the IND. This allogeneic cell transplant program has the potential to transform the treatment of type 1 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, insulin producing islet cells are destroyed. Our approach is to replace these cells with fully differentiated stem cell-derived pancreatic islet cells. This approach follows the well-established precedent of cadaveric islet cell transplants, which have proven clinical benefit. Advancement of VX-880 is a significant achievement. It is Vertex's first cell-based therapy to enter the clinic, and it is the only fully differentiated pancreatic islet cell program in development. We expect to initiate the Phase I/II clinical trial, which is a single-arm study of people with severe, difficult to control type 1 diabetes in the coming months. 
The goal of this study is to assess safety and measures of glycemic control. We are focused on quickly getting the clinical trial up and running, and we look forward to updating you as we make more progress over the course of this year. 
With that overview, I'll now hand it off to Stuart."
36235,702044327,2187366,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2021",2021-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Reshma. I am pleased to review with you our continued strong commercial performance. Our Q4 global revenues were $1.6 billion, with full year revenues of $6.2 billion. This reflects significant growth over 2019 as we launched TRIKAFTA and Kaftr",657,"Thank you, Reshma. I am pleased to review with you our continued strong commercial performance. Our Q4 global revenues were $1.6 billion, with full year revenues of $6.2 billion. This reflects significant growth over 2019 as we launched TRIKAFTA and Kaftrio in the U.S. and EU, respectively. As expected, in addition to considerable continued U.S. demand for our medicines, we saw a significant increase in revenues from outside the U.S. in the fourth quarter, following the approval and launch of Kaftrio. 
Starting in the U.S. It is now well over a year since the launch of TRIKAFTA, and we have made tremendous progress in bringing TRIKAFTA to nearly all eligible patients, 12 and older, as reflected in our Q4 revenues. In 2021, our commercial focus now turns to maintaining the very high rates of persistence and compliance that we have seen to date, and we anticipate that these rates will normalize over the coming months. We expect the majority of near-term growth of TRIKAFTA in the U.S. to come from approvals in rare mutations and younger age groups. TRIKAFTA was recently approved for patients 12 and older with rare mutations. And the FDA recently accepted the sNDA for 6 to 11 year olds and granted it priority review. We expect an approval around midyear. 
In Europe, enthusiasm and interest in Kaftrio amongst the CF community is high. Our fourth quarter revenues reflect substantial uptake of Kaftrio across all countries where patients have access. Most notably in the larger markets of Germany and England, where the majority of eligible patients have already been initiated. We are seeing similar uptake in other countries where we have secured reimbursement agreements, including Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Denmark. We remain focused on continuing the launch in these countries as well as completing new reimbursement agreements to provide all eligible patients across the EU with access to our medicines. We have high confidence that as was the case in the U.S., ultimately the vast majority of CF patients in the EU will be treated with Kaftrio. 
However, while the destination is the same, the journey to get there will be different. In addition to the time and work required to secure new reimbursement agreements, the COVID-19 pandemic also presents significant uncertainties around the rate of uptake for our medicines. We are conducting fully virtual launches in the EU amidst evolving country level COVID lockdowns. The ability of patients to attend in person consultations with their physicians as the pandemic continues is a dynamic we are monitoring closely. 
I will now outline what's next for Vertex's CF franchise and how to think about future growth. We recently shared with you an updated and expanded view of the CF market opportunity based on an accumulation of new data from registries and other sources around the world. We now estimate that there are 83,000 patients living with CF in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia. Today, we are treating around half of these patients. Notably, this leaves more than 30,000 additional patients in these regions who could benefit from our medicines and who are not treated today. Approximately 2/3 are 12 and older, and we expect to reach these patients through the continued launch, uptake and reimbursement of Kaftrio in the EU and through approvals and reimbursement agreements in other countries, such as Australia and Canada. The remaining 1/3 of patients are in the lower age groups or have other mutations, and we are making progress towards reaching these patients through label expansions. 
Finally, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the CF teams at Vertex, both in the U.S. and internationally, for their unwavering dedication despite the unprecedented global challenges of the past year. And I would also like to thank the CF community for their partnership as we work together to bring transformative medicines to patients around the world. 
Charlie will now review our fourth quarter and full year results and financial guidance."

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we continued our exceptionally strong financial performance. And of note, Q4 was our first quarter with more than $1 billion of sales for the triple combination, a significant accomplishment for the commercia",661,"Thanks, Stuart. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we continued our exceptionally strong financial performance. And of note, Q4 was our first quarter with more than $1 billion of sales for the triple combination, a significant accomplishment for the commercial team. 
Fourth quarter total product revenues were $1.6 billion, a 29% increase compared to 2019, bringing our full year revenues to $6.2 billion, an increase of more than 50% compared to 2019 revenues of $4 billion. Our fourth quarter revenues included $1.21 billion in the U.S. and $421 million in revenues outside the U.S. Our ex-U.S. revenues for the quarter grew 70% over the prior year, driven by the uptake of Kaftrio and our other medicines following the completion of several reimbursement agreements over the last year. 
Our fourth quarter 2020 combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $539 million compared to $496 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. And our full year expenses were $1.98 billion compared to $1.69 billion in 2019. Our full year expenses reflected increased cost to support the rapid global expansion of our CF business as well as targeted investment in expanding our pipeline into new disease areas and progressing our high priority clinical programs. 
Our remarkable growth in revenues, combined with disciplined spending, resulted in a 2020 operating margin of 56% and operating income of $3.49 billion, an increase of 95% compared to 2019. Net income was $2.72 billion compared to $1.39 billion for 2019. With continued substantial revenue growth and profitability, we finished the year with $6.7 billion in cash. Consistent with our corporate strategy, our top priority for capital deployment is reinvestment in innovation, both internally in our R&D programs and externally through business development aligned with our R&D strategy. 
For example, in 2020, we executed important collaboration agreements with Affinia, Skyhawk Therapeutics and Moderna. Additionally, we also used over $500 million of cash to acquire Vertex shares through our ongoing share repurchase program. The primary purpose of this program is to offset dilution and approved very effective with nearly 2.5 million shares repurchased. 
Now to guidance. Our 2020 performance reflected considerable TRIKAFTA uptake as we achieved nearly full penetration of eligible patients in the U.S. as well as strong uptake of Kaftrio in key EU countries where patients have access. For 2021, we project that we will achieve total product revenues of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion, reflecting 10% growth at the midpoint. This guidance reflects our expectations for currently approved products in regions where we are reimbursed, plus an expectation of TRIKAFTA approval for the 6- to 11-year old population in the U.S. in mid-2021. 
In our 2021 revenue guidance, there are fewer significant variables compared to 2020. However, an important continuing factor is rates of patient persistence and compliance. We saw high rates of persistence and compliance with TRIKAFTA maintained in the U.S. throughout 2020, and we expect these levels to normalize throughout 2021. This dynamic is factored into our guidance as is uncertainty related to the ongoing pandemic. 
As Stuart mentioned, moving forward, we expect to see further contribution to international revenues with subsequent waves of reimbursement agreements and launches in the EU as well as other ex-U.S. geographies. However, the timing of these agreements is not predictable and they are, therefore, not included in our 2021 guidance. 
For non-GAAP OpEx, we are guiding to a range of $2.25 billion to $2.3 billion. We expect to continue allocating greater than 70% of OpEx to R&D with year-over-year growth, largely driven by investment in our pipeline programs in order to advance key programs further into the clinic and generate important proof-of-concept data in 2021. Our non-GAAP tax rate for 2020 was 21%, and we are guiding to a range of 21% to 22% this year. 
In closing, 2020 was a tremendously successful year for Vertex and our business, and we look forward to continuing our growth and significant profitability in 2021. 
Now back to Reshma for a few closing remarks."

With rega",244,"Corey, this is Reshma. Let me take both of those questions for you. The AATD program is indeed followed very carefully, as we do all of our programs, honestly, from a safety perspective, and that is just part of what we do. So that is ongoing. 
With regard to levels and maybe broadly speaking, what are we really looking for from this VX-864 Phase II proof-of-concept study, really 3 things. The first is safety. This is the first time that VX-864 is going to patients with AATD. The second is PK and exposure. And the third is increases in functional AAT levels. I'm also going to be looking to see if there's a dose effect relationship. The key here, remember, is that this is our first time to close the loop on cracking the biology. That's to say, if we see levels of functional AAT increase in this study, we see a dose effect. What that tells us is that the mechanism that we projected to be the mechanism that could target both lung and liver raise AAT levels, we got it. 
And as I always say, we divide drug development at Vertex into 2 parts: cracking the biology, pouring on the chemistry. Pouring on the chemistry is the easier. It is not easy, but it's the easier of the 2 parts. And so that's what we're really looking for is assessment of safety, PK and we're looking for elevations of functional AAT levels."

Salveen, this is Reshma.

Salveen, this is Reshma. Why don't I start us off with the second part of your question, and then I'm going to ask Stuart to just comment a little bit more on the launch dynamics in the EU and a little bit more about the U.S. I think that will cover your question on CF. So Salveen, with regard to BD, what we're really talking about here is an interest that is exactly the same as the strategy we've laid out for many years, probably the last 8 years now. We are interested in assets that complement our internal efforts in CF. We're interested in assets that fit our R&D strategy, and you know our R&D strategy is very, very diligent. We are very serious about the causal human biology and biomarkers and transformative potential, specialty markets. It has to fit all of that. And we're looking for tools that fit our toolkit. 
We've transacted in these areas. A lot of the recent transactions like Affinia and Skyhawk and Ribometrix fit those tools, and you should expect to see us continue doing that. We've also transacted on -- I think Semma is a great example. It's a good one to talk about today given the clearance of the IND. Acquisitions like Semma that fit our R&D strategy like a glove and those that have transformative potential. And if you're thinking about, okay, what kind of falls in and what falls out, you can think back to a slide we showed at JPMorgan with our funnel, if you will, that goes through our criteria, certain diseases fall in. Clearly, things like CF and AATD and APOL1-mediated kidney disease, but other examples of diseases that fall in would be Huntington's Disease, would be polycystic kidney disease. And then there are diseases that fall out because they don't fit our criteria, criteria like specialty markets or understanding of causal human biology or having biomarkers that translate well. 
Stuart, I'm going to turn it over to you to tell us a little bit about the CF market."

So Salveen, just I'm going to break down what's incorporated into our guidance into U.S. and ex-U.S. and talk about what the drivers of growth are. So in the U.S., as you know, the vast majority of eligible patients across all patient groups have been initiated on TRIKAFTA in the U.S. during the course of 2020. And so incorporated our guidance is the kind of the annualized effect of those patients having been initiated, offset to some degree by persistence and compliance, which we expect to normalize during the course of 2021. In terms of growth drivers for the U.S., probably the most notable is the expected approval of TRIKAFTA for 6- to 11-year olds, which we expect to happen in the midyear. 
Moving to ex-U.S. We have obviously launched the Kaftrio triple combination in those markets where we do have reimbursement agreements like the U.K. and Ireland and Denmark or markets where you can get early access like Germany. And the majority of patients actually have already been initiated in those markets, the launch has gone very strongly. We do anticipate, obviously, initiating more patients in those countries. But we have only included in our guidance, countries where we already have pricing and reimbursement agreements. 
So to the last part of your question, which is then where else would we be seeking pricing and reimbursement. The major countries in the EU, where we were continuing to see reimbursement are like France, Spain and Italy. Obviously, as Charlie said in his prepared remarks, it's impossible for us to predict exactly the timing of when we will reach those agreements. And for that reason, we don't include them in our guidance. 
Outside of the EU, obviously, the major countries are Australia and Canada. In both of those, we have filed for regulatory approval and are also in parallel seeking reimbursement approval as well. Again, those are not included within our guidance. And then if I can just kind of turn to the longer-term because obviously, 2021 is sort of 1 year in a long journey that we've been on. We continue to believe that we will be able to treat up to 90% of patients with CFTR modulators like the triple combination over time. That has for a long time been our goal and continues to be our goal, and we still feel very confident, if not more confident than ever that we're going to get there over time."

Can you maybe just comment about where Vertex's balance sheet or where you strategically feel comfortable along the range of sizes of what that can be, whether that's $5 billion, $10 billion, $15 billion? Maybe just think about that, which is the other side of doing a deal. And then the second question, you made a nice comment about CF and how you're advancing the cycle there. I know there was a super corrector that had really high levels of chloride transport and there's also a once-daily potentiator. Can you just remind us where those are? And if those are still moving forward and to [indiscernible]?"

Let me take the second question first, and then I'll come back around and talk a little bit more about BD. So the once-a-day potentiator is VX-561. And you're right, we have been busy at work.

So the once-a-day potentiator is VX-561. And you're right, we have been busy at work. David Altshuler, the team in San Diego have been busy at work with the development of more correctors. We have the combination of VX-121, let's call it, a next-gen corrector; VX-561, that's the once-a-day potentiator; and teza, that's made its way through Phase II development. And you'll remember the agency asked us to also do a monotherapy study with VX-561. All of that's been completed. And what we're really doing now is looking at all of the data, planning forward to our regulatory interactions. And as soon as we get through all of those, we'll certainly give you an update on that program. 
Just remember, at a high level, drug development in CF going forward is going to be completely different than anything that's come before it because there is no placebo anymore. And so, don't be surprised if you don't hear from me on this program until we are through all of the conversations and we're ready to give you concrete next steps. But I'm very pleased with how that's progressed. 
Okay. Let's tackle BD. Let me take a couple of minutes and just really walk you through this in a little bit of detail. When I think about where we are in terms of the business today and where we're going, and then try to give you a little bit more color and texture behind capital allocation and BD. Here's a way to put it all together. The -- if you look at the company 3 years ago, so back to January 2018. We were active in the clinic with programs in patients. So I'm not counting healthy volunteers, just patient-based studies in CF and pain. That's it. That's where we were. Fast forward 3 years, and we are now -- if I count the type 1 diabetes program, which is going to be going into patients very quickly, we're looking at molecules in 6 disease areas right now in patients, right? And if I count the pain molecule in healthy volunteers, that's 7. So it's very different. 
If I think about revenues, 2018, January, I think we have closed out the previous year, it's something a little bit north of $2 billion. And if I think about cash, again, a little bit north of $2 billion. Where we are today, we closed out 2020 with revenues of more than $6 billion in cash, close to $7 billion. We are indeed in a different place. And it's really that different place that allows us to think about mid- and late-stage assets. And that's a way of indicating the balance sheet and the strength of the balance sheet. 
I want to be very clear that the strategy is exactly the same what I outlined previously. And if I just focus in on the assets that fit our R&D strategy, we are now able to look at, for example, Phase II assets, assets that might be in Phase III. And those are assets that we're going to look at. We're also going to continue to look at tools for our toolkit. I'm not looking at -- I have no preconceived notions about the timing of a transaction and I have no preconceived notions about the dollar amount of a transaction. It has to fit our R&D strategy. It has to be transformative. We have to be able to add value. And when we find that asset and we have the patience and the judgment to be very thoughtful about that, we're going to be ready to evaluate."

So as you noted, just to ground everybody, we recently updated our view on the epidemiology of CF in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia from 75,000 patients living with CF in those countries or regions to 83,000. And the reason that drove that change was really improvements in data quality and capture in the various registries and, indeed, some establishment of new registries in these regions. We periodically review all that data. And on our latest review, it was obvious to us that over the last few years, the epidemiology had increased. 
Just to answer a question you didn't ask, but one that we have been asked consistently is, was that increase concentrated in any 1 country, any 1 region? It really wasn't. It was really an across the board phenomenon. And something that's not uncommon as well in rare and orphan diseases is when you have really great transformative medicines, often you see increases in the number of eligible patients, and we believe that was also a factor here. 
In terms of whether that new epidemiology is included in our long-term -- our 2021 guidance. Absolutely, it is. That's the denominator that we are using now. And indeed, a number of those patients are already being treated with our CFTR modulators in the U.S., Canada, Australia and the EU."

And the best example I can give you of that is type 1 diabetes and our Semma acquisition. So when you think about type 1 diabetes, it's well over 2 million people, right? So far away from being a rare disease that suffer from type 1 diabetes. And the key there is that the Semma acquisition and the cell-based therapy holds the potential to be transformative. So you're very correct, that is a key that we are looking for. And the type 1 diabetics are treated by endocrinologists, a specialty group. So really, the key for us is not rare disease, but specialty markets. And type 1 diabetes is the best example."

With regard to your question about tools for our toolkit and what do we have. We are really about transforming diseases.

The first one, the one for which the IND just cleared, let's call that one the naked cell program. I would expect that there are maybe 60,000 people who could benefit from that naked cell program. That program does require immunosuppression. And the way I get to 60,000 is maybe there are 10,000, 15,000 people who have type 1 diabetes, have end-stage renal disease because of their type 1 diabetes. And for that reason, have had a renal transplant and are on immunosuppressive anyway. And then maybe another 40,000 or so people with very brittle diabetes, who would be comfortable with immunosuppression for the benefits that the cell therapy would bring them. 
Now of course, the high fruit here is the cell plus device program. For that second program, we are in late preclinical development. The really important thing to know there is that the Semma team prior to acquisition, and one of the reasons we were so excited about the Semma team coming into Vertex, is that they designed using the right material, the right geometry and a clear understanding of how to avoid the pitfalls of fibrosis, allowing oxygen to flow, allowing insulin and glucose to flow but not allowing the immune cells to attack the cell-based therapy.

Okay. So the question that you asked is an excellent one, and it is how should we think about our cell-based therapy vis-à-vis what's been done with pancreas transplant or islet cell transplant. All right. So maybe 3 or 4 key things to know. The most important, by far, in a way, the most important thing to know is this. We know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. It's autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic islet cells. And we know that when you can replace those cells, be it by whole pancrease transplant or islet cell transplants, you get benefit. So we know those 2 things. What's the problem? Well, the problem is the quantity and quality of islet cell. That is actually the essence of the problem, not that we don't know that this will work. We know it will work. 
And the real, real seminal discovery here that the Semma team made, and that was so exciting to us is they developed away to take stem cells differentiated, fully differentiated into insulin producing islet cells and make that in industrialized quantities. And so now what we have is the quantity and quality of cells to give, to transfuse, to transplant into patients with type 1 diabetes. So that's really what the real discovery here has been and why this program is so exciting to us.
Charlie, from that excitement to an inventory question, that I'm going to ask you to address."

It was also a remarkable year for Vertex. Despite the challenges we all faced against the backdrop of the pandemic, Vertex delivered extraordinary commercial performance generating $6.2 billion in product revenues, representing more than 50% growth compared to 2019. We also meaningfully advanced the pipeline and significantly strengthened our financial position.
Vertex has discovered and developed medicines that have transformed the treatment of cystic fibrosis. And the latest of these, TRIKAFTA, or KAFTRIO, as it's known in the EU, has the potential to treat up to 90% of patients with cystic fibrosis. In 2020, the first full year after TRIKAFTA approval in the U.S., the number of patients with CF treated with our medicines increased substantially. And by the end of the year, the vast majority of eligible patients, 12 years and older, in the U.S. were on TRIKAFTA.
In Q3, we received early approval for KAFTRIO in the EU and also secured reimbursement in England. By the end of the year, with direct access at marketing authorization in Germany, portfolio agreements in Ireland and Denmark and the reimbursement deal in the U.K., thousands of patients across the EU gained access to KAFTRIO. In terms of next steps in CF, we have line of sight to continued significant growth as we expand access to the triple combination to more patients in the EU, to cure approvals in new geographies as well as extend treatment to patients with rare mutations and younger populations, starting with the 6 to 11 year olds in the U.S. We're also advancing additional small molecule combination regimen and other approaches that will further define our long-term leadership in CF. Our goal remains to bring transformative therapies to all people with this disease.
2020 was also an important year for our pipeline. We delivered proof-of-concept in 2 disease areas and advanced several clinical programs, spanning multiple modalities, and we are now poised to move the VX-880 program into the clinic for type 1 diabetes, our seventh disease area in clinical development and our first cell-based therapy.
Turning to our financial position, which continues to strengthen. As we treat more patients, our revenues and profitability are growing, and we finished the year with $6.7 billion in cash. We are steadfast in our belief that the best way to drive continued growth and create long-term value is to reinvest this capital in innovation, both internal and external. With respect to external innovation, our strategy remains the same, invest in assets that complement our internal CF pipeline, seek assets that fit our R&D strategy and identify tools to add to our toolkit. What has changed is our position in CF and our growing financial firepower. Given where we are with TRIKAFTA and KAFTRIO plus line of sight to novel regimens and treatment for the last 10% and given our balance sheet, we are now in a position to focus on assets that fit our R&D strategy and consider assets in mid and late stage.
Moving on to an update on the pipeline. I'll focus on our R&D portfolio outside of CF and provide additional detail, including upcoming milestones on a number of programs. In total, we are active in clinical development in 7 disease areas, spanning multiple modalities, including small molecule, gene editing and cell therapy with each program holding the potential to transform the course of the targeted disease.
I'll start with CTX001, our most clinically derisked program outside of CF, which we are developing with our partner, CRISPR Therapeutics. In December, groundbreaking clinical data in sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented in a plenary session at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting. These data demonstrated proof-of-concept and showed that CTX001 has the potential to be a onetime functional cure for people living with these diseases. We're also pleased to share that the first patient treated in the thalassemia study recently completed 2 years of follow-up and has enrolled in the long-term follow-up study. We are advancing through clinical development with urgency, and our goal is to be able to bring this therapy to patients as soon as possible.
Over the course of 2021, there are 3 key milestones that will mark our progress with CTX001: first, the presentation of additional clinical data for more patients and for a longer duration of follow-up that will further define the efficacy and durability of this therapy; the completion of enrollment of our 2 ongoing studies of CTX001; and third, the progression of our discussions with regulators about the data needed for a filing package for approval of CTX001.
In our alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, or AATD program, we're focused on the development of small molecule correctors to address the Z-AAT protein folding defect, the underlying cause of this disease, and thereby, treat both lung and liver manifestations of the disease. Our most advanced molecules VX-864, which is progressing through a dose-ranging Phase II proof-of-concept study. The goal of the study is to assess safety, PK and levels of functional AAT protein. The study continues to enroll in dose patients, and we expect to have the results in the first half of this year. Consistent with our portfolio approach, that is to say our strategy of advancing multiple molecules simultaneously through early clinical development for each target across our disease areas, we are also on track to advance an additional small molecule AAT corrector into the clinic in 2021.
Our lead molecule in the APOL1-mediated FSGS program, VX-147, is also currently being studied in a Phase II proof-of-concept study, evaluating the safety, PK and reduction of proteinuria over 13 weeks. We expect to have results from this study in 2021. We also have a second molecule for APOL1-mediated kidney disease that is now completing Phase I.
In our pain program, we have a molecule that continues to progress through Phase I, and we have at least one additional NaV1.8 inhibitor that we expect to enter the clinic this year.
Lastly, we submitted the IND for VX-880, our first cell therapy for type 1 diabetes, towards the end of last year, and we are very pleased that the FDA recently cleared the IND. This allogeneic cell transplant program has the potential to transform the treatment of type 1 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, insulin-producing islet cells are destroyed. Our approach is to replace these cells with fully differentiated stem cell-derived pancreatic islet cells. This approach follows the well-established precedent of cadaveric islet cell transplants, which have proven clinical benefit. Advancement of VX-880 is a significant achievement. It is Vertex's first cell-based therapy to enter the clinic, and it is the only fully differentiated pancreatic islet cell program in development. We expect to initiate the Phase I/II clinical trial, which is a single-arm study of people with severe, difficult-to-control type 1 diabetes in the coming months. The goal of this study is to assess safety and measures of glycemic control. We are focused on quickly getting the clinical trial up and running, and we look forward to updating you as we make more progress over the course of this year.
With that overview, I'll now hand it off to Stuart."

I am pleased to review, with you, our continued strong commercial performance. Our Q4 global revenues were $1.6 billion, with full year revenues of $6.2 billion.

Our Q4 global revenues were $1.6 billion, with full year revenues of $6.2 billion. This reflects significant growth over 2019 as we launched TRIKAFTA and KAFTRIO in the U.S. and EU, respectively. As expected, in addition to considerable continued U.S. demand for our medicines, we saw a significant increase in revenues from outside the U.S. in the fourth quarter, following the approval and launch of KAFTRIO.
Starting in the U.S. It is now well over a year since the launch of TRIKAFTA, and we have made tremendous progress in bringing TRIKAFTA to nearly all eligible patients, 12 and older, as reflected in our Q4 revenues. In 2021, our commercial focus now turns to maintaining the very high rates of persistence and compliance that we have seen to date, and we anticipate that these rates will normalize over the coming months. We expect the majority of near-term growth of TRIKAFTA in the U.S. to come from approvals in rare mutations and younger age groups. TRIKAFTA was recently approved for patients 12 and older with rare mutations, and the FDA recently accepted the sNDA for 6 to 11 year olds and granted it priority review. We expect an approval around midyear.
In Europe, enthusiasm and interest in KAFTRIO amongst the CF community is high. Our fourth quarter revenues reflect substantial uptake of KAFTRIO across all countries where patients have access. Most notably in the larger markets of Germany and England, where the majority of eligible patients have already been initiated. We are seeing similar uptake in other countries where we have secured reimbursement agreements, including Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Denmark. We remain focused on continuing the launch in these countries as well as completing new reimbursement agreements to provide all eligible patients across the EU with access to our medicines. We have high confidence that, as was the case in the U.S., ultimately the vast majority of CF patients in the EU will be treated with KAFTRIO. 
However, while the destination is the same, the journey to get there will be different. In addition to the time and work required to secure new reimbursement agreements, the COVID-19 pandemic also presents significant uncertainties around the rate of uptake for our medicines. We are conducting fully virtual launches in the EU amidst evolving country level COVID lockdowns. The ability of patients to attend in-person consultations with their physicians as the pandemic continues is a dynamic we are monitoring closely.
I will now outline what's next for Vertex's CF franchise and how to think about future growth. We recently shared with you an updated and expanded view of the CF market opportunity based on an accumulation of new data from registries and other sources around the world. We now estimate that there are 83,000 patients living with CF in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia. Today, we are treating around half of these patients. Notably, this leaves more than 30,000 additional patients in these regions who could benefit from our medicines and who are not treated today. Approximately 2/3 are 12 and older, and we expect to reach these patients through the continued launch, uptake and reimbursement of KAFTRIO in the EU and through approvals and reimbursement agreements in other countries, such as Australia and Canada. The remaining 1/3 of patients are in lower age groups or have other mutations, and we are making progress towards reaching these patients through label expansions.
Finally, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the CF teams at Vertex, both in the U.S. and internationally, for their unwavering dedication despite the unprecedented global challenges of the past year. And I would also like to thank the CF community for their partnership as we work together to bring transformative medicines to patients around the world.
Charlie will now review our fourth quarter and full year results and financial guidance."

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we continued our exceptionally strong financial performance. And of note, Q4 was our first quarter with more than $1 billion of sales for the triple combination, a significant accomplishment for the commercial team.
Fourth quarter total product revenues were $1.6 billion, a 29% increase compared to 2019, bringing our full year revenues to $6.2 billion, an increase of more than 50% compared to 2019 revenues of $4 billion. Our fourth quarter revenues included $1.21 billion in the U.S. and $421 million in revenues outside the U.S. Our ex-U.S. revenues for the quarter grew 70% over the prior year, driven by the uptake of KAFTRIO and our other medicines following the completion of several reimbursement agreements over the last year.
Our fourth quarter 2020 combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $539 million compared to $496 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. And our full year expenses were $1.98 billion compared to $1.69 billion in 2019. Our full year expenses reflected increased cost to support the rapid global expansion of our CF business as well as targeted investment in expanding our pipeline into new disease areas and progressing our high priority clinical programs. 
Our remarkable growth in revenues, combined with disciplined spending, resulted in a 2020 operating margin of 56% and operating income of $3.49 billion, an increase of 95% compared to 2019. Net income was $2.72 billion compared to $1.39 billion for 2019. With continued substantial revenue growth and profitability, we finished the year with $6.7 billion in cash. Consistent with our corporate strategy, our top priority for capital deployment is reinvestment in innovation, both internally in our R&D programs and externally through business development aligned with our R&D strategy. For example, in 2020, we executed important collaboration agreements with Affinia, Skyhawk Therapeutics and Moderna. Additionally, we also used over $500 million of cash to acquire Vertex shares through our ongoing share repurchase program. The primary purpose of this program is to offset dilution and has proved very effective with nearly 2.5 million shares repurchased.
Now to guidance. Our 2020 performance reflected considerable TRIKAFTA uptake as we achieved nearly full penetration of eligible patients in the U.S. as well as strong uptake of KAFTRIO in key EU countries where patients have access. For 2021, we project that we will achieve total product revenues of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion, reflecting 10% growth at the midpoint. This guidance reflects our expectations for currently approved products in regions where we are reimbursed plus an expectation of TRIKAFTA approval for the 6- to 11-year old population in the U.S. in mid-2021.
In our 2021 revenue guidance, there are fewer significant variables compared to 2020. However, an important continuing factor is rates of patient persistence and compliance. We saw high rates of persistence and compliance with TRIKAFTA maintained in the U.S. throughout 2020, and we expect these levels to normalize throughout 2021. This dynamic is factored into our guidance as is uncertainty related to the ongoing pandemic.
As Stuart mentioned, moving forward, we expect to see further contribution to international revenues with subsequent waves of reimbursement agreements and launches in the EU as well as other ex-U.S. geographies. However, the timing of these agreements is not predictable and they are, therefore, not included in our 2021 guidance.
For non-GAAP OpEx, we are guiding to a range of $2.25 billion to $2.3 billion. We expect to continue allocating greater than 70% of OpEx to R&D with year-over-year growth largely driven by investment in our pipeline programs in order to advance key programs further into the clinic and generate important proof-of-concept data in 2021. Our non-GAAP tax rate for 2020 was 21%, and we are guiding to a range of 21% to 22% this year.
In closing, 2020 was a tremendously successful year for Vertex and our business, and we look forward to continuing our growth and significant profitability in 2021.
Now back to Reshma for a few closing remarks."

The AATD program is indeed followed very carefully, as we do all of our programs, honestly, from a safety perspective, and that is just part of what we do. So that is ongoing. With regard to levels and maybe broadly speaking, what are we really looking for from this VX-864 Phase II proof-of-concept study, really 3 things. The first is safety. This is the first time that VX-864 is going to patients with AATD. The second is PK and exposure. And the third is increases in functional AAT levels. I'm also going to be looking to see if there's a dose effect relationship. The key here, remember, is that this is our first time to close the loop on cracking the biology. That's to say, if we see levels of functional AAT increase in this study, we see a dose effect, what that tells us is that the mechanism that we projected to be the mechanism that could target both lung and liver raise AAT levels, we got it.
And as I always say, we divide drug development at Vertex into 2 parts: cracking the biology, pouring on the chemistry. Pouring on the chemistry is the easier. It is not easy, but it's the easier of the 2 parts. And so that's what we're really looking for is assessment of safety, PK, and we're looking for elevations of functional AAT levels."

Why don't I start us off with the second part of your question, and then I'm going to ask Stuart to just comment a little bit more on the launch dynamics in the EU and a little bit more about the U.S. I think that will cover your question on CF. So Salveen, with regard to BD, what we're really talking about here is an interest that is exactly the same as the strategy we've laid out for many years, probably the last 8 years now. We are interested in assets that complement our internal efforts in CF. We're interested in assets that fit our R&D strategy. And you know our R&D strategy is very, very diligent. We are very serious about the causal human biology and biomarkers and transformative potential, specialty markets. It has to fit all of that, and we're looking for tools that fit our toolkit.  
We've transacted in these areas. A lot of the recent transactions, like Affinia and Skyhawk and Ribometrix, fit those tools, and you should expect to see us continue doing that. We've also transacted on -- I think Semma is a great example. It's a good one to talk about today given the clearance of the IND. Acquisitions like Semma that fit our R&D strategy like a glove and those that have transformative potential. And if you're thinking about, okay, what kind of falls in and what falls out, you can think back to a slide we showed at JPMorgan with our funnel, if you will, that goes through our criteria, certain diseases fall in. Clearly, things like CF and AATD and APOL1-mediated kidney disease, but other examples of diseases that fall in would be Huntington's disease, would be polycystic kidney disease. And then there are diseases that fall out because they don't fit our criteria, criteria like specialty markets or understanding of causal human biology or having biomarkers that translate well.
Stuart, I'm going to turn it over to you to tell us a little bit about the CF market."

So Salveen, just I'm going to break down what's incorporated into our guidance into U.S. and ex-U.S. and talk about what the drivers of growth are. So in the U.S., as you know, the vast majority of eligible patients across all patient groups have been initiated on TRIKAFTA in the U.S. during the course of 2020. And so incorporated in our guidance is the kind of the annualized effect of those patients having been initiated, offset to some degree by persistence and compliance, which we expect to normalize during the course of 2021. In terms of growth drivers for the U.S., probably the most notable is the expected approval of TRIKAFTA for 6 to 11 year olds, which we expect to happen in the midyear.
Moving to ex-U.S. We have obviously launched the KAFTRIO triple combination in those markets where we do have reimbursement agreements, like the U.K. and Ireland and Denmark or markets where you can get early access like Germany. And the majority of patients actually have already been initiated in those markets, the launch has gone very strongly. We do anticipate, obviously, initiating more patients in those countries. But we have only included in our guidance countries where we already have pricing and reimbursement agreements.
So to the last part of your question, which is then where else would we be seeking pricing and reimbursement. The major countries in the EU, where we were continuing to seek reimbursement are like France, Spain and Italy. Obviously, as Charlie said in his prepared remarks, it's impossible for us to predict exactly the timing of when we will reach those agreements. And for that reason, we don't include them in our guidance. Outside of the EU, obviously, the major countries are Australia and Canada. In both of those, we have filed for regulatory approval and are also in parallel seeking reimbursement approval as well. Again, those are not included within our guidance. 
And then if I can just kind of turn to the longer term because obviously, 2021 is sort of 1 year in a long journey that we've been on. We continue to believe that we will be able to treat up to 90% of patients with CFTR modulators like the triple combination over time. That has for a long time been our goal and continues to be our goal, and we still feel very confident, if not more confident than ever, that we're going to get there over time."

So the once-a-day potentiator is VX-561. And you're right, we have been busy at work. David Altshuler, the team in San Diego have been busy at work with the development of more correctors. We have the combination of VX-121, let's call it, a next-gen corrector; VX-561, that's the once-a-day potentiator; and teza, that's made its way through Phase II development. And you'll remember the agency asked us to also do a monotherapy study with VX-561. All of that's been completed. And what we're really doing now is looking at all of the data, planning forward to our regulatory interactions. And as soon as we get through all of those, we'll certainly give you an update on that program.
Just remember, at a high level, drug development in CF going forward is going to be completely different than anything that's come before it because there is no placebo anymore. And so, don't be surprised if you don't hear from me on this program until we are through all of the conversations and we're ready to give you concrete next steps. But I'm very pleased with how that's progressed.  
Okay. Let's tackle BD. Let me take a couple of minutes and just really walk you through this in a little bit of detail. When I think about where we are in terms of the business today and where we're going, and then try to give you a little bit more color and texture behind capital allocation and BD, here's a way to put it all together. The -- if you look at the company 3 years ago, so back to January 2018, we were active in the clinic with programs and patients. So I'm not counting healthy volunteers, just patient-based studies in CF and pain. That's it. That's where we were. Fast forward 3 years, and we are now -- if I count the type 1 diabetes program, which is going to be going into patients very quickly, we're looking at molecules in 6 disease areas right now in patients, right? And if I count the pain molecule in healthy volunteers, that's 7. So it's very different.  
If I think about revenues, 2018, January, I think we have closed out the previous year at something a little bit north of $2 billion. And if I think about cash, again, a little bit north of $2 billion. Where we are today? We closed out 2020 with revenues of more than $6 billion in cash, close to $7 billion. We are indeed in a different place. And it's really that different place that allows us to think about mid- and late-stage assets. And that's a way of indicating the balance sheet and the strength of the balance sheet. 
I want to be very clear that the strategy is exactly the same what I outlined previously. And if I just focus in on the assets that fit our R&D strategy, we are now able to look at, for example, Phase II assets, assets that might be in Phase III. And those are assets that we're going to look at. We're also going to continue to look at tools for our toolkit. I'm not looking at -- I have no preconceived notions about the timing of a transaction and I have no preconceived notions about the dollar amount of a transaction. It has to fit our R&D strategy. It has to be transformative. We have to be able to add value. And when we find that asset and we have the patience and the judgment to be very thoughtful about that, we're going to be ready to evaluate."

So as you noted, and just to ground everybody, we recently updated our view on the epidemiology of CF in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia from 75,000 patients living with CF in those countries or regions to 83,000. And the reason that drove that change was really improvements in data quality and capture in the various registries and, indeed, some establishment of new registries in these regions. We periodically review all that data. And on our latest review, it was obvious to us that over the last few years, the epidemiology had increased. 
Just to answer a question you didn't ask, but one that we have been asked consistently is, was that increase concentrated in any one country, any one region? And it really wasn't. It was really an across-the-board phenomenon and something that's not uncommon as well in rare and orphan diseases is when you have really great transformative medicines, often you see increases in the number of eligible patients, and we believe that was also a factor here. In terms of whether that new epidemiology is included in our long term -- our 2021 guidance. Absolutely, it is. That's the denominator that we are using now. And indeed, a number of those patients are already being treated with our CFTR modulators in the U.S., Canada, Australia and the EU."

And the best example I can give you of that is type 1 diabetes and our Semma acquisition. So when you think about type 1 diabetes, it's well over 2 million people, right? So far away from being a rare disease that suffer from type 1 diabetes. And the key there is that the Semma acquisition and the cell-based therapy holds the potential to be transformative. So you're very correct, that is a key that we are looking for. And the type 1 diabetics are treated by endocrinologists, a specialty group. So really, the key for us is not rare disease, but specialty markets, and type 1 diabetes is the best example."

As you've heard us talk about before, we've initiated those conversations, but we have not yet completed them. So we're looking forward to doing so this year. But yes, I do expect these patients to be the composition of our filing package.
On the VX-880 program and what are we looking for. So first things first. This is the first time that the -- these fully differentiated, stem cell-derived, insulin-producing islet cells are going into patients. So what we're really looking for is to get to our clinic trial sites with urgency. We're looking to get the cells dosed. We're evaluating safety and the outcome measures are really fairly straightforward, C-peptide, glucose, hemoglobin A1c. And what we're looking for here is, obviously, to see an impact in terms of bringing down blood sugar and being able to see C-peptide level drive, an indication that there is insulin. It's a little too early to call exactly what the results will be and such. But I am very excited that we're on the brink of enrolling patients and getting these trials up and running."

I guess you must be hearing my enthusiasm just brimming over. So the way I would think about the type 1 diabetes program is really 2 programs, and I would think of them as 2 separate programs. The first one, the one for which the IND just cleared, let's call that one the naked cell program. I would expect that there are maybe 60,000 people who could benefit from that naked cell program. That program does require immunosuppression. And the way I get to 60,000 is maybe there are 10,000, 15,000 people who have type 1 diabetes, have end-stage renal disease because of their type 1 diabetes and, for that reason, have had a renal transplant and are on immunosuppressives anyway. And then maybe another 40,000 or so people with very brittle diabetes, who would be comfortable with immunosuppression for the benefits that the cell therapy would bring them. 
Now of course, the high fruit here is the cells plus device program. For that second program, we are in late preclinical development. The really important thing to know there is that the Semma team prior to acquisition, and one of the reasons we were so excited about the Semma team coming into Vertex is that they designed using the right material, the right geometry and a clear understanding of how to avoid the pitfalls of fibrosis, allowing oxygen to flow, allowing insulin and glucose to flow but not allowing the immune cells to attack the cell-based therapy. So that program is particularly exciting because that does not require immunosuppressives. As we make progress on that program, we'll certainly keep you updated but that is making its way through preclinical development -- late preclinical development right now."

Okay. So the question that you asked is an excellent one, and it is how should we think about our cell-based therapy vis-à-vis what's been done with pancreas transplant or islet cell transplant. All right. So maybe 3 or 4 key things to know. The most important, by far, in a way, the most important thing to know is this. We know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. It's autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic islet cells. And we know that when you can replace those cells, be it by whole pancreas transplant or islet cell transplants, you get benefit. So we know those 2 things. 
What's the problem? Well, the problem is the quantity and quality of islet cells. That is actually the essence of the problem, not that we don't know that this will work. We know it will work. And the real, real seminal discovery here that the Semma team made, and that was so exciting to us is they developed a way to take stem cells differentiated, fully differentiated into insulin-producing islet cells and make that in industrialized quantities. And so now what we have is the quantity and quality of cells to give, to transfuse, to transplant into patients with type 1 diabetes. So that's really what the real discovery here has been and why this program is so exciting to us.

It was also a remarkable year for Vertex. Despite the challenges we all faced against the backdrop of the pandemic, Vertex delivered extraordinary commercial performance generating $6.2 billion in product revenues, representing more than 50% growth compared to 2019. We also meaningfully advanced the pipeline and significantly strengthened our financial position.
Vertex has discovered and developed medicines that have transformed the treatment of cystic fibrosis. And the latest of these, TRIKAFTA, or KAFTRIO, as it's known in the EU, has the potential to treat up to 90% of patients with cystic fibrosis. In 2020, the first full year after TRIKAFTA approval in the U.S., the number of patients with CF treated with our medicines increased substantially. And by the end of the year, the vast majority of eligible patients, 12 years and older, in the U.S. were on TRIKAFTA.
In Q3, we received early approval for KAFTRIO in the EU and also secured reimbursement in England. By the end of the year, with direct access at marketing authorization in Germany, portfolio agreements in Ireland and Denmark and the reimbursement deal in the U.K., thousands of patients across the EU gained access to KAFTRIO. In terms of next steps in CF, we have line of sight to continued significant growth as we expand access to the triple combination to more patients in the EU, to cure approvals in new geographies as well as extend treatment to patients with rare mutations and younger populations, starting with the 6 to 11 year olds in the U.S. We're also advancing additional small molecule combination regimen and other approaches that will further define our long-term leadership in CF. Our goal remains to bring transformative therapies to all people with this disease.
2020 was also an important year for our pipeline. We delivered proof-of-concept in 2 disease areas and advanced several clinical programs, spanning multiple modalities, and we are now poised to move the VX-880 program into the clinic for type 1 diabetes, our seventh disease area in clinical development and our first cell-based therapy.
Turning to our financial position, which continues to strengthen. As we treat more patients, our revenues and profitability are growing, and we finished the year with $6.7 billion in cash. We are steadfast in our belief that the best way to drive continued growth and create long-term value is to reinvest this capital in innovation, both internal and external. With respect to external innovation, our strategy remains the same, invest in assets that complement our internal CF pipeline, seek assets that fit our R&D strategy and identify tools to add to our toolkit. What has changed is our position in CF and our growing financial firepower. Given where we are with TRIKAFTA and KAFTRIO plus line of sight to novel regimens and treatment for the last 10% and given our balance sheet, we are now in a position to focus on assets that fit our R&D strategy and consider assets in mid and late stage.
Moving on to an update on the pipeline. I'll focus on our R&D portfolio outside of CF and provide additional detail, including upcoming milestones on a number of programs. In total, we are active in clinical development in 7 disease areas, spanning multiple modalities, including small molecule, gene editing and cell therapy with each program holding the potential to transform the course of the targeted disease.
I'll start with CTX001, our most clinically derisked program outside of CF, which we are developing with our partner, CRISPR Therapeutics. In December, groundbreaking clinical data in sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented in a plenary session at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting. These data demonstrated proof-of-concept and showed that CTX001 has the potential to be a onetime functional cure for people living with these diseases. We're also pleased to share that the first patient treated in the thalassemia study recently completed 2 years of follow-up and has enrolled in the long-term follow-up study. We are advancing through clinical development with urgency, and our goal is to be able to bring this therapy to patients as soon as possible.
Over the course of 2021, there are 3 key milestones that will mark our progress with CTX001: first, the presentation of additional clinical data for more patients and for a longer duration of follow-up that will further define the efficacy and durability of this therapy; the completion of enrollment of our 2 ongoing studies of CTX001; and third, the progression of our discussions with regulators about the data needed for a filing package for approval of CTX001.
In our alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, or AATD program, we're focused on the development of small molecule correctors to address the Z-AAT protein folding defect, the underlying cause of this disease, and thereby, treat both lung and liver manifestations of the disease. Our most advanced molecules VX-864, which is progressing through a dose-ranging Phase II proof-of-concept study. The goal of the study is to assess safety, PK and levels of functional AAT protein. The study continues to enroll in dose patients, and we expect to have the results in the first half of this year. Consistent with our portfolio approach, that is to say our strategy of advancing multiple molecules simultaneously through early clinical development for each target across our disease areas, we are also on track to advance an additional small molecule AAT corrector into the clinic in 2021.
Our lead molecule in the APOL1-mediated FSGS program, VX-147, is also currently being studied in a Phase II proof-of-concept study, evaluating the safety, PK and reduction of proteinuria over 13 weeks. We expect to have results from this study in 2021. We also have a second molecule for APOL1-mediated kidney disease that is now completing Phase I.
In our pain program, we have a molecule that continues to progress through Phase I, and we have at least one additional NaV1.8 inhibitor that we expect to enter the clinic this year.
Lastly, we submitted the IND for VX-880, our first cell therapy for type 1 diabetes, towards the end of last year, and we are very pleased that the FDA recently cleared the IND. This allogeneic cell transplant program has the potential to transform the treatment of type 1 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, insulin-producing islet cells are destroyed. Our approach is to replace these cells with fully differentiated stem cell-derived pancreatic islet cells. This approach follows the well-established precedent of cadaveric islet cell transplants, which have proven clinical benefit. Advancement of VX-880 is a significant achievement. It is Vertex's first cell-based therapy to enter the clinic, and it is the only fully differentiated pancreatic islet cell program in development. We expect to initiate the Phase I/II clinical trial, which is a single-arm study of people with severe, difficult-to-control type 1 diabetes in the coming months. The goal of this study is to assess safety and measures of glycemic control. We are focused on quickly getting the clinical trial up and running, and we look forward to updating you as we make more progress over the course of this year.
With that overview, I'll now hand it off to Stuart."

Our Q4 global revenues were $1.6 billion, with full year revenues of $6.2 billion. This reflects significant growth over 2019 as we launched TRIKAFTA and KAFTRIO in the U.S. and EU, respectively. As expected, in addition to considerable continued U.S. demand for our medicines, we saw a significant increase in revenues from outside the U.S. in the fourth quarter, following the approval and launch of KAFTRIO.
Starting in the U.S. It is now well over a year since the launch of TRIKAFTA, and we have made tremendous progress in bringing TRIKAFTA to nearly all eligible patients, 12 and older, as reflected in our Q4 revenues. In 2021, our commercial focus now turns to maintaining the very high rates of persistence and compliance that we have seen to date, and we anticipate that these rates will normalize over the coming months. We expect the majority of near-term growth of TRIKAFTA in the U.S. to come from approvals in rare mutations and younger age groups. TRIKAFTA was recently approved for patients 12 and older with rare mutations, and the FDA recently accepted the sNDA for 6 to 11 year olds and granted it priority review. We expect an approval around midyear.
In Europe, enthusiasm and interest in KAFTRIO amongst the CF community is high. Our fourth quarter revenues reflect substantial uptake of KAFTRIO across all countries where patients have access. Most notably in the larger markets of Germany and England, where the majority of eligible patients have already been initiated. We are seeing similar uptake in other countries where we have secured reimbursement agreements, including Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Denmark. We remain focused on continuing the launch in these countries as well as completing new reimbursement agreements to provide all eligible patients across the EU with access to our medicines. We have high confidence that, as was the case in the U.S., ultimately the vast majority of CF patients in the EU will be treated with KAFTRIO. 
However, while the destination is the same, the journey to get there will be different. In addition to the time and work required to secure new reimbursement agreements, the COVID-19 pandemic also presents significant uncertainties around the rate of uptake for our medicines. We are conducting fully virtual launches in the EU amidst evolving country level COVID lockdowns. The ability of patients to attend in-person consultations with their physicians as the pandemic continues is a dynamic we are monitoring closely.
I will now outline what's next for Vertex's CF franchise and how to think about future growth. We recently shared with you an updated and expanded view of the CF market opportunity based on an accumulation of new data from registries and other sources around the world. We now estimate that there are 83,000 patients living with CF in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia. Today, we are treating around half of these patients. Notably, this leaves more than 30,000 additional patients in these regions who could benefit from our medicines and who are not treated today. Approximately 2/3 are 12 and older, and we expect to reach these patients through the continued launch, uptake and reimbursement of KAFTRIO in the EU and through approvals and reimbursement agreements in other countries, such as Australia and Canada. The remaining 1/3 of patients are in lower age groups or have other mutations, and we are making progress towards reaching these patients through label expansions.
Finally, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the CF teams at Vertex, both in the U.S. and internationally, for their unwavering dedication despite the unprecedented global challenges of the past year. And I would also like to thank the CF community for their partnership as we work together to bring transformative medicines to patients around the world.
Charlie will now review our fourth quarter and full year results and financial guidance."

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we continued our exceptionally strong financial performance. And of note, Q4 was our first quarter with more than $1 billion of sales for the triple combination, a significant accomplishment for the commercial team.
Fourth quarter total product revenues were $1.6 billion, a 29% increase compared to 2019, bringing our full year revenues to $6.2 billion, an increase of more than 50% compared to 2019 revenues of $4 billion. Our fourth quarter revenues included $1.21 billion in the U.S. and $421 million in revenues outside the U.S. Our ex-U.S. revenues for the quarter grew 70% over the prior year, driven by the uptake of KAFTRIO and our other medicines following the completion of several reimbursement agreements over the last year.
Our fourth quarter 2020 combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $539 million compared to $496 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. And our full year expenses were $1.98 billion compared to $1.69 billion in 2019. Our full year expenses reflected increased cost to support the rapid global expansion of our CF business as well as targeted investment in expanding our pipeline into new disease areas and progressing our high priority clinical programs. 
Our remarkable growth in revenues, combined with disciplined spending, resulted in a 2020 operating margin of 56% and operating income of $3.49 billion, an increase of 95% compared to 2019. Net income was $2.72 billion compared to $1.39 billion for 2019. With continued substantial revenue growth and profitability, we finished the year with $6.7 billion in cash. Consistent with our corporate strategy, our top priority for capital deployment is reinvestment in innovation, both internally in our R&D programs and externally through business development aligned with our R&D strategy. For example, in 2020, we executed important collaboration agreements with Affinia, Skyhawk Therapeutics and Moderna. Additionally, we also used over $500 million of cash to acquire Vertex shares through our ongoing share repurchase program. The primary purpose of this program is to offset dilution and has proved very effective with nearly 2.5 million shares repurchased.
Now to guidance. Our 2020 performance reflected considerable TRIKAFTA uptake as we achieved nearly full penetration of eligible patients in the U.S. as well as strong uptake of KAFTRIO in key EU countries where patients have access. For 2021, we project that we will achieve total product revenues of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion, reflecting 10% growth at the midpoint. This guidance reflects our expectations for currently approved products in regions where we are reimbursed plus an expectation of TRIKAFTA approval for the 6- to 11-year old population in the U.S. in mid-2021.
In our 2021 revenue guidance, there are fewer significant variables compared to 2020. However, an important continuing factor is rates of patient persistence and compliance. We saw high rates of persistence and compliance with TRIKAFTA maintained in the U.S. throughout 2020, and we expect these levels to normalize throughout 2021. This dynamic is factored into our guidance as is uncertainty related to the ongoing pandemic.
As Stuart mentioned, moving forward, we expect to see further contribution to international revenues with subsequent waves of reimbursement agreements and launches in the EU as well as other ex-U.S. geographies. However, the timing of these agreements is not predictable and they are, therefore, not included in our 2021 guidance.
For non-GAAP OpEx, we are guiding to a range of $2.25 billion to $2.3 billion. We expect to continue allocating greater than 70% of OpEx to R&D with year-over-year growth largely driven by investment in our pipeline programs in order to advance key programs further into the clinic and generate important proof-of-concept data in 2021. Our non-GAAP tax rate for 2020 was 21%, and we are guiding to a range of 21% to 22% this year.
In closing, 2020 was a tremendously successful year for Vertex and our business, and we look forward to continuing our growth and significant profitability in 2021.
Now back to Reshma for a few closing remarks."

The AATD program is indeed followed very carefully, as we do all of our programs, honestly, from a safety perspective, and that is just part of what we do. So that is ongoing. With regard to levels and maybe broadly speaking, what are we really looking for from this VX-864 Phase II proof-of-concept study, really 3 things. The first is safety. This is the first time that VX-864 is going to patients with AATD. The second is PK and exposure. And the third is increases in functional AAT levels. I'm also going to be looking to see if there's a dose effect relationship. The key here, remember, is that this is our first time to close the loop on cracking the biology. That's to say, if we see levels of functional AAT increase in this study, we see a dose effect, what that tells us is that the mechanism that we projected to be the mechanism that could target both lung and liver raise AAT levels, we got it.
And as I always say, we divide drug development at Vertex into 2 parts: cracking the biology, pouring on the chemistry. Pouring on the chemistry is the easier. It is not easy, but it's the easier of the 2 parts. And so that's what we're really looking for is assessment of safety, PK, and we're looking for elevations of functional AAT levels."

Why don't I start us off with the second part of your question, and then I'm going to ask Stuart to just comment a little bit more on the launch dynamics in the EU and a little bit more about the U.S. I think that will cover your question on CF. So Salveen, with regard to BD, what we're really talking about here is an interest that is exactly the same as the strategy we've laid out for many years, probably the last 8 years now. We are interested in assets that complement our internal efforts in CF. We're interested in assets that fit our R&D strategy. And you know our R&D strategy is very, very diligent. We are very serious about the causal human biology and biomarkers and transformative potential, specialty markets. It has to fit all of that, and we're looking for tools that fit our toolkit.  
We've transacted in these areas. A lot of the recent transactions, like Affinia and Skyhawk and Ribometrix, fit those tools, and you should expect to see us continue doing that. We've also transacted on -- I think Semma is a great example. It's a good one to talk about today given the clearance of the IND. Acquisitions like Semma that fit our R&D strategy like a glove and those that have transformative potential. And if you're thinking about, okay, what kind of falls in and what falls out, you can think back to a slide we showed at JPMorgan with our funnel, if you will, that goes through our criteria, certain diseases fall in. Clearly, things like CF and AATD and APOL1-mediated kidney disease, but other examples of diseases that fall in would be Huntington's disease, would be polycystic kidney disease. And then there are diseases that fall out because they don't fit our criteria, criteria like specialty markets or understanding of causal human biology or having biomarkers that translate well.
Stuart, I'm going to turn it over to you to tell us a little bit about the CF market."

So Salveen, just I'm going to break down what's incorporated into our guidance into U.S. and ex-U.S. and talk about what the drivers of growth are. So in the U.S., as you know, the vast majority of eligible patients across all patient groups have been initiated on TRIKAFTA in the U.S. during the course of 2020. And so incorporated in our guidance is the kind of the annualized effect of those patients having been initiated, offset to some degree by persistence and compliance, which we expect to normalize during the course of 2021. In terms of growth drivers for the U.S., probably the most notable is the expected approval of TRIKAFTA for 6 to 11 year olds, which we expect to happen in the midyear.
Moving to ex-U.S. We have obviously launched the KAFTRIO triple combination in those markets where we do have reimbursement agreements, like the U.K. and Ireland and Denmark or markets where you can get early access like Germany. And the majority of patients actually have already been initiated in those markets, the launch has gone very strongly. We do anticipate, obviously, initiating more patients in those countries. But we have only included in our guidance countries where we already have pricing and reimbursement agreements.
So to the last part of your question, which is then where else would we be seeking pricing and reimbursement. The major countries in the EU, where we were continuing to seek reimbursement are like France, Spain and Italy. Obviously, as Charlie said in his prepared remarks, it's impossible for us to predict exactly the timing of when we will reach those agreements. And for that reason, we don't include them in our guidance. Outside of the EU, obviously, the major countries are Australia and Canada. In both of those, we have filed for regulatory approval and are also in parallel seeking reimbursement approval as well. Again, those are not included within our guidance. 
And then if I can just kind of turn to the longer term because obviously, 2021 is sort of 1 year in a long journey that we've been on. We continue to believe that we will be able to treat up to 90% of patients with CFTR modulators like the triple combination over time. That has for a long time been our goal and continues to be our goal, and we still feel very confident, if not more confident than ever, that we're going to get there over time."

So the once-a-day potentiator is VX-561. And you're right, we have been busy at work. David Altshuler, the team in San Diego have been busy at work with the development of more correctors. We have the combination of VX-121, let's call it, a next-gen corrector; VX-561, that's the once-a-day potentiator; and teza, that's made its way through Phase II development. And you'll remember the agency asked us to also do a monotherapy study with VX-561. All of that's been completed. And what we're really doing now is looking at all of the data, planning forward to our regulatory interactions. And as soon as we get through all of those, we'll certainly give you an update on that program.
Just remember, at a high level, drug development in CF going forward is going to be completely different than anything that's come before it because there is no placebo anymore. And so, don't be surprised if you don't hear from me on this program until we are through all of the conversations and we're ready to give you concrete next steps. But I'm very pleased with how that's progressed.  
Okay. Let's tackle BD. Let me take a couple of minutes and just really walk you through this in a little bit of detail. When I think about where we are in terms of the business today and where we're going, and then try to give you a little bit more color and texture behind capital allocation and BD, here's a way to put it all together. The -- if you look at the company 3 years ago, so back to January 2018, we were active in the clinic with programs and patients. So I'm not counting healthy volunteers, just patient-based studies in CF and pain. That's it. That's where we were. Fast forward 3 years, and we are now -- if I count the type 1 diabetes program, which is going to be going into patients very quickly, we're looking at molecules in 6 disease areas right now in patients, right? And if I count the pain molecule in healthy volunteers, that's 7. So it's very different.  
If I think about revenues, 2018, January, I think we have closed out the previous year at something a little bit north of $2 billion. And if I think about cash, again, a little bit north of $2 billion. Where we are today? We closed out 2020 with revenues of more than $6 billion in cash, close to $7 billion. We are indeed in a different place. And it's really that different place that allows us to think about mid- and late-stage assets. And that's a way of indicating the balance sheet and the strength of the balance sheet. 
I want to be very clear that the strategy is exactly the same what I outlined previously. And if I just focus in on the assets that fit our R&D strategy, we are now able to look at, for example, Phase II assets, assets that might be in Phase III. And those are assets that we're going to look at. We're also going to continue to look at tools for our toolkit. I'm not looking at -- I have no preconceived notions about the timing of a transaction and I have no preconceived notions about the dollar amount of a transaction. It has to fit our R&D strategy. It has to be transformative. We have to be able to add value. And when we find that asset and we have the patience and the judgment to be very thoughtful about that, we're going to be ready to evaluate."

So as you noted, and just to ground everybody, we recently updated our view on the epidemiology of CF in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia from 75,000 patients living with CF in those countries or regions to 83,000. And the reason that drove that change was really improvements in data quality and capture in the various registries and, indeed, some establishment of new registries in these regions. We periodically review all that data. And on our latest review, it was obvious to us that over the last few years, the epidemiology had increased. 
Just to answer a question you didn't ask, but one that we have been asked consistently is, was that increase concentrated in any one country, any one region? And it really wasn't. It was really an across-the-board phenomenon and something that's not uncommon as well in rare and orphan diseases is when you have really great transformative medicines, often you see increases in the number of eligible patients, and we believe that was also a factor here. In terms of whether that new epidemiology is included in our long term -- our 2021 guidance. Absolutely, it is. That's the denominator that we are using now. And indeed, a number of those patients are already being treated with our CFTR modulators in the U.S., Canada, Australia and the EU."

So far away from being a rare disease that suffer from type 1 diabetes. And the key there is that the Semma acquisition and the cell-based therapy holds the potential to be transformative. So you're very correct, that is a key that we are looking for. And the type 1 diabetics are treated by endocrinologists, a specialty group. So really, the key for us is not rare disease, but specialty markets, and type 1 diabetes is the best example."

In other cases, we've identified a small molecule approach but we think that adding, for example, protein degradation technology, such as through our collaboration with Kymera, or drugging RNA, I should say, as with our collaborations with Ribometrix or SkyHawk, are the right way to approach those diseases. And you will continue to see us do deals and partnerships where there's a particular technology that opens up a target that we think has transformational potential, and we'll continue to do those as time goes on."

The cell therapy product goes directly into patients. There's no healthy volunteer step. And I would say that in a reasonable number of patients, we're going to be able to tell what the performance of our therapy is, the measures that we are looking at, the outcomes are very straightforward, glucose, hemoglobin A1c, C-peptide level.

I guess you must be hearing my enthusiasm just brimming over. So the way I would think about the type 1 diabetes program is really 2 programs, and I would think of them as 2 separate programs. The first one, the one for which the IND just cleared, let's call that one the naked cell program. I would expect that there are maybe 60,000 people who could benefit from that naked cell program. That program does require immunosuppression. And the way I get to 60,000 is maybe there are 10,000, 15,000 people who have type 1 diabetes, have end-stage renal disease because of their type 1 diabetes and, for that reason, have had a renal transplant and are on immunosuppressives anyway. And then maybe another 40,000 or so people with very brittle diabetes, who would be comfortable with immunosuppression for the benefits that the cell therapy would bring them. 
Now of course, the high fruit here is the cells plus device program. For that second program, we are in late preclinical development. The really important thing to know there is that the Semma team prior to acquisition, and one of the reasons we were so excited about the Semma team coming into Vertex is that they designed using the right material, the right geometry and a clear understanding of how to avoid the pitfalls of fibrosis, allowing oxygen to flow, allowing insulin and glucose to flow but not allowing the immune cells to attack the cell-based therapy. So that program is particularly exciting because that does not require immunosuppressives. As we make progress on that program, we'll certainly keep you updated but that is making its way through preclinical development -- late preclinical development right now."

Okay. So the question that you asked is an excellent one, and it is how should we think about our cell-based therapy vis-à-vis what's been done with pancreas transplant or islet cell transplant. All right. So maybe 3 or 4 key things to know. The most important, by far, in a way, the most important thing to know is this. We know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. It's autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic islet cells. And we know that when you can replace those cells, be it by whole pancreas transplant or islet cell transplants, you get benefit. So we know those 2 things. 
What's the problem? Well, the problem is the quantity and quality of islet cells. That is actually the essence of the problem, not that we don't know that this will work. We know it will work. And the real, real seminal discovery here that the Semma team made, and that was so exciting to us is they developed a way to take stem cells differentiated, fully differentiated into insulin-producing islet cells and make that in industrialized quantities. And so now what we have is the quantity and quality of cells to give, to transfuse, to transplant into patients with type 1 diabetes. So that's really what the real discovery here has been and why this program is so exciting to us.

Our goal is to continue to transform cystic fibrosis and other serious diseases and, in so doing, reach more patients and drive future growth. 1 quarter into 2021, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making across the board in sup",1075,"Thank you, Michael. Our goal is to continue to transform cystic fibrosis and other serious diseases and, in so doing, reach more patients and drive future growth. 1 quarter into 2021, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making across the board in support of this goal. We are treating more patients with our CFTR modulators than ever before. And our clinical pipeline, spanning 7 disease areas and 3 modalities, has advanced significantly. In addition, we continue to execute on our strategy to use external innovation to complement our internal innovation efforts, including 2 new deals announced already this year. 
I'll start with CF. Vertex has built an exceptionally strong and durable franchise and earned a leadership position in cystic fibrosis. RCF medicines have transformed the treatment of this disease, and we continue to significantly increase the number of patients we're treating. Our first quarter revenues totaled more than $1.7 billion, which represents a 14% year-over-year growth and reflects the high level of treatment penetration of TRIKAFTA in the U.S. and strong KAFTRIO launch in international markets. We are poised for continued significant growth in the coming years as we achieve additional approvals and reimbursement agreements for our medicines globally and as we bring our medicines to younger patients. 
The clinical benefit that the triple combination delivers is remarkable. And with this medicine, we believe we can treat 90% of all people with CF. But we are not stopping there. We're investing to bring new and potentially better regimens, such as the VX-121, 561 tezacaftor combination to patients. This new combination is a once-a-day regimen with potential for enhanced patient benefit as well as enhanced economics with the reduced royalty obligation. Finally, we remain committed to and are making progress in developing genetic therapies for the remaining 10% of CF patients. 
In summary, consistent with our strategy to bring transformative medicines to all patients with CF, the combination of label expansion, additional approvals and reimbursement agreements and the next-generation of products will continue to provide significant top and bottom line growth in the coming years. 
Let me turn to our clinical pipeline, which includes programs in 7 disease areas and span small molecules, cell and genetic therapies. We have made substantial progress across the breadth of the pipeline and are poised for multiple data readouts in the next 6 to 12 months. 
First, CTX001. CTX001 is our most advanced program beyond CF. In the last year, we've generated remarkable clinical data that demonstrates the potential of this therapy to be a onetime functional cure for patients suffering from sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. CTX001 has been granted RMAT, Fast Track and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the FDA for both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia as well as prime designation from the EMA for both diseases. With the compelling clinical profile and rapid progress of CTX001 towards registration and commercialization, now is the ideal time for Vertex to take the lead for this program and bring the full breadth of our development, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization expertise so that we can reach all eligible patients who may benefit from CTX001 as quickly as possible. 
As Stuart will discuss in a moment, there are nearly 170,000 patients with sickle cell disease in beta thalassemia in the U.S. and Europe, of whom 32,000 patients have severe disease and we believe will be eligible for CTX001 therapy with the current conditioning regimen. This number could extend significantly once gentler conditioning regimens are available. To date, more than 30 patients have been dosed with CTX001, and we anticipate sharing updated data from the ongoing sickle cell and transfusion-dependent thalassemia studies with more patients and longer duration of follow-up at upcoming medical meetings this year. We also expect to complete enrollment in both of these studies this year. 
Lastly, while we've initiated, we have not yet completed our discussions with regulators regarding filing expectations. Based on conversations to date, we believe regulatory submissions for approval of CTX001 may be possible in the next 18 to 24 months. We'll provide further details as we conclude our discussions. 
Moving on to the AATD program. Our approach targets the underlying cause of this disease by using a small molecule corrector to appropriately fold the misfolded ZAAT protein. We believe this is the optimal approach for treating AATD, and it is the only approach that addresses both the lung and liver manifestations of the disease. VX-864 is our most advanced molecule in the program. We have completed enrollment. And recently, we also completed dosing in the Phase II proof-of-concept study of VX-864. Patients are now in the process of completing the 28-day safety follow-up period. We are on track for a data readout later this quarter. 
Turning to APOL1-mediated kidney disease. APOL1-mediated kidney disease is a particularly aggressive form of renal disease characterized by proteinuria, declining renal function and progression to ESRD. Our lead molecule in this program, VX-147, is being studied in the Phase II proof-of-concept study in APOL1-mediated FSGS, evaluating safety, pharmacokinetics and reduction of proteinuria in patients over the course of 13 weeks. We expect to have the results from this study in the second half of 2021. 
Next, turning to our pain program. Earlier this week, we announced that we plan to advance VX-548, the next lead molecule in our pain program, into Phase II development. In VX-150, we were the first to validate the NaV1.8 target with 3 positive Phase II proof-of-concept trials in 3 different pain indications. The recent decision to move VX-548 to Phase II was based on supportive Phase I data in healthy volunteers, including safety, power ability and pharmacokinetics. In these studies, the molecule exhibited a favorable profile at doses considerably lower than those required with our previous NaV1.8 inhibitors. The Phase II studies will evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-548 in the treatment of acute pain following bunionectomy and also in abdominoplasty. These are well-characterized settings for the evaluation of 2 broad categories of acute pain, visceral and nonvisceral, and we expect the studies to start in the second half of this year. 
Finally, in our type 1 diabetes program, we received FDA Fast Track Designation for the self alone study and initiated the Phase I/II study in patients with difficult-to-treat Type 1 diabetes in Q1. Screening is now open, and we look forward to providing updates on our progress this year. 
With those comments, I'll hand it off to Stuart."

Today, I am pleased to review with you our Q1 commercial performance and our excitement about the prospects for CTX001. 1 year into the pandemic, our CF revenues continue to grow. Our Q1 global revenues were $1.7 billion driven by continued strong execution in both the U.S. and the EU. 
Our performance in the U.S. continues to be impressive. To date, nearly all eligible CF patients in the U.S. have initiated treatment with TRIKAFTA. Based on the original approval in patients 12 years and older with at least 1 FV08 [indiscernible] mutation. And persistence and compliance remain high among these patients. In December 2020, TRIKAFTA's approval was expanded in the U.S. to include patients 12 years and older with rare mutations. Many of these patients have now initiated treatment as well, and we are pleased by the uptake we have seen in this newly eligible group. 
Outside of the U.S., in markets where patients have access, the adoption of KAFTRIO is just as impressive as in the U.S. We have seen rapid uptake, particularly in the U.K. and Germany. And persistence and compliance are similarly strong, reflecting the very favorable risk-benefit profile of KAFTRIO. Our ex U.S. revenues in Q1 were $470 million, 43% higher than the same period last year, primarily due to the successful launch of KAFTRIO. Earlier this year, we shared our updated estimate that there are approximately 83,000 people living with CF in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia. Today, we are treating about half of all patients, leaving an additional 30,000 patients who could benefit from our medicines but who are not yet treated. Going forward, we are very confident that we will be able to reach these patients. 
Approximately 2/3 of the untreated patients are 12 and older, and we expect we will be able to treat these patients through the ongoing launch, uptake and reimbursement of KAFTRIO outside the U.S. In countries where we have regulatory approval and reimbursement, our teams are working hard to reach all eligible patients who could benefit from KAFTRIO. In countries such as France, Spain and Australia, where we have regulatory approval but have not yet secured reimbursement, our teams continue to make progress to ensure access, and we are confident that we will be able to secure reimbursement in the remaining large markets. For example, TRIKAFTA was recently approved in Australia, and we are committed to continuing to work collaboratively with the pharmaceutical benefits advisory committee there to ensure all 2,200 patients who can benefit from treatment have government-funded access to TRIKAFTA as quickly as possible. Lastly, in Canada, we are still awaiting regulatory approval, and we expect approval there in the second half of this year. 
The majority of the remaining approximately 10,000 patients are younger than 12. Our work to secure approvals for these younger patient populations is ongoing, and we are making good progress here. We anticipate approval of TRIKAFTA in 6- to 11-year olds in the U.S. in mid-2021 and have filed the regulatory submission for this population in Europe as well. 
In summary, our continued progress in achieving label expansion, new approvals and reimbursements and development of new products will drive continued growth in the years to come. In all of this, we are grateful for the tireless work and continued support of the global CF community. 
Let's now turn to CTX001, which is our next medicine that is rapidly advancing toward regulatory submissions and commercialization. Given the tremendous progress of CTX001 that we and our partners at CRISPR have made as well as Vertex' established expertise in development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization in serious diseases, both companies believe that having Vertex lead all aspects of the CTX001 program going forward would provide for the most efficient and expeditious path to bring this medicine to patients. By doing this, we aim to ensure a coordinated global launch, which will maximize the potential of this program for both patients and our shareholders. 
CTX001 is a groundbreaking therapy that has demonstrated great momentum with the potential to be the first approved genetic therapy for patients with sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia represent a multibillion-dollar commercial opportunity. Today, there are approximately 32,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe who would likely be eligible for gene editing therapy based on the severity of their disease and the current busulfan-based conditioning regimen. Vertex, CRISPR and a number of other companies are actively pursuing gentler conditioning regimens. Such regimens would potentially expand the eligible patient population to approximately 170,000 total patients in the U.S. and Europe. 
The commercial opportunity in sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia fits well within Vertex' strategic focus on specialty markets. Patients are primarily cared for by hematologists, and the treatment will be focused at transplant centers in the U.S. and Europe, which can be covered by a specialist infrastructure. By taking a leadership role on CTX001, we will be able to leverage our proven expertise in product launches, reimbursement and access to bring the curative potential of this treatment to more patients more quickly around the world. Given we believe that regulatory submissions could happen in the next 18 to 24 months, our precommercial work is underway. CTX001 is breaking new grounds in many respects, and I'm very much looking forward to providing more details on this exciting work on future calls. 
And now I'll hand it over to Charlie."

In the first quarter of 2021, Vertex continued its record of exceptional financial performance. First quarter total product revenues were $1.7 billion, a 14% increase compared to the first quarter of 2020. And these results included $1.25 billion of revenue in the U.S. and $470 million from outside the U.S. The ex U.S. results represent growth of 43% over the prior year driven largely by the rapid uptake of KAFTRIO in countries where we have secured reimbursement, particularly England and Germany. 
Our first quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $530 million compared to $477 million for the first quarter of 2020. Expenses in Q1 were primarily driven by investment in innovation, and we expect our R&D investments will continue to be substantial as we drive toward proof-of-concept data and further clinical and regulatory progress across our broad pipeline. 
Our continued growth in revenues, combined with carefully managed growth in spending translates to a first quarter non-GAAP operating margin of 58%. With our strong revenue and profitability, we ended the first quarter with $6.9 billion in cash. Consistent with our corporate and R&D strategy, we're investing more in innovation than ever before, including external innovation. This was most recently exemplified by both our amended collaboration agreement with CRISPR and our new discovery collaboration with Obsidian Therapeutics. 
Now on to guidance. We are maintaining our previously issued 2021 guidance for total product revenues in the range of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion. Our Q1 revenues were very strong but they also include an approximately $50 million benefit from channel inventory fluctuations that are not directly reflective of underlying patient demand. As a reminder, our 2021 guidance reflects our expectations for currently approved products in regions where we are reimbursed, plus an expectation of TRIKAFTA approval for the 6- to 11-year-old population in the U.S. in mid-2021. It does not include any additional reimbursements that we might obtain this year. 
For non-GAAP OpEx, we are reiterating our guidance range of $2.25 billion to $2.3 billion. We expect to continue allocating greater than 70% of OpEx to R&D as we further advance our pipeline programs. We are poised to generate important clinical data from a number of programs over the course of the year, and these data sets will drive decisions on further investment. For our non-GAAP tax rate, we are guiding to a range of 21% to 22% this year. 
In summary, I'm very pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2021 and  look forward to updating you on our continued progress over the course of this year. 
Now back to Reshma for closing remarks."

I think the questions really are, where are we with the 864 program, what are we expecting, what would be success and a little bit about the portfolio approach and other molecules. So let me take that in pieces. So you know this, but to review for others on the call, we are taking small molecule correctors to refold the misfolded ZAAT protein. That's our approach to this disease. And the reason it's important to understand that is that, fundamentally, this is the only approach that holds the potential to treat both liver and lung, hence, our enthusiasm for this approach. VX-864 is in the clinic. You heard me in the prepared remarks talk about the fact that we've hit some really important milestones. We are done with enrollment. Our patients have completed the dosing period, and they are now in the 28-day safety follow-up period. 
Here's what I'm looking for from the study and what I would consider success, really 3 things. The first, safety. This is the first time we've had VX-864 in patients with AATD, so that's obviously front and center. Second, a dose exposure or dose response relationship; and third, elevation in functional AAT levels. That's really what I'm looking for and what I would be very excited to see. In terms of the portfolio and molecule beyond VX-864, as with all of the programs in the pipeline, so we have a whole portfolio of molecules, and that continues to be true for AATD as well."

Let me start with the question around the amended agreement with CRISPR. Geoff, it's a number of catalysts that happened over the course of the last, let's say, 6 to 8 months that led us to amending the agreement. If you go back to last year, between last year and now, we have delivered proof-of-concept results from both sickle cell and beta thalassemia. Not only that, but we have data that we've shown from 10 patients, and the data are really nothing short of remarkable. We're also at a point now where we've dosed more than 30 people in this program. And we are looking to complete enrollment in both beta thal and sickle cell disease this year. The program has a lot of momentum behind it, and it is progressing overall even faster than we expected. You put that all together, and this is really just the perfect time for Vertex to take the leadership role and bring the full weight of our experience and infrastructure and expertise to get to as many patients as possible as quickly as possible. 
With regard to your question on AATD, the answer to your question around how committed are we, how do we think about this disease, this disease fits our strategy like a glove, and we are exceptionally committed to AATD. With regard to the approach, there is no better approach to AATD than small molecule correction of the misfolded protein, right? The ZAAT protein that is misfolded in the disease, that is the underlying cause of the disease. And with the small molecule approach, you have the opportunity to target that underlying cargo disease and in so doing treat both the liver and lung manifestations. So we are absolutely committed to AATD and to the small molecule correctors."

Michael, I think you're asking about the Type 1 diabetes program. And just to understand a little bit about the background and maybe a little bit about where we are, and I certainly heard your question about when we can expect to see some data. Okay, so the Type 1 diabetes program is a cell-based program that comes really in 2 flavors. One, let's call it the naked cell approach, that's the one that had the IND cleared earlier in the year, that's the one that's in patients -- the study in patients is ongoing right now, the Phase I/II study, and that program is in the Phase I/II stage. The second one is the sell plus device program. Now let me just step back and explain 2 more things here. There is very little biological risk in terms of the approach that we're taking to Type 1 diabetes, right? 
Because we understand very clearly what the cause of disease is, it's autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet cells. Maybe more importantly, we have known for many years that islet cell transplants lead to great outcomes in patients with Type 1 diabetes. That is already known. Islet cell transplants have been done for years. The issue has been the quality and quantity of cells. And that's exactly the solution that Sema and now Vertex are bringing forward. So with the naked cell program. This would be about, let's say, 60,000 patients. These are patients with severe diabetes that I think could benefit from this program, which would include chronic immunosuppression. 
If we go then to the cell and device program, there are over 1 million people just in the U.S. and an equivalent number in the EU with Type 1 diabetes that could benefit from the cell and device program. That, of course, would not require any immunosuppression. And with regard to timing, so the naked program is cleared to IND. It's in the Phase I/II now. You recall that we're starting at a lower dose and then just like with CTX001, we would then get to the target dose. And I would say that just like the CTX001 program, you should think of it as a efficient program and a reasonable number of patients will give us a good sensitive profile. And I would say that you should have a mindset towards 2022 for data readout from that program."

I'm going to tackle the things that you need to know from an R&D perspective, and I'm going to ask Stuart to comment on the commercial prospects here. Three things, Liisa, to know from the R&D perspective. First, the target. The target here is NaV1.8. And that's important to note because NaV1.8 is a genetically validated target, but it's also a pharmacologically validated target. And you're exactly right, it was VX-150 that had positive Phase II proof-of-concept readouts across 3 different pain indications: acute, neuropathic and, let's call it, musculoskeletal pain. 
The second thing to know is our approach with VX-548. So VX-548, as it's emerged from its Phase I trial, it really has all of the properties that we're looking for, not only in terms of safety and tolerability but also PK and exposures and at doses that are considerably lower than what we saw with our previous NaV1.8 0.8 inhibitors, including 150. And that obviously has significant benefits in a multitude of ways, but including in formulation and manufacturability. And the last thing I'll say on the R&D side is we're starting with acute pain. Bunionectomy will be first and then abdominoplasty. We're doing that because the pathway to registration is a visceral and nonvisceral indication. Acute pain, as the name implies, it's a very short duration of treatment. It's a couple of days. And we've done a bunionectomy studies before. We know how to do it. So that's kind of how I'm viewing that. 
I'm going to turn it over to Stuart to tell you a little bit more about the market size and the opportunity there."

What you've heard us say in the past is when we get to considerations in musculoskeletal pain, for example, that is not something that we would commercialize. But what we're talking about here is acute pain and neuropathic pain. 
Going to CF, the next wave of combination of potentiators and correctors is indeed the combination of VX-121, VX-561 and tezacaftor. And really, what we're looking at here is a combination that has the potential to have superior efficacy for patients, once-a-day dosing and also improved economics. And what I mean by that is going from royalties that are in the low double digits to low single digits. We are wrapping up our conversations with regulators on that program, and we are readying that program to go to Phase III, which I expect will happen later this year."

So that's very, very impressive as they are driven by uptake in those markets where we already have reimbursement. 
We're continuing to make good progress in getting reimbursement in new countries. Indeed, during the first few months of this year. We have added new reimbursement agreements in places like Finland and Israel and Switzerland. And we're continuing to work with countries where we have regulatory approval but don't yet have reimbursement. And in Europe, that would be countries like France and Italy and Spain. Obviously, we recently received regulatory approval in Australia. We're working with the PE back there. And obviously, we're still waiting for regulatory approval in Canada. What I can tell you is that we continue to feel very, very confident that we are going to get both regulatory approvals and reimbursement agreements in those countries.

And the reason I say that is we at Vertex are working on gentler regimen, CRISPR Therapeutics is working on gentler regimen as are a number of other companies. 
There are targets that we already know about. There are self-surface markers on hematopoietic stem cells that are the specific cells that we want to target. Those are already known, CD-117, for example. And the payloads are already known as well.

One is with microdystrophins, which many others are doing, not us.

So when you think about the advantages and disadvantages of each, and there are, the potential advantage to a microdystrophin approach is that it's a singular approach for multiple exons. The great disadvantage, of course, is that it's not anywhere close to a full-length protein. Our approach is the full-length protein, which has the great benefit of being what is exactly the protein that is what we are trying to target. So having full-length protein is critically important. 
What we see as the approach here is to come forward with the first exon and then to have an approach and an agreement with regulators that once we have that first exon, that the second, third, fourth would be far more efficient. And obviously, our intent is to bring those forward on shorter time lines because the bulk of the work will have been done with the first exon."

Our goal is to continue to transform cystic fibrosis and other serious diseases and, in so doing, reach more patients and drive future growth. One quarter into 2021, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making across the board in s",1076,"Thank you, Michael. Our goal is to continue to transform cystic fibrosis and other serious diseases and, in so doing, reach more patients and drive future growth. One quarter into 2021, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making across the board in support of this goal. We are treating more patients with our CFTR modulators than ever before. And our clinical pipeline, spanning 7 disease areas and 3 modalities, has advanced significantly. In addition, we continue to execute on our strategy to use external innovation to complement our internal innovation efforts, including 2 new deals announced already this year.
I'll start with CF. Vertex has built an exceptionally strong and durable franchise and earned a leadership position in cystic fibrosis. Our CF medicines have transformed the treatment of this disease, and we continue to significantly increase the number of patients we're treating. Our first quarter revenues totaled more than $1.7 billion, which represents a 14% year-over-year growth and reflects the high level of treatment penetration of TRIKAFTA in the U.S. and strong KAFTRIO launch in international markets. We are poised for continued significant growth in the coming years as we achieve additional approvals and reimbursement agreements for our medicines globally and as we bring our medicines to younger patients.
The clinical benefit that the triple combination delivers is remarkable. And with this medicine, we believe we can treat 90% of all people with CF. But we are not stopping there. We're investing to bring new and potentially better regimens, such as the VX-121, 561, tezacaftor combination to patients. This new combination is a once-a-day regimen with potential for enhanced patient benefit as well as enhanced economics with the reduced royalty obligation. Finally, we remain committed to and are making progress in developing genetic therapies for the remaining 10% of CF patients.
In summary, consistent with our strategy to bring transformative medicines to all patients with CF, the combination of label expansion, additional approvals and reimbursement agreements and the next generation of products will continue to provide significant top and bottom line growth in the coming years.
Let me turn to our clinical pipeline, which includes programs in 7 disease areas and spans small molecules, cell and genetic therapies. We have made substantial progress across the breadth of the pipeline and are poised for multiple data readouts in the next 6 to 12 months. First, CTX001. CTX001 is our most advanced program beyond CF. In the last year, we've generated remarkable clinical data that demonstrates the potential of this therapy to be a onetime functional cure for patients suffering from sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. CTX001 has been granted RMAT, Fast Track and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the FDA for both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia; as well as PRIME designation from the EMA for both diseases.
With the compelling clinical profile and rapid progress of CTX001 towards registration and commercialization, now is the ideal time for Vertex to take the lead for this program and bring the full breadth of our development, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization expertise, so that we can reach all eligible patients who may benefit from CTX001 as quickly as possible. As Stuart will discuss in a moment, there are nearly 170,000 patients with sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia in the U.S. and Europe, of whom 32,000 patients have severe disease and we believe will be eligible for CTX001 therapy with the current conditioning regimen. This number could extend significantly once gentler conditioning regimens are available.
To date, more than 30 patients have been dosed with CTX001, and we anticipate sharing updated data from the ongoing sickle cell and transfusion-dependent thalassemia studies with more patients and longer duration of follow-up at upcoming medical meetings this year. We also expect to complete enrollment in both of these studies this year.
Lastly, while we've initiated, we have not yet completed our discussions with regulators regarding filing expectations. Based on conversations to date, we believe regulatory submissions for approval of CTX001 may be possible in the next 18 to 24 months. We'll provide further details as we conclude our discussions.
Moving on to the AATD program. Our approach targets the underlying cause of this disease by using a small molecule corrector to appropriately fold the misfolded Z-AAT protein. We believe this is the optimal approach for treating AATD, and it is the only approach that addresses both the lung and liver manifestations of the disease. VX-864 is our most advanced molecule in the program. We have completed enrollment. And recently, we also completed dosing in the Phase II proof-of-concept study of VX-864. Patients are now in the process of completing the 28-day safety follow-up period. We are on track for a data readout later this quarter.
Turning to APOL1-mediated kidney disease. APOL1-mediated kidney disease is a particularly aggressive form of renal disease characterized by proteinuria, declining renal function and progression to ESRD. Our lead molecule in this program, VX-147, is being studied in a Phase II proof-of-concept study in APOL1-mediated FSGS, evaluating safety, pharmacokinetics and reduction of proteinuria in patients over the course of 13 weeks. We expect to have the results from this study in the second half of 2021.
Next, turning to our pain program. Earlier this week, we announced that we plan to advance VX-548, the next lead molecule in our pain program, into Phase II development. In VX-150, we were the first to validate the NaV1.8 target with 3 positive Phase II proof-of-concept trials in 3 different pain indications. The recent decision to move VX-548 to Phase II was based on supportive Phase I data in healthy volunteers, including safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics. In these studies, the molecule exhibited a favorable profile at doses considerably lower than those required with our previous NaV1.8 inhibitors. The Phase II studies will evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-548 in the treatment of acute pain following bunionectomy and also in abdominoplasty. These are well-characterized settings for the evaluation of 2 broad categories of acute pain, visceral and nonvisceral, and we expect the studies to start in the second half of this year.
Finally, in our type 1 diabetes program, we received FDA Fast Track Designation for the cells alone study and initiated the Phase I/II study in patients with difficult-to-treat type 1 diabetes in Q1. Screening is now open, and we look forward to providing updates on our progress this year.
With those comments, I'll hand it off to Stuart."

Our performance in the U.S. continues to be impressive. To date, nearly all eligible CF patients in the U.S. have initiated treatment with TRIKAFTA. Based on the original approval in patients 12 years and older with at least 1 F508del mutation. And persistence and compliance remain high among these patients. In December 2020, TRIKAFTA's approval was expanded in the U.S. to include patients 12 years and older with rare mutations. Many of these patients have now initiated treatment as well, and we are pleased by the uptake we have seen in this newly eligible group.
Outside of the U.S., in markets where patients have access, the adoption of KAFTRIO is just as impressive as in the U.S. We have seen rapid uptake, particularly in the U.K. and Germany. And persistence and compliance are similarly strong, reflecting the very favorable risk/benefit profile of KAFTRIO. Our ex-U.S. revenues in Q1 were $470 million, 43% higher than the same period last year, primarily due to the successful launch of KAFTRIO.
Earlier this year, we shared our updated estimate that there are approximately 83,000 people living with CF in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia. Today, we are treating about half of all patients, leaving an additional 30,000 patients who could benefit from our medicines but who are not yet treated. Going forward, we are very confident that we will be able to reach these patients.
Approximately 2/3 of the untreated patients are 12 and older, and we expect we will be able to treat these patients through the ongoing launch, uptake and reimbursement of KAFTRIO outside the U.S. In countries where we have regulatory approval and reimbursement, our teams are working hard to reach all eligible patients who could benefit from KAFTRIO. In countries such as France, Spain and Australia where we have regulatory approval but have not yet secured reimbursement, our teams continue to make progress to ensure access, and we are confident that we will be able to secure reimbursement in the remaining large markets.
For example, TRIKAFTA was recently approved in Australia, and we are committed to continuing to work collaboratively with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee there to ensure all 2,200 patients who can benefit from treatment have government-funded access to TRIKAFTA as quickly as possible.
Lastly, in Canada, we are still awaiting regulatory approval, and we expect approval there in the second half of this year.
The majority of the remaining approximately 10,000 patients are younger than 12. Our work to secure approvals for these younger patient populations is ongoing, and we are making good progress here. We anticipate approval of TRIKAFTA in 6- to 11-year-olds in the U.S. in mid-2021 and have filed the regulatory submission for this population in Europe as well.
In summary, our continued progress in achieving label expansion, new approvals and reimbursements and development of new products will drive continued growth in the years to come. In all of this, we are grateful for the tireless work and continued support of the global CF community.
Let's now turn to CTX001, which is our next medicine that is rapidly advancing toward regulatory submissions and commercialization. Given the tremendous progress of CTX001 that we and our partners at CRISPR have made, as well as Vertex' established expertise in development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization in serious diseases, both companies believe that having Vertex lead all aspects of the CTX001 program going forward would provide for the most efficient and expeditious path to bring this medicine to patients. By doing this, we aim to ensure a coordinated global launch, which will maximize the potential of this program for both patients and our shareholders.
CTX001 is a groundbreaking therapy that has demonstrated great momentum with the potential to be the first approved genetic therapy for patients with sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia represent a multibillion-dollar commercial opportunity. Today, there are approximately 32,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe who would likely be eligible for gene editing therapy based on the severity of their disease and the current busulfan-based conditioning regimen. Vertex, CRISPR and a number of other companies are actively pursuing gentler conditioning regimens. Such regimens would potentially expand the eligible patient population to approximately 170,000 total patients in the U.S. and Europe.
The commercial opportunity in sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia fits well within Vertex' strategic focus on specialty markets. Patients are primarily cared for by hematologists, and the treatment will be focused at transplant centers in the U.S. and Europe, which can be covered by a specialist infrastructure. By taking a leadership role on CTX001, we will be able to leverage our proven expertise in product launches, reimbursement and access to bring the curative potential of this treatment to more patients more quickly around the world.
Given we believe that regulatory submissions could happen in the next 18 to 24 months, our precommercial work is underway. CTX001 is breaking new grounds in many respects, and I'm very much looking forward to providing more details on this exciting work on future calls.
And now I'll hand it over to Charlie."

In the first quarter of 2021, Vertex continued its record of exceptional financial performance. First quarter total product revenues were $1.7 billion, a 14% increase compared to the first quarter of 2020. And these results included $1.25 billion of revenue in the U.S. and $470 million from outside the U.S. The ex-U.S. results represent growth of 43% over the prior year driven largely by the rapid uptake of KAFTRIO in countries where we have secured reimbursement, particularly England and Germany.
Our first quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $530 million compared to $477 million for the first quarter of 2020. Expenses in Q1 were primarily driven by investment in innovation, and we expect our R&D investments will continue to be substantial as we drive toward proof-of-concept data and further clinical and regulatory progress across our broad pipeline.
Our continued growth in revenues, combined with carefully managed growth in spending, translates to a first quarter non-GAAP operating margin of 58%. With our strong revenue and profitability, we ended the first quarter with $6.9 billion in cash. Consistent with our corporate and R&D strategy, we're investing more in innovation than ever before, including external innovation. This was most recently exemplified by both our amended collaboration agreement with CRISPR and our new discovery collaboration with Obsidian Therapeutics.
Now on to guidance. We are maintaining our previously issued 2021 guidance for total product revenues in the range of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion. Our Q1 revenues were very strong, but they also include an approximately $50 million benefit from channel inventory fluctuations that are not directly reflective of underlying patient demand. As a reminder, our 2021 guidance reflects our expectations for currently approved products in regions where we are reimbursed, plus an expectation of TRIKAFTA approval for the 6- to 11-year-old population in the U.S. in mid-2021. It does not include any additional reimbursements that we might obtain this year.
For non-GAAP OpEx, we are reiterating our guidance range of $2.25 billion to $2.3 billion. We expect to continue allocating greater than 70% of OpEx to R&D as we further advance our pipeline programs. We are poised to generate important clinical data from a number of programs over the course of the year, and these data sets will drive decisions on further investment.
For our non-GAAP tax rate, we are guiding to a range of 21% to 22% this year.
In summary, I'm very pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2021 and look forward to updating you on our continued progress over the course of this year.
Now back to Reshma for closing remarks."

I think the questions really are, where are we with the 864 program, what are we expecting, what would be success and a little bit about the portfolio approach and other molecules. So let me take that in pieces.
So you know this, but to review for others on the call, we are taking small molecule correctors to refold the misfolded Z-AAT protein. That's our approach to this disease. And the reason it's important to understand that is that, fundamentally, this is the only approach that holds the potential to treat both liver and lung, hence, our enthusiasm for this approach.
VX-864 is in the clinic. You heard me in the prepared remarks talk about the fact that we've hit some really important milestones. We are done with enrollment. Our patients have completed the dosing period, and they are now in the 28-day safety follow-up period.
Here's what I'm looking for from the study and what I would consider success, really 3 things. The first, safety. This is the first time we've had VX-864 in patients with AATD, so that's obviously front and center. Second, a dose exposure or dose response relationship; and third, elevation in functional AAT levels. That's really what I'm looking for and what I would be very excited to see.
In terms of the portfolio and molecule beyond VX-864, as with all of the programs in the pipeline, so we have a whole portfolio of molecules. And that continues to be true for AATD as well."

Geoff, it's a number of catalysts that happened over the course of the last, let's say, 6 to 8 months that led us to amending the agreement. If you go back to last year, between last year and now, we have delivered proof-of-concept results from both sickle cell and beta thalassemia. Not only that, but we have data that we've shown from 10 patients, and the data are really nothing short of remarkable. We're also at a point now where we've dosed more than 30 people in this program. And we are looking to complete enrollment in both beta thal and sickle cell disease this year.
The program has a lot of momentum behind it, and it is progressing overall even faster than we expected. You put that all together, and this is really just the perfect time for Vertex to take the leadership role and bring the full weight of our experience and infrastructure and expertise to get to as many patients as possible, as quickly as possible.
With regard to your question on AATD, the answer to your question around how committed are we, how do we think about this disease, this disease fits our strategy like a glove, and we are exceptionally committed to AATD.
With regard to the approach, there is no better approach to AATD than small molecule correction of the misfolded protein, right? The Z-AAT protein that is misfolded in the disease, that is the underlying cause of the disease. And with the small molecule approach, you have the opportunity to target that underlying cause of disease and, in so doing, treat both the liver and lung manifestations. So we are absolutely committed to AATD and to the small molecule correctors."

Michael, I think you're asking about the type 1 diabetes program. And just to understand a little bit about the background and maybe a little bit about where we are, and I certainly heard your question about when we can expect to see some data. Okay, so the type 1 diabetes program is a cell-based program that comes really in 2 flavors. One, let's call it the naked cell approach, that's the one that had the IND cleared earlier in the year. That's the one that's in patients -- the study in patients is ongoing right now, the Phase I/II study. And that program is in the Phase I/II stage. The second one is the cell plus device program.
Now let me just step back and explain 2 more things here. There is very little biological risk in terms of the approach that we're taking to type 1 diabetes, right? Because we understand very clearly what the cause of disease is, it's autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet cells. Maybe more importantly, we have known for many years that islet cell transplants lead to great outcomes in patients with type 1 diabetes. That is already known. Islet cell transplants have been done for years. The issue has been the quality and quantity of cells. And that's exactly the solution that Semma and now Vertex are bringing forward. So with the naked cell program, this would be about, let's say, 60,000 patients. These are patients with severe diabetes that I think could benefit from this program, which would include chronic immunosuppression.
If we go then to the cell and device program, there are over 1 million people just in the U.S. and an equivalent number in the EU with type 1 diabetes that could benefit from the cell and device program. That, of course, would not require any immunosuppression.
And with regard to timing, so the naked program is cleared to IND. It's in the Phase I/II now. You recall that we're starting at a lower dose, and then just like with CTX001, we would then get to the target dose. And I would say that just like the CTX001 program, you should think of it as a efficient program, and a reasonable number of patients will give us a good sensitive profile. And I would say that you should have a mindset towards 2022 for data readout from that program."

Three things, Liisa, to know from the R&D perspective. First, the target. The target here is NaV1.8. And that's important to know because NaV1.8 is a genetically validated target, but it's also a pharmacologically validated target.

So VX-548, as it's emerged from its Phase I trial, it really has all of the properties that we're looking for, not only in terms of safety and tolerability but also PK and exposures and at doses that are considerably lower than what we saw with our previous NaV1.8 inhibitors, including 150. And that obviously has significant benefits in a multitude of ways but including in formulation and manufacturability.
And the last thing I'll say on the R&D side is we're starting with acute pain. Bunionectomy will be first and then abdominoplasty. We're doing that because the pathway to registration is a visceral and nonvisceral indication. Acute pain, as the name implies, it's a very short duration of treatment. It's a couple of days. And we've done a bunionectomy studies before. We know how to do it. So that's kind of how I'm viewing that.
I'm going to turn it over to Stuart to tell you a little bit more about the market size and the opportunity there."

So in the acute and neuropathic segments of the pain market, they're both currently multibillion-dollar segments of the market, both largely dominated by generics currently and both in need of significant innovation. And so we're looking to bring forward an agent, which is both superior in terms of efficacy and tolerability. And as a result of that, we believe it will be used in a great deal of patients in both of those segments.
And because we're targeting that superior profile, we think we'll be able to compete in a really, really strong way with generic opioids and also generic pregabalins in the neuropathic segment of the market. Both of those as well are markets which are served by a relatively concentrated group of prescribers. And so we feel that those segments in particular play into our overall corporate strategy of focusing on specialty markets."

What you've heard us say in the past is when we get to considerations in musculoskeletal pain, for example, that is not something that we would commercialize. But what we're talking about here is acute pain and neuropathic pain.
Going to CF, the next wave of combination of potentiators and correctors is, indeed, the combination of VX-121, VX-561 and tezacaftor. And really, what we're looking at here is a combination that has the potential to have superior efficacy for patients, once-a-day dosing and also improved economics. And what I mean by that is going from royalties that are in the low double digits to low single digits. We are wrapping up our conversations with regulators on that program, and we are readying that program to go to Phase III, which I expect will happen later this year."

And the reason I say that is we at Vertex are working on gentler regimen, CRISPR Therapeutics is working on gentler regimen as are a number of other companies.
There are targets that we already know about. There are self-surface markers on hematopoietic stem cells that are the specific cells that we wanted to target. Those are already known, CD117, for example. And the payloads are already known as well. And remember, this gentler conditioning regimen has potential use for both oncology indications as well as what we would be looking at in terms of sickle cell and beta cell.

So when you think about the advantages and disadvantages of each, and there are, the potential advantage to a microdystrophin approach is that it's a singular approach for multiple exons. The great disadvantage, of course, is that it's not anywhere close to a full-length protein.
Our approach is the full-length protein, which has the great benefit of being what is exactly the protein that is what we are trying to target. So having full-length protein is critically important. What we see as the approach here is to come forward with the first exon and then to have an approach and an agreement with regulators that once we have that first exon, that the second, third, fourth would be far more efficient.

As such, we are raising our 2021 guidance range by $500 million to a range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion, reflecting 18% year-on-year growth at the midpoint of the range. But our work in CF is not done. There are still more than 30,000 people with CF who are yet to be treated. And by reaching these patients, we see continued significant growth for the CF business. 
With regard to the pipeline, progress is accelerating across the portfolio. We now expect to achieve target enrollment in both CTX001 studies in Q3. We have initiated the VX-548 Phase II program in acute pain. We are on track to begin the Phase II of next-in-class triple combination program in CF shortly. And in the next 6 to 9 months, we expect important data readouts from multiple clinical stage programs, including VX-147 in APOL1-mediated FSGS, VX-548 in acute pain and VX-880 in type 1 diabetes. 
I'll now review the key clinical stage programs in more detail. Starting with CF. We are relentless in our efforts to maximize the benefit we can deliver for patients. TRIKAFTA sets the very high bar, and we recognize that any new medicine that aims to treat the 90% of people with CF with at least 1 F508del, including our own medicines, has to show clear potential to improve on TRIKAFTA. We announced earlier this week that the once-a-day next-in-class triple combination VX-121, tezacaftor, VX-561 is advancing to Phase III. We believe it holds the potential for greater efficacy and convenience for patients. It also has the benefit of enhanced economics for our business based on the fact that the royalty obligation would decrease from low double digits to low single digits. 
We are also committed to developing therapies for the approximately 10% of patients who cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. Our lead program in partnership with Moderna uses an mRNA-based approach and continues to make progress in late preclinical development. 
Let me now turn to our [Audio Gap] includes 5 mid- to late-stage programs using 3 different therapeutic modalities, including small molecules, cell and genetic therapies. The most advanced program in the pipeline is CTX001, our gene editing therapy, which represents a potential onetime functional cure for patients with beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. This program continues to have strong momentum and impressive results. We've shared new data at EHA last month involving 22 patients who were treated with CTX001 and had at least 3 months of follow-up. In this data set, [Audio Gap] all beta thalassemia patients [Audio Gap] patients who have the most simple form of the disease. We're transfusion sickle cell patients with free of pain crises following CTX001 therapy. We now have dosed more than 45 patients across the program and are on track to achieve target enrollment in both CTX001 studies in the third quarter. 
We are working with regulators to finalize the filing package for CTX001 and anticipate filing for approval in the next 18 to 24 months. 
Moving to VX-147. VX-147 is our lead molecule for the treatment of APOL1-mediated kidney disease, and we anticipate clinical data from our Phase II proof-of-concept study in APOL1-mediated FSGS in the second half of 2021. VX-147 Phase II study evaluates the safety and the reduction of proteinuria over the course of 13 weeks. Full digit decreases in proteinuria with this molecule would be a significant risk-lowering milestone for the program as this will establish APOL1 inhibition as a promising new mechanism that can be applied to the approximately [ 100,000 ] who have APOL1-mediated nondiabetic pertineuric kidney diseases. 
Consistent with the portfolio approach we take with every pipeline program [Audio Gap] behind VX-147 targeting the APOL1 pathway. 
Turning to the NaV1.8 program. As announced last week, the Phase II trial in acute pain following bunionectomy surgery with our selective NaV1.8 inhibitor, VX-548, is underway, and data are expected by early 2022. NaV1.8 [Audio Gap] and pharmacologically validated with our previous molecule VX-150, demonstrating positive proof of concept in acute neuroplastic and musculoskeletal pain. VX-548 is more potent than our prior molecules, which allows us to use lower doses and also more fully explore the dose response curve. 
We expect to move faster with VX-548 by conducting multiple clinical studies in parallel. Indeed, we are starting a second Phase II acute pain study following abdominoplasty in the coming weeks. The potential to serve patients suffering from acute pain is substantial, and Stuart will share additional perspective on the market opportunity in his remarks. 
The Phase I/II study with VX-880, our islets cells-alone approach, is underway, and the first patient has been dosed. Ours is the only approach to use stem cell-derived fully differentiated insulin-producing islet cells, distinguishing it from all other therapies in clinical development today. Similar to CTX001, we anticipate that proof of concept for VX-880 may be established with relatively small bespefficient time frame. We expect initial data from the study in 2022. Our optimism for this program and for the ability of VX-880 to demonstrate clinical benefit comes from the cadaveric ilial transplantation experience, which has all for transformational outcomes. 
Beyond VX-880, our [indiscernible] program is continuing to progress in late preclinical development. Finally, in AATD, as we shared with you in June, the VX-864 Phase II clinical data showed clear evidence of biological activity, though the magnitude of clinical effect did not support its progression to pivotal studies. Based [Audio Gap] AATD and to our small molecule corrector approach. This is the only approach that targets the underlying cause of AATD and therefore, holds the potential to treat both the lung and liver manifestations of disease. We expect that our next wave of molecules will advance into the clinic in 2022 and that we will be a more rapidly through clinical development with the insights we have gained from the VX-864 trial. 
I'll now hand it off to Stuart."
36235,1674312267,2355466,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Reshma. I'll begin by reviewing the Q2 revenue performance of our CF medicines. Our Q2 global revenues reached nearly $1.8 billion, driven by increasing revenues outside the U.S. as a result of the launch of KAFTRIO and continued strong perform",1208,"Thank you, Reshma. I'll begin by reviewing the Q2 revenue performance of our CF medicines. Our Q2 global revenues reached nearly $1.8 billion, driven by increasing revenues outside the U.S. as a result of the launch of KAFTRIO and continued strong performance in the U.S. In the U.S., the launch of TRIKAFTA in ages 12-plus has been highly successful and just under 2 years since regulatory approval, the vast majority of eligible patients have initiated treatment. We have continued to see very high persistence and compliance levels, and we're now focused on the ongoing law of TRIKAFTA in children ages 6 to 11 in the U.S., following the approval in June. 
Outside the U.S., we have made significant progress with reimbursement for our medicines. We now have reimbursed access for KAFTRIO in more than 15 countries outside the U.S., less than 1 year following EMA approval. This compares favorably to the industry standard, both in terms of the time line in individual countries and the total number of markets to reimbursement agreements. Our rapid reimbursement progress can be attributed to multiple factors: the transformative clinical benefits of the triple combination, the support and collaboration of governments and the CF community and the expertise of our commercial team, built over the course of a decade. 
Importantly, as Reshma mentioned earlier, we are achieving reimbursement for our medicines at levels that recognize their considerable clinical value. The pivotal clinical trial data for TRIKAFTA were unprecedented. And as with all of our primary medicines, we are continuing to track the long-term performance of the triple combination in extension studies of our pivotal trials and in the real world, to be able to fully understand and communicate the long-term benefits of CFTR modulator therapy to all key stakeholders. 
We have previously shown powerful evidence that treatment with KALYDECO, ORKAMBI and SYMDEKO slows lung function decline, results in multisystem benefits and transforms the course of the disease in CF patients. Earlier this month, we have obtained our first long-term follow-up data with the triple combination. In the FF and FMF patient populations treated for at least 96 weeks with TRIKAFTA in the open-label extension of the pivotal clinical trials, we do not see any decline in mean lung function over time. This is a first for any of our CFTR modulators. We look forward to sharing these data in a forthcoming medical forum. 
Although we are pleased with what we have achieved so far, we still have a long way to go to reach all CF patients. As we have previously communicated, we estimate there are 83,000 people living with CF in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia, and approximately 90% of these are likely to benefit from a CFTR modulator. We estimate that there are more than 30,000 patients who could benefit from our current CF medicines who are not yet being treated. Reaching these patients which will drive significant additional revenue growth will be achieved by successfully launching our medicines where we have reimbursement, securing additional new reimbursement agreements and label expansions to younger age groups. And we remain confident we will be able to reach the vast majority of these patients. 
I would now like to provide some perspective on the market opportunities for some of the other medicines in our mid- and late-stage pipeline. Starting with CTX001. With the amendment of our collaboration agreement with CRISPR Therapeutics, Vertex now has taken global leadership for all aspects of the CTX001 program. As a result, we are in a position to leverage Vertex's demonstrate the ability to develop and secure access and reimbursement for transformative medicines. We see tremendous potential for CTX001. We estimate that there are more than 150,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe who have beta thalassemia or sickle cell disease, approximately 32,000 of whom have severe disease. 25,000 are severe sickle cell disease patients, and the vast majority of these are in the U.S. 
We believe that a gene-editing approach, which holds the potential for a onetime curative treatment will be highly valued by patients, physicians and payers. Consistent with our own internal market research, published physician surveys in the U.S. consistently indicate [Audio Gap] would be good candidates for a onetime curative approach using the current conditioning regimen. And with gentler conditioning regimens in the future, we expect CTX001 to be an attractive option for a much larger proportion of the 150,000 beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease patients. 
Our pre-commercial efforts are well underway. There are a number of notable features that are guiding our approach to this market, including: one, patients with severe beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease are symptomatic and have a lifelong history of hospitalizations and other significant cost burdens. We are developing health economic models to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of a functional cure for these patients. Two, new and flexible payment models will be needed for a functional cure for these diseases. We are engaged with payers to understand what models work best for them and for patients. And three, patients are geographically concentrated. For instance, 75% of eligible sickle cell patients in the U.S. live in 15 states. We will use these and other insights to establish a commercial operation that is both lean and highly effective as we have in CF today. 
Let me now turn to pain and share our perspective on the market opportunity for a novel medicine in this area. Acute pain therapies represent 1.8 billion treatment days a year in the U.S. Despite more than 90% of prescriptions being generic, acute pain still represents a $4 billion market, underscoring the opportunity for a novel transformative agent. A new medicine that even takes a portion of the current treatment days has multibillion dollar potential. 
In acute pain, a significant component of the market is opioids. A medicine with high efficacy and without the limitations of opioids, particularly their addictive potential, would be transformative for patients and the health care system. 
With regards to commercialization, treatment is highly concentrated within hospital and postoperative settings. 25% of U.S. hospitals account for 80% of all opioid prescriptions. Given this concentration, successful commercialization will be possible with a small specialist focused commercial model, again, consistent with our lean SG&A approach. 
Finally, Type 1 diabetes. VX-880 has advanced to patient studies. And relatively soon, we will begin to have a view of its clinical profile. We estimate that 60,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe with severe Type 1 diabetes or Type 1 diabetes with prior kidney transplant would be potential candidates for VX-880. In and of itself, the islet cells alone program is a significant market opportunity and existing transplant approaches establish a basis for the high value of a transformative therapy. Beyond VX-880, the cells and device program could address the broader Type 1 diabetes population, 2.6 million patients in the U.S. and Europe. 
In conclusion, it's an exciting time to be at Vertex as we continue to bring our CF medicine, and we still have significant growth ahead in CF with new reimbursement agreements and label expansions to younger age groups. And beyond CF, with each program, having both the potential and presenting a significant commercial opportunity. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Charlie."

Second quarter total product revenues were $1.79 billion, an 18% increase compared to the second quarter of 2020. This growth was primarily driven by strong international uptake of KAFTRIO and continued performance of TRIKAFTA in the U.S. Our second quarter revenues included [Audio Gap] 71% over the prior year, reflecting the full quarter effect of prior initiations in Europe as well as any new patient initiations in countries where patients have access to KAFTRIO. 
Our second quarter combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $537 million compared to $467 million for the second quarter of 2020 [Audio Gap] proof-of-concept data and further clinical and regulatory progress across the pipeline. Our continued growth in revenues, combined with carefully managed growth in spending, translates to a second quarter operating margin of 57%. With our strong revenue and profitability, we ended the quarter with $6.7 billion in cash, following the onetime $900 million payment to CRISPR Therapeutics for the amended collaboration. 
Our strong financial performance to date, the future growth profile in CF and the tremendous potential of our broad and deep pipeline made this the right time for the $1.5 billion stock repurchase authorization that we announced in June. This authorization gives us the opportunity to repurchase stock at very attractive prices as we seek to offset future dilution from equity programs. 
Now to guidance. We are making a significant upward revision to our previously issued 2021 guidance for total product revenues to a range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion. This $500 million increase in our revenue guidance range reflects year-to-date business outperformance as well as the rapid progress we have made in reaching new reimbursement agreements. Year-over-year, this guidance represents nearly 18% growth at the midpoint. 
As is our practice, the guidance only includes revenue for countries that are currently reimbursed. Future reimbursements are not included. We are maintaining our non-GAAP OpEx guidance for the full year 2021 at $2.25 billion to $2.3 billion. Driven by R&D investment, we anticipate that our OpEx in the second half of 2021 will be sequentially greater than in the first half of the year. Specific drivers include the new economic split under the amended CTX001 collaboration advancement of VX-548 to multiple studies in pain and investment to support Type 1 diabetes clinical development. For our non-GAAP tax rate, we continue to guide to a range of 21% to 22% this year. 
Looking to the future, the financial profile of our business is exceptional in many ways. First, we expect to see continued significant top and bottom line growth from our CF franchise into the middle of the decade as we continue to reach more and more patients. Second, our CF revenues are well protected by the triple combinations strong IP, which extends to the late 2030s and which could be further extended with the new next-in-class triple now entering pivotal trials. Third, our differentiated business model and lean SG&A lead to high margins and strong cash flow, which allows for sustained levels of investment into internal and external R&D and continued strong earnings growth. 
And finally, we have a number of multibillion-dollar opportunities advancing in the pipeline, many with near-term milestones, including those in beta cell, sickle cell disease, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, pain, Type 1 diabetes and AAAT, each of which have the potential to drive significant growth beyond CF into the 2030s.

And we are looking for a double-digit reduction in protein are meaningful, and it is correlated with improvements in GFR and the hard endpoints of time to ESRD. 
As with all of our programs, Mike, we have a portfolio approach here. I am excited to see these results.

I do expect that we're going to bring those discussions to a conclusion. in the next coming months. And I do anticipate filing to be possible in the next, let's call it, 18 to 24 months. So that's really what it looks like on CTX001. 
On the Phase III next-in-class CF program, we've gone through our discussions with the regulators. We've had our end of Phase II meetings -- And this trial design that you see reflects those considerations in those discussions. I will point out that as I look at the VX-121 data, there are 3 really important elements that stand out to me. The first is that in our HBE assays, and you know that our HBEF phase translates very well into the clinic, not only qualitatively but quantitatively, singularly or in combination. So 121 on alone or in combination with the TRIKAFTA 56. 1, the results are in our HBEs that 121 is more efficacious, more efficacious than even TRIKAFTA. That's really saying something. 
And in the Phase II results, you can look at the sweat chloride, which is the real direct translation of chloride transport in vitro. And you can see that we're looking at numbers that are more like 45 to 45 millimolar with the 1:1 regimen versus [ 33 to 39 ]. That's what we saw in Phase II with the TRIKAFTA regimen. And then, of course, ppFEV1, which is more variable, but patients for being better than TRIKAFTA.

I'm really excited about our pain program. You know that we have a program in NAV 1.8. That's the 1 that's furthest ahead in our discovery and preclinical research, we also have programs in NaV1.7. 
The reason I'm particularly excited about NaV1.8 is it's a genetically validated target for sure, but it's also pharmacologically validated by our very owned VX-150. The [Audio Gap] 48 really is all the attributes we were looking for in terms of potency as well as in drug-like properties, DDIs manufacturability, et cetera. So this one really looks very exciting to us. It's already in the Banyan running as a Phase II proof-of-concept study. The abdominoplasty is right behind it, and that could start up very shortly. We are also interested in pursuing peripheral neuropathic pain in the area. And the reason for that is because, again, our VX-150 molecule had proof of positive proof-of-concept data not only in acute pain, but also neuro passing pain. So that one is another study [Audio Gap] Very short in duration because it's a procedure like a [indiscernible] 
a reasonably efficient time frame. I expect that the [indiscernible] results will be ready by [Audio Gap], let's say the faster. So that's really how I would encapsulate the pain program.

And maybe the best way to summarize potential to bring that even TRIKAFTA thing, which I think adds a level of convenience for our patients.

It is a non-inferiority study, and that noninferiority is on PPV. You're also correct that the royalties go from low double digits with TRIKAFTA, KAFTRIO to low single digits. 
Let me just take a step back, though, and help maybe everyone on the phone line understand our perspective on the 121 program and why we're really doing this. So our long-standing goals in CF have been threefold: first, bring forward a medicine that can treat up to 90% of patients with cystic fibrosis. Give that a check, that's TRIKAFTA, KAFTRIO. Second, get patients who can benefit from CFTR modulators to the highest levels of efficacy. And the way we've discussed that is to bring patients to carrier levels of sweat chloride. And that's really important because as those levels, when you look at carriers of cystic fibrosis, they really have no [Audio Gap]. And if you look at our own data, other published data, it is absolutely true that the better the sweat chloride results, which is a reflection of CFTR function, the better the outcomes for our patients. And the third big goal has been to get to the last 10% of patients. The 121561-tezacaptav program is all about that big goal number 2, get patients to carrier levels of sweat chloride. And certainly, it is the case that some patients on TRIKAFTA can get there. But we are looking to get many, many more patients to those levels, if not all patients, and that is 121561teza. 
And as I reviewed from what we see in the HPE cells, in terms of chloride transport, sweat chloride from the Phase II studies and even ppFEV1, all these measures point us in the direction that this is possible with 121 561. And of course, we're busy in the labs working on even more efficacious molecules."

Brian, we are going to be conducting the study in the usual countries, U.S., European countries, the standard. Remember, this study, both the studies in the 121 program are compared to to TRIKAFTA, KAFTRIO. So this is not placebo-controlled. So patients are going to be an active therapy in either arm. That obviously makes it a lot easier for patients to enroll. With regard to impact on revenues for TRIKAFTA, no, we don't see any impact on revenues to TRIKAFTA. 
And with regard to how did we select the dose, how did we think about this program. We shared with you the results from the Phase II study. And as is the case with all of our programs, we take all of that data. We do quite a bit of modeling and simulation to settle on the best dose that maximizes efficacy and has the greatest benefit risk profile. I think that's exactly what we've done with regimen that we've selected. And as I mentioned on my response to 1 of the other questions, what I see in these data with the regimen that we're selecting is in vitro chloride transport that is even better than TRIKAFTA. Sweat chloride levels, which is the most approximate translation of chloride transport, so the sweat chloride levels in our Phase II trial that are higher than what we saw with Trip and ppFEV1 which, you know has greater variability, that is also showing us particular potential to be better than TRIKAFTA. 
I have to say what is obvious. TRIKAFTA is a great medicine. What we saw in the clinical trials has been recapitulated in the real world. You heard Stuart talk about the longer-term data with TRIKAFTA that look excellent.  But we think we have something that might be even better than that with 121561 tezacaftor, and I'm really looking forward to the Phase III results."

Let me start with the clinical trials and the enrollment and such. First and foremost, we are on track to have results in this calendar year and the second half of the year. It has been a study that has taken some time to enroll, and I'm not surprised about that. The factors that we need to think about are, remember, this study started right in the midst of the pandemic, actually right when the pandemic was hitting a real high point in terms of case numbers here in the U.S. 
The second is that this is a disease that for which we don't routinely employ genetic testing in renal medicine. So it takes a little bit of time to find the patients, genetically test them and have them enroll in our studies. And the third thing is APOL1-mediated FSGS is the smaller of the spectrum of APOL1-mediated kin disease and the APOL1-mediated FSGS patients because it's a smaller component. They are spread across the U.S., and they don't necessarily live close to a testing center. And so that was particularly difficult in the pandemic. With regard to what we are looking for, we are looking for percent decreases in proteinuria, and I think double-digit decreases in proteinuria, in this Phase II study, which is a first-in-class molecule for this genetically validated target would be just excellent. 
And the question around what is the agency looking for and such? It really depends on the kidney disease of interest. We are looking at a homogeneous kidney disease. It is all genetically defined. And I think that, that falls into a category in and of itself. And as I said, there is no precedent for this. We are the first to bring a targeted therapy for APOL1-mediated kidney disease. But I do think a percent reduction in the double digits would be very meaningful."

And thank you for those. I'm really happy to talk about the Type 1 diabetes programs. I'm sure you can hear from the enthusiasm in my voice, it's one of the ones that is really holds enormous potential for patients. 
So let's just start at the very top of the funnel. There are more than 2 million patients, 2 million patients with Type 1 diabetes in the U.S. and Europe. So the potential to help patients is enormous when you look at it from that perspective. I'll take your second question first about encapsulation. I do think that it will be important to have the cells being capsulated in a device or in some way, be immune-invasive so that you don't require immunosuppressives to be able to get to all of those patients. I think that the device approach is elegant because it has the benefit of simplicity. That's not to say that it's a simple device, but it is to say that the cells encapsulated with this device then don't require any further manipulation, which is elegant. That all being said, we are very interested in all other approaches, and we are pursuing other approaches to immunoevasion. The lead approach is with the cells encapsulated in the device. 
With regard to the cadaveric cells and the cells that are available currently, the big differentiator, and this is really important to understand because it's fundamental. Those cells are cadaveric cells. And those cadaveric cells have all of the limitations that have made the procedure difficult for patients to undergo. That is to say quality and quantity of cells are limited. Our approach are as a stem cell derived using islet cells. And that makes quantity not an issue and quality is not an issue. And so that's really the foundational difference between our approach and the other."

As we reach the halfway point in 2021, our business is performing exceptionally well and is very well positioned for the future. Our CF franchise is strong and growing. During the second quarter, we reached a number of new reimbursemen",1165,"Thank you, Michael. As we reach the halfway point in 2021, our business is performing exceptionally well and is very well positioned for the future. Our CF franchise is strong and growing. During the second quarter, we reached a number of new reimbursement agreements for the triple combination as well as other CFTR modulators in our portfolio, including major markets like France and Italy, earlier than expected. These reimbursement agreements are occurring in a time frame that is far quicker than is typical for OUS markets and importantly, we are achieving reimbursements at levels which are robust and reflect the value of our CF medicines.  
We also secured regulatory approval for the triple combination in the 6 to 11 age for the U.S. Taken together, these additional reimbursement agreements and regulatory approvals provide thousands of new patients with access to our medicines. As such, we are raising our 2021 guidance range by $500 million to a range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion, reflecting 18% year-on-year growth at the midpoint of the range. But our work in CF is not done. There are still more than 30,000 people with CF who are yet to be treated. And by reaching these patients, we see continued significant growth for the CF business.  
With regard to the pipeline, progress is accelerating across the portfolio. We now expect to achieve target enrollment in both CTX001 studies in Q3. We have initiated the VX-548 Phase II program in acute pain. We are on track to begin the Phase III of next-in-class triple combination program in CF shortly. And in the next 6 to 9 months, we expect important data readouts from multiple clinical stage programs, including VX-147 in APOL1-mediated FSGS, VX-548 in acute pain and VX-880 in type 1 diabetes.  
I'll now review the key clinical stage programs in more detail. Starting with CF. We are relentless in our efforts to maximize the benefit we can deliver for patients. TRIKAFTA sets the very high bar, and we recognize that any new medicine that aims to treat the 90% of people with CF with at least 1 F508del, including our own medicines, has to show clear potential to improve on TRIKAFTA. We announced earlier this week that the once a day next-in-class triple combination VX-121, tezacaftor, VX-561 is advancing to Phase III. We believe it holds the potential for greater efficacy and convenience for patients. It also has the benefit of enhanced economics for our business based on the fact that the royalty obligation would decrease from low double digits to low single digits.  
We are also committed to developing therapies for the approximately 10% of patients who cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. Our lead program in partnership with Moderna uses an mRNA-based approach and continues to make progress in late preclinical development.  
Let me now turn to our non-CF clinical pipeline which includes 5 mid- to late-stage programs using 3 different therapeutic modalities, including small molecules, cell and genetic therapies. The most advanced program in the pipeline is CTX001, our gene editing therapy, which represents a potential onetime functional cure for patients with beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease. This program continues to have strong momentum and impressive results. 
We've shared new data at EHA last month involving 22 patients who were treated with CTX001 and had at least 3 months of follow-up. In this data set, all beta thalassemia patients, including beta 0 patients who have the most severe form of the disease were transfusion independent. And all sickle cell patients were free of pain crises following CTX001 therapy. We now have dosed more than 45 patients across the program and are on track to achieve target enrollment in both CTX001 studies in the third quarter. We are working with regulators to finalize the filing package for CTX001 and anticipate filing for approval in the next 18 to 24 months.  
Moving to VX-147. VX-147 is our lead molecule for the treatment of APOL1-mediated kidney disease, and we anticipate clinical data from our Phase II proof-of-concept study in APOL1-mediated FSGS in the second half of 2021. The VX-147 Phase II study evaluates the safety and the reduction of proteinuria over the course of 13 weeks. The achievement of double digit decreases in proteinuria with this molecule would be a significant risk-lowering milestone for the program as this will establish APOL1 inhibition as a promising new mechanism that can be applied to the approximately 100,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe who have APOL1-mediated nondiabetic proteinuric kidney diseases.  
Consistent with the portfolio approach we take with every pipeline program, we have multiple molecules in development behind VX-147 targeting the APOL1 pathway.  
Turning to the NaV1.8 program. As announced last week, the Phase II trial in acute pain following bunionectomy surgery with our selective NaV1.8 inhibitor, VX-548, is underway, and data are expected by early 2022. NaV1.8 is both generally and pharmacologically validated with our previous molecule VX-150, demonstrating positive proof-of-concept in acute neuroplastic and musculoskeletal pain. VX-548 is more potent than our prior molecules, which allows us to use lower doses and also more fully explore the dose response curve.  
We expect to move faster with VX-548 by conducting multiple clinical studies in parallel. Indeed, we are starting a second Phase II acute pain study following abdominoplasty in the coming weeks. The potential to serve patients suffering from acute pain is substantial, and Stuart will share additional perspective on the market opportunity in his remarks.  
Moving on to type 1 diabetes, the Phase I/II study with VX-880, our islet cells-alone approach is underway, and the first patient has been dosed. Ours is the only approach to use stem cell-derived fully differentiated insulin-producing islet cells, distinguishing it from all other therapies in clinical development today. Similar to CTX001, we anticipate that proof of concept for VX-880 may be established with relatively small numbers of patients over a reasonably efficient time frame. We expect initial data from the study in 2022. 
Our optimism for this program and for the ability of VX-880 to demonstrate clinical benefit comes from the cadaveric islet cell transplantation experience, which has already provided a precedent for transformational outcome. Beyond VX-880, our cell plus device program is continuing to progress in late preclinical development. 
Finally, in AATD. As we shared with you in June, the VX-864 Phase II clinical data showed clear evidence of biological activity, though the magnitude of clinical effect did not support its progression to pivotal studies. Based on these data, we remain confident in and committed to AATD and to our small molecule corrector approach. This is the only approach that targets the underlying cause of AATD and therefore, holds the potential to treat both the lung and liver manifestations of disease. We expect that our next wave of molecules will advance into the clinic in 2022, and that we will be a more rapidly through clinical development with the insights we have gained from the VX-864 trial.  
I'll now hand it off to Stuart."
36235,1674312267,2357192,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Reshma. I'll begin by reviewing the Q2 revenue performance of our CF medicines. Our Q2 global revenues reached nearly $1.8 billion, driven by increasing revenues outside the U.S. as a result of the launch of KAFTRIO and continued strong perform",1244,"Thank you, Reshma. I'll begin by reviewing the Q2 revenue performance of our CF medicines. Our Q2 global revenues reached nearly $1.8 billion, driven by increasing revenues outside the U.S. as a result of the launch of KAFTRIO and continued strong performance in the U.S. In the U.S., the launch of TRIKAFTA in ages 12-plus has been highly successful. And just under 2 years since regulatory approval, the vast majority of eligible patients have initiated treatment.  
We have continued to see very high persistence and compliance levels, and we're now focused on the ongoing launch of TRIKAFTA in children ages 6 to 11 in the U.S., following the approval in June. Outside the U.S., we have made significant progress with reimbursement for our medicines. We now have reimbursed access for KAFTRIO in more than 15 countries outside the U.S., less than 1 year following EMA approval. This compares favorably to the industry standard, both in terms of the time line in individual countries and the total number of markets to reimbursement agreements. 
Our rapid reimbursement progress can be attributed to multiple factors: the transformative clinical benefits of the triple combination, the support and collaboration of governments and the CF community and the expertise of our commercial team, built over the course of a decade.  
Importantly, as Reshma mentioned earlier, we are achieving reimbursement for our medicines at levels that recognize their considerable clinical value. The pivotal clinical trial data for TRIKAFTA were unprecedented. And as with all of our prior medicines, we are continuing to track the long-term performance of the triple combination in extension studies of our pivotal trials and in the real world, to be able to fully understand and communicate the long-term benefits of CFTR modulator therapy to all key stakeholders.  
We have previously shown powerful evidence that treatment with KALYDECO, ORKAMBI and SYMDEKO slows lung function decline, results in multisystem benefits and transforms the course of the disease in CF patients. Earlier this month, we have obtained our first long-term follow-up data with the triple combination. In the FF and FMF patient populations treated for at least 96 weeks with TRIKAFTA in the open-label extension of the pivotal clinical trials, we do not see any decline in mean lung function over time. This is a first for any of our CFTR modulators. We look forward to sharing these data in a forthcoming medical forum.  
Although we are pleased with what we have achieved so far, we still have a long way to go to reach all CF patients. As we have previously communicated, we estimate there are 83,000 people living with CF in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia, and approximately 90% of these are likely to benefit from a CFTR modulator. We estimate that there are more than 30,000 patients who could benefit from our current CF medicines who are not yet being treated. 
Reaching these patients, which will drive significant additional revenue growth, will be achieved by successfully launching our medicines where we have reimbursement, securing additional new reimbursement agreements and label expansions to younger age groups, and we remain confident we will be able to reach the vast majority of these patients.  
I would now like to provide some perspective on the market opportunities for some of the other medicines in our mid- and late-stage pipeline. Starting with CTX001. With the amendment of our collaboration agreement with CRISPR Therapeutics, Vertex now has taken global leadership for all aspects of the CTX001 program. As a result, we are in a position to leverage Vertex's demonstrate the ability to develop and secure access and reimbursement for transformative medicines. 
We see tremendous potential for CTX001. We estimate that there are more than 150,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe who have beta thalassemia or sickle cell disease, approximately 32,000 of whom have severe disease. 25,000 are severe sickle cell disease patients, and the vast majority of these are in the U.S.  
We believe that a gene-editing approach, which holds the potential for a onetime curative treatment will be highly valued by patients, physicians and payers. Consistent with our own internal market research, published physician surveys in the U.S. consistently indicate that they expect 1/4 to 3/4 of the sickle cell disease patients would be good candidates for a onetime curative approach using the current conditioning regimen, which is in line with the estimates of the numbers of severe patients. And with gentler conditioning regimens in the future, we expect CTX001 to be an attractive option for a much larger proportion of the 150,000 beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease patients.  
Our pre-commercial efforts are well underway. There are a number of notable features that are guiding our approach to this market, including: one, patients with severe beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease are symptomatic and have a lifelong history of hospitalizations and other significant cost burdens. We are developing health economic models to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of a functional cure for these patients. Two, new and flexible payment models will be needed for a functional cure for these diseases. We are engaged with payers to understand what models work best for them and for patients. And three, patients are geographically concentrated. For instance, 75% of eligible sickle cell patients in the U.S. live in 15 states. 
We will use these and other insights to establish a commercial operation that is both lean and highly effective as we have in CF today.  
Let me now turn to pain and share our perspective on the market opportunity for a novel medicine in this area. Acute pain therapies represent 1.8 billion treatment days a year in the U.S. Despite more than 90% of prescriptions being generic, acute pain still represents a $4 billion market, underscoring the opportunity for a novel transformative agent. A new medicine that even takes a portion of the current treatment days has multibillion dollar potential.  
In acute pain, a significant component of the market is opioids. A medicine with high efficacy and without the limitations of opioids, particularly their addictive potential, would be transformative for patients and the health care system.  
With regards to commercialization, treatment is highly concentrated within hospital and postoperative settings. 25% of U.S. hospitals account for 80% of all opioid prescriptions. Given this concentration, successful commercialization will be possible with a small specialist focused commercial model, again, consistent with our lean SG&A approach.  
Finally, type 1 diabetes. VX-880 has advanced to patient studies. And relatively soon, we will begin to have a view of its clinical profile. We estimate that 60,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe with severe type 1 diabetes or type 1 diabetes with prior kidney transplant would be potential candidates for VX-880. In and of itself, the islet cells alone program is a significant market opportunity, and existing transplant approaches establish a basis for the high value of a transformative therapy. Beyond VX-880, the cells and device program could address the broader type 1 diabetes population, 2.6 million patients in the U.S. and Europe.  
In conclusion, it's an exciting time to be at Vertex as we continue to bring our CF medicine to more patients, and we still have significant growth ahead in CF with new reimbursement agreements and label expansions to younger age groups. And beyond CF, mid and late-stage pipeline is rapidly advancing with each program, having both the potential to transform lives and presenting a significant commercial opportunity.  
And with that, I'll hand it over to Charlie."

In the second quarter of 2021, Vertex, again continued its record of outstanding financial performance. In fact, we're in the midst of our eighth consecutive year of at least double-digit revenue growth. Second quarter total product revenu",653,"Thanks, Stuart. In the second quarter of 2021, Vertex, again continued its record of outstanding financial performance. In fact, we're in the midst of our eighth consecutive year of at least double-digit revenue growth. Second quarter total product revenues were $1.79 billion, an 18% increase compared to the second quarter of 2020. This growth was primarily driven by strong international uptake of KAFTRIO and continued performance of TRIKAFTA in the U.S. 
Our second quarter revenues included $1.26 billion in the U.S. and $536 million outside the U.S. Ex U.S. revenues for the quarter grew 71% over the prior year, reflecting the full quarter effect of prior initiations in Europe as well as any new patient initiations in countries where patients have access to KAFTRIO.  
Our second quarter combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $537 million compared to $467 million for the second quarter of 2020, driven largely by investment in our clinical stage programs and our research pipeline. As our pipeline continues to expand and mature, we expect our R&D investments will continue to be substantial while we drive toward proof-of-concept data and further clinical and regulatory progress across the pipeline. 
Our continued growth in revenues, combined with carefully managed growth in spending translates to a second quarter operating margin of 57%. With our strong revenue and profitability, we ended the quarter with $6.7 billion in cash, following the onetime $900 million payment to CRISPR Therapeutics for the amended collaboration.  
Our strong financial performance to date, the future growth profile in CF and the tremendous potential of our broad and deep pipeline made this the right time for the $1.5 billion stock repurchase authorization that we announced in June. This authorization gives us the opportunity to repurchase stock at very attractive prices as we seek to offset future dilution from equity programs. 
Now to guidance. We are making a significant upward revision to our previously issued 2021 guidance for total product revenues to a range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion. This $500 million increase in our revenue guidance range reflects year-to-date business outperformance as well as the rapid progress we have made in reaching new reimbursement agreements. Year-over-year, this guidance represents nearly 18% growth at the midpoint. As is our practice, the guidance only includes revenue for countries that are currently reimbursed. Future new reimbursements are not included. 
We are maintaining our non-GAAP OpEx guidance for the full year 2021 at $2.25 billion to $2.3 billion. Driven by R&D investment, we anticipate that our OpEx in the second half of 2021 will be sequentially greater than in the first half of the year. Specific drivers include the new economic split under the amended CTX001 collaboration, advancement of VX-548 to multiple studies in pain and investment to support type 1 diabetes clinical development.  
For our non-GAAP tax rate, we continue to guide to a range of 21% to 22% this year.  
Looking to the future, the financial profile of our business is exceptional in many ways. First, we expect to see continued significant top and bottom line growth from our CF franchise into the middle of the decade as we continue to reach more and more patients. Second, our CF revenues are well protected by the triple combinations strong IP, which extends to the late 2030s and which could be further extended with the new next-in-class triple now entering pivotal trials. Third, our differentiated business model and lean SG&A lead to high margins and strong cash flow, which allows for sustained levels of investment into internal and external R&D and continued strong earnings growth.  
And finally, we have a number of multibillion-dollar opportunities advancing in the pipeline, many with near-term milestones, including those in beta thal, sickle cell disease, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, pain, type 1 diabetes and AAT, each of which have the potential to drive significant growth beyond CF into the 2030s.  
With that, I'll turn it back to Reshma to close."

For the others on the phone, this is the APOL1-mediated FSGS program that is currently in Phase II, and we are on track to read out the Phase II results in the second half of this year. The way I see this program, Mike, and what we're really looking for is safety for sure. It's a Phase II program. And on the efficacy side, you're right, it is about percent reduction in proteinuria. And we are looking for a double-digit reduction in proteinuria because at those levels, it's meaningful and it is correlated with improvements in GFR and the hard endpoints of time to ESRD. 
As with all of our programs, Mike, we have a portfolio approach here. I am excited to see these results. The community physicians as well as patient groups and the regulators, particularly in the U.S., have had multiple workshops and conferences over the last several years. And the regulators have expressed openness for proteinuria to be the regulatory enabling endpoint. Now whether that's an accelerated approval, whether that's a full approval, all of that obviously will need to be discussed as we progressed the program and have those discussions with the regulators. But I've been really pleased with how the regulators have thought about it and the fact that this is indeed a genetically defined renal disease. And what the regulators have often talked about is a homogeneous proteinuric kidney disease and that is what this is. So I feel optimism for proteinuria to be the regulatory enabling end point. And obviously, that makes a more efficient trial."

As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are now looking to achieve completion of target enrollment in Q3. So that's really a very near-term completion of the target enrollment. So what we're looking at now and I've described it before as we've had these conversations with regulators and we do have the benefit of really virtually every regulatory designation one can image. So we've had the opportunity to have productive discussions with the agency. It's about the size of the filing package, it's about the duration of follow-up and the CMC manufacturing controls, I'd like to say. Achievement enrollment is really short term, so it's about the duration of follow-up in CMC manufacturing. 
I do expect that we're going to bring those discussions to a conclusion in the next coming months. And I do anticipate filing to be possible in the next, let's call it, 18 to 24 months. So that's really what it looks like on CTX001. 
On the Phase III next-in-class CF program, we've gone through our discussions with the regulators. We've had our end of Phase II meetings, and this trial design that you see reflects those considerations in those discussions. 
I will point out that as I look at the VX-121 data, there are 3 really important elements that stand out to me. The first is that in our HBE assays, and you know that our HBE assays translates very well into the clinic, not only qualitatively but quantitatively, singularly or in combination. So 121 alone or in combination with TRIKAFTA 561, the results are -- in our HBEs that 121 is more efficacious, more efficacious than even TRIKAFTA. That's really saying something. 
And in the Phase II results, you can look at the sweat chloride, which is the real direct translation of chloride transport in vitro. And you can see that we're looking at numbers that are more like 45 to 45 millimolar with the 121 regimen versus 33 to 39. That's what we saw in Phase II with the TRIKAFTA regimen. And then, of course, ppFEV1, which is more variable, but even that has indications for being better than TRIKAFTA. So while the primary endpoint is noninferiority, I see a lot of optimism in these data to even have the potential to be better than TRIKAFTA."

So as you know, we updated our estimates of the epidemiology for people living with CF in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia earlier this year, it's approximately 83,000 patients. And we're probably treating about half of those patients today. And as you know, we updated our guidance today to a range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion. What that means is and I don't want to gloss over this is that there is more than 30,000 patients remain eligible for our CFTR modulators, they are likely to benefit from our existing CFTR modulators. And those 30,000 patients really pull into 3 categories. The first one is people who live in countries where we have regulatory approval and we've secured reimbursement and we are beginning the launches in those markets. And as you know, the launches of our CF medicines tend to be a very rapid. 
The second group of patients are those who live in countries where we have regulatory approval, but don't yet have reimbursement. Obviously we've had a great year securing reimbursement for KAFTRIO just a year -- just under a year from EMA approval, and I have full confidence that we're going to continue that run and secure additional reimbursement agreements in countries where we don't have it today. 
And then we have to get down into the younger patients. And as you know, we've done that with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. And given the benefit risk profile of TRIKAFTA, we fully expect we'll be able to get down to younger age groups. So over the next several years, we see multibillion dollar revenue growth potential through getting to those more than 30,000 patients. 
Additionally, we are also working on the 7% to 10% of patients who aren't going to be eligible for our CFTR modulators, using genetic approaches through our collaborations with amongst others at Moderna. So we do see continued growth of our CF franchise for several years to come based on continuing to execute in the way that we have done over the last few years. 
And then to tell you how the pipeline is going to layer on top of that, I'll hand it back to Reshma."

And when I think about 147, that is absolutely on track to have results in the second half of this year.

And that's not even talking about the programs that are in late preclinical development or in Phase I. 
So we are investing heavily in our pipeline. It is because the pipeline is accelerating, and there are many opportunities for us to get to the next important milestones in clinical development. I would be remiss if I didn't say a word about VX-880. This is the naked cells-only approach. This one is a Phase I/II trial.

In terms of the mRNA program, you know that we have multiple programs for the last 10% of our CF patients, the most advanced of which is the mRNA program in partnership with Moderna. There's really 2 components here. It's the mRNA construct itself and it's also delivery. We have made solid progress on both of those. And I would say the important one is on delivery. A little too early for me to give you timing for when that would enter the clinic. But I will say that the progress has been very good.

Sure thing, Robyn. Let me start with pain. I'm really excited about our pain program. You know that we have a program in NaV1.8, that's the one that's furthest ahead. In our discovery and preclinical research, we also have programs in NaV1.7. The rea",355,"Yes. Sure thing, Robyn. Let me start with pain. I'm really excited about our pain program. You know that we have a program in NaV1.8, that's the one that's furthest ahead. In our discovery and preclinical research, we also have programs in NaV1.7. The reason I'm particularly excited about NaV1.8 is it's a genetically validated target for sure, but it's also pharmacologically validated by our very own VX-150. The molecule that's in the clinic now, VX-548, really is all the attributes we were looking for in terms of potency as well as in drug like properties, DDIs, manufacturability, et cetera. 
So this one really looks very exciting to us. It's already in the bunionectomy study that is up and running as a Phase II proof-of-concept study. The abdominoplasty is right behind it, and that should start-up very shortly. We are also interested in pursuing peripheral neuropathic pain in the NaV1.8 area. And the reason for that is because, again, our VX-150 molecule had proof of -- positive proof-of-concept data, not only in acute pain, but also in neuropathic pain. So that one is another study that's coming. 
With regard to acute pain, the studies are very short in duration because it's a procedure like a bunionectomy, you have treatment that is over a couple of days. And so the results can be obtained in a reasonably efficient time frame. I expect that the bunionectomy results will be ready by, let's say, the tail end of this year, beginning part of next year, abdominoplasty results thereafter. So that's really how I would encapsulate the pain program. 
With regard to the Galapagos data, maybe Galapagos AbbVie data, Robyn, I'd rather focus on our portfolio and tell you about how I see our portfolio. And maybe the best way to summarize it is VX-121, 561 tezacaftor holds the potential to bring greater patient benefit than even TRIKAFTA a once daily dosing, which I think adds a level of convenience for our patients. And in all honesty, the greatest threat to TRIKAFTA, the greatest competitor to TRIKAFTA in terms of the most advanced is our very owned VX-121,561 tezacaftor."

For the regulatory enabling end point, it is a noninferiority study, and that noninferiority is on ppFEV1. 
You're also correct that the royalties go from low double digits with TRIKAFTA, KAFTRIO to low single digits. 
Let me just take a step back, though, and help maybe everyone on the phone line to understand our perspective on the 121 program and why we're really doing this. So our long-standing goals in CF have been threefold. First, bring forward a medicine that can treat up to 90% of patients with cystic fibrosis. Give that a check, that's TRIKAFTA, KAFTRIO. 
Second, get patients who can benefit from CFTR modulators with the highest levels of efficacy. And the way we've discussed that is to bring patients to carrier levels of sweat chloride. And that's really important because as those levels, when you look at carriers of cystic fibrosis, they really have no manifestation of disease. And when you look at our own data, other published data, it is absolutely true that the better the sweat chloride results, which is a reflection of CFTR function, the better the outcomes for our patients. 
And the third big goal has been to get to the last 10% of patients. The 121, 561 tezacaftor program is all about that big goal number 2, get patients to carrier levels of sweat chloride. And certainly, it is the case that some patients on TRIKAFTA can get there. But we are looking to get many, many more patients to those levels, if not all patients, and that is 121, 561 teza. 
And as I reviewed from what we see in the HPE cells, in terms of chloride transport, sweat chloride from the Phase II studies and even ppFEV1, all these measures point us in the direction that this is possible with 121, 561. And of course, we're busy in the labs working on even more efficacious molecules."

That obviously makes it a lot easier for patients to enroll into this study. 
With regard to impact on revenues for TRIKAFTA, no, we don't see any impact on revenues to TRIKAFTA. 
And with regard to how did we select the dose, how did we think about this program. We shared with you the results from the Phase II study. And as is the case with all of our programs, we take all of that data. We do quite a bit of modeling and simulation to settle on the best dose that maximizes efficacy and has the greatest benefit risk profile. 
I think that's exactly what we've done with regimen that we've selected. And as I mentioned on my response to one of the other questions, what I see in these data with the regimen that we're selecting is in vitro chloride transport that is even better than TRIKAFTA. Sweat chloride levels, which is the most approximate translation of chloride transport, so the sweat chloride levels in our Phase II trial that are higher than what we saw with TRIKAFTA, and ppFEV1 which, you know has greater variability, that is also showing us particular potential to be better than TRIKAFTA. 
I have to say what is obvious. TRIKAFTA is a great medicine. What we saw in the clinical trials has been recapitulated in the real world. You heard Stuart talk about the longer-term data with TRIKAFTA that just continues to look excellent. But we think we have something that might be even better than that with 121, 561 tezacaftor, and I'm really looking forward to the Phase III results."

Let me start with the clinical trials and the enrollment and such. First and foremost, we are on track to have results in this calendar year, in the second half of the year. It has been a study that has taken some time to enroll, and I'm not surprised about that. The factors that we need to think about are, remember, this study started right in the midst of the pandemic, actually right when the pandemic was hitting a real high point in terms of case numbers here in the U.S. 
The second is that this is a disease that for which we don't routinely employ genetic testing in renal medicine. So it takes a little bit of time to find the patients, genetically test them and have them enroll in our studies. 
And the third thing is APOL1-mediated FSGS is the smaller of the spectrum of APOL1-mediated kidney disease. And the APOL1-mediated FSGS patients, because it's a smaller component, they are spread across the U.S., and they don't necessarily live close to a testing center. And so that was particularly difficult in the pandemic. 
With regard to what we are looking for, we are looking for percent decreases in proteinuria, and I think double-digit decreases in proteinuria, in this Phase II study, which is a first-in-class molecule for this genetically validated target, would be just excellent. 
And the question around what is the agency looking for and such. It really depends on the kidney disease of interest. We are looking at a homogeneous kidney disease. It is all genetically defined. And I think that, that falls into a category in and of itself. And as I said, there is no precedent for this. We are the first to bring a targeted therapy for APOL1-mediated kidney disease. But I do think a percent reduction in the double digits would be very meaningful."

And thank you for those. I'm really happy to talk about the Type 1 diabetes programs. I'm sure you can hear from the enthusiasm in my voice, it's one of the ones that is -- really holds enormous potential for patients. 
So let's just start at the very top of the funnel. There are more than 2 million patients, 2 million patients with Type 1 diabetes in the U.S. and Europe. So the potential to help patients is enormous when you look at it from that perspective. 
I'll take your second question first about encapsulation. I do think that it will be important to have the cells being capsulated in a device or in some way, be immune-evasive so that you don't require immunosuppressives to be able to get to all of those patients. 
I think that the device approach is elegant because it has the benefit of simplicity. That's not to say that it's a simple device, but it is to say that the cells encapsulated with this device then don't require any further manipulation, which is elegant. 
That all being said, we are very interested in all other approaches, and we are pursuing other approaches to immunoevasion. The lead approach is with the cells encapsulated in the device. 
With regard to the cadaveric cells and the cells that are available currently, the big differentiator, and this is really important to understand because it's fundamental. Those cells are cadaveric cells. And those cadaveric cells have all of the limitations that have made the procedure difficult for patients to undergo. That is to say quality and quantity of cells are limited. Our approach are as a stem cell-derived, full-differentiated, insulin-producing islet cells. And that makes quantity not an issue and quality not an issue. And so that's really the foundational difference between our approach and the other."

I'm very pleased to be here with you tonight to discuss Vertex's progress through the first 3 quarters of 2021. During this year, we've meaningfully increased our leadership in cystic fibrosis, both with our approved CFTR modulators and with the CF programs advancing in our pipeline. We've expanded and accelerated our R&D pipeline beyond CF, and these programs are now delivering clinical results. We have continued to demonstrate exceptional financial performance with significant growth in revenue, high operating margins and increasing cash flow. Let me elaborate more on each of these 3 points. 
Starting with CF, from a commercial perspective, third quarter product revenues were $1.98 billion, representing almost 30% growth year-over-year. This growth was driven by the performance of TRIKAFTA in the U.S., including the launch in children ages 6 to 11, and strong uptake OUS, where KAFTRIO has been reimbursed, including most recently in France and Italy. Based on the strong performance, we are again increasing our revenue guidance and now expect total product revenues for 2021 to be between $7.4 billion and $7.5 billion. As we look forward, we expect that our CF business will continue to show robust growth in the years ahead as there are approximately 30,000 CF patients yet to be treated with our CFTR modulators. 
We've made important progress with our CF R&D pipeline programs this year as well. Based on strong preclinical and clinical results from our next-in-class triple combination regimen of VX-121, tezacaftor and VX-561 that demonstrate the potential for superior benefit to existing CFTR modulators, we've accelerated this program into pivotal studies. Both of the Phase III studies are head-to-head trials versus TRIKAFTA. Both studies are up and running and enrolling patients. And we are not stopping there. We have identified even more promising regimens in our labs, building on 20 years of success translating our proprietary insights in CF biology into groundbreaking medicines. We are confident that these regimens will allow us to reach our long-standing goal of bringing CF patients to carrier levels of sweat chloride. 
For the approximately 10% of people with CF who cannot benefit from a CFTR modulator, we're working on genetic therapies, including an mRNA approach. We and our partner, Moderna, have for some time now been able to synthesize mRNA constructs that restore CFTR protein function in vitro. The biggest challenge for us and for everyone in the field has been delivery of the mRNA to the target cells. I am very pleased to report that we and Moderna have made a significant breakthrough in delivery this past year. We have now demonstrated that we can efficiently deliver full-length CFTR mRNA to human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro to provide high levels of CFTR function and in vivo through the delivery of nebulized lipid nanoparticles to the bronchial epithelial cells in nonhuman primates. 
Based on these results, IND-enabling studies for our CFTR mRNA therapy are already underway, and we plan to file an IND and start clinical development in 2022. To close CF, I will note that just a few months from now, we will mark the 10th anniversary of the first approval of KALYDECO, our first CFTR modulator. And last month, marked 2 years since the U.S. approval for TRIKAFTA. For the Phase III clinical trials, our CF medicines have always been appreciated for their outstanding short-term benefits, not just significant increase in ppFEV1, but decreases in pulmonary exacerbations, increases in weight and increases in quality of life. We're now in a position where we have tens of thousands of patient years of safety data, and we could appreciate more fully the breadth of clinical benefit with analysis of longer-term real-world data. 
What we find truly remarkable is that with KALYDECO, we now have database on an average of 6 years of follow-up in patients 6 years and older and that includes a 78% reduction in the mortality rate and an 89% reduction in the rate of lung transplantation compared to patients who are not eligible for treatment. With TRIKAFTA, we now have data showing no decline in lung function after 2 years of follow-up from the pivotal trials. And this is a first for any CF medicine. I'd like to emphasize that from our perspective, it is these kinds of long-term data that ultimately determine physician and patient choice of regimens, particularly in CF where patients take CFTR modulators chronically over a lifetime. 
Let me turn to our pipeline outside of CF. First, to our type 1 diabetes programs and the unprecedented clinical data we recently shared. The pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes is well known. It results from the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet cells. Daily injections of insulin have saved the lives of these patients, but patients still suffer from severe long-term vascular complications of the disease, resulting in premature mortality. And unfortunately, the treatment itself can lead to severe hypoglycemic episodes that can be associated with unresponsiveness, seizures and even death. Therefore, the holy grail for type 1 diabetes for decades has been to replace the damaged pancreatic islet cells and restore insulin production. Early clinical space using cadaveric islets have demonstrated the curative potential of this approach. The problem has been produced sufficient quality and quantity of islet cells to treat the millions of people with this disease. 
Vertex has developed a proprietary process to make industrial quantities of allogeneic, stem cell-derived, fully differentiated islet cells that could serve the more than 25 million patients with type 1 diabetes. The clinical data from this first patient treated in our VX-880 program with these cells are truly remarkable with a single infusion at half the target dose combined with standard immunosuppression, routinely used in transplantation, we observed substantial improvements across multiple measures of islet cell function that were rapid, robust and durable through day 90. 
Our stem cell-derived islets produce basal levels of insulin and increased insulin secretion appropriately in response to glucose stimulation. And in the 90 days following infusion, there was a significant reduction in blood glucose as measured by hemoglobin A1C despite a 91% reduction in exogenous insulin requirements. On the safety side, VX-880 was generally well tolerated. These cells are the product. They are the common denominator across our type 1 diabetes programs and these will derisk each of our 3 programs. 
In the cells alone program, we use standard pharmacologic immunosuppressives. In the next program, we're using our proprietary device for immunoprotection of these cells. The IND-enabling studies for this program are already underway, and we plan to file the IND in 2022. And these same cells are the starting product for our gene-editing program designed to produce hypoimmune islet cells that can evade the immune system. 
In cell and gene therapies, it is clear that the curative potential of these approaches is very high, and therefore, these therapeutics have potentially rapid path to registration involving a reasonable number of patients and a reasonable amount of follow-up. It is with this in mind that we're working with urgency on the VX-880 program. 
Moving on to CTX001. CTX001 is our nonviral ex vivo gene-editing therapy that is designed as a onetime curative approach for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. It also stands out as a clear example of how we have accelerated our pipeline in 2021. CTX001 is our most advanced program outside of CF and continues to have strong momentum. We've now fully enrolled the target number of patients in both the sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia clinical studies. Based on the clinical data we've presented to date, physician and patient interest in these trials has been high, and we have additional patients beyond the target 45 in each trial who are now completing eligibility assessments and will be enrolled this month. We anticipate closing out our regulatory discussions in the near term and submitting regulatory filings for approval of CTX001 by year-end 2022 based on these clinical results. We have high confidence that CTX001 will be our next launched medicine. Stuart will comment on the progress of our commercial preparedness in his remarks. 
On to VX-147 and where we will have results from the Phase II proof-of-concept study this quarter. This Phase II study of VX-147 is fully enrolled and focuses on patients with the form of FSGS that is mediated by APOL1. Our goal is to establish APOL1 inhibition as a new mechanism that can be used more broadly beyond FSGS, and in APOL1-mediated nondiabetic proteinuric kidney disease. Based on the human genetics, the strongly validated target and the performance of VX-147 across a number of in vitro and in vivo assays we see our APOL1-mediated kidney disease or AMKD program as having a high probability of success. Some of the preclinical data from this program are the subject of a presentation at the American Society of Nephrology Meeting taking place later this week. 
In this Phase II study, we're assessing the safety of VX-147, and the key efficacy marker is reduction of proteinuria. Proteinuria is the clinically relevant endpoint and one that regulators have expressed openness to accepting in a homogeneous proteinuric kidney disease population. If our Phase II study in APOL1-mediated FSGS is successful, it would represent a first-in-class demonstration of proof-of-concept for an APOL1-mediated kidney disease and would propel us into pivotal development in the AMKD population, which includes, but is not limited to FSGS. In total, this represents approximately 100,000 people with AKD. 
I'll conclude the pipeline discussion with a few words on our pain program. We have high confidence in the NaV1.8 target for 3 main reasons. One, NaV1.8 is genetically validated. Two, NaV1.8 is also pharmacologically validated with our very own 3 positive Phase II proof-of-concept studies in acute, neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. And third, our lead molecule in the program, VX-548, has the key drug-like properties that we are looking for, including high selectivity and potency. The 2 Phase II dose-ranging studies in acute pain, [ bienectomy ] and abdominoplasty with VX-548 are well underway. Based on enrollment progress, we currently expect data from these studies in Q1 of 2022. With that, I'll now turn it over to Stuart to review the commercial progress."

I'll begin by reviewing the Q3 revenue performance of our CF medicines, which reached nearly $2 billion in Q3. U.S. revenues were $1.38 billion, an increase of 13% compared to the prior year, driven by the performance of TRIKAFTA, includin",1232,"Thanks, Reshma. I'll begin by reviewing the Q3 revenue performance of our CF medicines, which reached nearly $2 billion in Q3. U.S. revenues were $1.38 billion, an increase of 13% compared to the prior year, driven by the performance of TRIKAFTA, including the launch in the 6- to 11-year-old population. The launch in the 6- to 11-year olds is progressing rapidly, which is not surprising given the profile of the medicine and the recognition of the importance of early treatment of this relentlessly progressive disease. Outside the U.S., revenues were $601 million, an increase of more than 90% over the third quarter last year, driven by the ongoing launch of KAFTRIO in the 12-plus population. In particular, KAFTRIO was off to a strong start in France and Italy, 2 major markets where we achieved reimbursement in June of this year. 
We also signed a letter of intent for public reimbursement of TRIKAFTA in patients 12 and over in Canada. And since then, we've achieved model provincial reimbursement agreements and some 90% of patients covered by government insurance now have reimbursed access to TRIKAFTA. We have achieved reimbursement agreements for KAFTRIO/TRIKAFTA in more than 20 countries outside the U.S., just over 1 year since approval. And importantly, we've continued to achieve reimbursement at levels that reflect the high value of the triple combination regimen. 
As Reshma mentioned in her remarks, the profile of our CF medicines continues to be enhanced by term data. The start of the North American CF conferences tonight, and among several important abstracts, our data from the ongoing 192-week open-label extension study of TRIKAFTA, which shows there has been no loss of lung function during long-term follow-up. This is a first for any CFTR modulator to date is an important milestone for the field. All previous long-term data for our other medicines showed a slowing of lung function decline. In contrast, these data show no loss of lung function for patients on TRIKAFTA after 96 weeks of follow-up. 
Real-world data also being presented at the conference on KALYDECO show at an average of 6 years of follow-up, a 78% reduction in the mortality rate and an 89% reduction in the rate of lung transplantation compared to patients who were not eligible for the treatment. These data are very important for patients and the medical community because they more fully illustrate how our medicines address the long-term aggression and complications of the disease. These data also have important implications for the future competitive landscape as they raise the bar in terms of what will be required to compete effectively. 
Now turning to some of the other opportunities in our pipeline beyond CF. Our commercial experience in CF provides foundational capabilities, which we will be able to leverage to commercialize our next wave of transformative medicines. As Reshma mentioned, regulatory submissions for CTX001 are planned for the end of 2022. And so our launch preparation activities are well underway to ensure we are able to bring this potential medicine to patients globally immediately upon approval. We see CTX001 as a potential onetime curative approach for the approximately 32,000 patients with severe sickle cell disease or transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia in the U.S. and Europe. We've developed a deep understanding of the sickle cell and beta thalassemia markets, including where patients with these diseases are and the role that key referral and treatment centers will play to facilitate the treatment journey for patients. 
Consistent with our own internal market research, published physician surveys in the U.S. consistently indicate that they would expect 1/4 to 1/3 of their patients with sickle cell disease to be good candidates for a onetime curative approach using the current conditioning regimen, which is in line with the estimates of the numbers of patients with severe disease, approximately 25,000 sickle cell disease patients. 
We are focused on 3 key areas of launch preparation for CTX001. First, people. We've hired many of the key people who will support the launch. Second, manufacturing. This is an area we have focused on from the earliest days of our work on CTX001 to ensure we can supply a consistent and high-quality product to the large number of patients we believe will benefit from the medicine on day 1 of the launch. Importantly, we are using the same manufacturing sites and processes for commercialization that we are using for our clinical trials. And third, patients, making sure we really listen, understand them and their experience, so we can provide them at launch with the information, resources and support they need as they consider treatment with CTX001. 
Now turning to pain. With our acute pain study is well underway, I thought I would remind you of the large market opportunity there. Acute pain accounts for 1.8 billion treatment days a year in the U.S. alone. And despite more than 90% of prescriptions being generic, this is still today a $4 billion market. That's typical branded pain medicine pricing of approximately $10 a day, a new medicine that takes even a portion of the current treatment days has multibillion dollar potential. 
In light of the unprecedented data for VX 880, it's also worth highlighting the market opportunity in type 1 diabetes, which is very large. Let me start with the disease. Type 1 diabetes is a disease that is affecting more than 2.5 million people in the U.S. and Europe alone. It is a severely debilitating and life-shortening disease in which due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet cells, the body produces little to no insulin. 
There are 2 patient populations to consider. First, those with severe enough diabetes for whom the benefit risk profile is positive for the cells alone plus standard immunosuppressive therapy. And secondly, the broader population who would be candidates for the cells encapsulated in our proprietary device or hyperimmune cells, where immunosuppression would not be needed. There are at least 60,000 patients with type 1 diabetes in the U.S. and Europe who are potential candidates for the first approach with VX-880. This group is made up of people who have severe, difficult to control forms of type 1 diabetes, characterized by impaired awareness of hyperglycemia and severe hyperglycemic events that can be life-threatening. There are approximately 45,000 patients in this category. 
And then there are people with type 1 diabetes who have had previous organ transplants, primarily kidney and so are already on immunosuppression. There are about 15,000 patients in this category. Cadaveric islet and whole pancreas transplants are already performed, albeit in small numbers of these patients and give some sense of the value of this type of intervention in a patient with severe disease. 
For illustrative purposes, if you benchmark price in the U.S. for a pancreatic transplant of approximately $400,000 per patient as the price for a cell-based treatment, treating even a minority of the eligible patients would represent a multibillion-dollar opportunity. Beyond VX-880, the cells plus device program which encapsulates the same cells for which we recently reported the unprecedented clinical data into our proprietary device that protects these cells from the immune system, could address the broader type 1 diabetes population, 2.6 million patients in the U.S. and Europe. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our continued progress in bringing our CF medicines to more patients around the world and excited about the many opportunities in our pipeline. And with that, I'll turn it over to Charlie."

Total product revenues were $1.98 billion, a 29% increase compared to the third quarter of 2020. Notably, TRIKAFTA represented nearly 80% of third quarter revenues as most eligible patients have switched to TRIKAFTA. Our third quarter revenues included $1.38 billion in the U.S. and $601 million outside the U.S. Ex U.S. revenues for the quarter grew 92% over the prior year driven by continued strong uptake for KAFTRIO. 
Our third quarter combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $561 million compared to $497 million for the third quarter of 2020, driven largely by investment in our clinical stage programs and our research pipeline. We expect our R&D investments will continue to be substantial as we advance our mid- and late-stage programs and make further clinical and regulatory progress across the pipeline. Our continued growth in revenues, combined with disciplined growth in OpEx translates to a year-to-date operating margin of 59%. And with our strong revenue and profitability, we ended the second quarter with $7 billion in cash. 
Now to guidance. We are again revising our 2021 guidance upward for total product revenues in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.5 billion. This increase reflects continued outperformance as well as the rapid uptick we have seen with new launches. Year-over-year, this guidance represents 20% growth at the midpoint. As Stuart highlighted, the 6 to 11 launch in the U.S. and the uptake in France and Italy are proceeding very rapidly. 
Even with the outstanding growth in the number of patients treated this year, we have approximately 30,000 patients left to treat with our CFTR modulators. Given our proven track record of securing new reimbursement agreements in additional markets, executing successful launches and expanding access to younger age groups, we are confident that we will be able to reach the vast majority of these patients with our medicines. We are maintaining our non-GAAP OpEx guidance for full year 2021 at $2.25 billion to $2.3 billion. And for our non-GAAP tax rate, we continue to guide to a range of 21% to 22% this year. 
In conclusion, 2021 will be another year of rapid growth for Vertex, and we are confident in our continued growth trajectory in CF and our ability to lead in this therapeutic area over the long term. TRIKAFTA is an exception medicine that sets a very high bar for efficacy and safety with IP that extends to the late 2030s. With the emerging profile of our next regimens beyond TRIKAFTA as well progress we are making in genetic therapies for CF, we are well on our way to fulfilling our vision for achieving carrier levels in all CF phases. The VX-121/tezacaftor/VX-561 regimen is the only regimen with clinical data that shows the potential to meet or exceed the performance of TRIKAFTA and is years ahead of any other regimens in development. 
Our pipeline beyond CF is both advancing and delivering. Progress with CTX001 and more recently, VX-880, continues to demonstrate the value we can create by investing in external innovation. We look forward to sharing additional data with you as ongoing trials come to completion in the coming months. We anticipate Phase II data for VX-147 in APOL1-mediated FSGS and Phase II data for VX-548 in acute pain in the near term. With growing revenues and margins at the top of our peer group, we will deliver strong cash flows as we continue to reinvest in internal and external innovation to drive future growth. We are confident that the execution of our business strategy will continue to drive exceptional results for patients and the medical community as well as for our shareholders.

36235,1685888899,2422026,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated","Executives","Yes. Salveen, this is Reshma. Two questions in there. One about the mRNA program with Moderna. And another question, I think, on type 1 diabetes, but specifically with regard to our collaboration with Arbor and how we're thinking about the hypoimmune cell",515,"Yes. Salveen, this is Reshma. Two questions in there. One about the mRNA program with Moderna. And another question, I think, on type 1 diabetes, but specifically with regard to our collaboration with Arbor and how we're thinking about the hypoimmune cell programs. Let me break it up into 2 parts. And maybe I'll expand a little bit on type 1 diabetes even beyond the collaboration with Arbor. 
Let's start with Moderna. We are very excited about the recent breakthrough we made that I shared in my prepared remarks on the mRNA program for the last 10% of patients with CF who simply don't make any CFTR protein, right? And when you step back and think about what do you really need to do to make a breakthrough here, it's really about 3 things. It's about the HBE cells, it's about the mRNA construct itself and then for short about delivery. And it's this last one, delivery that's been a vexing problem for us in the field as a whole. And that's really the exciting news for today. 
With regard to the HBE cells, these have been the workhorse for the 4 medicines that we have brought forward already. And I say that because they are the only model that translates from the bench to the bed side, right? And it's not only qualitatively so, but quantitatively so. And it's -- these HBE cells that have also been the workhorse for the program with Moderna. 
The second is the mRNA construct itself. And a number of years ago, we have struck up a partnership with Moderna, arguably the best company in the space of mRNA. And in all honesty, we have for some time been able to express full-length CFTR mRNA, the protein, and demonstrate its functionality. We've been able to do all that in vitro and HBE. But over the last several months, what we have now been able to do is demonstrate that we can deliver using nebulized LNPs to the appropriate cells. So that is to say, to bronchial epithelial cells, and we've done this in small animals and large, and we can see that we've delivered them to -- deliver the mRNA construct to the bronchial epithelial cells. No one else has claimed to do this, and certainly, no one else has been able to do this. So that's the big advancement that allows us to go and start our GLP-enabling studies. Those are already underway, and I do expect the IND to go in next year. 
On type 1 diabetes, Salveen, there are the cells themselves. And then there are the mechanisms to cloak the cells, right? In the first program with VX-880, we use simple off-the-shelf pharmacologic immunosuppressive. In the second program, it's cells plus device. Those IND studies are already underway IND next year. The third program is using these same cells. And for the cloaking, we use -- our plan to use gene editing, for example, to make hypoimmune cells. I'm going to ask Bastiano to comment just a little bit more on the hypoimmune program. Bastiano?"

So like Reshma said, the product is actually the cell, the fully differentiated allogeneic beta cells. Aiding cells to cloak them from the immune system is a complex scientific challenge in general, specific to type 1 diabetes is represent are even more complicated because the call, that type 1 is an autoimmune disease. So we have to cloak the cells from the general allogeneic response, but also from the autoimmunity. And of course, it's fairly obvious that allogeneic rejection is something that has been worked on in the past, I would say, 2 decades. And of course, knocking out MHC Class 1 and 2 is the usual place where most people will go, and we're doing that internally. There are other mechanisms we are exploring internally into collaboration to ensure that we take care of both types of immunity, the allogeneic rejection and autoimmunity."

The second question is more a question around the fact that you had commented about M&A earlier this year. In fact, Reshma had commented even about areas like Huntington's. And I just wanted you to refresh that view in the fact that you haven't really commented about that so much like you did earlier this year in the recent prior quarters."

So we have obviously established ourselves as a leader in CF over the last decade plus. And over the recent few years, we've expanded that leadership first with TRIKAFTA that can serve up to 90% of people with CF. And then with the specific program that you're asking about VX-121/561/tez, which preclinically in these HBE cells that are a model that translates from bench to bedside have demonstrated the potential to have even better efficacy than TRIKAFTA and in the clinical program from the Phase II results that we shared earlier in the year, where it looks that 121/561/tez has the ability to provide even more benefit than TRIKAFTA. 
Now make no mistake about it. TRIKAFTA sets an incredibly high bar. It's an extraordinary medicine with a very high benefit risk profile. But 121 frankly is the competitor to TRIKAFTA. It's years ahead of anything else in the field. If I just stand back and look at this, Mike, we have the best medicine for CF today in the form of TRIKAFTA. We have the best medicine for CF tomorrow in the form of 121/561/tezacaftor. And as I look long term, when you really think about CF, a chronic disease, children are born with this disease, they're going to take medicine for a lifetime chronically, you're going to need long-term data, the kind of data that Stuart talked about in his prepared remarks, mortality, lung transplantation, rate of decline. And to be clear, the only company that has the term data and the long-term data is Vertex. With regard to capital allocation, Charlie, I'll ask you to comment on that one."

And we have shown that in CF that innovation that leads to transformative medicines for serious disease, create tremendous value both for patients and for shareholders. And we hope to do that in a number of other disease areas that are represented across our broad pipeline. So when it comes to capital allocation, our primary focus is on reinvestment in innovation, both internally and externally. You can see in the numbers, we've never invested more internally than we are today. And you can also see in the pipeline, the benefit of some of the smart external investments that we've made over the last couple of years, I would call out CRISPR and Semma specifically, but there are many others. 
And so from a capital allocation standpoint, that reinvestment in innovation will continue to be the top priority. We've not commented specifically on types of deals because we're not looking for a certain type of deal. We're looking for tools and technologies and assets that fit and are well aligned with our research strategy.

And yes, I'm enormously proud of our execution in this third quarter that led to the results that you commented on and led us to increasing our revenue guidance today. It's hard to comment specifically on kind of quarter-on-quarter, what our growth rate is going to be, but I'll give you a sense for where we are in our overall growth trajectory. As you said, we got the approval for the 6- to 11-year-olds for TRIKAFTA in June, so just prior to this quarter starting. We also secured new reimbursement agreements in important markets like Italy and France and also most recently in Canada, and the launches there are underway. What I can tell you is that the level of enthusiasm for 6- to 11-year-old TRIKAFTA here in the U.S. and overseas for a KAFTRIO is exceptionally high, in line with that, that we've seen in every other market where we've launched TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO. So those launches are off to a strong start. Obviously, we're in the first few months of those launches. 
So looking ahead, what do I see? Despite the fact that we've had really successful launches for TRIKAFTA and KAFTRIO, we're still actually only treating today about half of all the patients with CF who could benefit from our medicines overall. And specifically for CFTR modulators, there's about 30,000 patients yet to go in terms of patients who could benefit from our medicines. Now you might ask yourself who are those patients? Well, those patients are patients in countries where we have reimbursement, where we're early in the launch sequence some of the markets I just described. They're in countries where we have regulatory approvals with most of the world now, but where we have yet to secure reimbursement agreements. But -- and they're in younger age groups, obviously, 6- to 11-year-olds. Outside the U.S., we don't yet have an approval. And also, we're going to be pursuing approvals for TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO down to even younger age groups as we have done with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. 
So given our track record in securing approvals, getting reimbursement and successfully launching, I have no doubt that we're going to get to the vast majority of those 30,000 patients over the coming years. And so I see substantial growth for our CF franchise between now and the middle of the next decade. And then as we announced today, we've also made great progress with our mRNA program, which has the prospect of developing a medicine for the 10% or so of patients who don't respond to CFTR modulators. So I think we've got substantial growth runway yet to go in CF. And Reshma, back to you."

The first is the human genetics for APOL1-mediated kidney disease is strong. In fact, they're very strong. People who have kidney disease, who have proteinuria have 2 APOL1 alleles. They have universally poor outcomes. And the target, therefore, is really exceptionally well validated. 
The second is our in vitro and in vivo studies. We've done portfolio of studies in vitro as well as in animal studies, we find good potency, good selectivity and really strong reductions in proteinuria. And the third is that VX-147 is all of the drug-like properties that we seek. As a nephrologist, I find this opportunity really very exciting for the following reason. So in Phase II, we're studying 801-mediated FSGS. That is one kind of APOL1-mediated kidney disease. It's a very aggressive form of renal disease, about 10,000 people who have that. 
But APOL1-mediated proteinuric, let's say, prime proteinuric kidney disease, I know it's a mouthful, there's about 100,000 people who have that. And if the Phase II study is positive in FSGS, what that really tells you is that we have now, for the first time, found a small molecule that interdicts on APOL1 and can potentially be a therapy for the broad FSGS, not only FSGS, but the broad AMKD market, so the full 100,000. 
And then with regard to what would we consider successful? Okay. So the Phase II studies in FSGS, right, and the entry criteria is such that it's a very severe population. It's APOL1-mediated FSGS with a high burden of proteinuria and we allow stable doses of standard of care therapy. So these patients are already on ACEs, ARBs, immunosuppressives and steroids. So in that kind of patient population with an aggressive disease with high levels of proteinuria already in standard of care, double-digit improvements in proteinuria that would be impressive. Now of course, higher is better, but double-digit improvements in proteinuria, that would not only be important, it would be something that we've not seen before."

There's a question in there about dose targeting it to the right cells and how translatable the model is. And then there's another question in there about how do we think about the 90%. 
Okay. So I'm going to be circumspect with my comments. The insights are commercially sensitive. But here's what I can tell you. We have been very, very diligent and deliberate about dose and making sure that the mRNA transcript and protein expression are in the right cells. I would say that in drug development in this area, that's the most important part that many others have not gotten right. And that's specifically why I talked about the HBE assays in vitro, and the small and large animal studies and the targeting of the mRNA construct to the relevant cells, which are the bronchial epithelial cells. And I feel very good about the dose selection, about the schedule of dosing and the targeting to the appropriate cells. 
Now with regard to the question about down the line, do we think this could be extended to the other 90%. I would actually look at it the other way. CF is a systemic disease. It's not only a lung disease. And so the real value of small molecule correction of the CFTR protein is that you get systemic benefit. So in the setting of the last 10%, what I would contemplate is -- if our -- we are successful with our mRNA program when we're in the clinic next year, it's combining the mRNA with a small molecule. We're obviously the only ones who could do that. And I think the opportunity to bring benefit to the last 10% is therefore tremendous."

And second question I've had is for your device for diabetes. How does the device -- I know you've talked about how getting the cells in, they go to the liver and then blood vessels formed, and that's how they interact with the liver to function. How does the device not only protect the cells from the attacked by the immune system, but also allow them to have the interaction with blood vessels to work and function. So how does it work?

Let's do CF first, and then we'll -- let's do type 1 diabetes next. 
So Robyn, you know this, the TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO medicine can treat up to 90% of people with CF and it has really extraordinary efficacy. And what we see is that large numbers of patients, as you saw in the clinical trials program get benefit in the double-digit improvements in ppFEV1, significant improvements in sweat chloride in weight and quality of life. Now what we are trying to do and our long-term goal is to get all CF patients to carrier levels of sweat chloride. And the reason we want to do that is because carriers really manifest almost no disease. And what I can tell you, 121/561/tez in our preclinical experiments in these HBE cells that have this quantitative and quantitative relationship to what we see in the clinic, the 121/tez/561 has the potential to be even better than TRIKAFTA in that dimension. But we've already identified another generating molecules that in our HBE assays, look like they're going to get us to that ultimate goal of getting all patients with CF, the 90% to carrier levels. 
With regard to the device program, I'll ask Bastiano to comment, but here's the important thumbnail sketch of the field and what the real breakthrough that we have made. The problem with device historically has been foreign body reactions or fibrosis. And the second challenge with devices has been vascularization. Both of those challenges are what we tackled with our program and what we do not see with our device. So what we do not see is fibrosis or for body reaction. And what we do see is really excellent vascularization. Bastiano had a comment about the materials and the geometry and the configuration of the device that allows us to have the kind of effect that we have. Bastiano?"

It's called channel array device for that particular reason. It's purportedly designed to really minimize fibrosis and to allow the device to integrate in the body, allow vascular beds to form throughout the device on top and the bottom. So the cells are always optimally distant to a source of oxygen and nutrient, allowing for insulin and glucose, of course, to be exchanged. This is completely different from you think what was in the field, and we have evidence in our preclinical models that we do not see further by the response. We see robust neovascularization.

So we start at the highest level with the overall opportunity, and then I'll get to your question about the kind of launch dynamics or our views on them at this kind of early stage. So in terms of people who have severe sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia, between the U.S. and the EU, we think there's about 32,000 we estimate patients who have severe disease in both of those in the combined populations of sickle cell and beta thalassemia. In sickle cell, it's about 25,000 and because of the nature of the disease, the vast majority of those are in the United States. And that number is kind of validated by external physician surveys, which would indicate that -- they think they would treat between 25% and 1/3 of all their sickle cell disease patients with a onetime curative approach with the existing conditioning regimens. So we think that's about the order of magnitude of patients who might be eligible for this initial phase of a gene-editing curative treatment. 
In terms of launch dynamics, it's really going to be a function of probably 4 things. The first one is sort of physician and patient interest in the technology. And based on the results that we've seen to date and the enthusiasm we've seen in the field, particularly as it translates into interest in our clinical trials, we expect the enthusiasm from the community to be high. At the other end, it's going to be a function of our ability to manufacture. And as you can imagine, we're working diligently on our manufacturing processes to make sure that we have capacity to treat patients. But the bottleneck is likely to be in treatment centers. And as you know, the treatment is going to be administered in transplant centers. There's a limited number of those in the U.S., and they also have competing priorities with malignant hematology conditions. And so that is likely to be the rate-limiting step. We're obviously in the initial throes of evaluating those treatment centers and working with them. 
Again, we do think that enthusiasm to treat these patients is going to be high given the very significant unmet need in sickle cell disease and thalassemia and the outstanding results we've seen to date. So without commenting specifically because I wouldn't know the exact answer to that at this early stage, Liisa, those are likely to be some of the pinch points as it were in terms of the launch dynamics. What I can tell you, though, is we are expecting demand to be very, very substantial amongst those 32,000 patients given the unmet need and the results we've seen."

On the manufacturing side, we are using the same processes and actually the same sites as we did for the clinical trials for the commercial product.

With regard to your questions, which really center around the next wave, whether it's 121/561/tezacaftor, which is already in the clinic in Phase III clinical trials or the molecules that we've identified in San Diego that are going to be coming into the clinic. How are we thinking about this? How quickly can we go? What's the overall goal? So to be clear, the goal here is to bring all patients with cystic fibrosis to carrier levels of sweat chloride. That is our long-stated goal and that is what we are aiming for. And I feel really good about where we are with 121/561/tez based on the preclinical results that I shared and the Phase II results that we shared earlier this year. And the next wave of molecules look like they can be even better. So we are well on our path to bringing forward therapies that can bring all CF patients to carrier levels of sweat chloride. 
With regard to speed and how fast can we go, right? I don't think that anybody can go faster than us in cystic fibrosis for a couple of reasons. One, we've already demonstrated that we can do this very quickly. In TRIKAFTA, we went from the bench, so first synthesis of the molecule to U.S. approval in less than 4 years. Outside of oncology, it's one of the fastest drug development programs ever. The second reason I say that we do this really fast as we have a lot of experience in this, right? We've already done it with 4 medicines on the market, the fifth one being 121/tez/561. 
And with regard to when should we expect results and such. Remember, the trials for TRIKAFTA, we enrolled in about 6 months. So that's a benchmark for the last set of clinical trials we did. I expect us to continue to use the -- what we know and our experience to move fast with 121/561/tez and the molecules behind that."

I'm very pleased to be here with you tonight to discuss Vertex's progress through the first 3 quarters of 2021. During this year, we've meaningfully increased our leadership in cystic fibrosis, both with our approved CFTR modulators and with the CF programs advancing in our pipeline. 
We've expanded and accelerated our R&D pipeline beyond CF, and these programs are now delivering clinical results. We have continued to demonstrate exceptional financial performance with significant growth in revenue, high operating margins and increasing cash flow. Let me elaborate more on each of these 3 points. 
Starting with CF, from a commercial perspective, third quarter product revenues were $1.98 billion, representing almost 30% growth year-over-year. This growth was driven by the performance of TRIKAFTA in the U.S., including the launch in children ages 6 to 11, and strong uptake OUS, where KAFTRIO has been reimbursed, including most recently in France and Italy. 
Based on the strong performance, we are again increasing our revenue guidance and now expect total product revenues for 2021 to be between $7.4 billion and $7.5 billion. As we look forward, we expect that our CF business will continue to show robust growth in the years ahead as there are approximately 30,000 CF patients yet to be treated with our CFTR modulators. 
We've made important progress with our CF R&D pipeline programs this year as well. Based on strong preclinical and clinical results from our next-in-class triple combination regimen of VX-121, tezacaftor and VX-561 that demonstrate the potential for superior benefit to existing CFTR modulators, we've accelerated this program into pivotal studies. Both of the Phase III studies are head-to-head trials versus TRIKAFTA. Both studies are up and running and enrolling patients. 
And we are not stopping there. We have identified even more promising regimens in our labs, building on 20 years of success translating our proprietary insights in CF biology into groundbreaking medicines. We are confident that these regimens will allow us to reach our long-standing goal of bringing CF patients to carrier levels of sweat chloride. 
For the approximately 10% of people with CF who cannot benefit from a CFTR modulator, we're working on genetic therapies, including an mRNA approach. We and our partner, Moderna, have for some time now been able to synthesize mRNA constructs that restore CFTR protein function in vitro. The biggest challenge for us and for everyone in the field has been delivery of the mRNA to the target cells. 
I am very pleased to report that we and Moderna have made a significant breakthrough in delivery this past year. We have now demonstrated that we can efficiently deliver full-length CFTR mRNA to human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro to provide high levels of CFTR function and in vivo through the delivery of nebulized lipid nanoparticles to the bronchial epithelial cells in nonhuman primates. 
Based on these results, IND-enabling studies for our CFTR mRNA therapy are already underway, and we plan to file an IND and start clinical development in 2022. To close out on CF, I will note that just a few months from now, we will mark the 10th anniversary of the first approval of KALYDECO, our first CFTR modulator. And last month, marked 2 years since the U.S. approval for TRIKAFTA. 
For the Phase III clinical trials, our CF medicines have always been appreciated for their outstanding short-term benefits, not just significant increase in ppFEV1, but decreases in pulmonary exacerbations, increases in weight and increases in quality of life. We're now in a position where we have tens of thousands of patient years of safety data, and we could appreciate more fully the breadth of clinical benefit with analysis of longer-term real-world data. 
What we find truly remarkable is that with KALYDECO, we now have data based on an average of 6 years of follow-up in patients 6 years and older and that includes a 78% reduction in the mortality rate and an 89% reduction in the rate of lung transplantation compared to patients who are not eligible for treatment. 
With TRIKAFTA, we now have data showing no decline in lung function after 2 years of follow-up from the pivotal trials. And this is a first for any CF medicine. I'd like to emphasize that from our perspective, it is these kinds of long-term data that ultimately determine physician and patient choice of regimens, particularly in CF where patients take CFTR modulators chronically over a lifetime. 
Let me turn to our pipeline outside of CF. First, to our type 1 diabetes programs and the unprecedented clinical data we recently shared. The pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes is well known. It results from the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet cells. Daily injections of insulin have saved the lives of these patients, but patients still suffer from severe long-term vascular complications of the disease, resulting in premature mortality. 
And unfortunately, the treatment itself can lead to severe hypoglycemic episodes that can be associated with unresponsiveness, seizures and even death. Therefore, the holy grail for type 1 diabetes for decades has been to replace the damaged pancreatic islet cells and restore insulin production. Early clinical space using cadaveric islets have demonstrated the curative potential of this approach. The problem has been produced sufficient quality and quantity of islet cells to treat the millions of people with this disease. 
Vertex has developed a proprietary process to make industrial quantities of allogeneic, stem cell-derived, fully differentiated islet cells that could serve the more than 2.5 million patients with type 1 diabetes. The clinical data from this first patient treated in our VX-880 program with these cells are truly remarkable with a single infusion at half the target dose combined with standard immunosuppression, routinely used in transplantation, we observed substantial improvements across multiple measures of islet cell function that were rapid, robust and durable through day 90. 
Our stem cell-derived islets produce basal levels of insulin and increased insulin secretion appropriately in response to glucose stimulation. And in the 90 days following infusion, there was a significant reduction in blood glucose as measured by hemoglobin A1C despite a 91% reduction in exogenous insulin requirements. On the safety side, VX-880 was generally well tolerated. These cells are the product. They are the common denominator across our type 1 diabetes programs and these results derisk each of our 3 programs. 
In the cells alone program, we use standard pharmacologic immunosuppressives. In the next program, we're using our proprietary device for immunoprotection of these cells. The IND-enabling studies for this program are already underway, and we plan to file the IND in 2022. And these same cells are the starting product for our gene-editing program designed to produce hypoimmune islet cells that can evade the immune system. 
In cell and gene therapies, it is clear that the curative potential of these approaches is very high, and therefore, these therapeutics have potentially rapid path to registration involving a reasonable number of patients and a reasonable amount of follow-up. It is with this in mind that we're working with urgency on the VX-880 program. 
Moving on to CTX001. CTX001 is our nonviral ex vivo gene-editing therapy that is designed as a onetime curative approach for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. It also stands out as a clear example of how we have accelerated our pipeline in 2021. 
CTX001 is our most advanced program outside of CF and continues to have strong momentum. We've now fully enrolled the target number of patients in both the sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia clinical studies. Based on the clinical data we've presented to date, physician and patient interest in these trials has been high, and we have additional patients beyond the target 45 in each trial who are now completing eligibility assessments and will be enrolled this month. 
We anticipate closing out our regulatory discussions in the near term and submitting regulatory filings for approval of CTX001 by year-end 2022 based on these clinical results. We have high confidence that CTX001 will be our next launched medicine. Stuart will comment on the progress of our commercial preparedness in his remarks. 
On to VX-147 and where we will have results from the Phase II proof-of-concept study this quarter. This Phase II study of VX-147 is fully enrolled and focuses on patients with the form of FSGS that is mediated by APOL1. Our goal is to establish APOL1 inhibition as a new mechanism that can be used more broadly beyond FSGS, and in APOL1-mediated nondiabetic proteinuric kidney disease. 
Based on the human genetics, the strongly validated target and the performance of VX-147 across a number of in vitro and in vivo assays we see our APOL1-mediated kidney disease or AMKD program as having a high probability of success. Some of the preclinical data from this program are the subject of a presentation at the American Society of Nephrology Meeting taking place later this week. 
In this Phase II study, we're assessing the safety of VX-147, and the key efficacy marker is reduction of proteinuria. Proteinuria is the clinically relevant endpoint and one that regulators have expressed openness to accepting in a homogeneous proteinuric kidney disease population. If our Phase II study in APOL1-mediated FSGS is successful, it would represent a first-in-class demonstration of proof-of-concept for an APOL1-mediated kidney disease and would propel us into pivotal development in the AMKD population, which includes, but is not limited to FSGS. In total, this represents approximately 100,000 people with AKD. 
I'll conclude the pipeline discussion with a few words on our pain program. We have high confidence in the NaV1.8 target for 3 main reasons. One, NaV1.8 is genetically validated. Two, NaV1.8 is also pharmacologically validated with our very own 3 positive Phase II proof-of-concept studies in acute, neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. 
And third, our lead molecule in the program, VX-548, has the key drug-like properties that we are looking for, including high selectivity and potency. The 2 Phase II dose-ranging studies in acute pain, bunionectomy and abdominoplasty with VX-548 are well underway. Based on enrollment progress, we currently expect data from these studies in Q1 of 2022. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Stuart to review the commercial progress."

I'll begin by reviewing the Q3 revenue performance of our CF medicines, which reached nearly $2 billion in Q3.

I'll begin by reviewing the Q3 revenue performance of our CF medicines, which reached nearly $2 billion in Q3. U.S. revenues were $1.38 billion, an increase of 13% compared to the prior year, driven by the performance of TRIKAFTA, including the launch in the 6- to 11-year-old population. 
The launch in the 6- to 11-year olds is progressing rapidly, which is not surprising given the profile of the medicine and the recognition of the importance of early treatment of this relentlessly progressive disease. Outside the U.S., revenues were $601 million, an increase of more than 90% over the third quarter last year, driven by the ongoing launch of KAFTRIO in the 12-plus population. 
In particular, KAFTRIO was off to a strong start in France and Italy, 2 major markets where we achieved reimbursement in June of this year. 
We also signed a letter of intent for public reimbursement of TRIKAFTA in patients 12 and over in Canada. And since then, we've achieved multiple provincial reimbursement agreements and some 90% of patients covered by government insurance now have reimbursed access to TRIKAFTA. 
We have achieved reimbursement agreements for KAFTRIO/TRIKAFTA in more than 20 countries outside the U.S., just over 1 year since approval. And importantly, we've continued to achieve reimbursement at levels that reflect the high value of the triple combination regimen. 
As Reshma mentioned in her remarks, the profile of our CF medicines continues to be enhanced by term data. The start of the North American CF conferences tonight, and among several important abstracts, our data from the ongoing 192-week open-label extension study of TRIKAFTA, which shows there has been no loss of lung function during long-term follow-up. This is a first for any CFTR modulator to date, an important milestone for the field. 
All previous long-term data for our other medicines showed a slowing of lung function decline. In contrast, these data show no loss of lung function for patients on TRIKAFTA after 96 weeks of follow-up. 
Real-world data also being presented at the conference on KALYDECO show at an average of 6 years of follow-up, a 78% reduction in the mortality rate and an 89% reduction in the rate of lung transplantation compared to patients who were not eligible for the treatment. These data are very important for patients and the medical community because they more fully illustrate how our medicines address the long-term progression and complications of the disease. 
These data also have important implications for the future competitive landscape as they raise the bar in terms of what will be required to compete effectively. 
Now turning to some of the other opportunities in our pipeline beyond CF. Our commercial experience in CF provides foundational capabilities, which we will be able to leverage to commercialize our next wave of transformative medicines. As Reshma mentioned, regulatory submissions for CTX001 are planned for the end of 2022. And so our launch preparation activities are well underway to ensure we are able to bring this potential medicine to patients globally immediately upon approval. 
We see CTX001 as a potential onetime curative approach for the approximately 32,000 patients with severe sickle cell disease or transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia in the U.S. and Europe. We've developed a deep understanding of the sickle cell and beta thalassemia markets, including where patients with these diseases are and the role that key referral and treatment centers will play to facilitate the treatment journey for patients. 
Consistent with our own internal market research, published physician surveys in the U.S. consistently indicate that they would expect 1/4 to 1/3 of their patients with sickle cell disease to be good candidates for a onetime curative approach using the current conditioning regimen, which is in line with the estimates of the numbers of patients with severe disease, approximately 25,000 sickle cell disease patients. 
We are focused on 3 key areas of launch preparation for CTX001. First, people. We've hired many of the key people who will support the launch. Second, manufacturing. This is an area we have focused on from the earliest days of our work on CTX001 to ensure we can supply a consistent and high-quality product to the large number of patients we believe will benefit from the medicine on day 1 of the launch. 
Importantly, we are using the same manufacturing sites and processes for commercialization that we are using for our clinical trials. And third, patients, making sure we really listen, understand them and their experience, so we can provide them at launch with the information, resources and support they need as they consider treatment with CTX001. 
Now turning to pain. With our acute pain study is well underway, I thought I would remind you of the large market opportunity there. Acute pain accounts for 1.8 billion treatment days a year in the U.S. alone. And despite more than 90% of prescriptions being generic, this is still today a $4 billion market. That's typical branded pain medicine pricing of approximately $10 a day, a new medicine that takes even a portion of the current treatment days has multibillion dollar potential. 
In light of the unprecedented data for VX 880, it's also worth highlighting the market opportunity in type 1 diabetes, which is very large. Let me start with the disease. Type 1 diabetes is a disease affecting more than 2.5 million people in the U.S. and Europe alone. It is a severely debilitating and life-shortening disease in which due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet cells, the body produces little to no insulin. 
There are 2 patient populations to consider. First, those with severe enough diabetes for whom the benefit risk profile is positive for the cells alone plus standard immunosuppressive therapy. And secondly, the broader population who would be candidates for the cells encapsulated in our proprietary device or hyperimmune cells, where immunosuppression would not be needed. There are at least 60,000 patients with type 1 diabetes in the U.S. and Europe who are potential candidates for the first approach with VX-880. This group is made up of people who have severe, difficult to control forms of type 1 diabetes, characterized by impaired awareness of hyperglycemia and severe hyperglycemic events that can be life-threatening. There are approximately 45,000 patients in this category. 
And then there are people with type 1 diabetes who have had previous organ transplants, primarily kidney, and so are already on immunosuppression. There are about 15,000 patients in this category. Cadaveric islet and whole pancreas transplants are already performed, albeit in small numbers of these patients and give some sense of the value of this type of intervention in a patient with severe disease. 
For illustrative purposes, if you benchmark price in the U.S. for a pancreatic transplant of approximately $400,000 per patient as the price for a cell-based treatment, treating even a minority of the eligible patients would represent a multibillion-dollar opportunity. 
Beyond VX-880, the cells plus device program which encapsulates the same cells for which we recently reported the unprecedented clinical data into our proprietary device that protects these cells from the immune system, could address the broader type 1 diabetes population, 2.6 million patients in the U.S. and Europe. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our continued progress in bringing our CF medicines to more patients around the world and excited about the many opportunities in our pipeline. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Charlie."

In the third quarter of 2021, Vertex's long-term track record of strong revenue growth continued. Total product revenues were $1.98 billion, a 29% increase compared to the third quarter of 2020.

Total product revenues were $1.98 billion, a 29% increase compared to the third quarter of 2020. Notably, TRIKAFTA represented nearly 80% of third quarter revenues as most eligible patients have switched to TRIKAFTA. 
Our third quarter revenues included $1.38 billion in the U.S. and $601 million outside the U.S. Ex U.S. revenues for the quarter grew 92% over the prior year driven by continued strong uptake for KAFTRIO. 
Our third quarter combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $561 million compared to $497 million for the third quarter of 2020, driven largely by investment in our clinical stage programs and our research pipeline. We expect our R&D investments will continue to be substantial as we advance our mid- and late-stage programs and make further clinical and regulatory progress across the pipeline. 
Our continued growth in revenues, combined with disciplined growth in OpEx translates to a year-to-date operating margin of 59%. And with our strong revenue and profitability, we ended the second quarter with $7 billion in cash. 
Now to guidance. We are again revising our 2021 guidance upward for total product revenues in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.5 billion. This increase reflects continued outperformance as well as the rapid uptick we have seen with new launches. Year-over-year, this guidance represents 20% growth at the midpoint. 
As Stuart highlighted, the 6 to 11 launch in the U.S. and the uptake in France and Italy are proceeding very rapidly. Even with the outstanding growth in the number of patients treated this year, we have approximately 30,000 patients left to treat with our CFTR modulators. 
Given our proven track record of securing new reimbursement agreements in additional markets, executing successful launches and expanding access to younger age groups, we are confident that we will be able to reach the vast majority of these patients with our medicines. We are maintaining our non-GAAP OpEx guidance for full year 2021 at; $2.25 billion to $2.3 billion. And for our non-GAAP tax rate, we continue to guide to a range of 21% to 22% this year. 
In conclusion, 2021 will be another year of rapid growth for Vertex, and we are confident in our continued growth trajectory in CF and our ability to lead in this therapeutic area over the long term. TRIKAFTA is an exception medicine that sets a very high bar for efficacy and safety with IP that extends to the late 2030s. 
With the emerging profile of our next regimens beyond TRIKAFTA as well progress we are making in genetic therapies for CF, we are well on our way to fulfilling our vision for achieving carrier levels in all CF patients.
The VX-121/tezacaftor/VX-561 regimen is the only regimen with clinical data that shows the potential to meet or exceed the performance of TRIKAFTA and is years ahead of any other regimens in development. 
Our pipeline beyond CF is both advancing and delivering. Progress with CTX001 and more recently, VX-880, continues to demonstrate the value we can create by investing in external innovation. We look forward to sharing additional data with you as ongoing trials come to completion in the coming months. We anticipate Phase II data for VX-147 in APOL1-mediated FSGS and Phase II data for VX-548 in acute pain in the near term. 
With growing revenues and margins at the top of our peer group, we will deliver strong cash flows as we continue to reinvest in internal and external innovation to drive future growth. We are confident that the execution of our business strategy will continue to drive exceptional results for patients and the medical community as well as for our shareholders. 
We will now open up the call to questions."

Salveen, this is Reshma. Two questions in there. One about the mRNA program with Moderna. And another question, I think, on type 1 diabetes, but specifically with regard to our collaboration with Arbor and how we're thinking about the hypoimmune cell",515,"Yes. Salveen, this is Reshma. Two questions in there. One about the mRNA program with Moderna. And another question, I think, on type 1 diabetes, but specifically with regard to our collaboration with Arbor and how we're thinking about the hypoimmune cell programs. Let me break it up into 2 parts. And maybe I'll expand a little bit on type 1 diabetes even beyond the collaboration with Arbor. 
Let's start with Moderna. We are very excited about the recent breakthrough we made that I shared in my prepared remarks on the mRNA program for the last 10% of patients with CF who simply don't make any CFTR protein, right? And when you step back and think about what do you really need to do to make a breakthrough here, it's really about 3 things. It's about the HBE cells, it's about the mRNA construct itself and then for shorts about delivery. 
And it's this last one, delivery that's been a vexing problem for us in the field as a whole. And that's really the exciting news for today. 
With regard to the HBE cells, these have been the workhorse for the 4 medicines that we have brought forward already. And I say that because they are the only model that translates from the bench to the bed side, right? And it's not only qualitatively so, but quantitatively so. And it's -- these HBE cells that have also been the workhorse for the program with Moderna. 
The second is the mRNA construct itself. And a number of years ago, we have struck up a partnership with Moderna, arguably the best company in the space of mRNA. And in all honesty, we have for some time been able to express full-length CFTR mRNA, the protein, and demonstrate its functionality. We've been able to do all that in vitro and HBE.
But over the last several months, what we have now been able to do is demonstrate that we can deliver using nebulized LNPs to the appropriate cells. So that is to say, to bronchial epithelial cells, and we've done this in small animals and large, and we can see that we've delivered them to -- deliver the mRNA construct to the bronchial epithelial cells. No one else has claimed to do this, and certainly, no one else has been able to do this. So that's the big advancement that allows us to go and start our GLP-enabling studies. Those are already underway, and I do expect the IND to go in next year. 
On type 1 diabetes, Salveen, there are the cells themselves. And then there are the mechanisms to cloak the cells, right? In the first program with VX-880, we use simple off-the-shelf pharmacologic immunosuppresses. In the second program, it's cells plus device. Those IND studies are already underway, IND next year. The third program is using these same cells. And for the cloaking, we use -- or plan to use gene editing, for example, to make hypoimmune cells. I'm going to ask Bastiano to comment just a little bit more on the hypoimmune program. Bastiano?"

So like Reshma said, the product is actually the cell, the fully differentiated allogeneic beta cells. Aiding cells to cloak them from the immune system is a complex scientific challenge in general, specific to type 1 diabetes is -- represents are even more complicated because the call, that type 1 is an autoimmune disease. 
So we have to cloak the cells from the general allogeneic response, but also from the autoimmunity. And of course, it's fairly obvious that allogeneic rejection is something that has been worked on in the past, I would say, 2 decades. And of course, knocking out MHC Class 1 and 2 is the usual place where most people will go, and we're doing that internally. 
There are other mechanisms we are exploring internally into collaboration to be sure that we take care of both types of immunity, the allogeneic rejection and autoimmunity."

The second question is more a question around the fact that you had commented about M&A earlier this year. In fact, Reshma had commented even about areas like Huntington's. And I just wanted you to refresh that view in the fact that you haven't really commented about that so much like you did earlier this year in the recent prior quarters."

So we have obviously established ourselves as a leader in CF over the last decade plus. And over the recent few years, we've expanded that leadership first with TRIKAFTA that can serve up to 90% of people with CF. And then with the specific program that you're asking about VX-121/561/tez, which preclinically in these HBE cells that are a model that translates from bench to bedside have demonstrated the potential to have even better efficacy than TRIKAFTA and in the clinical program from the Phase II results that we shared earlier in the year, where it looks that 121/561/tez has the ability to provide even more benefit than TRIKAFTA. 
Now make no mistake about it. TRIKAFTA sets an incredibly high bar. It's an extraordinary medicine with a very high benefit risk profile. But 121 frankly is the competitor to TRIKAFTA. It's years ahead of anything else in the field. 
If I just stand back and look at this, Mike, we have the best medicine for CF today in the form of TRIKAFTA. We have the best medicine for CF tomorrow in the form of 121/561/tezacaftor. And as I look long term, when you really think about CF, a chronic disease, children are born with this disease, they're going to take medicine for a lifetime chronically, you're going to need long-term data, the kind of data that Stuart talked about in his prepared remarks, mortality, lung transplantation, rate of decline. And to be clear, the only company that has the term data and the long-term data is Vertex. 
With regard to capital allocation, Charlie, I'll ask you to comment on that one."

And we have shown that in CF that innovation that leads to transformative medicines for serious disease, create tremendous value both for patients and for shareholders. And we hope to do that in a number of other disease areas that are represented across our broad pipeline. 
So when it comes to capital allocation, our primary focus is on reinvestment in innovation, both internally and externally. You can see in the numbers, we've never invested more internally than we are today. And you can also see in the pipeline, the benefit of some of the smart external investments that we've made over the last couple of years, I would call out CRISPR and Semma specifically, but there are many others. 
And so from a capital allocation standpoint, that reinvestment in innovation will continue to be the top priority. We've not commented specifically on types of deals because we're not looking for a certain type of deal. We're looking for tools and technologies and assets that fit and are well aligned with our research strategy.

And yes, I'm enormously proud of our execution in this third quarter that led to the results that you commented on and led us to increasing our revenue guidance today. It's hard to comment specifically on kind of quarter-on-quarter, what our growth rate is going to be, but I'll give you a sense for where we are in our overall growth trajectory. As you said, we got the approval for the 6- to 11-year-olds for TRIKAFTA in June, so just prior to this quarter starting. We also secured new reimbursement agreements in important markets like Italy and France and also most recently in Canada, and the launches there are underway. 
What I can tell you is that the level of enthusiasm for 6- to 11-year-old TRIKAFTA here in the U.S. and overseas for a KAFTRIO is exceptionally high, in line with that, that we've seen in every other market where we've launched TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO. So those launches are off to a strong start. Obviously, we're in the first few months of those launches. 
So looking ahead, what do I see? Despite the fact that we've had really successful launches for TRIKAFTA and KAFTRIO, we're still actually only treating today about half of all the patients with CF who could benefit from our medicines overall. And specifically for CFTR modulators, there's about 30,000 patients yet to go in terms of patients who could benefit from our medicines. 
Now you might ask yourself who are those patients? Well, those patients are patients in countries where we have reimbursement, where we're early in the launch sequence some of the markets I just described. They're in countries where we have regulatory approvals with most of the world now, but where we have yet to secure reimbursement agreements. But -- and they're in younger age groups, obviously, 6- to 11-year-olds. Outside the U.S., we don't yet have an approval. And also, we're going to be pursuing approvals for TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO down to even younger age groups as we have done with KALYDECO and ORKAMBI. 
So given our track record in securing approvals, getting reimbursement and successfully launching, I have no doubt that we're going to get to the vast majority of those 30,000 patients over the coming years. And so I see substantial growth for our CF franchise between now and the middle of the next decade. And then as we announced today, we've also made great progress with our mRNA program, which has the prospect of developing a medicine for the 10% or so of patients who don't respond to CFTR modulators. So I think we've got substantial growth runway yet to go in CF. And Reshma, back to you."

In fact, th",362,"Still on the question of the VX-147 program. Okay. So on that one, I have high confidence in the Phase II proof-of-concept study. And I say that for really 3 reasons. The first is the human genetics for APOL1-mediated kidney disease is strong. In fact, they're very strong. People who have kidney disease, who have proteinuria have 2 APOL1 alleles. They have universally poor outcomes. And the target, therefore, is really exceptionally well validated. 
The second is our in vitro and in vivo studies. We've done portfolio of studies in vitro as well as in animal studies, we find good  potency, good selectivity and really strong reductions in proteinuria. And the third is that VX-147 is all of the drug-like properties that we seek. As a nephrologist, I find this opportunity really very exciting for the following reason. So in Phase II, we're studying APOL1 -mediated FSGS. That is one kind of APOL1-mediated kidney disease. It's a very aggressive form of renal disease, about 10,000 people who have that. 
But APOL1-mediated proteinuric, let's say, prime proteinuric kidney disease, I know it's a mouthful, there's about 100,000 people who have that. And if the Phase II study is positive in FSGS, what that really tells you is that we have now, for the first time, found a small molecule that interdicts on APOL1 and can potentially be a therapy for the broad FSGS, not only FSGS, but the broad AMKD market, so the full 100,000. 
And then with regard to what would we consider successful? Okay. So the Phase II study is in FSGS, right, and the entry criteria is such that it's a very severe population. It's APOL1-mediated FSGS with a high burden of proteinuria and we allow stable doses of standard of care therapy. So these patients are already on ACEs, ARBs, immunosuppressives and steroids. 
So in that kind of patient population with an aggressive disease with high levels of proteinuria already in standard of care, double-digit improvements in proteinuria that would be impressive. Now of course, higher is better, but double-digit improvements in proteinuria, that would not only be important, it would be something that we've not seen before."

There's a question in there about dose targeting it to the right cells and how translatable the model is. And then there's another question in there about how do we think about the 90%. 
Okay. So I'm going to be circumspect with my comments. The insights are commercially sensitive, but here's what I can tell you. We have been very, very diligent and deliberate about dose and making sure that the mRNA transcript and protein expression are in the right cells. I would say that in drug development in this area, that's the most important part that many others have not gotten right. And that's specifically why I talked about the HBE assays in vitro, and the small and large animal studies and the targeting of the mRNA construct to the relevant cells, which are the bronchial epithelial cells. And I feel very good about the dose selection, about the schedule of dosing and the targeting to the appropriate cells. 
Now with regard to the question about down the line, do we think this could be extended to the other 90%. I would actually look at it the other way. CF is a systemic disease, it's not only a lung disease. And so the real value of small molecule correction of the CFTR protein is that you get systemic benefit. So in the setting of the last 10%, what I would contemplate is -- if our -- we are successful with our mRNA program when we're in the clinic next year, it's combining the mRNA with a small molecule. We're obviously the only ones who could do that. And I think the opportunity to bring benefit to the last 10% is therefore tremendous."

And what we see is that large numbers of patients, as you saw in the clinical trials program get benefit in the double-digit improvements in ppFEV1, significant improvements in sweat chloride in weight and quality of life. 
Now what we are trying to do and our long-term goal is to get all CF patients to carrier levels of sweat chloride. And the reason we want to do that is because carriers really manifest almost no disease. And what I can tell you, 121/561/tez in our preclinical experiments in these HBE cells that have this quantitative and quantitative relationship to what we see in the clinic, the 121/tez/561 has the potential to be even better than TRIKAFTA in that dimension. But we've already identified another generating molecules that in our HBE assays, look like they're going to get us to that ultimate goal of getting all patients with CF, the 90% to carrier levels. 
With regard to the device program, I'll ask Bastiano to comment, but here's the important thumbnail sketch of the field and what the real breakthrough that we have made. The problem with device historically has been foreign body reactions or fibrosis. And the second challenge with devices has been vascularization. Both of those challenges are what we tackled with our program and what we do not see with our device. 
So what we do not see is fibrosis or for body reaction. And what we do see is really excellent vascularization. Bastiano had a comment about the materials and the geometry and the configuration of the device that allows us to have the kind of effect that we have. Bastiano?"

And Robyn, I just want to maybe start with making clear that this is a completely novel device that is made with different materials, different geometry, different configuration from everything else that has been described by others in the field. It was specifically -- [ actually ] designed to exactly address the causes of failure in the field of encapsulation like Reshma said, which is foreign body response and vascularization. It's called channel array device for that particular reason. It's purportedly designed to really minimize fibrosis and to allow the device to integrate in the body, allow vascular beds to form throughout the device on top and the bottom. 
So the cells are always optimally distant to a source of oxygen and nutrient, allowing for insulin and glucose, of course, to be exchanged. This is completely different from you think what was in the field, and we have evidence in our preclinical models that we do not see foreign body response. We see robust neo-vascularization. We see rapid insulin responsiveness and immunoprotection even in immunocompetent animals."

So we start at the highest level with the overall opportunity, and then I'll get to your question about the kind of launch dynamics or our views on them at this kind of early stage. So in terms of people who have severe sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia, between the U.S. and the EU, we think there's about 32,000 we estimate patients who have severe disease in both of those in the combined populations of sickle cell and beta thalassemia. In sickle cell, it's about 25,000 and because of  the nature of the disease, the vast majority of those are in the United States. And that number is kind of validated by external physician surveys, which would indicate that -- they think they would treat between 25% and 1/3 of all their sickle cell disease patients with a onetime curative approach with the existing conditioning regimens. So we think that's about the order of magnitude of patients who might be eligible for this initial phase of a gene-editing curative treatment. 
In terms of launch dynamics, it's really going to be a function of probably 4 things. The first one is sort of physician and patient interest in the technology. And based on the results that we've seen to date and the enthusiasm we've seen in the field, particularly as it translates into interest in our clinical trials, we expect the enthusiasm from the community to be high. At the other end, it's going to be a function of our ability to manufacture. 
And as you can imagine, we're working diligently on our manufacturing processes to make sure that we have capacity to treat patients. But the bottleneck is likely to be in treatment centers. And as you know, the treatment is going to be administered in transplant centers. There's a limited number of those in the U.S., and they also have competing priorities with malignant hematology conditions. And so that is likely to be the rate-limiting step. We're obviously in the initial throes of evaluating those treatment centers and working with them. 
Again, we do think that enthusiasm to treat these patients is going to be high given the very significant unmet need in sickle cell disease and thalassemia and the outstanding results we've seen to date. So without commenting specifically because I wouldn't know the exact answer to that at this early stage, Liisa, those are likely to be some of the pinch points as it were in terms of the launch dynamics. What I can tell you, though, is we are expecting demand to be very, very substantial amongst those 32,000 patients given the unmet need and the results we've seen."

Okay. So Cory, on the regulatory filings, because of these designations we've had a benefit of multiple conversations with the agency and as I said earlier, been able to address most of their questions, and we're really now wrapping up conversations around 2 clinical points, which is how big is the database and what's the duration of follow-up. 
On the manufacturing side, we are using the same processes and actually the same sites as we did for the clinical trials for the commercial product. And in the grand scheme of things, when you think about what we are doing with CTX001, it's ex vivo gene editing. And really, it's the Cas enzyme and the guide RNA. And in the grand scheme of things, that's just simply an easier manufacturing situation than other manufacturing challenges. 
So I feel very good about our conversations with the agency. We've been able to derisk by addressing their questions along the way. And we are using the same processes and the same sites that we used in the clinical trials for the commercial product.

With regard to your questions, which really center around the next wave, whether it's 121/561/tezacaftor, which is already in the clinic in Phase III clinical trials or the molecules that we've identified in San Diego that are going to be coming into the clinic. How are we thinking about this? How quickly can we go? What's the overall goal? 
So to be clear, the goal here is to bring all patients with cystic fibrosis to carrier levels of sweat chloride. That is our long-stated goal and that is what we are aiming for. And I feel really good about where we are with 121/561/tez based on the preclinical results that I shared and the Phase II results that we shared earlier this year. And the next wave of molecules look like they can be even better. So we are well on our path to bringing forward therapies that can bring all CF patients to carrier levels of sweat chloride. 
With regard to speed and how fast can we go, right? I don't think that anybody can go faster than us in cystic fibrosis for a couple of reasons. One, we've already demonstrated that we can do this very quickly. In TRIKAFTA, we went from the bench, so first synthesis of the molecule to U.S. approval in less than 4 years. Outside of oncology, it's one of the fastest drug development programs ever. 
The second reason I say that we do this really fast as we have a lot of experience in this, right? We've already done it with 4 medicines on the market, the fifth one being 121/tez/561.  
And with regard to when should we expect results and such. Remember, the trials for TRIKAFTA, we enrolled in about 6 months. So that's a benchmark for the last set of clinical trials we did. I expect us to continue to use the -- what we know and our experience to move fast with 121/561/tez and the molecules behind that."
