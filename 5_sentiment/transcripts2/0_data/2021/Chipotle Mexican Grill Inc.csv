We are pleased to report a strong ending to what has been a challenging year. Even today, a few Chipotle restaurants remain fully closed, while only about 60% of our dining rooms are open with reduced capacity, with the rest being available for to-go services. 
Despite this challenging backdrop, our results demonstrate that Chipotle restaurants with the right leaders and culture, along with excellent culinary, can deliver outstanding performance in any environment. Most importantly, none of this would be possible without our dedicated team members that strive to deliver a great guest experience on a daily basis. 
The pandemic has presented new challenges for all of us, and our team has successfully navigated every one of them. I thank our team members for their ongoing commitment to serving our guests as well as supporting each other and could not be prouder of their efforts. 
Before we dive into our financial results, let me reflect back on 2020 and highlight a few key accomplishments that have helped propel Chipotle's mission of cultivating a better world. These include: a paramount focus on industry-leading protocols that help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and guests; providing jobs with industry-leading benefits to nearly 88,000 people; and paying out nearly $40 million of discretionary bonuses and assistance pay to our restaurant team members as well as over $13 million of tuition costs for employees furthering their education; prioritizing diversity, equality and inclusion efforts across the company; and raising nearly $4 million in support of organizations helping underserved communities; and investing in the future of farming through grants, long-term contracts and the Aluminaries Project 2.0. 
As a purpose-driven organization, we're already hard at work identifying ways that we can make a positive impact on the world in 2021. We are optimistic about the future and look forward to continuing to deliver on our promises and passionately play an active supportive role in our communities. 
Now let's focus on our business performance, where for the fourth quarter we reported sales of $1.6 billion, representing 11.6% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 5.7% comparable restaurant sales growth; restaurant-level margins of 19.5%, which is 30 basis points higher than last year; and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $3.48, representing an increase of 21.7% year-over-year. 
Comparable restaurant sales were fairly consistent in each month of Q4 due to a combination of factors, including healthy demand for carne asada, strength in our digital platform and the delivery menu price increase. Q1 has also started on a very positive note with comparable restaurant sales for January accelerating to around 11% despite a double-digit comparison. 
Even with the resurgence in COVID cases, the 2-year compounded comp stack in Q4 was a robust 19.9%, which is similar to the 20.2% we delivered last quarter and highlights the resiliency of the Chipotle brand. 
In light of the ever-changing environment we all experienced in 2020, our full year performance showed good progress, with sales growing 7.1% to reach $6 billion driven by a 1.8% comp; 161 new restaurant openings; and digital sales of $2.8 billion, which grew 174% versus the prior year. 
As you can see from these results, our key strategies continue to resonate with guests and position us to win today while we create the future. What really excites me and the entire leadership team is our vision of having more than 6,000 restaurants and expanding AUVs above $2.5 million with margins at or above 25%, all of which is a question of when, not if. 
Let me now provide a brief update on each of these strategies, which I believe still have plenty of runway. These are: number one, making the brand visible, relevant and loved; number two, utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation; number three, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement; number four, engaging with customers through our loyalty program; and number five, running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in restaurant and digital experiences. 
Beginning with our marketing programs, which are generating attractive returns by driving culture, driving a difference and ultimately driving purchase. Our creative marketing initiatives across both traditional and digital channels continue to be successful in attracting new users to Chipotle as well as motivating existing customers to come more often. 
Whether it was switching our Halloween celebration to an entirely digital offering for the first time, unveiling a new line of Chipotle merchandise ahead of the holiday season or launching real foodprint, a sustainability impact tracker that shows how Chipotle ingredients are better for the planet, the marketing team did a terrific job consistently enhancing our brand and purpose using the right message with the right vehicle. 
Traditional advertising also remains an important marketing tool for Chipotle. We connected and engaged with guests through our Behind The Foil TV campaign and The New Avocado Journey Spy, highlighting real ingredients, real cooking techniques and real employees. We also featured our Making An Order Spot that highlights the ease of customizing your order on our app to continue to drive awareness of digital ordering. 
And last week, we announced our first-ever Super Bowl commercial that will air during the second quarter of the beginning this Sunday. The Spots Title Can Avrio change the world and highlights Chipotle's commitment to cultivating a better world through its real food, sustainable sourcing and commitment to the farming industry. Supplementing these efforts are a steady flow of new menu innovation that is validated by our stage-gate process, which gives new and existing customers even more reasons to visit Chipotle. 
Since our initial offering of carne asada ended last year, we continued hearing from our guests that they wanted to back. So we found a way to source more tender cuts of steak that met our Food with Integrity standards and brought it back for a limited time across the U.S. and Canada as well as in France for the first time. The relaunch, which we expect to last through early March is going well, and we're encouraged that the incidence mix is similar to what we saw last year. 
In addition, in January, we launched the Lantero line cauliflower rice for a limited time across the U.S. and Canada. We're excited to introduce this plant-powered better-for-you option that aligns with the latest health trends and emphasizes the benefits of real food. With only 4 grams of net carbs per serving, it puts a delicious twist on Chipotle's classic rice recipe by using the same fresh, real ingredients and culinary techniques. 
Early feedback has been outstanding. Cauliflower rice is definitely on trend, a great reason for new guests to try Chipotle for the first time or entice existing guests to visit more often. And it keeps our Lifestyle Bowls platform top of mind. 
We have 2 other menu items currently being tested. The first is quesadillas, which is available as a digital-only menu option in a few test markets. We continue to make operational progress and remain optimistic about the potential for quesadillas to be available nationwide in the near future. 
The second item is our smoked brisket, which is currently being tested and showing encouraging results. I personally love the richness of our smoke brisket recipe as it delivers a flavor unlike anything else at Chipotle. We are gaining valuable feedback on both of these items, and we'll update you on their progress as well as other menu items that are in early development as they move through our stage-gate process. 
Moving to the next strategic driver, our digital platform, which continues to be a big beneficiary from guests adopting the digital off-premise occasion. Q4 digital sales grew 177% year-over-year to $781 million and represented 49% of sales. This was consistent with Q3 digital sales and mix, highlighting our ongoing momentum and the fact that Chipotle is top of mind for a lot more eating and dining occasions than we were in the past. 
We are not stopping there. We've made our digital channel even more convenient with easy ordering in the Chipotle app and website enhancements such as unlimited customization, contactless delivery and group ordering. 
As a result, and I mentioned this earlier, full year digital sales were $2.8 billion, representing 46% of total sales and growing 174% year-over-year. What an amazing accomplishment. At this sales rate, our average restaurant delivers a digital AUV of $1.1 million. 
With this success, we will not allow complacency to set in. Rather, we will continue to look for ways to further enhance our digital ecosystem. For example, we just announced a car-side pickup pilot in San Jose as an additional access point for our guests. In addition, we are opening up more and more Chipotlanes and are in the early stages of testing alternative formats like our first-ever digital-only restaurant outside of Westpoint. This new prototype allows us to enter more trade areas that wouldn't support a full-size restaurant and allows for greater flexibility with future locations. It's early days, but this location has outperformed our expectations thus far. 
During the quarter, about half of the digital sales came via order-ahead and pickup transactions or digital pickup orders as we refer to them, with the remainder coming from the delivery channel. However, our overall digital mix moved up about 50% late in the quarter as COVID restrictions toughened, largely driven by an increase in digital pickup orders. I'm pleased to report that the strong digital momentum has continued into January, with our digital mix remaining in the low-50% range. 
Another area where we saw a big benefit in 2020 is our rewards program, which added over 10 million members in the last year and currently has nearly 19.5 million enrolled members. This gives us the ability to communicate organically with a large and passionate community of Chipotle fans. We have focused on strengthening our creative and analytical capabilities by using predictive modeling to ensure that our members feel known and valued as we elevate their relationship with Chipotle. We strategically share brand and promotional messages with personalized content weekly. 
In addition, we reach customers with dedicated journeys focused on welcoming new members, growing frequency and minimizing lapsing behavior. There are preprogram touch points in place to drive customer value across their life cycle, including a keen focus on retaining digital customers who have experienced the brand in new ways over the last year. 
Although Chipotle Rewards and its CRM capability have been active for less than 2 years, we have already made significant progress and have further enhancements planned in the coming months that we expect will continue to drive frequency increases across our customer segments. 
Finally, I want to spend some time on our restaurant operations, where the team stayed focused on safety, reliability and excellent culinary as it seamlessly adapted to abrupt changes in guest needs and ordering patterns. This hasn't been easy, especially as the number of COVID cases began despite and at times impacted our staffing capabilities. But they have been up to the challenge, and I'm so proud of our operational leaders and team members. They have been unwavering in the desire and execution of the right things for each other, our customers, our community and our business. 
And as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, Chipotle has continued to reward and invest in our team members to ensure we are creating an environment that allows our employees to develop and thrive in their career, not only today but also in the future. We offer best-in-class benefits coupled with training, development and promotional opportunities that foster a learning culture for continual growth. 
Turnover continues to be relatively stable, and we are seeing plenty of great applicants for open positions to staff our expected growth in AUV and new restaurant openings. In fact, we held our first national hiring event of the year called Coast-to-Coast Career Day in mid-January with a goal of employing 15,000 new restaurant team members across the U.S. We had an overwhelming response and feel fortunate to have a reputation for attracting and developing great talent. 
In closing, I believe our performance in 2020 was, in some ways, even more impressive than what we achieved in 2019 and highlights that the Chipotle brand has remained visible and flexible in order to stay relevant. Our ability to pivot and adapt to the rapidly changing needs of our guests is a testament to the durability of our model and the strength of our team members. My sincere thanks to our employees for their passion to make Chipotle a welcoming place for all and a special place to work. 
As we look ahead, the rollout of vaccines gives us hope that the world can return to a more normal environment at some point during 2021. And I'm optimistic that resiliency will prevail as people want to get back together to share a meal and share some stories. 
In the meantime, we're ready to navigate through any potential challenges. With world-class talent, inclusive culture, strong business fundamentals and deep financial strength, we feel well prepared to emerge even stronger post-COVID and continue to serve and delight our guests. 
With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials."

Despite ongoing challenges related to COVID, we're pleased to report solid fourth quarter results, with sales growing 11.6% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as comp sales grew 5.7%.

Despite ongoing challenges related to COVID, we're pleased to report solid fourth quarter results, with sales growing 11.6% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as comp sales grew 5.7%. Restaurant-level margin of 19.5% was 30 basis points higher than last year. And earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $3.48, representing a 21.7% year-over-year increase. 
The fourth quarter had a nonrecurring tax benefit was partially offset by expenses related to legal reserves, restaurant asset impairments and closure costs, transformation expenses and other adjustments, which netted to positively impact our earnings per share by $3.21, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $6.69. 
For the full year, sales increased 7.1% to $6 billion on a comp increase of 1.8%. Restaurant-level margins were 17.4%, a decrease of 310 basis points. And we generated earnings per share adjusted for unusual expenses of $10.73, a decrease of 23.6% over last year. We had a nonrecurring tax benefit that was partially offset by expenses related to legal reserves, restaurant asset impairment and closure costs as well as our transformation that positively impacted our earnings per share by $1.79, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $12.52. 
While the uncertainty from COVID makes it difficult to provide comp guidance for full year 2021, we remain optimistic about our future prospects as evidenced by a great start to Q1, with January comps accelerating to roughly 11% despite a very difficult comparison. Sales in last week of January were in the high single digits, with winter weather across the country contributing to the lower comp. Assuming the pandemic doesn't worsen, we expect our Q1 comp to be in the mid- to high-teens range given an easier comparison during the second half of March. 
So costs were 31% in Q4, a decrease of 210 basis points from last year, and this was due primarily to menu price increases, along with better waste control, partially offset by fewer sales of high-margin beverages and higher dairy pricing. In Q1, we expect food costs to remain right around 31% as the benefit from a full quarter of menu price increases will be offset by higher cost menu items such as cauliflower rice as well as slightly higher avocado prices. 
Labor costs for the quarter were 25.4%, a decrease of 110 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage and efficiencies related to digital orders, partially offset by COVID-related expenses, including exclusion pay as well as normal labor inflation. We expect labor costs to be right around 25% during Q1. This expected benefit from sales leverage is offset by ongoing COVID-related expenses. Other operating costs for the quarter was 17.9%, an increase of 310 basis points from last year due primarily to higher delivery fees in the quarter. 
Delivery expenses were elevated year-over-year given the significant growth in delivery, with delivery sales now nearly 25% of total sales. To help improve the economics on this premium access point, we have implemented several delivery menu price differentials with a weighted average being right around 13%. We have seen modest resistance thus far, and we'll continue to monitor and adjust pricing as appropriate at the market level or at the restaurant level. 
Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 3.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. But as expected, it was 130 basis point sequential increase from Q3 to sport carne asada the latest brand messaging under our Behind The Foil campaign. We expect marketing spend to be near 4% in Q1, which will be the highest quarterly level during 2021, in order to support new menu items as well as the upcoming Super Bowl ad. 
As a result of the higher anticipated marketing demand and ongoing momentum in our delivery business, we expect other operating costs to be right around 17% in Q1. The Q4 restaurant-level margin was 19.5%, while our trailing 12-month average unit volumes were roughly $2.2 million, which is back to our pre-COVID level. We expect to close much of this margin gap versus the 22% expected at this volume in 2021 as COVID-related impacts and delivery economics normalize and as quarterly marketing expenses even out. 
Note that some of this gap relates to delivery accounting as increased delivery menu prices as well as delivery and service fees had the effect of grossing up, which may create the appearance that margin algorithm gap is widening. Therefore, we now disclose our AUVs with and without the delivery menu price increase to provide better clarity and transparency. 
G&A for the quarter was $124 million on a GAAP basis or $114 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding roughly $7 million for settlement of several older legal matters and nearly $3 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes $90 million in underlying G&A, $21 million related to noncash stock comp and a $4 million bonus performance adjustment due to our strong performance in 2020 despite the pandemic. 
We are still in the early innings of our growth life cycle, and therefore, continue to make important G&A investments in 2020 despite the COVID pandemic. We saw an uptick in Q4 underlying G&A due to technology investments, customer service enhancements, increased headcount as well as higher medical claims. 
Looking ahead to Q1. We expect underlying G&A expense to carry forward in the $90 million range as we continue to make tech investments, the majority of which are revenue-generating, to bolster our expanding digital and loyalty platforms. These include initiatives that are customer-facing like app upgrades as well as behind-the-scenes initiatives like a new labor scheduling tool. In addition, we also plan to increase headcount in order to support our expected accelerated growth. 
Even with this elevated spend, our goal remains to deliver leverage on this line item relative to our sales growth. Stock comp will likely be around $23 million each quarter in 2021, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. We also expect to recognize around $4 million of employer taxes in Q1 associated with shares that vest at the beginning of our fiscal year. 
Lastly, our 2018 performance shares were modified to account for unplanned effects of COVID. This will result in a GAAP accounting charge of about $24 million for both Q1 and Q2, and about $8 million in Q3 and Q4. We plan to present non-GAAP results without these unusual charges to clearly show our underlying business performance. 
Our effective tax rate for Q4 was negative 62.2% on a GAAP basis and 24.6% on a non-GAAP basis. The difference is due to recognizing a net operating loss for tax purposes in 2020, which we expect to carry back to the preceding 5 years. We generated an NOL for tax purposes due to several factors, including the impact of COVID, increased tax deduction for equity, vesting and exercises, accelerated tax depreciation deductions and various tax planning initiatives. An income tax benefit is generated due to the difference in federal tax rates between 2020 and the years that the federal NOL will be carried back to. 
For fiscal 2021, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items such as stock option exercises. This range assumes no change to current income tax rate. And if corporate tax rates change as a result of tax reform under Biden administration, we'll revisit our estimated effective tax rate. 
Turning now to the balance sheet, where we ended Q4 with $1.1 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments and no debt, along with a $600 million untapped credit facility. We're privileged to have this financial strength with which to make ongoing strategic investments in our people, our business and our communities to further differentiate Chipotle brand and support our expected growth for 2021 and beyond. We didn't buy back any stock in Q4, but if our business continues to improve and economy continues to stabilize, we will likely begin buying again in late Q1 or early Q2. 
One area that definitely benefited from our strong cash position is restaurant design and real state development, where we remain diligent and aggressive while many of our peers pulled back. I'm really impressed by the hard work of our development and operations team as they opened 61 new restaurants in the fourth quarter, with 42 including a chipotlane. For the full year, they successfully navigated construction and permitting challenges and opened 161 new restaurants, with 100 including a Chipotlane. Remarkably, this was towards the high end of the 150 to 165 range we provided before the onset of the pandemic. 
As of year-end, we had a total of 170 Chipotlanes, including 5 conversions. Performance for these formats continues to be stellar. The digital gap versus non-Chipotlane restaurants remains around 10% driven entirely by higher-margin digital pickup orders. And sales at the Chipotlane cohort continued to outperform the non-Chipotlane results from the same open period. In fact, non-comp Chipotlane sales are opening close to our existing restaurant AUV versus historical peak productivity in the mid- to high-80% range. These results reaffirm our strategy of an accelerated pivot towards Chipotlane site. Not only will this enhance customer access and convenience, but it also helps increase new restaurant sales, margins and returns. 
While 62% of new restaurants in 2020 had a Chipotlane, our goal is to have more than 70% of openings included Chipotlanes in 2021, where we anticipate opening around 200 new restaurants. Of course, this development guidance assumes no major COVID-related delays in 2021. Guidance also includes remodeling or relocating 10 to 15 restaurants this year to add a Chipotlane. This will allow us to learn and ensure we're getting a superior return on this investment before potentially ramping up the number of remodels and our relocations in the future. 
Let me end by also expressing my gratitude to all of our team members in our restaurants and in support roles as they overcame countless challenges and embrace change to safely serve and delight our guests. It's through this collaborative effort that we've been able to achieve such an impressive performance in 2020 and continue to build momentum at the start of this year. 
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

And then, Jack, just the restaurant-level margins, you touched on that as well about how that 19.5 million or so was short of that relationship that you would have for a $2.2 million box, i.e. that should be 22% if you get your delivery economics up to speed. Should we be thinking about -- what is the buildup that -- in that margin through the year? How fast can you close that gap in that relationship? 
And I guess the last thing is, when it comes to the 2-year trend in comp, basically, if you look at The Street numbers, people are thinking the mid-teens 2-year or thereabout after we get vaccines. And I'm wondering how you -- I know you're not giving guidance, but how do you think about the net of people having more options, but yet you're having perhaps a better daytime traffic and walk-in traffic than you would. Sorry for the 3 questions."

But we can see, as COVID-19 begins to be in the review mirror and as we have taken some action and we consider other action and how we're going to offset the margin impact of delivery, I would expect by the end of the year. And remember, COVID is going to be with us for at least a quarter or 2. I mean, the vaccine is not going to be widely available until more like midyear. So it's going to be more second half of the year. But I feel good about by the second half of the year that we should be closing the gap. If not all the way, we'll be knocking on the door on what the margin algorithm would be.

And currently, we're even testing now a car-site access. 
What I've seen is in the markets where we start to open those dining rooms up, you don't lose those occasions. You pick up the occasions that kind of got impacted by COVID. And it really is an and situation not an or. Now it's not 100% back in the dining room in some of these regions. But we're seeing 50%, 60% of the dining room business come back, and we're hanging on to 85%, 80% of our digital business. 
And as you walk into 2021, our digital system now has 19.5 million members. And what we have seen is they like the additional access, the convenience that it provides. And they like our ability to communicate with them through that rewards program. 
And so look, I think January is a great example of the strength of Chipotle's business still be impacted by COVID rolling over a year ago that didn't have COVID. And I think it just shows the power of the new access points, the way we're running our restaurants, the culture that we have in our restaurants. And then ultimately, our customers believe in the food, believe in the purpose. So very optimistic about where we get to. 
And as Jack pointed out, I think as the year goes on, you're going to continue to see us make progress on getting that algorithm back to where we said we'll get to as COVID wanes and some of these expenses go away. And the delivery channel, we kind of normalize it into our business going forward."

What I would say, David, is we're still seeing like that lunch occasion have a real opportunity. And what we've seen is in places where you have people moving around more, for whatever their routine is, you see that occasion still happening where they want to come into the restaurant. 
And look, I still think the occasion of the dining room experience gives you something unique. It's got another level of customization because you get to be face-to-face with how we're making your food versus the online occasion. And so when we talk to customers, there is a fair amount of people that when they have the opportunity, they will want to go back to their dining occasion. 
The thing that I find really promising in that is they've also adopted new off-premise digital occasions that they're not going to abandon. And when we look at the Venn diagram, the world where it used to be, they were exclusive. I only did online, and I only do in dining, and there was a few that did both. That's changed. You've got a lot more people doing both. And we've got people that historically probably would not have tried it, if not for, unfortunately, COVID. But they still really love that in-restaurant experience, and now we're top of mind for that occasion when they're not going to be in the restaurant.

The price increase that we took, it covers the dollar cost of delivery. Like there's an increase in delivery this year versus last year because so many people moved into that channel. And so the price increase we took so far, it gets us to about a breakeven versus last year in terms of a dollar -- from a dollar standpoint. 
But if you go through the math, and it's easiest to do this like on an annual basis. If you -- this 13% on 25% of the business ends up being about $80,000. And so look at the average cost of delivery being about $80,000 on average per restaurant. When you take that price increase, it ends up being a 3%, 3.25%, your sales will go up by about $80,000. And so you cover those dollars, your cash flow on a per-restaurant basis are the same. But if you go through the math and take the same cash flow and take 25%, which ends up being $625,000 of cash flow. That's $2.5 million at a 25% margin. And if your costs go up to $80,000 and your revenue goes up by $80,000, your margin is going to go down by 80 basis points. 
And so we don't make any less money, but the margin does end up being diluted just because of the math. Now we think there are things that we can do, either levers we can pull, other efficiencies we can file. We think over time, we can offset that, but that's just a math challenge that we're dealing with."

And so the economics look great. The new restaurant openings are opening really strong. Chipotlane continues to perform. And you see us experimenting with digital only. You'll see us experimenting with Chipotlanes only. 
But at the end of the day, I mean, the full business of Chipotle, where you got both lines, a Chipotlane as an access point with this digital system, it's just really winning economics, and there are a lot of those sites available in the U.S. 
To your question about international, obviously, we believe Chipotle can travel beyond the United States. We're already seeing some success in Canada. And then obviously, we've got some plans in place for places that we already have our foot in the door. So think of the U.K., France, specifically.

And then we'll evaluate other regions accordingly. We've not made decisions on how we want to enter those other markets.

If I would have asked you what Chipotle up to, you would not have been able to give me a good answer. Frankly, it would have been somebody else's narrative.

So Brian, you mentioned that the national launch of quesadillas are in the near feature, but it doesn't look like it's contemplated in 1Q same-store sales guidance given it implies a deceleration to your trends from January to the combined February and March time frame. Does guidance reflect uncertainty over the course of the pandemic or more so conservatism as quesadillas are expected to launch later in the quarter? 
And then my second question on catering. As we look towards the reopening, how big of an emphasis do you plan to place on catering given the gap you guys historically had, with 1% of your sales coming from catering before the pandemic versus fast-casual peers that were typically in that 8% range?"

So we're being careful on that front. 
And then obviously, as we are able to lock and load on new initiatives, we'll share that with you guys. We're still in the phase of making sure we've got the equipment rolled out everywhere. And we're feeling really good about the training we're going to do around quesadilla. So more to come on that front. 
But I would say more of it is just -- there's still a lot of unknown. Luckily, every day seems to be better with this -- with the whole COVID issue both -- vaccine rates seem to be going up and COVID cases seem to be going down. And luckily, less and less people are ending up in the hospital. So I'm optimistic, but we wanted to be conservative on that front. 
And then regarding catering, yes, look, Andrew, I think it's a huge opportunity. Once people want to get back together, I think it's going to be a real big opportunity for our business. And it's one of the areas we're thinking about. And we're going to figure out the right time to start pushing that once, obviously, people can get back together in groups in a meaningful way. 
So it's a big opportunity. I wish we -- the first step will be getting back to 1% of our sales doing catering. And then the next step will be tracking down numbers that I think are much higher than where we were with 1%."

And in terms of the guidance, Brian mentioned before, the first quarter is still difficult to predict. We don't know where COVID is going next. We're optimistic because the vaccines are getting traction. But it essentially takes the last week trend, which we talked about in the script. We -- while we did overall 11% for January, we had moved down into the high single digits at the last week of January.

We are pleased to report a strong ending to what has been a challenging year. Even today, a few Chipotle restaurants remain fully closed, while only about 60% of our dining rooms are open with reduced capacity, with the rest being available for to-go services. Despite this challenging backdrop, our results demonstrate that Chipotle restaurants with the right leaders and culture, along with excellent culinary, can deliver outstanding performance in any environment. Most importantly, none of this would be possible without our dedicated team members that strive to deliver a great guest experience on a daily basis. The pandemic has presented new challenges for all of us, and our team has successfully navigated every one of them. I thank our team members for their ongoing commitment to serving our guests as well as supporting each other and could not be prouder of their efforts. 
Before we dive into our financial results, let me reflect back on 2020 and highlight a few key accomplishments that have helped propel Chipotle's mission of cultivating a better world. These include a paramount focus on industry-leading protocols that help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and guests, providing jobs with industry-leading benefits to nearly 88,000 people and paying out nearly $40 million in discretionary bonuses and assistance pay to our restaurant team members as well as over $13 million of tuition costs for employees furthering their education; prioritizing diversity, equality and inclusion efforts across the company; and raising nearly $4 million in support of organizations; helping underserved communities; and investing in the future of farming through grants, long-term contracts and the Aluminaries Project 2.0.  
As a purpose-driven organization, we're already hard at work identifying ways that we can make a positive impact on the world in 2021. We are optimistic about the future and look forward to continuing to deliver on our promises and passionately play an active supportive role in our communities.  
Now let's focus on our business performance, where for the fourth quarter, we reported sales of $1.6 billion, representing 11.6% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 5.7% comparable restaurant sales growth; restaurant-level margins of 19.5%, which is 30 basis points higher than last year; and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $3.48, representing an increase of 21.7% year-over-year. 
Comparable restaurant sales were fairly consistent in each month of Q4, due to a combination of factors, including healthy demand for carne asada, strength in our digital platform and the delivery menu price increase. Q1 has also started on a very positive note with comparable restaurant sales for January accelerating to around 11%, despite a double digit comparison. Even with a resurgence in COVID cases, the 2-year compounded comp stack in Q4 was a robust 19.9%, which is similar to the 20.2% we delivered last quarter and highlights the resiliency of the Chipotle brand. 
In light of the ever-changing environment we all experienced in 2020, our full-year performance showed good progress, with sales growing 7.1% to reach $6 billion, driven by a 1.8% comp, 161 new restaurant openings and digital sales of $2.8 billion, which grew 174% versus the prior year. 
As you can see from these results, our key strategies continue to resonate with guests and position us to win today while we create the future. What really excites me and the entire leadership team is our vision of having more than 6,000 restaurants and expanding AUVs above $2.5 million with margins at or above 25%, all of which is a question of when, not if. 
Let me now provide a brief update on each of these strategies, which I believe still have plenty of runway. These are: number one, making the brand visible, relevant and loved; number two, utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation; number three, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement; number four, engaging with customers through our loyalty program; and number five, running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in restaurant and digital experiences.  
Beginning with our marketing programs, which are generating attractive returns by driving culture, driving a difference and ultimately driving purchase. Our creative marketing initiatives across both traditional and digital channels continue to be successful in attracting new users to Chipotle as well as motivating existing customers to come more often.  
Whether it was switching our Halloween celebration to an entirely digital offering for the first time, unveiling a new line of Chipotle merchandise ahead of the holiday season or launching Real Foodprint, a sustainability impact tracker that shows how Chipotle ingredients are better for the planet, the marketing team did a terrific job consistently enhancing our brand and purpose using the right message with the right vehicle. 
Traditional advertising also remains an important marketing tool for Chipotle. We connected and engaged with guests through our Behind the Foil TV campaign and a new avocado journey spot, highlighting real ingredients, real cooking techniques and real employees. We also featured our making an order spot that highlights the ease of customizing your order on our app to continue to drive awareness of digital ordering.  
And last week, we announced our first-ever Super Bowl commercial that will air during the second quarter beginning this Sunday. The spot is titled, Can a Burrito Change the World, and highlights Chipotle's commitment to cultivating a better world through its real food, sustainable sourcing and commitment to the farming industry. Supplementing these efforts are a steady flow of new menu innovation that is validated by our stage-gate process, which gives new and existing customers even more reasons to visit Chipotle.  
Since our initial offering of carne asada ended last year, we continued hearing from our guests that they wanted it back. So we found a way to source more tender cuts of steak that met our Food with Integrity standards and brought it back for a limited time across the U.S. and Canada as well as in France for the first time. The relaunch, which we expect to last through early March, is going well, and we're encouraged that the incidence mix is similar to what we saw last year.  
In addition, in January, we launched Cilantro-Lime Cauliflower Rice for limited time across the U.S. and Canada. We're excited to introduce this plant-powered better-for-you option that aligns with the latest health trends and emphasizes the benefits of real food. With only 4 grams of net carbs per serving, it puts a delicious twist on Chipotle's classic rice recipe by using the same fresh, real ingredients and culinary techniques. 
Early feedback has been outstanding. Cauliflower rice is definitely on trend, a great reason for new guests to try Chipotle for the first time or entice existing guests to visit more often, and it keeps our Lifestyle Bowls platform top of mind.  
We have 2 other menu items currently being tested. The first is quesadillas, which is available as a digital-only menu option in a few test markets. We continue to make operational progress and remain optimistic about the potential for quesadillas to be available nationwide in the near future. The second item is our smoked brisket, which is currently being tested and showing encouraging results. I personally love the richness of our smoked brisket recipe as it delivers a flavor unlike anything else at Chipotle. We are gaining valuable feedback on both of these items, and we'll update you on their progress as well as other menu items that are in early development as they move through our stage-gate process.  
Moving to the next strategic driver, our digital platform, which continues to be a big beneficiary from guests adopting the digital off-premise occasion. Q4 digital sales grew 177% year-over-year to $781 million and represented 49% of sales. This was consistent with Q3 digital sales and mix, highlighting our ongoing momentum and the fact that Chipotle is top of mind for a lot more eating and dining occasions than we were in the past. 
We are not stopping there. We've made our digital channel even more convenient with easy ordering in the Chipotle app and website enhancements such as unlimited customization, contactless delivery and group ordering. 
As a result, and I mentioned this earlier, full year digital sales were $2.8 billion, representing 46% of total sales and growing 174% year-over-year. What an amazing accomplishment. At this sales rate, our average restaurant delivers a digital AUV of $1.1 million.  
With this success, we will not allow complacency to set in. Rather, we will continue to look for ways to further enhance our digital ecosystem. For example, we just announced a car-side pickup pilot in San Jose as an additional access point for our guests. In addition, we are opening up more and more Chipotlanes and are in the early stages of testing alternative formats like our first-ever digital-only restaurant outside of West Point. This new prototype allows us to enter more trade areas that wouldn't support a full-size restaurant and allows for greater flexibility with future locations. It's early days, but this location has outperformed our expectations thus far.  
During the quarter, about half of the digital sales came via order-ahead and pickup transactions or digital pickup orders, as we refer to them, with the remainder coming from the delivery channel. However, our overall digital mix moved up about 50% late in the quarter as COVID restrictions toughened, largely driven by an increase in digital pickup orders. I'm pleased to report that the strong digital momentum has continued into January, with our digital mix remaining in the low-50% range. 
Another area where we saw a big benefit in 2020 is our rewards program, which added over 10 million members in the last year and currently has nearly 19.5 million enrolled members. This gives us the ability to communicate organically with a large and passionate community of Chipotle fans. We have focused on strengthening our creative and analytical capabilities by using predictive modeling to ensure that our members feel known and valued as we elevate their relationship with Chipotle. We strategically share brand and promotional messages with personalized content weekly.  
In addition, we reach customers with dedicated journeys focused on welcoming new members, growing frequency and minimizing lapsing behavior. There are preprogrammed touch points in place to drive customer value across their life cycle, including a keen focus on retaining digital customers who have experienced the brand in new ways over the last year.  
Although Chipotle Rewards and its CRM capability have been active for less than 2 years, we have already made significant progress and have further enhancements planned in the coming months that we expect will continue to drive frequency increases across our customer segments.  
Finally, I want to spend some time on our restaurant operations, where the team stayed focused on safety, reliability and excellent culinary as it seamlessly adapted to abrupt changes in guest needs and ordering patterns. This hasn't been easy, especially as the number of COVID cases began to spike and at times impacted our staffing capabilities. But they have been up to the challenge, and I'm so proud of our operational leaders and team members. They have been unwavering in the desire and execution of the right things for each other, our customers, our community and our business.  
And as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, Chipotle has continued to reward and invest in our team members to ensure we are creating an environment that allows our employees to develop and thrive in their career, not only today but also in the future. We offer best-in-class benefits coupled with training, development and promotional opportunities that foster a learning culture for continual growth.  
Turnover continues to be relatively stable, and we are seeing plenty of great applicants for open positions to staff our expected growth in AUV and new restaurant openings. In fact, we held our first national hiring event of the year called Coast-to-Coast Career Day in mid-January with a goal of employing 15,000 new restaurant team members across the U.S. We had an overwhelming response and feel fortunate to have a reputation for attracting and developing great talent.  
In closing, I believe our performance in 2020 was, in some ways, even more impressive than what we achieved in 2019 and highlights that the Chipotle brand has remained visible and flexible in order to stay relevant. Our ability to pivot and adapt to the rapidly changing needs of our guests is a testament to the durability of our model and the strength of our team members. My sincere thanks to our employees for their passion to make Chipotle a welcoming place for all and a special place to work.  
As we look ahead, the rollout of vaccines gives us hope that the world can return to a more normal environment at some point during 2021. And I'm optimistic that resiliency will prevail as people want to get back together to share a meal and share some stories.  
In the meantime, we're ready to navigate through any potential challenges. With world-class talent, an inclusive culture, strong business fundamentals and deep financial strength, we feel well prepared to emerge even stronger post-COVID and continue to serve and delight our guests.  
With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials."

Despite ongoing challenges related to COVID, we're pleased to report solid fourth quarter results, with sales growing 11.6% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as comp sales grew 5.7%.

Despite ongoing challenges related to COVID, we're pleased to report solid fourth quarter results, with sales growing 11.6% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as comp sales grew 5.7%. Restaurant-level margin of 19.5% was 30 basis points higher than last year. And earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $3.48, representing a 21.7% year-over-year increase.  
The fourth quarter had a nonrecurring tax benefit was partially offset by expenses related to legal reserves, restaurant asset impairments and closure costs, transformation expenses and other adjustments, which netted to positively impact our earnings per share by $3.21, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $6.69.  
For the full year, sales increased 7.1% to $6 billion on a comp increase of 1.8%. Restaurant-level margins were 17.4%, a decrease of 310 basis points. And we generated earnings per share adjusted for unusual expenses of $10.73, a decrease of 23.6% over last year. We had nonrecurring tax benefit that was partially offset by expenses related to legal reserves, restaurant asset impairment and closure costs as well as our transformation that positively impacted our earnings per share by $1.79, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $12.52.  
While the uncertainty from COVID makes it difficult to provide comp guidance for full year 2021, we remain optimistic about our future prospects, as evidenced by a great start to Q1, with January comps accelerating to roughly 11% despite a very difficult comparison. Sales in last week of January were in the high single digits, with winter weather across the country contributing to the lower comp. Assuming the pandemic doesn't worsen, we expect our Q1 comp to be in the mid- to high-teens range, given an easier comparison during the second half of March.  
Food cost were 31% in Q4, a decrease of 210 basis points from last year, and this was due primarily to menu price increases, along with better waste control, partially offset by fewer sales of high-margin beverages and higher dairy pricing. In Q1, we expect food costs to remain right around 31% as the benefit from a full quarter of menu price increases will be offset by higher cost menu items such as cauliflower rice as well as slightly higher avocado prices.  
Labor costs for the quarter were 25.4%, a decrease of 110 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage and efficiencies related to digital orders, partially offset by COVID-related expenses, including exclusion pay as well as normal labor inflation. We expect labor costs to be right around 25% during Q1, as expected benefit from sales leverage is offset by ongoing COVID-related expenses. Other operating costs for the quarter was 17.9%, an increase of 310 basis points from last year, due primarily to higher delivery fees in the quarter. 
Delivery expenses were elevated year-over-year given the significant growth in delivery, with delivery sales now nearly 25% of total sales. To help improve the economics on this premium access point, we have implemented several delivery menu price differentials with a weighted average being right around 13%. We have seen modest resistance thus far, and we'll continue to monitor and adjust pricing as appropriate at the market level or at the restaurant level.  
Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 3.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. But as expected, it was 130 basis point sequential increase from Q3 to support carne asada and the latest brand messaging under our Behind the Foil campaign. We expect marketing spend to be near 4% in Q1, which would be the highest quarterly level during 2021, in order to support new menu items as well as the upcoming Super Bowl ad.  
As a result of the higher anticipated marketing demand and ongoing momentum in our delivery business, we expect other operating costs to be right around 17% in Q1. The Q4 restaurant-level margin was 19.5%, while our trailing 12-month average unit volumes were roughly $2.2 million, which is back to our pre-COVID level. We expect to close much of this margin gap versus the 22% expected at this volume in 2021 as COVID-related impacts and delivery economics normalize and as quarterly marketing expenses even out. 
Note that some of this gap relates to delivery accounting as increased delivery menu prices as well as delivery and service fees had the effect of grossing up, which may create the appearance that margin algorithm gap is widening. Therefore, we now disclose our AUVs with and without the delivery menu price increase to provide better clarity and transparency.  
G&A for the quarter was $124 million on a GAAP basis or $114 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding roughly $7 million for settlement of several older legal matters and nearly $3 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes $90 million in underlying G&A, $21 million related to noncash stock comp and a $4 million bonus performance adjustment due to our strong performance in 2020 despite the pandemic.  
We are still in the early innings of our growth life cycle, and therefore, continue to make important G&A investments in 2020 despite the COVID pandemic. We saw an uptick in Q4 underlying G&A due to technology investments, customer service enhancements, increased headcount as well as higher medical claims.  
Looking ahead to Q1. We expect underlying G&A expense to carry forward in the $90 million range as we continue to make tech investments, the majority of which are revenue-generating, to bolster our expanding digital and loyalty platform. These include initiatives that are customer-facing like app upgrades as well as behind-the-scenes initiatives like a new labor scheduling tool. In addition, we also plan to increase headcount in order to support our expected accelerated growth. 
Even with this elevated spend, our goal remains to deliver leverage on this line item relative to our sales growth. Stock comp will likely be around $23 million each quarter in 2021, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. We also expect to recognize around $4 million of employer taxes in Q1 associated with shares that vest at the beginning of our fiscal year.  
Lastly, our 2018 performance shares were modified to account for unplanned effects of COVID. This will result in a GAAP accounting charge of about $24 million for both Q1 and Q2, and about $8 million in Q3 and Q4. We plan to present non-GAAP results without these unusual charges to clearly show our underlying business performance.  
Our effective tax rate for Q4 was negative 62.2% on a GAAP basis and 24.6% on a non-GAAP basis. The difference is due to recognizing a net operating loss for tax purposes in 2020, which we expect to carry back to the preceding 5 years. We generated an NOL for tax purposes due to several factors, including the impact of COVID, increased tax deduction for equity, vesting and exercises, accelerated tax depreciation deductions and various tax planning initiatives. An income tax benefit is generated due to the difference in federal tax rates between 2020 and the years that the federal NOL will be carried back to.  
For fiscal 2021, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items such as stock option exercises. This range assumes no change to current income tax rate. And if corporate tax rates change as a result of tax reform under the Biden administration, we'll revisit our estimated effective tax rate.  
Turning now to the balance sheet, where we ended Q4 with $1.1 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments and no debt, along with a $600 million untapped credit facility. We're privileged to have this financial strength with which to make ongoing strategic investments in our people, our business and our communities to further differentiate Chipotle brand and support our expected growth for 2021 and beyond. We didn't buy back any stock in Q4, but if our business continues to improve and economy continues to stabilize, we will likely begin buying again in late Q1 or early Q2. 
One area that definitely benefited from our strong cash position is restaurant design and real state development, where we remain diligent and aggressive while many of our peers pulled back. I'm really impressed by the hard work of our development and operations team as they opened 61 new restaurants in the fourth quarter, with 42 including a Chipotlane. For the full year, they successfully navigated construction and permitting challenges and opened 161 new restaurants, with 100 including a Chipotlane. Remarkably, this was towards the high end of the 150 to 165 range we provided before the onset of the pandemic.  
As of year-end, we had a total of 170 Chipotlanes, including 5 conversions. Performance for these formats continues to be stellar. The digital gap versus non-Chipotlane restaurants remains around 10%, driven entirely by higher-margin digital pickup orders. And sales at the Chipotlane cohort continued to outperform the non-Chipotlane results from the same open period. In fact, non-comp Chipotlane sales are opening close to our existing restaurant AUV versus historical peak productivity in the mid- to high-80% range. These results reaffirm our strategy of an accelerated pivot towards Chipotlane sites. Not only will this enhance customer access and convenience, but it also helps increase new restaurant sales, margins and returns.  
While 62% of new restaurants in 2020 had a Chipotlane, our goal is to have more than 70% of openings include a Chipotlane in 2021, where we anticipate opening around 200 new restaurants. Of course, this development guidance assumes no major COVID-related delays in 2021. Guidance also includes remodeling or relocating 10 to 15 restaurants this year to add a Chipotlane. This will allow us to learn and ensure we're getting a superior return on this investment before potentially ramping up the number of remodels and our relocations in the future.  
Let me end by also expressing my gratitude to all of our team members in our restaurants and in support roles as they overcame countless challenges and embraced change to safely serve and delight our guests. It's through this collaborative effort that we've been able to achieve such an impressive performance in 2020 and continue to build momentum at the start of this year.  
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

And then, Jack, just the restaurant-level margins, you touched on that as well about how the 19.5 million or so was short of that relationship that you would have for a $2.2 million box, i.e., that should be 22% if you get your delivery economics up to speed. Should we be thinking about -- what is the buildup that -- in that margin through the year? How fast can you close that gap in that relationship? 
And I guess the last thing is, when it comes to the 2-year trend in comp, basically, if you look at The Street numbers, people are thinking a mid-teens 2-year or thereabout after we get vaccines.

And remember, COVID is going to be with us for at least a quarter or 2. I mean, the vaccine is not going to be widely available until more like midyear. So it's going to be more second half of the year. But I feel good about by the second half of the year that we should be closing the gap.

And currently, we're even testing now a car-side access. 
What I've seen is in the markets where we start to open those dining rooms up, you don't lose those occasions. You pick up the occasions that kind of got impacted by COVID. And it really is an and situation not an or. Now it's not 100% back in the dining room in some of these regions. But we're seeing 50%, 60% of the dining room business come back, and we're hanging on to 85%, 80% of our digital business. 
And as you walk into 2021, our digital system now has 19.5 million members. And what we have seen is they like the additional access, the convenience that it provides. And they like our ability to communicate with them through that rewards program. 
And so look, I think January is a great example of the strength of Chipotle's business still being impacted by COVID rolling over a year ago that didn't have COVID. And I think it just shows the power of the new access points, the way we're running our restaurants, the culture that we have in our restaurants. And then ultimately, our customers believe in the food, believe in the purpose. So very optimistic about where we get to. 
And as Jack pointed out, I think as the year goes on, you're going to continue to see us make progress on getting that algorithm back to where we said it will get to as COVID wanes and some of these expenses go away. And the delivery channel, we kind of normalize it into our business going forward."

There's indirect items as well. Like, for example, we're selling less beverages. We're selling like a few more burritos and more steaks. That seems a little counterintuitive why would COVID drive that, but we have a lot of new customers coming in, and they've been moving into those items. Unclear whether that will fully normalize after the pandemic. 
But I would say with the direct and indirect that we know about that comp delivery, it probably shows in that 50 to 100 basis points range. And then delivery all by itself [indiscernible]. Those are the biggest trends [indiscernible] they will normalize through this...

What I would say, David, is we're still seeing like that lunch occasion have a real opportunity. And what we've seen is in places where you have people moving around more, for whatever their routine is, you see that occasion still happening where they want to come into the restaurant. 
And look, I still think the occasion of the dining room experience gives you something unique. It's got another level of customization because you get to be face-to-face with how we're making your food versus the online occasion. And so when we talk to customers, there is a fair amount of people that when they have the opportunity, they will want to go back to their dining occasion. 
The thing that I find really promising in that is they've also adopted new off-premise digital occasions that they're not going to abandon. And when we look at the Venn diagram, the world where it used to be, they were exclusive. I only did online and I only do in dining, and there was a few that did both. That's changed. You've got a lot more people doing both. And we've got people that historically probably would not have tried it, if not for, unfortunately, COVID. But they still really love that in-restaurant experience, and now we're top of mind for that occasion when they're not going to be in the restaurant. 
So we're seeing a scenario where digital is going to prove to be very sticky, and people look forward to getting back out and going into our restaurants."

The price increase that we took, it covers the dollar cost of delivery, like there's an increase in delivery this year versus last year because so many people moved into that channel. And so the price increase we took so far, it gets us to about a breakeven versus last year in terms of a dollar -- from a dollar standpoint. 
But if you go through the math, and it's easiest to do this like on an annual basis, if you -- this 13% on 25% of the business ends up being about $80,000. And so look at the average cost of delivery being about $80,000 on average per restaurant. When you take that price increase, it ends up being a 3%, 3.25%, your sales will go up by about $80,000. And so you cover those dollars, your cash flow on a per-restaurant basis are the same. But if you go through the math and take the same cash flow and take 25%, which ends up being $625,000 of cash flow, that's $2.5 million at a 25% margin. And if your costs go up $80,000 and your revenue goes up by $80,000, your margin is going to go down by 80 basis points. 
And so we don't make any less money, but the margin does end up being diluted just because of the math. Now we think there are things that we can do, either levers we can pull, other efficiencies we can file. We think over time, we can offset that, but that's just a math challenge that we're dealing with."

So look, the first part of your question around the opportunity in the U.S. is we're very optimistic about Chipotlane and then the various executions we can pull off to bring Chipotle to every trade area in the United States that we think makes sense for Chipotle. And I think we've talked about that as, hey, we're accelerating, we're going to get back above 200. We're within striking distance of where the max level of development we did in the past. 
And so the economics look great. The new restaurant openings are opening really strong. Chipotlane continues to perform. And you see us experimenting with digital only. You'll see us experimenting with Chipotlanes only. 
But at the end of the day, I mean, the full business of Chipotle, where you got both lines, a Chipotlane as an access point with this digital system, it's just really winning economics, and there are a lot of those sites available in the U.S. 
To your question about international, obviously, we believe Chipotle can travel beyond the United States. We're already seeing some success in Canada. And then obviously, we've got some plans in place for places that we already have our foot in the door. So think of the U.K., France, specifically. And so you're going to see us starting to really use kind of our stage-gate process to move those markets along. 
And then we'll evaluate other regions accordingly. We've not made decisions on how we want to enter those other markets. And frankly, we haven't laid out exactly the order of how we're going to do it. For now, we want to deliver the U.S.. And where we already have some presence, we're going to start leaning into to see how much more upside there is. We have an idea. And then obviously, we're going to evaluate where we go beyond the markets that we currently are. 
But when we've done some research, what is clear is people love the purpose of Food with Integrity. They love the customization. They love the food. And frankly, the whole value proposition, I think, has legs well beyond the United States."

And what I can tell you is when I rewind the tapes when I first got here back in 2018, we were arguably spending about the same percent of dollars and nobody saw the brand. If I would have asked you what's Chipotle up to, you would not have been able to give me a good answer. Frankly, it would have been somebody else's narrative. 
And I think fast forward to where we are today, I know our brand is stronger from an awareness standpoint for what we stand for. I know the brand is stronger from a trust standpoint. I know the brand is stronger when it comes to our menu innovation as well as our approach to culinary. So we've made tremendous progress. The marketing team, I think, has done a fabulous job of keeping the brand in culture and leading culture. And you're going to continue to see us do that. 
I'm excited about bringing our message to the Super Bowl platform. I think it's going to be a very widely watched Super Bowl. And a lot of customers say to us, ""I feel good about eating at Chipotle,"" but they can't articulate why. We're going to tell them why they feel good about it. Obviously, they love the culinary aspect. But now they're going to get clarity on why they feel good about why they choose the brand Chipotle. And you'll see it in the advertising around our approach to farming, animals, sustainability, and frankly, the communities that we support and operate in. 
And then your second question about cauliflower rice. Look, I love it. It's really good. I highly recommend it if you haven't tried it. I'd recommend going 50-50, a little brown rice and cauliflower rice. But with that said, the good news is about 25% of our orders are coming from new or infrequent customers, which is really terrific.

Luckily, every day seems to be better with this -- with the whole COVID issue both -- vaccine rates seem to be going up and COVID cases seem to be going down. And luckily, less and less people are ending up in the hospital. So I'm optimistic, but we wanted to be conservative on that front.

We surged after Christmas and then surged again in January. So we're definitely at a higher level right now. 
And in terms of the guidance, Brian mentioned before, the first quarter is still difficult to predict. We don't know where COVID is going next. We're optimistic because the vaccines are getting traction. But it essentially takes the last week trend, which we talked about in the script. We -- while we did overall 11% for January, we had moved down into the high single digits at the last week of January. If you take that trend and move that out over the rest of the quarter, that's what we use to calculate that guidance of mid- to high-teens."

We are pleased to report a strong ending to what has been a challenging year. Even today, a few Chipotle restaurants remain fully closed, while only about 60% of our dining rooms are open with reduced capacity, with the rest being available for to-go services. Despite this challenging backdrop, our results demonstrate that Chipotle restaurants with the right leaders and culture, along with excellent culinary, can deliver outstanding performance in any environment. Most importantly, none of this would be possible without our dedicated team members that strive to deliver a great guest experience on a daily basis. The pandemic has presented new challenges for all of us, and our team has successfully navigated every one of them. I thank our team members for their ongoing commitment to serving our guests as well as supporting each other and could not be prouder of their efforts. 
Before we dive into our financial results, let me reflect back on 2020 and highlight a few key accomplishments that have helped propel Chipotle's mission of cultivating a better world. These include a paramount focus on industry-leading protocols that help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and guests, providing jobs with industry-leading benefits to nearly 88,000 people and paying out nearly $40 million in discretionary bonuses and assistance pay to our restaurant team members as well as over $13 million of tuition costs for employees furthering their education; prioritizing diversity, equality and inclusion efforts across the company; and raising nearly $4 million in support of organizations; helping underserved communities; and investing in the future of farming through grants, long-term contracts and the Aluminaries Project 2.0.  
As a purpose-driven organization, we're already hard at work identifying ways that we can make a positive impact on the world in 2021. We are optimistic about the future and look forward to continuing to deliver on our promises and passionately play an active supportive role in our communities.  
Now let's focus on our business performance, where for the fourth quarter, we reported sales of $1.6 billion, representing 11.6% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 5.7% comparable restaurant sales growth; restaurant-level margins of 19.5%, which is 30 basis points higher than last year; and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $3.48, representing an increase of 21.7% year-over-year. 
Comparable restaurant sales were fairly consistent in each month of Q4, due to a combination of factors, including healthy demand for carne asada, strength in our digital platform and the delivery menu price increase. Q1 has also started on a very positive note with comparable restaurant sales for January accelerating to around 11%, despite a double digit comparison. Even with a resurgence in COVID cases, the 2-year compounded comp stack in Q4 was a robust 19.9%, which is similar to the 20.2% we delivered last quarter and highlights the resiliency of the Chipotle brand. 
In light of the ever-changing environment we all experienced in 2020, our full-year performance showed good progress, with sales growing 7.1% to reach $6 billion, driven by a 1.8% comp, 161 new restaurant openings and digital sales of $2.8 billion, which grew 174% versus the prior year. 
As you can see from these results, our key strategies continue to resonate with guests and position us to win today while we create the future. What really excites me and the entire leadership team is our vision of having more than 6,000 restaurants and expanding AUVs above $2.5 million with margins at or above 25%, all of which is a question of when, not if. 
Let me now provide a brief update on each of these strategies, which I believe still have plenty of runway. These are: number one, making the brand visible, relevant and loved; number two, utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation; number three, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement; number four, engaging with customers through our loyalty program; and number five, running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in restaurant and digital experiences.  
Beginning with our marketing programs, which are generating attractive returns by driving culture, driving a difference and ultimately driving purchase. Our creative marketing initiatives across both traditional and digital channels continue to be successful in attracting new users to Chipotle as well as motivating existing customers to come more often.  
Whether it was switching our Halloween celebration to an entirely digital offering for the first time, unveiling a new line of Chipotle merchandise ahead of the holiday season or launching Real Foodprint, a sustainability impact tracker that shows how Chipotle ingredients are better for the planet, the marketing team did a terrific job consistently enhancing our brand and purpose using the right message with the right vehicle. 
Traditional advertising also remains an important marketing tool for Chipotle. We connected and engaged with guests through our Behind the Foil TV campaign and a new avocado journey spot, highlighting real ingredients, real cooking techniques and real employees. We also featured our making an order spot that highlights the ease of customizing your order on our app to continue to drive awareness of digital ordering.  
And last week, we announced our first-ever Super Bowl commercial that will air during the second quarter beginning this Sunday. The spot is titled, Can a Burrito Change the World, and highlights Chipotle's commitment to cultivating a better world through its real food, sustainable sourcing and commitment to the farming industry. Supplementing these efforts are a steady flow of new menu innovation that is validated by our stage-gate process, which gives new and existing customers even more reasons to visit Chipotle.  
Since our initial offering of carne asada ended last year, we continued hearing from our guests that they wanted it back. So we found a way to source more tender cuts of steak that met our Food with Integrity standards and brought it back for a limited time across the U.S. and Canada as well as in France for the first time. The relaunch, which we expect to last through early March, is going well, and we're encouraged that the incidence mix is similar to what we saw last year.  
In addition, in January, we launched Cilantro-Lime Cauliflower Rice for limited time across the U.S. and Canada. We're excited to introduce this plant-powered better-for-you option that aligns with the latest health trends and emphasizes the benefits of real food. With only 4 grams of net carbs per serving, it puts a delicious twist on Chipotle's classic rice recipe by using the same fresh, real ingredients and culinary techniques. 
Early feedback has been outstanding. Cauliflower rice is definitely on trend, a great reason for new guests to try Chipotle for the first time or entice existing guests to visit more often, and it keeps our Lifestyle Bowls platform top of mind.  
We have 2 other menu items currently being tested. The first is quesadillas, which is available as a digital-only menu option in a few test markets. We continue to make operational progress and remain optimistic about the potential for quesadillas to be available nationwide in the near future. The second item is our smoked brisket, which is currently being tested and showing encouraging results. I personally love the richness of our smoked brisket recipe as it delivers a flavor unlike anything else at Chipotle. We are gaining valuable feedback on both of these items, and we'll update you on their progress as well as other menu items that are in early development as they move through our stage-gate process.  
Moving to the next strategic driver, our digital platform, which continues to be a big beneficiary from guests adopting the digital off-premise occasion. Q4 digital sales grew 177% year-over-year to $781 million and represented 49% of sales. This was consistent with Q3 digital sales and mix, highlighting our ongoing momentum and the fact that Chipotle is top of mind for a lot more eating and dining occasions than we were in the past. 
We are not stopping there. We've made our digital channel even more convenient with easy ordering in the Chipotle app and website enhancements such as unlimited customization, contactless delivery and group ordering. 
As a result, and I mentioned this earlier, full year digital sales were $2.8 billion, representing 46% of total sales and growing 174% year-over-year. What an amazing accomplishment. At this sales rate, our average restaurant delivers a digital AUV of $1.1 million.  
With this success, we will not allow complacency to set in. Rather, we will continue to look for ways to further enhance our digital ecosystem. For example, we just announced a car-side pickup pilot in San Jose as an additional access point for our guests. In addition, we are opening up more and more Chipotlanes and are in the early stages of testing alternative formats like our first-ever digital-only restaurant outside of West Point. This new prototype allows us to enter more trade areas that wouldn't support a full-size restaurant and allows for greater flexibility with future locations. It's early days, but this location has outperformed our expectations thus far.  
During the quarter, about half of the digital sales came via order-ahead and pickup transactions or digital pickup orders, as we refer to them, with the remainder coming from the delivery channel. However, our overall digital mix moved up about 50% late in the quarter as COVID restrictions toughened, largely driven by an increase in digital pickup orders. I'm pleased to report that the strong digital momentum has continued into January, with our digital mix remaining in the low-50% range. 
Another area where we saw a big benefit in 2020 is our rewards program, which added over 10 million members in the last year and currently has nearly 19.5 million enrolled members. This gives us the ability to communicate organically with a large and passionate community of Chipotle fans. We have focused on strengthening our creative and analytical capabilities by using predictive modeling to ensure that our members feel known and valued as we elevate their relationship with Chipotle. We strategically share brand and promotional messages with personalized content weekly.  
In addition, we reach customers with dedicated journeys focused on welcoming new members, growing frequency and minimizing lapsing behavior. There are preprogrammed touch points in place to drive customer value across their life cycle, including a keen focus on retaining digital customers who have experienced the brand in new ways over the last year.  
Although Chipotle Rewards and its CRM capability have been active for less than 2 years, we have already made significant progress and have further enhancements planned in the coming months that we expect will continue to drive frequency increases across our customer segments.  
Finally, I want to spend some time on our restaurant operations, where the team stayed focused on safety, reliability and excellent culinary as it seamlessly adapted to abrupt changes in guest needs and ordering patterns. This hasn't been easy, especially as the number of COVID cases began to spike and at times impacted our staffing capabilities. But they have been up to the challenge, and I'm so proud of our operational leaders and team members. They have been unwavering in the desire and execution of the right things for each other, our customers, our community and our business.  
And as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, Chipotle has continued to reward and invest in our team members to ensure we are creating an environment that allows our employees to develop and thrive in their career, not only today but also in the future. We offer best-in-class benefits coupled with training, development and promotional opportunities that foster a learning culture for continual growth.  
Turnover continues to be relatively stable, and we are seeing plenty of great applicants for open positions to staff our expected growth in AUV and new restaurant openings. In fact, we held our first national hiring event of the year called Coast-to-Coast Career Day in mid-January with a goal of employing 15,000 new restaurant team members across the U.S. We had an overwhelming response and feel fortunate to have a reputation for attracting and developing great talent.  
In closing, I believe our performance in 2020 was, in some ways, even more impressive than what we achieved in 2019 and highlights that the Chipotle brand has remained visible and flexible in order to stay relevant. Our ability to pivot and adapt to the rapidly changing needs of our guests is a testament to the durability of our model and the strength of our team members. My sincere thanks to our employees for their passion to make Chipotle a welcoming place for all and a special place to work.  
As we look ahead, the rollout of vaccines gives us hope that the world can return to a more normal environment at some point during 2021. And I'm optimistic that resiliency will prevail as people want to get back together to share a meal and share some stories.  
In the meantime, we're ready to navigate through any potential challenges. With world-class talent, an inclusive culture, strong business fundamentals and deep financial strength, we feel well prepared to emerge even stronger post-COVID and continue to serve and delight our guests.  
With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials."

Despite ongoing challenges related to COVID, we're pleased to report solid fourth quarter results, with sales growing 11.6% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as comp sales grew 5.7%. Restaurant-level margin of 19.5% was 30 basis points higher than last year. And earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $3.48, representing a 21.7% year-over-year increase.  
The fourth quarter had a nonrecurring tax benefit was partially offset by expenses related to legal reserves, restaurant asset impairments and closure costs, transformation expenses and other adjustments, which netted to positively impact our earnings per share by $3.21, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $6.69.  
For the full year, sales increased 7.1% to $6 billion on a comp increase of 1.8%. Restaurant-level margins were 17.4%, a decrease of 310 basis points. And we generated earnings per share adjusted for unusual expenses of $10.73, a decrease of 23.6% over last year. We had nonrecurring tax benefit that was partially offset by expenses related to legal reserves, restaurant asset impairment and closure costs as well as our transformation that positively impacted our earnings per share by $1.79, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $12.52.  
While the uncertainty from COVID makes it difficult to provide comp guidance for full year 2021, we remain optimistic about our future prospects, as evidenced by a great start to Q1, with January comps accelerating to roughly 11% despite a very difficult comparison. Sales in last week of January were in the high single digits, with winter weather across the country contributing to the lower comp. Assuming the pandemic doesn't worsen, we expect our Q1 comp to be in the mid- to high-teens range, given an easier comparison during the second half of March.  
Food cost were 31% in Q4, a decrease of 210 basis points from last year, and this was due primarily to menu price increases, along with better waste control, partially offset by fewer sales of high-margin beverages and higher dairy pricing. In Q1, we expect food costs to remain right around 31% as the benefit from a full quarter of menu price increases will be offset by higher cost menu items such as cauliflower rice as well as slightly higher avocado prices.  
Labor costs for the quarter were 25.4%, a decrease of 110 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage and efficiencies related to digital orders, partially offset by COVID-related expenses, including exclusion pay as well as normal labor inflation. We expect labor costs to be right around 25% during Q1, as expected benefit from sales leverage is offset by ongoing COVID-related expenses. Other operating costs for the quarter was 17.9%, an increase of 310 basis points from last year, due primarily to higher delivery fees in the quarter. 
Delivery expenses were elevated year-over-year given the significant growth in delivery, with delivery sales now nearly 25% of total sales. To help improve the economics on this premium access point, we have implemented several delivery menu price differentials with a weighted average being right around 13%. We have seen modest resistance thus far, and we'll continue to monitor and adjust pricing as appropriate at the market level or at the restaurant level.  
Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 3.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. But as expected, it was 130 basis point sequential increase from Q3 to support carne asada and the latest brand messaging under our Behind the Foil campaign. We expect marketing spend to be near 4% in Q1, which would be the highest quarterly level during 2021, in order to support new menu items as well as the upcoming Super Bowl ad.  
As a result of the higher anticipated marketing demand and ongoing momentum in our delivery business, we expect other operating costs to be right around 17% in Q1. The Q4 restaurant-level margin was 19.5%, while our trailing 12-month average unit volumes were roughly $2.2 million, which is back to our pre-COVID level. We expect to close much of this margin gap versus the 22% expected at this volume in 2021 as COVID-related impacts and delivery economics normalize and as quarterly marketing expenses even out. 
Note that some of this gap relates to delivery accounting as increased delivery menu prices as well as delivery and service fees had the effect of grossing up, which may create the appearance that margin algorithm gap is widening. Therefore, we now disclose our AUVs with and without the delivery menu price increase to provide better clarity and transparency.  
G&A for the quarter was $124 million on a GAAP basis or $114 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding roughly $7 million for settlement of several older legal matters and nearly $3 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes $90 million in underlying G&A, $21 million related to noncash stock comp and a $4 million bonus performance adjustment due to our strong performance in 2020 despite the pandemic.  
We are still in the early innings of our growth life cycle, and therefore, continue to make important G&A investments in 2020 despite the COVID pandemic. We saw an uptick in Q4 underlying G&A due to technology investments, customer service enhancements, increased headcount as well as higher medical claims.  
Looking ahead to Q1. We expect underlying G&A expense to carry forward in the $90 million range as we continue to make tech investments, the majority of which are revenue-generating, to bolster our expanding digital and loyalty platform. These include initiatives that are customer-facing like app upgrades as well as behind-the-scenes initiatives like a new labor scheduling tool. In addition, we also plan to increase headcount in order to support our expected accelerated growth. 
Even with this elevated spend, our goal remains to deliver leverage on this line item relative to our sales growth. Stock comp will likely be around $23 million each quarter in 2021, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. We also expect to recognize around $4 million of employer taxes in Q1 associated with shares that vest at the beginning of our fiscal year.  
Lastly, our 2018 performance shares were modified to account for unplanned effects of COVID. This will result in a GAAP accounting charge of about $24 million for both Q1 and Q2, and about $8 million in Q3 and Q4. We plan to present non-GAAP results without these unusual charges to clearly show our underlying business performance.  
Our effective tax rate for Q4 was negative 62.2% on a GAAP basis and 24.6% on a non-GAAP basis. The difference is due to recognizing a net operating loss for tax purposes in 2020, which we expect to carry back to the preceding 5 years. We generated an NOL for tax purposes due to several factors, including the impact of COVID, increased tax deduction for equity, vesting and exercises, accelerated tax depreciation deductions and various tax planning initiatives. An income tax benefit is generated due to the difference in federal tax rates between 2020 and the years that the federal NOL will be carried back to.  
For fiscal 2021, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items such as stock option exercises. This range assumes no change to current income tax rate. And if corporate tax rates change as a result of tax reform under the Biden administration, we'll revisit our estimated effective tax rate.  
Turning now to the balance sheet, where we ended Q4 with $1.1 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments and no debt, along with a $600 million untapped credit facility. We're privileged to have this financial strength with which to make ongoing strategic investments in our people, our business and our communities to further differentiate Chipotle brand and support our expected growth for 2021 and beyond. We didn't buy back any stock in Q4, but if our business continues to improve and economy continues to stabilize, we will likely begin buying again in late Q1 or early Q2. 
One area that definitely benefited from our strong cash position is restaurant design and real state development, where we remain diligent and aggressive while many of our peers pulled back. I'm really impressed by the hard work of our development and operations team as they opened 61 new restaurants in the fourth quarter, with 42 including a Chipotlane. For the full year, they successfully navigated construction and permitting challenges and opened 161 new restaurants, with 100 including a Chipotlane. Remarkably, this was towards the high end of the 150 to 165 range we provided before the onset of the pandemic.  
As of year-end, we had a total of 170 Chipotlanes, including 5 conversions. Performance for these formats continues to be stellar. The digital gap versus non-Chipotlane restaurants remains around 10%, driven entirely by higher-margin digital pickup orders. And sales at the Chipotlane cohort continued to outperform the non-Chipotlane results from the same open period. In fact, non-comp Chipotlane sales are opening close to our existing restaurant AUV versus historical peak productivity in the mid- to high-80% range. These results reaffirm our strategy of an accelerated pivot towards Chipotlane sites. Not only will this enhance customer access and convenience, but it also helps increase new restaurant sales, margins and returns.  
While 62% of new restaurants in 2020 had a Chipotlane, our goal is to have more than 70% of openings include a Chipotlane in 2021, where we anticipate opening around 200 new restaurants. Of course, this development guidance assumes no major COVID-related delays in 2021. Guidance also includes remodeling or relocating 10 to 15 restaurants this year to add a Chipotlane. This will allow us to learn and ensure we're getting a superior return on this investment before potentially ramping up the number of remodels and our relocations in the future.  
Let me end by also expressing my gratitude to all of our team members in our restaurants and in support roles as they overcame countless challenges and embraced change to safely serve and delight our guests. It's through this collaborative effort that we've been able to achieve such an impressive performance in 2020 and continue to build momentum at the start of this year.  
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

And then, Jack, just the restaurant-level margins, you touched on that as well about how the 19.5 million or so was short of that relationship that you would have for a $2.2 million box, i.e., that should be 22% if you get your delivery economics up to speed. Should we be thinking about -- what is the buildup that -- in that margin through the year? How fast can you close that gap in that relationship? 
And I guess the last thing is, when it comes to the 2-year trend in comp, basically, if you look at The Street numbers, people are thinking a mid-teens 2-year or thereabout after we get vaccines.

But we can see, as COVID-19 begins to be in the review mirror and as we have taken some action and we consider other action and how we're going to offset the margin impact of delivery, I would expect by the end of the year. And remember, COVID is going to be with us for at least a quarter or 2. I mean, the vaccine is not going to be widely available until more like midyear. So it's going to be more second half of the year. But I feel good about by the second half of the year that we should be closing the gap.

And currently, we're even testing now a car-side access. 
What I've seen is in the markets where we start to open those dining rooms up, you don't lose those occasions. You pick up the occasions that kind of got impacted by COVID. And it really is an and situation not an or. Now it's not 100% back in the dining room in some of these regions. But we're seeing 50%, 60% of the dining room business come back, and we're hanging on to 85%, 80% of our digital business. 
And as you walk into 2021, our digital system now has 19.5 million members. And what we have seen is they like the additional access, the convenience that it provides. And they like our ability to communicate with them through that rewards program. 
And so look, I think January is a great example of the strength of Chipotle's business still being impacted by COVID rolling over a year ago that didn't have COVID. And I think it just shows the power of the new access points, the way we're running our restaurants, the culture that we have in our restaurants. And then ultimately, our customers believe in the food, believe in the purpose. So very optimistic about where we get to. 
And as Jack pointed out, I think as the year goes on, you're going to continue to see us make progress on getting that algorithm back to where we said it will get to as COVID wanes and some of these expenses go away. And the delivery channel, we kind of normalize it into our business going forward."

What I would say, David, is we're still seeing like that lunch occasion have a real opportunity. And what we've seen is in places where you have people moving around more, for whatever their routine is, you see that occasion still happening where they want to come into the restaurant. 
And look, I still think the occasion of the dining room experience gives you something unique. It's got another level of customization because you get to be face-to-face with how we're making your food versus the online occasion. And so when we talk to customers, there is a fair amount of people that when they have the opportunity, they will want to go back to their dining occasion. 
The thing that I find really promising in that is they've also adopted new off-premise digital occasions that they're not going to abandon. And when we look at the Venn diagram, the world where it used to be, they were exclusive. I only did online and I only do in dining, and there was a few that did both. That's changed. You've got a lot more people doing both. And we've got people that historically probably would not have tried it, if not for, unfortunately, COVID. But they still really love that in-restaurant experience, and now we're top of mind for that occasion when they're not going to be in the restaurant. 
So we're seeing a scenario where digital is going to prove to be very sticky, and people look forward to getting back out and going into our restaurants."

And the good news is we believe we're learning more every day. But what we've learned to date, I think, is going to have a powerful tailwind for us going forward. And if you think about 2020, we started the year with, I think it was less than 10 million in our system.

The price increase that we took, it covers the dollar cost of delivery, like there's an increase in delivery this year versus last year because so many people moved into that channel. And so the price increase we took so far, it gets us to about a breakeven versus last year in terms of a dollar -- from a dollar standpoint. 
But if you go through the math, and it's easiest to do this like on an annual basis, if you -- this 13% on 25% of the business ends up being about $80,000. And so look at the average cost of delivery being about $80,000 on average per restaurant. When you take that price increase, it ends up being a 3%, 3.25%, your sales will go up by about $80,000. And so you cover those dollars, your cash flow on a per-restaurant basis are the same. But if you go through the math and take the same cash flow and take 25%, which ends up being $625,000 of cash flow, that's $2.5 million at a 25% margin. And if your costs go up $80,000 and your revenue goes up by $80,000, your margin is going to go down by 80 basis points. 
And so we don't make any less money, but the margin does end up being diluted just because of the math. Now we think there are things that we can do, either levers we can pull, other efficiencies we can file. We think over time, we can offset that, but that's just a math challenge that we're dealing with."

And you haven't -- we haven't spoken about international in a long, long time. I think France was thrown into one of the comments. Is it a moment now where you start to really think about a global opportunity and start to talk and engage with either master franchisees or your own organization, how you do that?

Sure. So look, the first part of your question around the opportunity in the U.S. is we're very optimistic about Chipotlane and then the various executions we can pull off to bring Chipotle to every trade area in the United States that we think makes sense for Chipotle. And I think we've talked about that as, hey, we're accelerating, we're going to get back above 200. We're within striking distance of where the max level of development we did in the past. 
And so the economics look great. The new restaurant openings are opening really strong. Chipotlane continues to perform. And you see us experimenting with digital only. You'll see us experimenting with Chipotlanes only. 
But at the end of the day, I mean, the full business of Chipotle, where you got both lines, a Chipotlane as an access point with this digital system, it's just really winning economics, and there are a lot of those sites available in the U.S. 
To your question about international, obviously, we believe Chipotle can travel beyond the United States. We're already seeing some success in Canada. And then obviously, we've got some plans in place for places that we already have our foot in the door. So think of the U.K., France, specifically. And so you're going to see us starting to really use kind of our stage-gate process to move those markets along. 
And then we'll evaluate other regions accordingly. We've not made decisions on how we want to enter those other markets. And frankly, we haven't laid out exactly the order of how we're going to do it. For now, we want to deliver the U.S.. And where we already have some presence, we're going to start leaning into to see how much more upside there is. We have an idea. And then obviously, we're going to evaluate where we go beyond the markets that we currently are. 
But when we've done some research, what is clear is people love the purpose of Food with Integrity. They love the customization. They love the food. And frankly, the whole value proposition, I think, has legs well beyond the United States."

So you're going to see us continue to push the visibility of Chipotle and the idea of real food with real cooking, real culinary done, frankly, every day. 
And what I can tell you is when I rewind the tapes when I first got here back in 2018, we were arguably spending about the same percent of dollars and nobody saw the brand. If I would have asked you what's Chipotle up to, you would not have been able to give me a good answer. Frankly, it would have been somebody else's narrative. 
And I think fast forward to where we are today, I know our brand is stronger from an awareness standpoint for what we stand for. I know the brand is stronger from a trust standpoint. I know the brand is stronger when it comes to our menu innovation as well as our approach to culinary. So we've made tremendous progress. The marketing team, I think, has done a fabulous job of keeping the brand in culture and leading culture. And you're going to continue to see us do that. 
I'm excited about bringing our message to the Super Bowl platform. I think it's going to be a very widely watched Super Bowl. And a lot of customers say to us, ""I feel good about eating at Chipotle,"" but they can't articulate why. We're going to tell them why they feel good about it. Obviously, they love the culinary aspect. But now they're going to get clarity on why they feel good about why they choose the brand Chipotle. And you'll see it in the advertising around our approach to farming, animals, sustainability, and frankly, the communities that we support and operate in. 
And then your second question about cauliflower rice. Look, I love it. It's really good. I highly recommend it if you haven't tried it. I'd recommend going 50-50, a little brown rice and cauliflower rice. But with that said, the good news is about 25% of our orders are coming from new or infrequent customers, which is really terrific. So it's off to a great start, and our operators are doing a great job of making the cauliflower absolutely perfect. So we're really happy with how that's come out of the gate."

Does guidance reflect uncertainty over the course of the pandemic or more so conservatism as quesadillas are expected to launch later in the quarter?

So we're being careful on that front. 
And then obviously, as we are able to lock and load on new initiatives, we'll share that with you guys. We're still in the phase of making sure we've got the equipment rolled out everywhere. And we're feeling really good about the training we're going to do around quesadilla. So more to come on that front. 
But I would say more of it is just there's still a lot of unknown. Luckily, every day seems to be better with this -- with the whole COVID issue both -- vaccine rates seem to be going up and COVID cases seem to be going down. And luckily, less and less people are ending up in the hospital. So I'm optimistic, but we wanted to be conservative on that front. 
And then regarding catering, yes, look, Andrew, I think it's a huge opportunity. Once people want to get back together, I think it's going to be a real big opportunity for our business. And it's one of the areas we're thinking about. And we're going to figure out the right time to start pushing that once, obviously, people can get back together in groups in a meaningful way. 
So it's a big opportunity. I wish we -- the first step will be getting back to 1% of our sales doing catering. And then the next step will be tracking down numbers that I think are much higher than where we were with 1%."

We are pleased to report a strong ending to what has been a challenging year. Even today, a few Chipotle restaurants remain fully closed, while only about 60% of our dining rooms are open with reduced capacity, with the rest being available for to-go services. Despite this challenging backdrop, our results demonstrate that Chipotle restaurants with the right leaders and culture, along with excellent culinary, can deliver outstanding performance in any environment. Most importantly, none of this would be possible without our dedicated team members that strive to deliver a great guest experience on a daily basis. The pandemic has presented new challenges for all of us, and our team has successfully navigated every one of them. I thank our team members for their ongoing commitment to serving our guests as well as supporting each other and could not be prouder of their efforts. 
Before we dive into our financial results, let me reflect back on 2020 and highlight a few key accomplishments that have helped propel Chipotle's mission of cultivating a better world. These include a paramount focus on industry-leading protocols that help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and guests, providing jobs with industry-leading benefits to nearly 88,000 people and paying out nearly $40 million in discretionary bonuses and assistance pay to our restaurant team members as well as over $13 million of tuition costs for employees furthering their education; prioritizing diversity, equality and inclusion efforts across the company; and raising nearly $4 million in support of organizations; helping underserved communities; and investing in the future of farming through grants, long-term contracts and the Aluminaries Project 2.0.  
As a purpose-driven organization, we're already hard at work identifying ways that we can make a positive impact on the world in 2021. We are optimistic about the future and look forward to continuing to deliver on our promises and passionately play an active supportive role in our communities.  
Now let's focus on our business performance, where for the fourth quarter, we reported sales of $1.6 billion, representing 11.6% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 5.7% comparable restaurant sales growth; restaurant-level margins of 19.5%, which is 30 basis points higher than last year; and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $3.48, representing an increase of 21.7% year-over-year. 
Comparable restaurant sales were fairly consistent in each month of Q4, due to a combination of factors, including healthy demand for carne asada, strength in our digital platform and the delivery menu price increase. Q1 has also started on a very positive note with comparable restaurant sales for January accelerating to around 11%, despite a double digit comparison. Even with a resurgence in COVID cases, the 2-year compounded comp stack in Q4 was a robust 19.9%, which is similar to the 20.2% we delivered last quarter and highlights the resiliency of the Chipotle brand. 
In light of the ever-changing environment we all experienced in 2020, our full-year performance showed good progress, with sales growing 7.1% to reach $6 billion, driven by a 1.8% comp, 161 new restaurant openings and digital sales of $2.8 billion, which grew 174% versus the prior year. 
As you can see from these results, our key strategies continue to resonate with guests and position us to win today while we create the future. What really excites me and the entire leadership team is our vision of having more than 6,000 restaurants and expanding AUVs above $2.5 million with margins at or above 25%, all of which is a question of when, not if. 
Let me now provide a brief update on each of these strategies, which I believe still have plenty of runway. These are: number one, making the brand visible, relevant and loved; number two, utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation; number three, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement; number four, engaging with customers through our loyalty program; and number five, running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in restaurant and digital experiences.  
Beginning with our marketing programs, which are generating attractive returns by driving culture, driving a difference and ultimately driving purchase. Our creative marketing initiatives across both traditional and digital channels continue to be successful in attracting new users to Chipotle as well as motivating existing customers to come more often.  
Whether it was switching our Halloween celebration to an entirely digital offering for the first time, unveiling a new line of Chipotle merchandise ahead of the holiday season or launching Real Foodprint, a sustainability impact tracker that shows how Chipotle ingredients are better for the planet, the marketing team did a terrific job consistently enhancing our brand and purpose using the right message with the right vehicle. 
Traditional advertising also remains an important marketing tool for Chipotle. We connected and engaged with guests through our Behind the Foil TV campaign and a new avocado journey spot, highlighting real ingredients, real cooking techniques and real employees. We also featured our making an order spot that highlights the ease of customizing your order on our app to continue to drive awareness of digital ordering.  
And last week, we announced our first-ever Super Bowl commercial that will air during the second quarter beginning this Sunday. The spot is titled, Can a Burrito Change the World, and highlights Chipotle's commitment to cultivating a better world through its real food, sustainable sourcing and commitment to the farming industry. Supplementing these efforts are a steady flow of new menu innovation that is validated by our stage-gate process, which gives new and existing customers even more reasons to visit Chipotle.  
Since our initial offering of carne asada ended last year, we continued hearing from our guests that they wanted it back. So we found a way to source more tender cuts of steak that met our Food with Integrity standards and brought it back for a limited time across the U.S. and Canada as well as in France for the first time. The relaunch, which we expect to last through early March, is going well, and we're encouraged that the incidence mix is similar to what we saw last year.  
In addition, in January, we launched Cilantro-Lime Cauliflower Rice for limited time across the U.S. and Canada. We're excited to introduce this plant-powered better-for-you option that aligns with the latest health trends and emphasizes the benefits of real food. With only 4 grams of net carbs per serving, it puts a delicious twist on Chipotle's classic rice recipe by using the same fresh, real ingredients and culinary techniques. 
Early feedback has been outstanding. Cauliflower rice is definitely on trend, a great reason for new guests to try Chipotle for the first time or entice existing guests to visit more often, and it keeps our Lifestyle Bowls platform top of mind.  
We have 2 other menu items currently being tested. The first is quesadillas, which is available as a digital-only menu option in a few test markets. We continue to make operational progress and remain optimistic about the potential for quesadillas to be available nationwide in the near future. The second item is our smoked brisket, which is currently being tested and showing encouraging results. I personally love the richness of our smoked brisket recipe as it delivers a flavor unlike anything else at Chipotle. We are gaining valuable feedback on both of these items, and we'll update you on their progress as well as other menu items that are in early development as they move through our stage-gate process.  
Moving to the next strategic driver, our digital platform, which continues to be a big beneficiary from guests adopting the digital off-premise occasion. Q4 digital sales grew 177% year-over-year to $781 million and represented 49% of sales. This was consistent with Q3 digital sales and mix, highlighting our ongoing momentum and the fact that Chipotle is top of mind for a lot more eating and dining occasions than we were in the past. 
We are not stopping there. We've made our digital channel even more convenient with easy ordering in the Chipotle app and website enhancements such as unlimited customization, contactless delivery and group ordering. 
As a result, and I mentioned this earlier, full year digital sales were $2.8 billion, representing 46% of total sales and growing 174% year-over-year. What an amazing accomplishment. At this sales rate, our average restaurant delivers a digital AUV of $1.1 million.  
With this success, we will not allow complacency to set in. Rather, we will continue to look for ways to further enhance our digital ecosystem. For example, we just announced a car-side pickup pilot in San Jose as an additional access point for our guests. In addition, we are opening up more and more Chipotlanes and are in the early stages of testing alternative formats like our first-ever digital-only restaurant outside of West Point. This new prototype allows us to enter more trade areas that wouldn't support a full-size restaurant and allows for greater flexibility with future locations. It's early days, but this location has outperformed our expectations thus far.  
During the quarter, about half of the digital sales came via order-ahead and pickup transactions or digital pickup orders, as we refer to them, with the remainder coming from the delivery channel. However, our overall digital mix moved up about 50% late in the quarter as COVID restrictions toughened, largely driven by an increase in digital pickup orders. I'm pleased to report that the strong digital momentum has continued into January, with our digital mix remaining in the low-50% range. 
Another area where we saw a big benefit in 2020 is our rewards program, which added over 10 million members in the last year and currently has nearly 19.5 million enrolled members. This gives us the ability to communicate organically with a large and passionate community of Chipotle fans. We have focused on strengthening our creative and analytical capabilities by using predictive modeling to ensure that our members feel known and valued as we elevate their relationship with Chipotle. We strategically share brand and promotional messages with personalized content weekly.  
In addition, we reach customers with dedicated journeys focused on welcoming new members, growing frequency and minimizing lapsing behavior. There are preprogrammed touch points in place to drive customer value across their life cycle, including a keen focus on retaining digital customers who have experienced the brand in new ways over the last year.  
Although Chipotle Rewards and its CRM capability have been active for less than 2 years, we have already made significant progress and have further enhancements planned in the coming months that we expect will continue to drive frequency increases across our customer segments.  
Finally, I want to spend some time on our restaurant operations, where the team stayed focused on safety, reliability and excellent culinary as it seamlessly adapted to abrupt changes in guest needs and ordering patterns. This hasn't been easy, especially as the number of COVID cases began to spike and at times impacted our staffing capabilities. But they have been up to the challenge, and I'm so proud of our operational leaders and team members. They have been unwavering in the desire and execution of the right things for each other, our customers, our community and our business.  
And as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, Chipotle has continued to reward and invest in our team members to ensure we are creating an environment that allows our employees to develop and thrive in their career, not only today but also in the future. We offer best-in-class benefits coupled with training, development and promotional opportunities that foster a learning culture for continual growth.  
Turnover continues to be relatively stable, and we are seeing plenty of great applicants for open positions to staff our expected growth in AUV and new restaurant openings. In fact, we held our first national hiring event of the year called Coast-to-Coast Career Day in mid-January with a goal of employing 15,000 new restaurant team members across the U.S. We had an overwhelming response and feel fortunate to have a reputation for attracting and developing great talent.  
In closing, I believe our performance in 2020 was, in some ways, even more impressive than what we achieved in 2019 and highlights that the Chipotle brand has remained visible and flexible in order to stay relevant. Our ability to pivot and adapt to the rapidly changing needs of our guests is a testament to the durability of our model and the strength of our team members. My sincere thanks to our employees for their passion to make Chipotle a welcoming place for all and a special place to work.  
As we look ahead, the rollout of vaccines gives us hope that the world can return to a more normal environment at some point during 2021. And I'm optimistic that resiliency will prevail as people want to get back together to share a meal and share some stories.  
In the meantime, we're ready to navigate through any potential challenges. With world-class talent, an inclusive culture, strong business fundamentals and deep financial strength, we feel well prepared to emerge even stronger post-COVID and continue to serve and delight our guests.  
With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials."

Despite ongoing challenges related to COVID, we're pleased to report solid fourth quarter results, with sales growing 11.6% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as comp sales grew 5.7%. Restaurant-level margin of 19.5% was 30 basis points higher than last year. And earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $3.48, representing a 21.7% year-over-year increase.  
The fourth quarter had a nonrecurring tax benefit was partially offset by expenses related to legal reserves, restaurant asset impairments and closure costs, transformation expenses and other adjustments, which netted to positively impact our earnings per share by $3.21, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $6.69.  
For the full year, sales increased 7.1% to $6 billion on a comp increase of 1.8%. Restaurant-level margins were 17.4%, a decrease of 310 basis points. And we generated earnings per share adjusted for unusual expenses of $10.73, a decrease of 23.6% over last year. We had nonrecurring tax benefit that was partially offset by expenses related to legal reserves, restaurant asset impairment and closure costs as well as our transformation that positively impacted our earnings per share by $1.79, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $12.52.  
While the uncertainty from COVID makes it difficult to provide comp guidance for full year 2021, we remain optimistic about our future prospects, as evidenced by a great start to Q1, with January comps accelerating to roughly 11% despite a very difficult comparison. Sales in last week of January were in the high single digits, with winter weather across the country contributing to the lower comp. Assuming the pandemic doesn't worsen, we expect our Q1 comp to be in the mid- to high-teens range, given an easier comparison during the second half of March.  
Food cost were 31% in Q4, a decrease of 210 basis points from last year, and this was due primarily to menu price increases, along with better waste control, partially offset by fewer sales of high-margin beverages and higher dairy pricing. In Q1, we expect food costs to remain right around 31% as the benefit from a full quarter of menu price increases will be offset by higher cost menu items such as cauliflower rice as well as slightly higher avocado prices.  
Labor costs for the quarter were 25.4%, a decrease of 110 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage and efficiencies related to digital orders, partially offset by COVID-related expenses, including exclusion pay as well as normal labor inflation. We expect labor costs to be right around 25% during Q1, as expected benefit from sales leverage is offset by ongoing COVID-related expenses. Other operating costs for the quarter was 17.9%, an increase of 310 basis points from last year, due primarily to higher delivery fees in the quarter. 
Delivery expenses were elevated year-over-year given the significant growth in delivery, with delivery sales now nearly 25% of total sales. To help improve the economics on this premium access point, we have implemented several delivery menu price differentials with a weighted average being right around 13%. We have seen modest resistance thus far, and we'll continue to monitor and adjust pricing as appropriate at the market level or at the restaurant level.  
Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 3.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. But as expected, it was 130 basis point sequential increase from Q3 to support carne asada and the latest brand messaging under our Behind the Foil campaign. We expect marketing spend to be near 4% in Q1, which would be the highest quarterly level during 2021, in order to support new menu items as well as the upcoming Super Bowl ad.  
As a result of the higher anticipated marketing demand and ongoing momentum in our delivery business, we expect other operating costs to be right around 17% in Q1. The Q4 restaurant-level margin was 19.5%, while our trailing 12-month average unit volumes were roughly $2.2 million, which is back to our pre-COVID level. We expect to close much of this margin gap versus the 22% expected at this volume in 2021 as COVID-related impacts and delivery economics normalize and as quarterly marketing expenses even out. 
Note that some of this gap relates to delivery accounting as increased delivery menu prices as well as delivery and service fees had the effect of grossing up, which may create the appearance that margin algorithm gap is widening. Therefore, we now disclose our AUVs with and without the delivery menu price increase to provide better clarity and transparency.  
G&A for the quarter was $124 million on a GAAP basis or $114 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding roughly $7 million for settlement of several older legal matters and nearly $3 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes $90 million in underlying G&A, $21 million related to noncash stock comp and a $4 million bonus performance adjustment due to our strong performance in 2020 despite the pandemic.  
We are still in the early innings of our growth life cycle, and therefore, continue to make important G&A investments in 2020 despite the COVID pandemic. We saw an uptick in Q4 underlying G&A due to technology investments, customer service enhancements, increased headcount as well as higher medical claims.  
Looking ahead to Q1. We expect underlying G&A expense to carry forward in the $90 million range as we continue to make tech investments, the majority of which are revenue-generating, to bolster our expanding digital and loyalty platform. These include initiatives that are customer-facing like app upgrades as well as behind-the-scenes initiatives like a new labor scheduling tool. In addition, we also plan to increase headcount in order to support our expected accelerated growth. 
Even with this elevated spend, our goal remains to deliver leverage on this line item relative to our sales growth. Stock comp will likely be around $23 million each quarter in 2021, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. We also expect to recognize around $4 million of employer taxes in Q1 associated with shares that vest at the beginning of our fiscal year.  
Lastly, our 2018 performance shares were modified to account for unplanned effects of COVID. This will result in a GAAP accounting charge of about $24 million for both Q1 and Q2, and about $8 million in Q3 and Q4. We plan to present non-GAAP results without these unusual charges to clearly show our underlying business performance.  
Our effective tax rate for Q4 was negative 62.2% on a GAAP basis and 24.6% on a non-GAAP basis. The difference is due to recognizing a net operating loss for tax purposes in 2020, which we expect to carry back to the preceding 5 years. We generated an NOL for tax purposes due to several factors, including the impact of COVID, increased tax deduction for equity, vesting and exercises, accelerated tax depreciation deductions and various tax planning initiatives. An income tax benefit is generated due to the difference in federal tax rates between 2020 and the years that the federal NOL will be carried back to.  
For fiscal 2021, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items such as stock option exercises. This range assumes no change to current income tax rate. And if corporate tax rates change as a result of tax reform under the Biden administration, we'll revisit our estimated effective tax rate.  
Turning now to the balance sheet, where we ended Q4 with $1.1 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments and no debt, along with a $600 million untapped credit facility. We're privileged to have this financial strength with which to make ongoing strategic investments in our people, our business and our communities to further differentiate Chipotle brand and support our expected growth for 2021 and beyond. We didn't buy back any stock in Q4, but if our business continues to improve and economy continues to stabilize, we will likely begin buying again in late Q1 or early Q2. 
One area that definitely benefited from our strong cash position is restaurant design and real state development, where we remain diligent and aggressive while many of our peers pulled back. I'm really impressed by the hard work of our development and operations team as they opened 61 new restaurants in the fourth quarter, with 42 including a Chipotlane. For the full year, they successfully navigated construction and permitting challenges and opened 161 new restaurants, with 100 including a Chipotlane. Remarkably, this was towards the high end of the 150 to 165 range we provided before the onset of the pandemic.  
As of year-end, we had a total of 170 Chipotlanes, including 5 conversions. Performance for these formats continues to be stellar. The digital gap versus non-Chipotlane restaurants remains around 10%, driven entirely by higher-margin digital pickup orders. And sales at the Chipotlane cohort continued to outperform the non-Chipotlane results from the same open period. In fact, non-comp Chipotlane sales are opening close to our existing restaurant AUV versus historical peak productivity in the mid- to high-80% range. These results reaffirm our strategy of an accelerated pivot towards Chipotlane sites. Not only will this enhance customer access and convenience, but it also helps increase new restaurant sales, margins and returns.  
While 62% of new restaurants in 2020 had a Chipotlane, our goal is to have more than 70% of openings include a Chipotlane in 2021, where we anticipate opening around 200 new restaurants. Of course, this development guidance assumes no major COVID-related delays in 2021. Guidance also includes remodeling or relocating 10 to 15 restaurants this year to add a Chipotlane. This will allow us to learn and ensure we're getting a superior return on this investment before potentially ramping up the number of remodels and our relocations in the future.  
Let me end by also expressing my gratitude to all of our team members in our restaurants and in support roles as they overcame countless challenges and embraced change to safely serve and delight our guests. It's through this collaborative effort that we've been able to achieve such an impressive performance in 2020 and continue to build momentum at the start of this year.  
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

And then, Jack, just the restaurant-level margins, you touched on that as well about how the 19.5 million or so was short of that relationship that you would have for a $2.2 million box, i.e., that should be 22% if you get your delivery economics up to speed. Should we be thinking about -- what is the buildup that -- in that margin through the year? How fast can you close that gap in that relationship? 
And I guess the last thing is, when it comes to the 2-year trend in comp, basically, if you look at The Street numbers, people are thinking a mid-teens 2-year or thereabout after we get vaccines.

And currently, we're even testing now a car-side access. 
What I've seen is in the markets where we start to open those dining rooms up, you don't lose those occasions. You pick up the occasions that kind of got impacted by COVID. And it really is an and situation not an or. Now it's not 100% back in the dining room in some of these regions. But we're seeing 50%, 60% of the dining room business come back, and we're hanging on to 85%, 80% of our digital business. 
And as you walk into 2021, our digital system now has 19.5 million members. And what we have seen is they like the additional access, the convenience that it provides. And they like our ability to communicate with them through that rewards program. 
And so look, I think January is a great example of the strength of Chipotle's business still being impacted by COVID rolling over a year ago that didn't have COVID. And I think it just shows the power of the new access points, the way we're running our restaurants, the culture that we have in our restaurants. And then ultimately, our customers believe in the food, believe in the purpose. So very optimistic about where we get to. 
And as Jack pointed out, I think as the year goes on, you're going to continue to see us make progress on getting that algorithm back to where we said it will get to as COVID wanes and some of these expenses go away. And the delivery channel, we kind of normalize it into our business going forward."

And what we've seen is in places where you have people moving around more, for whatever their routine is, you see that occasion still happening where they want to come into the restaurant. 
And look, I still think the occasion of the dining room experience gives you something unique. It's got another level of customization because you get to be face-to-face with how we're making your food versus the online occasion. And so when we talk to customers, there is a fair amount of people that when they have the opportunity, they will want to go back to their dining occasion. 
The thing that I find really promising in that is they've also adopted new off-premise digital occasions that they're not going to abandon. And when we look at the Venn diagram, the world where it used to be, they were exclusive. I only did online and I only do in dining, and there was a few that did both. That's changed. You've got a lot more people doing both. And we've got people that historically probably would not have tried it, if not for, unfortunately, COVID. But they still really love that in-restaurant experience, and now we're top of mind for that occasion when they're not going to be in the restaurant.

The price increase that we took, it covers the dollar cost of delivery, like there's an increase in delivery this year versus last year because so many people moved into that channel. And so the price increase we took so far, it gets us to about a breakeven versus last year in terms of a dollar -- from a dollar standpoint. 
But if you go through the math, and it's easiest to do this like on an annual basis, if you -- this 13% on 25% of the business ends up being about $80,000. And so look at the average cost of delivery being about $80,000 on average per restaurant. When you take that price increase, it ends up being a 3%, 3.25%, your sales will go up by about $80,000. And so you cover those dollars, your cash flow on a per-restaurant basis are the same. But if you go through the math and take the same cash flow and take 25%, which ends up being $625,000 of cash flow, that's $2.5 million at a 25% margin. And if your costs go up $80,000 and your revenue goes up by $80,000, your margin is going to go down by 80 basis points. 
And so we don't make any less money, but the margin does end up being diluted just because of the math. Now we think there are things that we can do, either levers we can pull, other efficiencies we can file.

And so the economics look great. The new restaurant openings are opening really strong. Chipotlane continues to perform. And you see us experimenting with digital only. You'll see us experimenting with Chipotlanes only. 
But at the end of the day, I mean, the full business of Chipotle, where you got both lines, a Chipotlane as an access point with this digital system, it's just really winning economics, and there are a lot of those sites available in the U.S. 
To your question about international, obviously, we believe Chipotle can travel beyond the United States. We're already seeing some success in Canada. And then obviously, we've got some plans in place for places that we already have our foot in the door. So think of the U.K., France, specifically. And so you're going to see us starting to really use kind of our stage-gate process to move those markets along. 
And then we'll evaluate other regions accordingly. We've not made decisions on how we want to enter those other markets. And frankly, we haven't laid out exactly the order of how we're going to do it. For now, we want to deliver the U.S.. And where we already have some presence, we're going to start leaning into to see how much more upside there is. We have an idea. And then obviously, we're going to evaluate where we go beyond the markets that we currently are. 
But when we've done some research, what is clear is people love the purpose of Food with Integrity. They love the customization. They love the food. And frankly, the whole value proposition, I think, has legs well beyond the United States."

Can you talk about the brand's visibility now and where it stands versus maybe several years ago when you took over? And how you're thinking about continued opportunities going forward?

Sure. Thanks, Jared, and welcome. So look, first of all, I just believe our message is a strong message that differentiates our brand, and it's a message that's very much on trend with how young people want to eat and the future of how people want to eat. So you're going to see us continue to push the visibility of Chipotle and the idea of real food with real cooking, real culinary done, frankly, every day. 
And what I can tell you is when I rewind the tapes when I first got here back in 2018, we were arguably spending about the same percent of dollars and nobody saw the brand. If I would have asked you what's Chipotle up to, you would not have been able to give me a good answer. Frankly, it would have been somebody else's narrative. 
And I think fast forward to where we are today, I know our brand is stronger from an awareness standpoint for what we stand for. I know the brand is stronger from a trust standpoint. I know the brand is stronger when it comes to our menu innovation as well as our approach to culinary. So we've made tremendous progress. The marketing team, I think, has done a fabulous job of keeping the brand in culture and leading culture. And you're going to continue to see us do that. 
I'm excited about bringing our message to the Super Bowl platform. I think it's going to be a very widely watched Super Bowl. And a lot of customers say to us, ""I feel good about eating at Chipotle,"" but they can't articulate why. We're going to tell them why they feel good about it. Obviously, they love the culinary aspect. But now they're going to get clarity on why they feel good about why they choose the brand Chipotle. And you'll see it in the advertising around our approach to farming, animals, sustainability, and frankly, the communities that we support and operate in. 
And then your second question about cauliflower rice. Look, I love it. It's really good. I highly recommend it if you haven't tried it. I'd recommend going 50-50, a little brown rice and cauliflower rice. But with that said, the good news is about 25% of our orders are coming from new or infrequent customers, which is really terrific. So it's off to a great start, and our operators are doing a great job of making the cauliflower absolutely perfect. So we're really happy with how that's come out of the gate."

So Brian, you mentioned that the national launch of quesadillas are in the near feature, but it doesn't look like it's contemplated in 1Q same-store sales guidance given it implies a deceleration to your trends from January to the combined February and March time frame. Does guidance reflect uncertainty over the course of the pandemic or more so conservatism as quesadillas are expected to launch later in the quarter? 
And then my second question on catering. As we look towards the reopening, how big of an emphasis do you plan to place on catering given the gap you guys historically had, with 1% of your sales coming from catering before the pandemic versus fast casual peers that were typically in that 8% range?"
26446,696658491,2216207,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Executives","So to answer your first question, look, I think there's still -- as much as I'm optimistic that the vaccine program is getting better as every day goes by, and it really is amazing to see the efficacy of these vaccines, there still is -- we want to be cau",303,"So to answer your first question, look, I think there's still -- as much as I'm optimistic that the vaccine program is getting better as every day goes by, and it really is amazing to see the efficacy of these vaccines, there still is -- we want to be cautious about where COVID goes from here. So we're being careful on that front. 
And then obviously, as we are able to lock and load on new initiatives, we'll share that with you guys. We're still in the phase of making sure we've got the equipment rolled out everywhere. And we're feeling really good about the training we're going to do around quesadilla. So more to come on that front. 
But I would say more of it is just there's still a lot of unknown. Luckily, every day seems to be better with this -- with the whole COVID issue both -- vaccine rates seem to be going up and COVID cases seem to be going down. And luckily, less and less people are ending up in the hospital. So I'm optimistic, but we wanted to be conservative on that front. 
And then regarding catering, yes, look, Andrew, I think it's a huge opportunity. Once people want to get back together, I think it's going to be a real big opportunity for our business. And it's one of the areas we're thinking about. And we're going to figure out the right time to start pushing that once, obviously, people can get back together in groups in a meaningful way. 
So it's a big opportunity. I wish we -- the first step will be getting back to 1% of our sales doing catering. And then the next step will be tracking down numbers that I think are much higher than where we were with 1%."

Brian, are you thinking in any way of kind of thinking about an appropriate at that level G&A per store, G&A as kind of a percentage of sales that as you think about longer-term revenue goals and longer-term operating income goals that we could perhaps start to anchor around? And I do ask that somewhat in the context of what you put in your press release, and I'm sorry if I missed it in the previous press release or forgot about it, reducing nonessential -- focusing on reducing nonessential controllable costs.

And Scott and all of our leaders in operations, their goal is to give people a great culinary experience and also give our team members a great culture and the opportunity to grow in our organization and do it in a way where we flow the revenue to the bottom line. 
So wherever we see an opportunity to get rid of unnecessary costs or, frankly, labor allocation, we go after it, and we'll continue to go after it. And that's why I've got a high level of confidence -- a very high level of confidence that the algorithm is going to be intact as we move throughout the year. Because as we continue to regain sales, we do things with our labor scheduling technology. And frankly, our operators, are laser-focused on giving people great experiences and then flowing to the bottom line accordingly. Of course, it's something we keep an eye on. 
So I don't think it's necessary to pick a certain point because there's always going to be opportunities where if we see an investment that makes sense to grow our business, we're going to make that investment. There's just way too much growth in this company to constrain us that way.

We surged after Christmas and then surged again in January. So we're definitely at a higher level right now. 
And in terms of the guidance, Brian mentioned before, the first quarter is still difficult to predict. We don't know where COVID is going next. We're optimistic because the vaccines are getting traction. But it essentially takes the last week trend, which we talked about in the script. We -- while we did overall 11% for January, we had moved down into the high single digits at the last week of January.

Chipotle is off to a promising start in 2021, which gives me optimism for the rest of the year. There's still uncertainty related to COVID, but as more people become vaccinated, including many Chipotle employees, I'm hopeful we're getting closer to brighter days ahead. In fact, all but about 20 of our restaurants are now open with 92% of them offering in-restaurant dining with capacity limitations.
For the quarter, we reported sales of $1.7 billion, representing 23.4% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 17.2% comparable restaurant sales growth including about a 1.5% headwind from winter weather in February. Restaurant-level margins of 22.3%, which is 470 basis points higher than last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $5.36, representing an increase of 74% year-over-year. Digital sales growth of 13.9% year-over-year, representing 50.1% of sales. And opened 40 new restaurants, including 26 with the Chipotlane.
Not surprisingly, comparable restaurant sales were the highest during the month of March as we lapped easier comparisons. And I'm pleased to report that April is off to a good start. These results highlight that our key strategy is continue to resonate with guests and position us to win today while we create the future.
Let me now provide a brief update on each of these strategies, which I believe will help fulfill our long-term vision of more than 6,000 restaurants, AUVs above $2.5 million and restaurant-level margins above 25%. These are: 1, making the brand visible relevant and loved; 2, utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation; 3, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement; 4, engaging with customers through our loyalty program; and 5, running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides delicious food with integrity while delivering an exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences.
Let me start with our marketing efforts, where the team is doing a great job being agile and remaining relevant to a consumer mindset that continues to evolve. Internally, we encourage curiosity and experimentation, which takes advantage of our digital and social capabilities in conjunction with TV advertising to consistently reinforce our messaging.
For example, we leveraged the return of sports to showcase our brand and purpose. Our first-ever Super Bowl commercial titled, Can a Burrito Change the World, who was very successful at highlighting Chipotle's dedication to cultivating a better world through real food, sustainable sourcing and the commitment of the farming industry. We also connected and engaged with our guests during March Madness with the mouthwatering commercial showcasing real ingredients, real cooking and real people in order to support the launch of our handcrafted quesadillas.
Not to be outdone, our digital communication strategy involves supercharging the super fans who are our true advocates. Content on social platforms is a key way we interact with our guests. The end goal for all of our creative initiatives is to drive culture, drive a difference and ultimately drive a purchase. Helping these marketing efforts were a handful of new menu innovations, which provide wonderful examples of the stage-gate process and our team's ability to execute new food experiences.
Polo Flower Rice, which we launched in early January and will continue through mid-May is continuing to bring in new guests. In addition, we launched quesadillas across the U.S. and Canada as a digital exclusive offering on March 11. This is our first new customizable entree in 17 years and was the most requested item by guests, not on our existing menu. We made sure we took the proper time to develop an excellent product that consumers love and also works well operationally. The end result is the quesadillas that is perfectly crispy on the outside with delicious melted cheese on the inside. My personal favorite is the barbacoa quesadillas.
The benefits of a digital-only offering are that it leverages our digital scale while removing operational friction by utilizing our digital kitchen. Although it's only been out for about a month, we're encouraged by its performance thus far with an incidence mix of approximately 10% and expect it to remain a guest favorite moving forward.
Last, but certainly not least, we also had carne asada for the majority of the quarter, and we're pleased to say that it had an incident mix similar to what we saw last year.
And our talented culinary team is not done innovating. We have several market tests of new items scheduled later this year that have shown promise in early-stage consumer testing. We are gaining valuable feedback and we'll update you on their progress as they move through our stage gate process. Also, it's likely that we will put another marketing push behind some 2020 initiatives like Tractor Beverages later this year to optimize their performance once COVID normalizes.
Let me now talk about the next strategic driver, our digital platform. Our investments in new digital features and innovations helped Q1 digital sales grow 134% year-over-year to $870 million and represent 50% of sales. Momentum continued to build within the quarter, with March setting a new record for digital transactions supported by our best-ever digital order-ahead month, over 800,000 app downloads and the most new digital customers since May of 2020.
With the overall digital mix remaining relatively stable for the last 3 quarters, we're delighted to see that our highest margin transaction, digital pickup orders were slightly more than half of digital sales during Q1. Within the delivery channel, about 40% were initiated through the Chipotle Apple website, while the remainder were through a handful of partners.
Our digital sales are a sticky, frictionless and convenient experience as evidenced by our April digital sales mix holding around 50%. Aided by the quesadillas launch, our digital sales are now slightly above the COVID peak from last year. While we've recovered roughly 60% of in-restaurant sales as dining rooms have reopened.
We also continue to see outside digital performance in Chipotlanes, which have revolutionized the drive-through experience towards order ahead for pickup transactions, which is our most profitable channel.
As our digital ecosystem has evolved from a commerce system to a platform of engagement, we continue to look for ways to enhance convenience and access, including Chipotlanes. Alternative store formats, digital-only menu offerings and Chipotle Rewards. We are regularly making enhancements to our app, website, delivering group offerings to support the current and expected future growth within this channel.
We'll also continue to make important tech investments to create a path for the future. One such example is our recent investment in Neuro, an early-stage leader in autonomous delivery. Neuro uses robotics in their fleet of on-road, occupant lists and autonomous vehicles to deliver everyday consumer goods, and we believe has the potential to take the delivery experience to the next level.
Speaking of our loyalty program, we now have more than 21 million passionate members that receive targeted and personalized messages. We are leveraging the CRM platform for purpose-driven messaging as well as tempting fans with our latest promotions. Communications to our customers are individually tailored so that specific customer activities prompt targeted responses. Each digital message can vary along the customer buying journey, such as the latest promotional offer and a new menu item or a more targeted offer to entice a customer that has not visited a restaurant for a certain period of time.
For example, customers received communication about the quesadillas launch featuring their favorite protein based on their ordering history. Our loyalty program has been very successful in driving additional transactions across our light, medium and heavy consumer segments, but we continue to increase the level of sophistication and experience in our information and targeting, which should bode well for the future of Chipotle Rewards. We're also investing in talent and infrastructure for rewards and have several enhancements to the program planned for later this year that consumers have indicated would increase their engagement and purchases.
Let me end by talking about the foundational ingredient of our success. And that's our restaurant operations, where the team has done a great job staying focused on safety, reliability and excellent culinary. Running great restaurants requires great people, and Chipotle is privileged to have amazing employees.
Our continued investment in our team members to ensure they have the resources to develop and thrive in their career, including the recently announced expansion of debt-free degrees in agriculture, culinary, hospitality and supply chain is paying off. Turnover continues to be relatively stable, and we are seeing great applicants for open positions to staff our expected growth in AUV and new restaurant openings.
After visiting a number of our restaurants recently, I'm encouraged to see more guests enjoying their food in our dining rooms. As a result, we've been reiterating the importance of executing great throughput by teaching, training and validating the 5 pillars of throughput every day during every shift. After all, guests need to feel safe and deserve a great and fast in-restaurant experience.
Chipotle is a unique brand committed to fostering a culture that values and champions are diversity, while leveraging the individual talents of all team members to grow our business and cultivate a better world. To show how passionate we are about inspiring real change in people, food and the environment, We have tied 10% of officer's annual incentive bonus to the company achieving certain ESG goals. Our updated sustainability report, which was published last week, showcases our desire for transparency and being a leader in sustainability.
I also want to take this opportunity to welcome our 2 new independent directors, Matt Carey and Mauricio Gutierrez, both bring excellent experience to our board and will be valuable assets for Chipotle.
Finally, I want to thank our employees for their incredible level of collaboration and tireless dedication, which were critical in helping demonstrate the brand's resiliency. While the past year has been full of ups and downs and the volatility related to COVID may not be fully behind us, I believe Chipotle is stronger today and is well positioned for growth. As a result, I'm excited about our future as we remain a premier fast-casual brand focusing on all stakeholders, a leader in culinary, a leader in food with integrity and an innovator providing convenient access inside our restaurants as well as through our expanding digital ecosystem.
With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials."
26446,706210209,2254794,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2021",2021-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We're proud of our performance during the first quarter with sales growing 23.4% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, as comp sales grew 17.2%. Restaurant-level margin of 22.3% was 470 basis points higher than last",1567,"Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We're proud of our performance during the first quarter with sales growing 23.4% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, as comp sales grew 17.2%. Restaurant-level margin of 22.3% was 470 basis points higher than last year, and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $5.36, representing a 74% year-over-year increase. This include a benefit from lower taxes related to option exercises and share vesting, which is more than offset by higher G&A related to performance-based catch-up adjustments and taxes on equity exercises investments. And I'll discuss these factors in greater detail shortly.
The first quarter had unusual expenses related to our 2018 performance share modification to account for the unplanned effects of COVID, restaurant asset impairments and closure costs as well as transformation costs, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.91, leading to a GAAP earnings per share of $4.45.
While the impact from COVID appears to be lessening, we're not quite out of the woods yet as seen by the recent spikes in a few regions, as well as a pause in administering certain vaccines and therefore, it's still difficult to provide comp guidance for full year 2021. We're encouraged by the strong start, and we're optimistic about our full year performance in 2021.
The geometric 2-year stack for Q1 comp was about 21% due to dining rooms reopening, our alfa rice launch, effective marketing, continued digital performance and the introduction of quesadillas, which all helped drive a strong finish to the quarter. For Q2, we expect our comps to be in the range of the high 20% to 30% with quesadillas incidents normalize and a lower marketing investment.
Food costs were 30% in Q1, a decrease of 280 basis points from last year. This is due primarily to menu price increase, a mix shift towards higher-margin proteins and lower waste, which were partially offset by costs associated with rice and fewer sales of high-margin beverages. In Q2, we expect food cost to be in the mid- to high 30% range as the benefit from our delivery menu price increase will be more than offset by seasonally higher avocado prices.
Labor costs for the quarter were 24.9%, a decrease of 300 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage and efficiencies related to digital orders, partially offset by labor inflation. We expect labor cost to be in the low 24% range during Q2 due to the benefit of our delivery menu price increase as well as seasonally higher sales. Other operating costs for the quarter was 16.9%, an increase of 200 basis points from last year due to higher delivery fees, which were partially offset by sales leverage and a onetime insurance credit.
Delivery expenses remained elevated year-over-year given the significant growth in delivery. And as you may have seen, we increased our delivery menu prices by 4% earlier this month to help cover the higher cost of this premium access point. And we'll continue to evaluate and fine-tune our delivery strategy in this dynamic market.
Marketing promo costs for the quarter were 3.5%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year, given a significant lower level of delivery promotion this year. While we invested more marketing dollars in order to support quesadillas and rice as well as our first-ever Super Bowl ad. We anticipate marketing expenses to be in the mid-2% range in Q2 as the time period tends to be less responsive to match the advertising channel.
Similar to the past few years, full year 2021 market expense is expected to be around 3% of sales. Due to lower marketing spend in Q2, other operating costs are expected to be around 16% for the quarter. The Q1 restaurant-level margin was 22.3%. While our trailing 12-month average unit volumes, excluding the delivery menu price increase were roughly $2.27 million. Normalizing for the higher marketing spend, our underlying restaurant level margin was essentially in line with the theoretical margin of 22.7% expected at the sales volume. We're pleased with this progress, and we remain confident that we have taken and we'll continue to take the necessary actions to ensure the margin stays on the algorithm as our AUVs rise throughout the year. In fact, we expect our trailing 12-month average unit volumes to pass $2.4 million in Q2, and we expect our margin algorithm to keep pace.
G&A for the quarter was $155 million on a GAAP basis or $129 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $24.4 million for the previously mentioned modification to our 2018 performance shares and about $1.6 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes $89 million in underlying G&A, $30 million related to noncash stock compensation, which includes a $7.7 million increase related to our strong performance in Q1 and $10 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting and stock option exercises.
Looking to Q2, we expect our underlying G&A to be around $94 million, as we continue to make investments, including in technology to support our future growth. We anticipate stock comp will likely be around $25 million in each of the remaining quarters in 2021 to reflect the new run rate, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance.
We also expect to recognize around $5 million in each quarter related to performance-based bonus expenses and employer taxes associated with shares that vest during each quarter as well as $1 million related to our upcoming virtual field leadership conference in Q2.
Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 20.2% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. Our effective tax rate benefited from option exercises and share vesting at elevated stock prices. As I'm sure you know, we received a tax deduction for the value of our employees received upon much an exercise or share vesting. And when that value exceeds the accounting charge for those shares, we benefit from a higher tax deduction. For fiscal 2021, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items such as the equity-related impact I just mentioned.
Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $1.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt along with our recently refinanced $500 million untapped revolver with a 5-year term and more favorable terms in our previous facility. We also restarted our buyback program in late February when our stock price softened, and we repurchased $61 million of our stock and average price of $1,425 during the quarter. We had nearly $154 million remaining on our share authorization as of March 31, and we expect to continue to opportunistically use excess free cash flow to repurchase our stock.
That being said, the best use for our cash remains investing in more Chipotlane, which continued to deliver outstanding returns. We opened 40 new restaurants in the first quarter, more than double the number opened in Q1 last year with 26 of these, including a Chipotlane. While only 65% of the new units had a Chipotlane in Q1 for the full year, We still anticipate opening around 200 new restaurants with more than 70%, including a Chipotlane.
As of March 31, we had a total of 196 Chipotlanes, including 5 conversions. Customers love the Chipotlane experience as it is the access channel that excels have provided convenience, speed and great value all at the same time. Performance continues to be stellar.
In trailing 12 months, Chipotlane restaurants continue to drive 17% higher overall digital sales compared to non-Chipotlane. An order ahead, our highest margin transaction is nearly 80% higher than non-Chipotlane, while delivering our lowest margin transaction is about 30% lower than our non-ChiChipotlane restaurants.
New Chipotlane opening was about 15% higher sales. And the comp restaurant -- at the comp at the 69 Chipotlane restaurants that have been opened more than a year, continues to outperform the non-Chipotlane restaurants from the same open period.
Beyond the significant growth opportunity in the new restaurants, we're excited to accelerate new restaurant opens in Canada, which was recently validated by our stage a process. We're building a healthy new restaurant pipeline and expect to open a handful of restaurants over the next 12 months including our first Chipotlane in late summer. We'll continue to experiment with different location formats and restaurant designs throughout the country to gauge consumer preferences. Ultimately, we believe we can open at least a few hundred restaurants in Canada, especially with their unit economics now approaching those of the U.S. The recent Surrey, British Columbia opening, which is our first new Canadian location 3 years, opened very strong and gives us even greater confidence about our growth strategy.
Let me close by thanking all of our team members who have proven their ability to operate through uncertainty, while also staying focused on our long-term purpose. Their commitment to constant improvement of the customer dining experience while strengthening our branded business is what helps drive our strategic growth initiatives. The combination of investing in our people, delivering relevant and compelling marketing, leveraging our digital system to enhance convenient access and great execution in our restaurants is leading to a better guest experience, which ultimately allows us to further strengthen our powerful economic model.
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

Look, what we're definitely seeing is people want to be back in our dining rooms. I've had the luxury of traveling recently, and Scott and I have been at numerous restaurants, and it's great to see the lines again in our dining rooms. And we're seeing a nice rebound, obviously, in those dining room sales because there weren't any a year ago.
And at the same time, what we're seeing is our digital business is really continuing to thrive. In the quarter, I don't know if you guys picked up on this, but I mean we had record sales for our digital business despite the fact that our dining rooms are opening. So I think it just demonstrates the power of both access modes, meaning the in-restaurant dining access mode and the digital access mode. And then not surprising, you're seeing the occasions come back based on whether you're coming into the dining room or whether you're ordering off-premise. And that's more tied to how open the region is, is how I would kind of describe it.
So we're feeling great about where we are. Consumer sentiment is definitely one where they want to get back out to socialize and get back into the dining rooms and have that in-dining experience. And then at the same token for those occasions that they build the behaviors around digitally, those are remaining in the business. And I think that's why you're seeing our results in Q1. And frankly, while I'm really proud of our teams that we're managing these 2 businesses out of 1 kitchen with really excellence."

From a dollar standpoint, they're pretty close. But as you know, when you are charging higher prices, you're grossing up the sales, and so it makes it a little harder to fully capture that margin. But I would say we're within striking distance. We're maybe a few percentage points away if we wanted to completely equalize the margin on an in-store transaction for delivery. So we've made a lot of progress over the last year.
And when we've taken these increases along the way, we've seen either acceptable resistance. And we've also seen what looks like people are shifting channels because it does look like our order ahead moves up when we do see customers maybe resist the higher pricing in those delivery channels a bit."

And I'm trying to figure out, are you shifting people away from third party by virtue of incentivizing them through loyalty or that kind of thing? Or is it just that the people who are ordering directly are very high spending customers, and they're the sort of minority that will ultimately download your apps versus preferring the convenience of of an aggregator platform?
I know there's a lot in there, but I'm trying to understand sort of the power of the Chipotle brand versus like kind of like call it, the convenience of the aggregators and who owns the customer there."

Sara, I think where you just ended your question is the answer, which is we have a very powerful brand. And as a result, when people join our rewards program, download the app and start ordering through our app, and they realize that they have the access of order ahead and pick up, whether it's at a Chipotlane. Order ahead and pick up, meaning I can grab it off the shelf and go or, I think, at delivery through our app. In all those occasions, you are able to accrue points and get recognized for being an engaged customer.
And we're providing lots of access, lots of convenience with a very powerful brand position behind it. And that's why I think you're seeing our order ahead business continue to grow. our white label or delivery business in our app continuing to grow as a percentage of the delivery occasion. And I think it's just a function of the brand continues to resonate. Our first strategy is all about building the brand, trust and love. And I think while we do that and provide a great experience, both digitally and for whatever occasion, you want to associate with that digital experience and then you give them rewards, it's a really powerful system that keeps people engaged."

It's hard to pin that down, though because, in essence, what you do is we have to -- as we approach the end of a lease term, like let's say, you've got a 10-year primary term with options. When you get to year 7 or 8, that's the time you have the conversation with landlords. If you try to have the conversation with landlords to try to get permission to modify the space in year 2 or 3, when you've got 7 years left, landlord doesn't really want to have that conversation.
So we have those conversations, and we have many of them throughout the year.

And as we grow to 2 4,  2 5, et cetera, et cetera, we think that our margin will move to 24 than a 25.
Now that's not going to happen every single quarter. It's not going to be perfect. But in terms of seeing our margins move up with our volumes, we still expect that to happen. Now there is a slight degradation as you move from $2.5 million to $3 million, for example, you might not get to all the way to 30% in terms of the margin for a $3 million restaurant. But you certainly should get in the 28% to 29% range.
So we still fully expect that we'll be able to expand margins. And one of the things that's enabling that is with the growth -- the significant growth in the delivery business, That has been -- still is our lowest-margin transaction, but we've closed the gaps considerably and our customers are still choosing that channel or they're choosing another channel. So giving the customers choice and let them pay for the more extreme convenience channel of delivery, let them pay the going rate, seems to be a workable strategy for us."

The positive is it came back really fast in March. The negative in that is you got to put a little bit of catch-up with the staffing. But I think our employee value proposition is world-class. And as people realize these opportunities are available, usually, we have no problem with the applicant flow. And then we turn our attention to training and developing these individuals because it's a great opportunity for not just the job now, but a future career.
So It's great to see the business come roaring back. It's also exciting to see our need to staff more people because that is the growth that we like to have. We like to have growth that results in more jobs and more people having upward opportunities.
We had, I think, 13,000-plus promotions recently. So I mean that's just a testament to the growth that we have, the strength of our proposition for those that stay with us, commit themselves to being developed and trained. And then obviously, we're going to staff accordingly as the business comes roaring back. So I'm very optimistic about the people we can attract, the culture that we create for them and then the opportunities that are available for them.
And what was the second part of your question?"

First of all, Andy, in the last year, what we've seen with labor inflation has -- it's been more modest than it had been in the last 5 years. In the last 5 years, we've seen inflation in kind of the mid-single-digit range. And with so",436,"Yes, I'll take this. First of all, Andy, in the last year, what we've seen with labor inflation has -- it's been more modest than it had been in the last 5 years. In the last 5 years, we've seen inflation in kind of the mid-single-digit range. And with some of the dislocations going on with COVID, actually, the labor inflation dropped to the low single digits. But we expect -- I think most people expect that's going to tick back up. And -- but let me just give you an example because the other thing that you might be thinking about is what if we have a national minimum wage that over time, approaches $15.
Now the way to think about this is our minimum wage or our average wage right now is $12 for our crew, it's $13 for all of our hourly employees. We're not that far off of, like, for example, a $15 number. But let's say, for example, that there's going to be an across-the-board 10% increase in our wages, that would have an impact on our margins of, call it, 150 to 200 basis points. And that would to offset that with menu pricing, that would take a 2% to 3% price increase. So all of that is very, very manageable. And we feel like if there is going to be significant increased inflation because of market-driven or because of federal minimum wage, we think everybody in the restaurant industry is going to have to pass those costs along to the customer, and we think we're in a much, much better position to do that than other companies out there.
In terms of commodities, the one that we're seeing for sure, and this is more of a seasonal shift that we see pretty much every year as avocados, we are going to see an increase in avocado prices as we shift into the next season. We don't see anything else moving up dramatically right now, Andy. I mean I think everyone's kind of waiting to see what happens in terms of demand. And if there are any disruptions with supply chain, we're not seeing any that we're worried about right now. But with everyone talking about with the stimulus and the reopening and the vaccine, there is going to be a surge in demand. And we think we're well prepared from a supply chain standpoint, but that's the only kind of wildcard as the year unfolds is will there be maybe a cyclical or interim dislocation where maybe there is some commodity inflation, but nothing that we're seeing right now."

And then we talked about all the things we did around launching quesadillas and dining rooms start to reopen, so on and so forth.
Then as you move into April, if you think about this 2-year, I think that's probably the best way to think about our business right now because of what you're seeing in kind of the year ago performance on Easter and so on and so forth. The good news is, we've seen days and weeks where you're in the 20s, and we've seen days and weeks where you're in the high teens. So it's bouncing around a little bit. And I think a lot of things are driving that, right? You're still seeing things flash around COVID in different parts of the country. Unfortunately, we had the pause in the vaccines. So you've got some consumer sentiment, I think, bouncing around, which, obviously, plays a role. And then obviously, we're going to be more in the leverage phase of our quesadillas launch versus our launch phase, which is what we're taking into account as we think it will normalize as you go down into the rest of the quarter.
So those are some of the puts and calls. We're, what, a couple of weeks into the second quarter. We love where we are, and we'll see how the rest of the quarter unfolds because I think we've got the right strategies. So we're going to stay focused on what we know has been working for us."

Chipotle is off to a promising start in 2021, which gives me optimism for the rest of the year. There's still uncertainty related to COVID, but as more people become vaccinated, including many Chipotle employees, I'm hopeful we're getting closer to brighter days ahead. In fact, all but about 20 of our restaurants are now open with 92% of them offering in-restaurant dining with capacity limitations. 
For the quarter, we reported sales of $1.7 billion, representing 23.4% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 17.2% comparable restaurant sales growth, including about a 1.5% headwind from winter weather in February. Restaurant-level margins of 22.3%, which is 470 basis points higher than last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $5.36, representing an increase of 74% year-over-year. Digital sales growth of 133.9% year-over-year, representing 50.1% of sales. And opened 40 new restaurants, including 26 with the Chipotlane. 
Not surprisingly, comparable restaurant sales were the highest during the month of March as we lapped easier comparisons. And I'm pleased to report that April is off to a good start. These results highlight that our key strategies continue to resonate with guests and position us to win today while we create the future. 
Let me now provide a brief update on each of these strategies, which I believe will help fulfill our long-term vision of more than 6,000 restaurants, AUV is above $2.5 million and restaurant-level margin is above 25%. These are: one, making the brand visible relevant and loved; two, utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation; three, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement; four, engaging with customers through our loyalty program; and five, running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides delicious food with integrity while delivering an exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences. 
Let me start with our marketing efforts where the team is doing a great job being agile and remaining relevant to a consumer mindset that continues to evolve. Internally, we encourage curiosity and experimentation, which takes advantage of our digital and social capabilities in conjunction with TV advertising to consistently reinforce our messaging. 
For example, we leveraged the return of sports to showcase our brand and purpose. Our first-ever Super Bowl commercial title Can a Burrito Change the World, was very successful at highlighting Chipotle's dedication to cultivating a better world through real food, sustainable sourcing and the commitment to the farming industry. We also connected and engaged with our guests during March Madness with a mouthwatering commercial showcasing real ingredients, real cooking and real people in order to support the launch of our handcrafted quesadillas. 
Not to be outdone, our digital communication strategy involves supercharging the super fans who are our true advocates. Content on social platforms is a key way we interact with our guests. The end goal for all of our creative initiatives is to drive culture, drive a difference and ultimately drive a purchase. Helping these marketing efforts were a handful of new menu innovations, which provide wonderful examples of the stage-gate process and our team's ability to execute new food experiences. 
Cauliflower rice, which we launched in early January and will continue through mid-May, is continuing to bring in new guests. In addition, we launched quesadillas across the U.S. and Canada as a digital exclusive offering on March 11. This is our first new customizable entree in 17 years and was the most requested item by guests, not on our existing menu. We made sure we took the proper time to develop an excellent product that consumers love and also works well operationally. The end result is the quesadillas that is perfectly crispy on the outside with delicious melted cheese on the inside. My personal favorite is the barbacoa quesadillas. 
The benefits of a digital-only offering are that it leverages our digital scale while removing operational friction by utilizing our digital kitchen. Although it's only been out for about a month, we're encouraged by its performance thus far with an incidence mix of approximately 10% and expect it to remain a guest favorite moving forward. 
Last, but certainly not least, we also had carne asada for the majority of the quarter, and we're pleased to say that it had an incident mix similar to what we saw last year. 
And our talented culinary team is not done innovating. We have several market tests of new items scheduled later this year that have shown promise in early-stage consumer testing. We are gaining valuable feedback and we'll update you on their progress as they move through our stage-gate process. Also, it's likely that we will put another marketing push behind some 2020 initiatives like Tractor Beverages later this year to optimize their performance once COVID normalizes. 
Let me now talk about the next strategic driver, our digital platform. Our investments in new digital features and innovations helped Q1 digital sales grow 134% year-over-year to $870 million and represent 50% of sales. Momentum continued to build within the quarter, with March setting a new record for digital transactions supported by our best-ever digital order-ahead month, over 800,000 app downloads and the most new digital customers since May of 2020. 
With the overall digital mix remaining relatively stable for the last 3 quarters, we're delighted to see that our highest margin transaction, digital pickup orders were slightly more than half of digital sales during Q1. Within the delivery channel, about 40% were initiated through the Chipotle app or website while the remainder were through a handful of partners. 
Our digital sales are a sticky, frictionless and convenient experience as evidenced by our April digital sales mix holding around 50%. Aided by the quesadillas launch, our digital sales are now slightly above the COVID peak from last year while we've recovered roughly 60% of in-restaurant sales as dining rooms have reopened. 
We also continue to see outside digital performance in Chipotlanes, which have revolutionized the drive-through experience towards order ahead for pickup transactions, which is our most profitable channel. 
As our digital ecosystem has evolved from a commerce system to a platform of engagement, we continue to look for ways to enhance convenience and access, including Chipotlanes; alternate store formats; digital-only menu offerings; and Chipotle Rewards. We are regularly making enhancements to our app, website, delivering group offerings to support the current and expected future growth within this channel. We'll also continue to make important tech investments to create a path for the future. One such example is our recent investment in Neuro, an early-stage leader in autonomous delivery. Neuro uses robotics in their fleet of on-road, occupant lists and autonomous vehicles to deliver everyday consumer goods, and we believe has the potential to take the delivery experience to the next level. 
Speaking of our loyalty program, we now have more than 21 million passionate members that receive targeted and personalized messages. We are leveraging the CRM platform for purpose-driven messaging as well as tempting fans with our latest promotions. Communications to our customers are individually tailored so that specific customer activities prompt targeted responses. Each digital message can vary along the customer buying journey, such as the latest promotional offer and a new menu item or a more targeted offer to entice a customer that has not visited a restaurant for a certain period of time. 
For example, customers received communication about the quesadillas launch featuring their favorite protein based on their ordering history. Our loyalty program has been very successful in driving additional transactions across our light, medium and heavy consumer segments, but we continue to increase the level of sophistication and experience in our information and targeting, which should bode well for the future of Chipotle Rewards. 
We're also investing in talent and infrastructure for rewards and have several enhancements to the program planned for later this year that consumers have indicated would increase their engagement and purchases. 
Let me end by talking about the foundational ingredient of our success. And that's our restaurant operations, where the team has done a great job staying focused on safety, reliability and excellent culinary. Running great restaurants requires great people, and Chipotle is privileged to have amazing employees. Our continued investment in our team members to ensure they have the resources to develop and thrive in their career, including the recently announced expansion of debt-free degrees in agriculture, culinary, hospitality and supply chain is paying off. 
Turnover continues to be relatively stable, and we are seeing great applicants for open positions to staff our expected growth in AUV and new restaurant openings. 
After visiting a number of our restaurants recently, I'm encouraged to see more guests enjoying their food in our dining rooms. As a result, we've been reiterating the importance of executing great throughput by teaching, training and validating the 5 pillars of throughput every day during every shift. After all, guests need to feel safe and deserve a great and fast in-restaurant experience. Chipotle is a unique brand committed to fostering a culture that values and champions our diversity while leveraging the individual talents of all team members to grow our business and cultivate a better world. To show how passionate we are about inspiring real change in people, food and the environment, we have tied 10% of officer's annual incentive bonus to the company achieving certain ESG goals. Our updated sustainability report, which was published last week, showcases our desire for transparency and being a leader in sustainability. 
I also want to take this opportunity to welcome our 2 new independent directors, Matt Carey and Mauricio Gutierrez, both bring excellent experience to our Board and will be valuable assets for Chipotle. 
Finally, I want to thank our employees for their incredible level of collaboration and tireless dedication, which were critical in helping demonstrate the brand's resiliency. While the past year has been full of ups and downs and the volatility related to COVID may not be fully behind us, I believe Chipotle is stronger today and is well positioned for growth. As a result, I'm excited about our future as we remain a premier fast-casual brand focusing on all stakeholders, a leader in culinary, a leader in food with integrity and an innovator providing convenient access inside our restaurants as well as through our expanding digital ecosystem. 
With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials."

We're proud of our performance during the first quarter with sales growing 23.4% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, as comp sales grew 17.2%.

We're proud of our performance during the first quarter with sales growing 23.4% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, as comp sales grew 17.2%. Restaurant-level margin of 22.3% was 470 basis points higher than last year, and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $5.36, representing a 74% year-over-year increase. This include a benefit from lower taxes related to option exercises and share vesting, which is more than offset by higher G&A related to performance-based catch-up adjustments and taxes on equity exercises investments. And I'll discuss these factors in greater detail shortly. 
The first quarter had unusual expenses related to our 2018 performance share modification to account for the unplanned effects of COVID, restaurant asset impairments and closure costs as well as transformation costs, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.91, leading to a GAAP earnings per share of $4.45. While the impact from COVID appears to be lessening, we're not quite out of the woods yet as seen by the recent spikes in a few regions as well as a pause in administering certain vaccines and therefore, it's still difficult to provide comp guidance for full year 2021. We're encouraged by the strong start, and we're optimistic about our full year performance in 2021. 
The geometric 2-year stack for Q1 comp was about 21% due to dining rooms reopening, our cauliflower rice launch, effective marketing, continued digital performance and the introduction of quesadillas, which all helped drive a strong finish to the quarter. For Q2, we expect our comps to be in the range of the high 20% to 30% with quesadillas incidents normalizing and a lower marketing investment. 
Food costs were 30% in Q1, a decrease of 280 basis points from last year. This is due primarily to menu price increase, a mix shift towards higher-margin proteins and lower waste, which were partially offset by costs associated with cauliflower rice and fewer sales of high-margin beverages. In Q2, we expect food cost to be in the mid- to high 30% range as the benefit from our delivery menu price increase will be more than offset by seasonally higher avocado prices. 
Labor costs for the quarter were 24.9%, a decrease of 300 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage and efficiencies related to digital orders, partially offset by labor inflation. We expect labor cost to be in the low 24% range during Q2 due to the benefit of our delivery menu price increase as well as seasonally higher sales. Other operating costs for the quarter was 16.9%, an increase of 200 basis points from last year due to higher delivery fees, which were partially offset by sales leverage and a onetime insurance credit. 
Delivery expenses remained elevated year-over-year given the significant growth in delivery. And as you may have seen, we increased our delivery menu prices by 4% earlier this month to help cover the higher cost of this premium access point. And we'll continue to evaluate and fine-tune our delivery strategy in this dynamic market. 
Marketing promo costs for the quarter were 3.5%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year, given a significant lower level of delivery promotion this year. While we invested more marketing dollars in order to support quesadillas and cauliflower rice as well as our first-ever Super Bowl ad, we anticipate marketing expenses to be in the mid-2% range in Q2 as the time period tends to be less responsive to match the advertising channel. 
Similar to the past few years, full year 2021 market expense is expected to be around 3% of sales. Due to lower marketing spend in Q2, other operating costs are expected to be around 16% for the quarter. The Q1 restaurant-level margin was 22.3% while our trailing 12-month average unit volumes, excluding the delivery menu price increase, were roughly $2.27 million. Normalizing for the higher marketing spend, our underlying restaurant level margin was essentially in line with the theoretical margin of 22.7% expected at the sales volume. We're pleased with this progress, and we remain confident that we have taken and we'll continue to take the necessary actions to ensure the margin stays on the algorithm as our AUVs rise throughout the year. In fact, we expect our trailing 12-month average unit volumes to pass $2.4 million in Q2, and we expect our margin algorithm to keep pace. 
G&A for the quarter was $155 million on a GAAP basis or $129 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $24.4 million for the previously mentioned modification to our 2018 performance shares and about $1.6 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes $89 million in underlying G&A, $30 million related to noncash stock compensation, which includes a $7.7 million increase related to our strong performance in Q1 and $10 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting and stock option exercises. 
Looking to Q2. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $94 million, as we continue to make investments, including in technology to support our future growth. We anticipate stock comp will likely be around $25 million in each of the remaining quarters in 2021 to reflect the new run rate, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. 
We also expect to recognize around $5 million in each quarter related to performance-based bonus expenses and employer taxes associated with shares that vest during each quarter as well as $1 million related to our upcoming virtual field leadership conference in Q2. 
Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 20.2% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. Our effective tax rate benefited from option exercises and share vesting at elevated stock prices. As I'm sure you know, we received a tax deduction for the value of our employees received upon much an exercise or share vesting. And when that value exceeds the accounting charge for those shares, we benefit from a higher tax deduction. For fiscal 2021, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items such as the equity-related impact I just mentioned. 
Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $1.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt along with our recently refinanced $500 million untapped revolver with a 5-year term and more favorable terms in our previous facility. We also restarted our buyback program in late February when our stock price softened, and we repurchased $61 million of our stock at an average price of $1,425 during the quarter. We had nearly $154 million remaining on our share authorization as of March 31, and we expect to continue to opportunistically use excess free cash flow to repurchase our stock. That being said, the best use for our cash remains investing in more Chipotle which continued to deliver outstanding returns. We opened 40 new restaurants in the first quarter, more than double the number opened in Q1 last year with 26 of these, including a Chipotlane. While only 65% of the new units had a Chipotlane in Q1 for the full year, we still anticipate opening around 200 new restaurants with more than 70%, including a Chipotlane. 
As of March 31, we had a total of 196 Chipotlanes, including 5 conversions. Customers love the Chipotlane experience as it is the access channel that excels have provided convenience, speed and great value all at the same time. Performance continues to be stellar. 
In trailing 12 months, Chipotlane restaurants continue to drive 17% higher overall digital sales compared to non-Chipotlane. An order ahead, our highest margin transaction is nearly 80% higher than non-Chipotlanes, while delivering our lowest margin transaction is about 30% lower than our non-Chipotlane restaurants. 
New Chipotlane opening was about 15% higher sales. And the comp restaurant -- at the comp at the 69 Chipotlane restaurants that have been opened more than a year, continues to outperform the non-Chipotlane restaurants from the same open period. 
Beyond the significant growth opportunity in the U.S., we're excited to accelerate new restaurant opens in Canada, which was recently validated by our stage-gate process. We're building a healthy new restaurant pipeline and expect to open a handful of restaurants over the next 12 months including our first Chipotlane in late summer. We'll continue to experiment with different location formats and restaurant designs throughout the country to gauge consumer preferences. Ultimately, we believe we can open at least a few hundred restaurants in Canada, especially with their unit economics now approaching those of the U.S. 
The recent Surrey, British Columbia opening, which is our first new Canadian location 3 years, opened very strong and gives us even greater confidence about our growth strategy. 
Let me close by thanking all of our team members who have proven their agility to operate through uncertainty while also staying focused on our long-term purpose. Their commitment to constant improvement of the customer dining experience while strengthening our branded business is what helps drive our strategic growth initiatives. The combination of investing in our people, delivering relevant and compelling marketing, leveraging our digital system to enhance convenient access and great execution in our restaurants is leading to a better guest experience, which ultimately allows us to further strengthen our powerful economic model. 
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

And I guess, Brian or Jack, can you elaborate on what you're seeing as that activity returns in terms of sales and mix?

Look, what we're definitely seeing is people want to be back in our dining rooms. I've had the luxury of traveling recently, and Scott and I have been at numerous restaurants, and it's great to see the lines again in our dining rooms. And we're seeing a nice rebound, obviously, in those dining room sales because there weren't any a year ago. 
And at the same time, what we're seeing is our digital business is really continuing to thrive. In the quarter, I don't know if you guys picked up on this, but we had record sales for our digital business despite the fact that our dining rooms are opening. So I think it just demonstrates the power of both access modes, meaning the in-restaurant dining access mode and the digital access mode. And then not surprising, you're seeing the occasions come back based on whether you're coming into the dining room or whether you're ordering off-premise. And that's more tied to how open the region is, is how I would kind of describe it. 
So we're feeling great about where we are. Consumer sentiment is definitely one where they want to get back out to socialize and get back into the dining rooms and have that in-dining experience. And then at the same token for those occasions that they build the behaviors around digitally, those are remaining in the business. And I think that's why you're seeing our results in Q1. And frankly, while I'm really proud of our teams that we're managing these 2 businesses out of 1 kitchen with really excellence."

Listen, the last price increase that we took, it doesn't get us all the way to where a delivery transaction delivers the same margin as an in-store transaction, and certainly not as much as our highest transaction, the order ahead. It gets it very, very close. 
From a dollar standpoint, they're pretty close. But as you know, when you are charging higher prices, you're grossing up the sales, and so it makes it a little harder to fully capture that margin. But I would say, we're within striking distance. We're maybe a few percentage points away if we wanted to completely equalize the margin on an in-store transaction for delivery. So we've made a lot of progress over the last year. 
And when we've taken these increases along the way, we've seen either acceptable resistance. And we've also seen what looks like people are shifting channels because it does look like our order head moves up when we do see customers maybe resist the higher pricing in those delivery channels a bit."

And then with conversions, we want to opportunistically look at relocations and rebuilds, remodels where we can add a Chipotlane. We still think that we can have hundreds of conversions.
It's hard to pin that down, though because, in essence, what you do is we have to -- as we approach the end of a lease term, like let's say, you've got a 10-year primary term with options. When you get to year 7 or 8, that's the time you have the conversation with landlords. If you try to have the conversation with landlords to try to get permission to modify the space in year 2 or 3, when you've got 7 years left, landlord doesn't really want to have that conversation.
So we have those conversations, and we have many of them throughout the year. If you look back to 10 years ago, we will have 100 or more, maybe in the 100, 150 range, where we're having conversations with landlords. Those conversations are going well.

So in the places where we're more open, we got more of our dining room business back. And our digital business is hanging in there.

We made some important steps over the last several months, so that we're within striking distance of that algorithm. And we see from here on out, as our volumes grow, our AUV was $2,270 million. And as we grow to $2.4 million,  $2.5 million, et cetera, et cetera, we think that our margin will move to 24 than a 25.
Now that's not going to happen every single quarter. It's not going to be perfect. But in terms of seeing our margins move up with our volumes, we still expect that to happen. Now there is a slight degradation as you move from $2.5 million to $3 million, for example, you might not get to all the way to 30% in terms of the margin for a $3 million restaurant. But you certainly should get in the 28% to 29% range.
So we still fully expect that we'll be able to expand margins. And one of the things that's enabling that is with the growth -- the significant growth in the delivery business, that has been -- still is our lowest-margin transaction, but we've closed the gaps considerably and our customers are still choosing that channel or they're choosing another channel. So giving the customers choice and let them pay for the more extreme convenience channel of delivery, let them pay the going rate, seems to be a workable strategy for us."

With that, obviously, we are quick to want to staff up our restaurants accordingly to be in sync with where our business is growing.
The positive is it came back really fast in March. The negative in that is you got to play a little bit of catch-up with the staffing. But I think our employee value proposition is world-class. And as people realize these opportunities are available, usually, we have no problem with the applicant flow. And then we turn our attention to training and developing these individuals because it's a great opportunity for not just the job now, but a future career.
So It's great to see the business come roaring back. It's also exciting to see our need to staff more people because that is the growth that we like to have. We like to have growth that results in more jobs and more people having upward opportunities.

First of all, Andy, in the last year, what we've seen with labor inflation has -- it's been more modest than it had been in the last 5 years. In the last 5 years, we've seen inflation in kind of the mid-single-digit range. And with so",438,"Yes, I'll take this. First of all, Andy, in the last year, what we've seen with labor inflation has -- it's been more modest than it had been in the last 5 years. In the last 5 years, we've seen inflation in kind of the mid-single-digit range. And with some of the dislocations going on with COVID, actually, the labor inflation dropped to the low single digits. But we expect -- I think most people expect that's going to tick back up. And -- but let me just give you an example because the other thing that you might be thinking about is what if we have a national minimum wage that over time, approaches $15.
Now the way to think about this is our minimum wage -- or our average wage right now is $12 for our crew, it's $13 for all of our hourly employees. We're not that far off of, like, for example, a $15 number. But let's say, for example, that there's going to be an across-the-board 10% increase in our wages, that would have an impact on our margins of, call it, 150 to 200 basis points. And that would -- to offset that with menu pricing, that would take a 2% to 3% price increase. So all of that is very, very manageable. And we feel like if there is going to be significant increased inflation because of market-driven or because of federal minimum wage, we think everybody in the restaurant industry is going to have to pass those costs along to the customer, and we think we're in a much, much better position to do that than other companies out there.
In terms of commodities, the one that we're seeing for sure, and this is more of a seasonal shift that we see pretty much every year is avocados. We are going to see an increase in avocado prices as we shift into the next season. We don't see anything else moving up dramatically right now, Andy. I mean I think everyone's kind of waiting to see what happens in terms of demand and if there are any disruptions with supply chain. We're not seeing any that we're worried about right now. But with everyone talking about with the stimulus and the reopening and the vaccine, there is going to be a surge in demand. And we think we're well prepared from a supply chain standpoint, but that's the only kind of wildcard as the year unfolds is will there be maybe a cyclical or interim dislocation or maybe there is some commodity inflation, but nothing that we're seeing right now."

So obviously, the first quarter, I think Jack covered it in his remarks, the geometric average was in the 20%, 21% range. I would obviously tell you January was a really good start. February kind of flattish, and March was really strong. Obviously, you got a much easier rollover. And then we talked about all the things we did around launching quesadillas and dining rooms start to reopen, so on and so forth.
Then as you move into April, if you think about this 2-year, I think that's probably the best way to think about our business right now because of what you're seeing in kind of the year ago performance on Easter and so on and so forth. The good news is, we've seen days and weeks where you're in the 20s, and we've seen days and weeks where you're in the high teens. So it's bouncing around a little bit. And I think a lot of things are driving that, right? You're still seeing things flash around COVID in different parts of the country. Unfortunately, we had the pause in the vaccines. So you've got some consumer sentiment, I think, bouncing around, which, obviously, plays a role. And then obviously, we're going to be more in the leverage phase of our quesadillas launch versus our launch phase, which is what we're taking into account as we think it will normalize as you go down into the rest of the quarter.
So those are some of the puts and calls. We're, what, a couple of weeks into the second quarter. We love where we are, and we'll see how the rest of the quarter unfolds because I think we've got the right strategies. So we're going to stay focused on what we know has been working for us."

Chipotle's second quarter results highlight the strength of our brand and our people as we demonstrated growing momentum in our business. Over the past 15 months, our teams have done an admirable job navigating and executing against macro complexities while giving us great optimism for where we go from here. While COVID challenges remain, including uncertainty regarding the impact of the Delta variant, I'm confident that our teams are up to the challenge and we're hopeful that we'll gradually see a more stable environment over time. 
Specific to Chipotle, we're pleased that all of our restaurants are now open and most are back to normal operations. For the quarter, we reported sales of $1.9 billion, representing 38.7% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 31.2% comparable restaurant sales growth. Restaurant-level margin of 24.5% was more than double the 12.2% we reported last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $7.46, representing a significant increase over the $0.40 reported last year. Digital sales growth of 10.5% year-over-year, representing 48.5% of sales. And we opened 56 new restaurants, including 45 with the Chipotle. And I'm delighted to report that Q3 is also off to a strong start.  
Even 12-month AUV is $2.41 million. The underlying run rate during the quarter is now above the historical peak of $2.5 million AUV. When we started this transformation a little over 3 years ago, I was often asked whether I thought we could get back to our peak $2.5 million volumes. My answer was yes. And when we achieve it, we will talk about growth beyond that. 
So it's a nice achievement for our organization to have $2.5 million AUVs again. But more importantly, we have growth strategies that will take us to the next leg of our journey, $3 million AUVs, along with industry-leading returns on invested capital that improve as we continue to add Chipotlanes.  
Stronger restaurant-level economics, combined with significant unit growth should allow us to optimize earnings power for many years to come. In fact, we remain confident in our key growth strategies and believe that over the longer term, they will allow us to have 6,000 restaurants in North America with AUVs pushing well beyond $3 million. Yes, the opportunity ahead of us remains significant. 
So what are the key strategies that are resonating with guests and allowing us to win today while we create the future? To no one's surprise, they are the same ones we've been talking about for some time, namely: opening and running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement, engaging with customers through our loyalty program to drive transactions and frequency, making the brand visible relevant and loved and utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation. 
Let me now provide a brief update on each of these, starting with our outstanding operations. This is a key focal point as our business is building on our digital gains along with in-restaurant strength due to a more confident and mobile consumer as well as the hard work our team has done to build more love for Chipotle. We've continued to make operational adjustments to adapt to the constantly changing environment, which has led us to recovering about 70% of in-restaurant sales thus far while retaining about 80% of digital sales. 
It's no secret that running great restaurants requires great people with a terrific culture, and we are privileged to have the best of both. Despite the labor challenges in certain parts of the country, the team has remained focused on safety, reliability, excellent culinary and experiences. I'm extremely proud of our world-class employee value proposition. We're providing industry-leading benefits, including a new virtual mental health platform, expanded debt-free degrees, attractive wages that were recently increased to an average of $15 per hour specialized job training and development and significant career advancement opportunities. 
And because more than 90% of our restaurant management roles are internal promotes, employees who join the Chipotle family know they have the opportunity to grow their careers with us. Through investing in our people, we have been able to maintain the stability of our workforce over the last 2 years. Knowing that our people are the key to our growth, we have been diligent in our recruiting focus since the start of the year. And reimagining the African experience, we're leveraging partnerships that allow us to engage in authentic conversations with prospective candidates and share all the opportunity Chipotle has to offer. 
Our coast-to-coast Career Day event last week resulted in us hiring thousands of additional team members to meet current demand and accommodate future growth. These efforts have dramatically helped improve our labor position. And as a result, our restaurants are attracting and retaining excellent employees in a tough labor environment. 
After visiting several restaurants this past month, I'm encouraged to see more and more guests enjoying their meals and are dining ores. They ordered Chipotle because they can get the exact customized meal they want made with real ingredients faster than anywhere else. As a result, we are committed to teaching, training and validating the 5 pillars of throughput every day during every shift to ensure we meet our high standards and provide a great guest experience. 
Over the past few years, Chipotle has evolved to a point where we now have 2 sizable businesses in restaurants as well as our record-breaking digital platform, that are helping us become a real food focused digital lifestyle brand. During the second quarter, digital sales grew about 11% year-over-year to $916 million and represented nearly 49% of sales. 
While COVID has, of course, helped bolster these digital gains, ongoing technology investments and operational excellence have been the critical success factors. Some examples of the digital innovations we've introduced include the addition of our concierge chatbot to the Chipotle app, which has the ability to answer common questions and resolve issues more efficiently. Thus freeing up our customer care team's time to help gas with more complicated situations. 
We also gave guests the ability to easily rate their order right in the app and online at chipotle.com, providing our restaurant operations teams with actionable insights on how to maintain and improve the digital guest experience. Additionally, we have opened a digital-only kitchen, continued expanding our digital drive-throughs with Chipotlanes being the majority of our new restaurant openings refreshed group ordering and invested in digital internationally by launching the Chipotle app in Canada and implementing our digital assets in Europe. While the results and positive feedback on these innovations show us we're on the right track, we know there's still more to do to enhance the customer experience by expanding access and minimizing friction. 
Not only are we pleased with the level of digital sales and overall mix, we're also delighted to see that our highest margin transaction digital pickup orders is gaining traction, and we expect this to continue as we add more Chipotlanes and customers experience the value of this occasion. As I mentioned earlier, we held on to about 80% of our digital gains exiting Q2. This highlights our digital experience is sticky because it's everything customers love about Chipotle with added convenience. 
And due to the pandemic, many new consumers were introduced to Chipotle via our digital channels and are now using us for alternative and often incremental occasions. Naturally, we believe our digital sales mix will moderate as capacity restrictions ease and guests feel more comfortable physically ordering and dining in our restaurants. However, we expect absolute digital sales dollars to find a new equilibrium in 2021 and grow from there. We're encouraged to see that so far in July, we continue to hold on to these digital gains even as in-store recovery has strengthened. 
Moving next to the loyalty program, which is a key enabler of our digital ecosystem and an expanding network that now has more than 23 million members. With this large base of consumers, Chipotle can distribute its own content more and more effectively and drive deeper levels of engagement within this community than ever before. We are leveraging our CRM platform to drive brand engagement and send personalized messages to help supercharge our super fans. We have proven that we can influence decisions along a guest buying journey when we offer them the right individually tailored offers at the right time. We're continuously improving our analytics and are consistently able to generate more transactions from light, medium and high-frequency users. 
With the recent announcement of Rewards exchange, we're optimistic we can continue to build upon our success. The updated functionality provides greater customization and flexibility to redeem rewards and allows guests to earn rewards faster, all of which is expected to improve engagement and drive additional frequency. While we are off to a terrific start, we will continue to invest in the program to take it to the next level and have other enhancements to the program that are expected to be rolled out by year-end. 
While the loyalty program is used to help drive frequency, our marketing efforts are primarily designed to bring more people to the brand. The combination of reach-based media and a successful frequency-driven loyalty program, make a great 1-2 punch that both brings in new users and increases transactions with our existing customers. The marketing team continues to ensure that relevant creative across a wide variety of media channels enables the brand to remain visible and live at the intersection of Chipotlane culture. 
Their agile approach, innovative mindset and relentless commitment to measurement have led to ongoing success. For example, our campaign to support the Casa deal launch was omnichannel with relevant creative across online video, digital and social media platforms as well as via traditional TV spots. 
We also celebrated team Chipotle, a group of American athletes who love the brand long before they became famous. Their personalized unwrapped videos provide an inside look at Chipotle's athlete, super fans and what it takes to compete at the highest level. It also highlights the training hard and eating real food with real ingredients go hand in hand. Furthermore, our Burritos and Bitcoin campaign around National Brito Day was one of our most successful social initiatives to date with billions of impressions for this culturally relevant promotion. These are just a few examples of the brand's work to drive culture, drive difference and ultimately drive a purchase. Another important pillar of our marketing efforts is a steady stream of new menu innovation with a cadence of on average about 2 to 3 per year. 
Cauliflower Rice was a seasonal item that enhanced our lifestyle bowls and the successful of bringing in new guests. We launched Kids as a permanent digital exclusive offering in March, and this menu item continues to perform well as it appears in about 10% of our transactions and is also helping attract new customers to Chipotle. 
Our talented culinary team is far from finished and our pipeline is filled with promise. I'm pleased to report that smoke brisket has been validated by our stage gate process. In addition, we are also in the early stages of developing other exciting menu items that we will validate using our stage gate that will bring news and new customers to the brand. To conclude, Chipotle is a unique brand committed to fostering a culture that values and champions our diversity while leveraging the individual talents of all team members to grow our business, elevate our brand and cultivate a better world. 
Well-trained and supported people preparing safe, delicious food and delivering excellent guest experiences are at the heart of our success. A big thank you to all our hard-working employees for making this possible. As a result, I'm convinced more than ever that we have the right team, the right culture and the right strategies to allow Chipotle to be a premier growth company for many years to come. With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials."
26446,717035841,2348282,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2021",2021-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report solid second quarter results with sales growing 38.7% year-over-year to $1.9 billion as comp sales grew 31.2%. Restaurant-level margin of 24.5% was more than double the 12.2% margin from",1355,"Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report solid second quarter results with sales growing 38.7% year-over-year to $1.9 billion as comp sales grew 31.2%. Restaurant-level margin of 24.5% was more than double the 12.2% margin from last year and represents the highest margin since 2015. And earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $7.46, a significant improvement over last year's adjusted EPS of $0.40. Just like last quarter, the second quarter had unusual expenses related to our 2018 performance share modification related to COVID, restaurant asset impairments and closure costs, legal expenses as well as transformation costs, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.86 and leading to GAAP earnings per share of $6.60. 
Looking ahead to Q3, while uncertainty still exists with the potential impact of the Delta variant as well as the pace of the economic recovery if current sales trends continue, we expect our comps to be in the low to mid-double-digit range, which implies a nice sequential acceleration in our geometric 2-year stack. 
This is due to the menu price increase we took in early June, which is holding strong so far, as well as in-restaurant sales continuing to recover. Of course, we'll closely monitor developments regarding the delta variant and follow all local protocols to ensure the safety of our restaurant teams and our customers. 
As Brian mentioned, in June, we increased our average hourly rate to $15 and subsequently took a 3.5% to 4% menu price increase to cover the cost in dollar terms. While average restaurant cash flow remains the same this lowers margin by about 80 basis points and an increase in sales by about $100,000 on an annual basis. So the historic margin algorithm we have discussed is not as relevant going forward. However, we maintain our goal of being able to pass through approximately 40% of incremental sales to restaurant cash flow, which is an important piece of our earnings growth potential. 
This is critical as we march towards AUVs of $3 million as higher sales will lead to higher margins and cash on cash return -- restaurant returns should increase well above the low to mid-60% range we're seeing today. 
Let me now go through the key P&L line items. Food costs were 30.4% in Q2, a decrease of nearly 300 basis points from last year. This was due primarily to leverage from menu price increases as well as lower beef prices, which were partially offset by higher costs associated with new menu items and avocados. Given the current environment, it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that Q3 is going to be challenged by several industry-wide issues, most notably beef and freight costs as well as staffing shortages at our suppliers. 
We anticipate these commodity headwinds will negatively impact the quarter by an additional 60 to 80 basis points, essentially offsetting the benefit of menu price increases. This will result in food cost for Q3 being at or slightly above the percentage we saw in Q2. Over the next few quarters, we'll have greater visibility on how much of this inflation is permanent versus transitory, and we can take the appropriate actions as needed to help offset any lasting impacts. 
Labor costs for the quarter were 24.5%, a decrease of 370 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage and to a lesser extent, efficiencies related to digital orders which were partially offset by higher wages that we saw for just 1 month during the quarter. We expect labor cost to be in the low 26% range during Q3 to reflect a full quarter of our wage increase. 
Other operating costs for the quarter were 15.2%, a decrease of 400 basis points from last year due primarily to sales leverage and lower promotional expenses. Marketing promo costs for the quarter were 2.4%, a decrease of 260 basis points versus the prior year due to a significant level of free delivery promotions last year. 
We anticipate marketing expense to be in the mid-2% range in Q3 and while the full year 2021 marketing spend is expected to remain about 3% of sales. Overall, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid-15% range for the quarter. G&A for the quarter was $146 million on a GAAP basis or $119 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $23.5 million for the previously mentioned modification to our 2018 performance shares for legal expenses and $1.2 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes $92 million in underlying G&A, about $22.5 million related to noncash stock comp and nearly $4.5 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity vesting and stock option exercises. Looking to Q3, we expect our underlying G&A to be around $96 million as we continue to make investments primarily in technology to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will likely be around $25 million in Q3, although this amount could move up or down based on our absolute performance. We also expect to recognize around $4 million related to performance-based bonus expenses and employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter as well as about $1 million related to our -- All Manager Conference scheduled for Q1 of next year. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 23.7% on a GAAP basis and 22.4% on a non-GAAP basis. 
And similar to last quarter, our effective tax rate benefited from option exercises and share vesting at elevated stock prices. For fiscal 2021, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items. 
Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with nearly $1.2 billion in cash restricted cash and investments with no debt, along with a $500 million untapped revolver. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased 145 million of our stock at an average price of $1,408. We had about $208 million remaining on our share authorization as of June 30 and expect to continue to prioritize using excess free cash flow to repurchase stock. But as I've said before, the best returns we can generate are by investing in more Chipotle. 
And during Q2, we opened 56 new restaurants with 45 of these, including a Chipotlane. And despite some external challenges, the development team continues to do an excellent job building new restaurants as well as developing a robust new unit development pipeline. 
For the full year, we now expect to be at or slightly above our prior 2021 guidance of 200 new restaurants with more than 70%, including a Chipotlane. As of June 30, we had a total of 240 Chipotlanes, including 8 conversions and 6 relocations, and they continue to enhance access into convenience forecasts while demonstrating superior performance. 
New Chipotlanes are opening with about 20% higher sales compared to the non-Chipotlanes nonsupport during the same time period. Over the trailing 12 months, Chipotlane restaurants continue to drive about a 15% higher overall digital sales mix compared to non-Chipotlane and is skewed heavily towards order ahead, our highest margin transaction. And a 2-year geometric comp at the AD Poland restaurants that have been opened more than a year, continues to outperform the non-Chipotlane restaurants from the same period. 
Along it's early days, but in conversions and relocations, which are both going through the stage gate process, are yielding encouraging results. We'll continue to learn and refine our approach to judiciously accelerate our Chipotlane portfolio, whether it be in older existing restaurants, strategic relocations of existing restaurants or through new restaurant additions. 
In closing, I want to reiterate how proud and thankful I am to all Chipotle team members for their tireless efforts. They're helping create value every day for our business, our communities, our shareholders, and each other, which is taking our amazing brand to new heights. As one strong team unified by our purpose and values, we remain committed to driving our powerful and durable economic model. Needless to say, my optimism for Chipotle's long-term potential has never been higher. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

So I'm just wondering like what has changed in the marketplace that's allowing you to get there now? And maybe that's a function of also growing the pipeline for next year, if there's anything you can say even qualitatively on that. 
And then just the second part is around best practices. Like how are things going outside of the U.S.? How is Canada? I think maybe the first Chipotlane opened. How is Western Europe, I think you're going to suburbs and testing technology -- What are some shared best practices?"

To get to your specific question about new unit openings. Obviously, we're halfway through the year. So that gives us more confidence in where we're going to end the year. And I think we talked about coming into the year how we had a really strong pipeline of units that were planned to be open. The team has done a phenomenal job in securing the people capability to be ready to open the restaurants. They've done a phenomenal job on the supply chain to ensure that we have everything we need to open restaurants, and we've continued to have really great openings. So the combination of sites lined up, supply chain in place, people capability ready to go gives us just that much more confidence on how we'll finish out the year to reinforce our guidance around 200-plus new openings. And we continue to build a really robust pipeline going forward. that's primarily driven by Chipotlanes, which is also a huge enabler for the business going forward. 
Your second question about what are we seeing in Canada and Europe. Canada continues to perform, and we're really excited about the opportunity of opening more restaurants out there. Obviously, Canada has been a little bit slower on the reopening process. But even despite that, they continue to deliver great economics and frankly, are performing in line with the U.S., and we're very optimistic about how we can continue to open and grow in Canada. In Europe, I think I mentioned this in some of our recent investor meetings. We just opened 2 new restaurants outside of London, and both of those are off to really good starts. We're just a couple of weeks in but we love the diversity of assets that we're opening. We love the fact that we have our digital assets all in place. And I'm optimistic about what we're going to learn so that we can really give clarity on the opportunity in Europe down the road. But that's still in the early stages of our stage gate process. And I think I've mentioned this in the past, probably COVID has slowed us down in our learning there than anywhere else. But love what we're seeing in the U.S. on new units, and it's exciting to the economics we're getting out of Canada."

And what we're seeing is the overlap is still in that 15-plus percent range of people doing both channels. which leaves the door open for a lot of incremental occasions or different occasions. The 1 thing that is driving some of the bounce back in our dining room business is we are seeing more business at lunch. And we're also seeing that lunch business occur Monday through Friday. And then when you look at kind of like suburban versus urban, that's another place where you're starting to see clearly people return to work or return to normal I would say, behaviors throughout their day. So the lunch occasion is definitely coming back while we're hanging on to all these new occasions around dinner and a lot of these off-premise occasions we've been talking about over time. I'm guessing we'll continue to see the overlap slowly go up from here because as more people return to the dining room, I'm hoping they've had really positive experiences digitally that will suggest, hey, I want to give Chipotle a try in the dining room and vice versa. Hopefully, people that are dining room-only people have heard great things about our rewards program, our digital system and they'll start giving that to try. But the thing I love about the 2 businesses, they serve different occasions, different needs. And I think that proves over the long run, these things are incremental or complementary."

Our general managers know that they have the ability to become field leaders and our field leaders know they have the ability to become team directors.

It's been, geez, well over a year since folks all lines. And for some of our employees, it's the first time you're seeing lines. And for customers, too, part of the process of getting people move down the line quickly is they need to know, how to order what they want to order and getting back to individual meals as well as our team members being quick to move them down the line, but doing it in an accurate way. So we still have opportunity on the throughput front, but I think that's just a matter of retraining building that muscle on our throughput pillars, and I'm confident we're going to capture that opportunity.

If you -- the on-premise ordering, it feels like it's something like $0.5 million per store lower than it was pre-COVID. But in some ways, you're not missing it because you have high-margin digital orders. But some of this is probably going to come back because people are still a little COVID cautious, you worker shortages, work from home and some of those things will burn off. So how do you think about the melt up in that on-premise order business? And how much of it maybe is semi-permanently shifted to digital ordering?"

As much as we've replicated the in-line experience online, it's -- there's still something to be said to walking down the line, seeing the food, getting the sites, the sounds, the smells and getting probably another level of customization that I think is very engaging to customers and they want to have that experience. So I think our dining rooms are going to keep coming back. And I also think it's human nature. You want to eat out, like you like a change of scenery. People like to share a meal -- And I've probably been 1 of the few that keep saying dinings will come back.

We can watch how the inflation unfolds over the next few months, the next few quarters. We can see how much is transitory, how much is going to be permitted.

The other thing I want to touch on is, obviously, we're very optimistic about Chipotle's long-term growth plans. I think we have the ability to grow units, grow average unit volumes, grow margins frankly, grow everything you want to grow and then at the same time, grow our organization. So people have the opportunity to grow with this company and participate in all this wonderful growth. And that's really what I think, is driving the strong employee value proposition that's resulting in us being able to staff our restaurants at an effective rate right now. So very proud of this organization, very proud of our results and also very optimistic about the future. So thank you for joining us, and we're going to get back to cultivating a better world.

Chipotle's second quarter results highlight the strength of our brand and our people, as we demonstrated growing momentum in our business. Over the past 15 months, our teams have done an admirable job navigating and executing against macro complexities while giving us great optimism for where we go from here. While COVID challenges remain, including uncertainty regarding the impact of the Delta variant, I'm confident that our teams are up to the challenge and we're hopeful that we'll gradually see a more stable environment over time.  
Specific to Chipotle, we're pleased that all of our restaurants are now open and most are back to normal operations. For the quarter, we reported sales of $1.9 billion, representing 38.7% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 31.2% comparable restaurant sales growth. Restaurant-level margin of 24.5% was more than double the 12.2% we reported last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $7.46, representing a significant increase over the $0.40 reported last year. Digital sales growth of 10.5% year-over-year, representing 48.5% of sales. And we opened 56 new restaurants, including 45 with the Chipotlanes. And I'm delighted to report that Q3 is also off to a strong start.   
While our trailing 12-month AUV is $2.41 million, the underlying run rate during the quarter is now above the historical peak of $2.5 million AUV. When we started this transformation a little over 3 years ago, I was often asked whether I thought we could get back to our peak $2.5 million volumes. My answer was yes. And when we achieve it, we will talk about growth beyond that.  
So it's a nice achievement for our organization to have $2.5 million AUVs again. But more importantly, we have growth strategies that will take us to the next leg of our journey, $3 million AUVs, along with industry-leading returns on invested capital that improve as we continue to add Chipotlanes.   
Stronger restaurant-level economics, combined with significant unit growth should allow us to optimize earnings power for many years to come. In fact, we remain confident in our key growth strategies and believe that over the longer term, they will allow us to have 6,000 restaurants in North America with AUVs pushing well beyond $3 million. Yes, the opportunity ahead of us remains significant.  
So what are the key strategies that are resonating with guests and allowing us to win today while we create the future? To no one's surprise, they are the same ones we've been talking about for some time, namely: opening and running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement, engaging with customers through our loyalty program to drive transactions and frequency, making the brand visible, relevant and loved and utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation. 
Let me now provide a brief update on each of these, starting with our outstanding operations. This is a key focal point as our business is building on our digital gains along with in-restaurant strength due to a more confident and mobile consumer as well as the hard work our team has done to build more love for Chipotle. We've continued to make operational adjustments to adapt to the constantly changing environment, which has led us to recovering about 70% of in-restaurant sales thus far while retaining about 80% of digital sales.  
It's no secret that running great restaurants requires great people with a terrific culture, and we are privileged to have the best of both. Despite the labor challenges in certain parts of the country, the team has remained focused on safety, reliability, excellent culinary and experiences. I'm extremely proud of our world-class employee value proposition. We're providing industry-leading benefits, including a new virtual mental health platform, expanded debt-free degrees, attractive wages that were recently increased to an average of $15 per hour, specialized job training and development and significant career advancement opportunities.  
And because more than 90% of our restaurant management roles are internal promotes, employees who join the Chipotle family know they have the opportunity to grow their careers with us. Through investing in our people, we have been able to maintain the stability of our workforce over the last 2 years. Knowing that our people are the key to our growth, we have been diligent in our recruiting focus since the start of the year. In reimagining the applicant experience, we're leveraging partnerships that allow us to engage in authentic conversations with prospective candidates and share all the opportunity Chipotle has to offer.  
Our coast-to-coast Career Day event last week resulted in us hiring thousands of additional team members to meet current demand and accommodate future growth. These efforts have dramatically helped improve our labor position. And as a result, our restaurants are attracting and retaining excellent employees in a tough labor environment.  
After visiting several restaurants this past month, I'm encouraged to see more and more guests enjoying their meals in our dining rooms. They ordered Chipotle because they can get the exact customized meal they want, made with real ingredients faster than anywhere else. As a result, we are committed to teaching, training and validating the 5 pillars of throughput every day, during every shift, to ensure we meet our high standards and provide a great guest experience.  
Over the past few years, Chipotle has evolved to a point where we now have 2 sizable businesses, in restaurants as well as our record-breaking digital platform, that are helping us become a real food-focused digital lifestyle brand. During the second quarter, digital sales grew about 11% year-over-year to $916 million and represented nearly 49% of sales. While COVID has, of course, helped bolster these digital gains, ongoing technology investments and operational excellence have been the critical success factors. Some examples of the digital innovations we've introduced include the addition of our concierge chatbot, Pepper, to the Chipotle app, which has the ability to answer common questions and resolve issues more efficiently, thus freeing up our customer care team's time to help guests with more complicated situations.  
We also gave guests the ability to easily rate their order right in the app and online at chipotle.com, providing our restaurant operations teams with actionable insights on how to maintain and improve the digital guest experience. Additionally, we have opened a digital-only kitchen, continued expanding our digital drive-throughs with Chipotlanes being the majority of our new restaurant openings, refreshed group ordering and invested in digital internationally by launching the Chipotle app in Canada and implementing our digital assets in Europe. While the results and positive feedback on these innovations show us we're on the right track, we know there's still more to do to enhance the customer experience by expanding access and minimizing friction.  
Not only are we pleased with the level of digital sales and overall mix, we're also delighted to see that our highest margin transaction, digital pickup orders is gaining traction, and we expect this to continue as we add more Chipotlanes and customers experience the value of this occasion. As I mentioned earlier, we held on to about 80% of our digital gains exiting Q2. This highlights our digital experience as sticky because it is everything customers love about Chipotle with added convenience.  
And due to the pandemic, many new consumers were introduced to Chipotle via our digital channels and are now using us for alternative and often incremental occasions. Naturally, we believe our digital sales mix will moderate as capacity restrictions ease and guests feel more comfortable physically ordering and dining in our restaurants. However, we expect absolute digital sales dollars to find a new equilibrium in 2021 and grow from there. We're encouraged to see that so far in July, we continue to hold on to these digital gains even as in-store recovery has strengthened.  
Moving next to the loyalty program, which is a key enabler of our digital ecosystem and an expanding network that now has more than 23 million members. With this large base of consumers, Chipotle can distribute its own content more and more effectively and drive deeper levels of engagement within this community than ever before. We are leveraging our CRM platform to drive brand engagement and send personalized messages to help supercharge our super fans. We have proven that we can influence decisions along a guest buying journey when we offer them the right individually tailored offers at the right time. We're continuously improving our analytics and are consistently able to generate more transactions from light, medium and high-frequency users.  
With the recent announcement of Rewards exchange, we're optimistic we can continue to build upon our success. The updated functionality provides greater customization and flexibility to redeem rewards and allows guests to earn rewards faster, all of which is expected to improve engagement and drive additional frequency. While we are off to a terrific start, we will continue to invest in the program to take it to the next level and have other enhancements to the program that are expected to be rolled out by year-end.  
While the loyalty program is used to help drive frequency, our marketing efforts are primarily designed to bring more people to the brand. The combination of reach-based media and a successful frequency-driven loyalty program, make a great 1-2 punch that both brings in new users and increases transactions with our existing customers. The marketing team continues to ensure that relevant creative across a wide variety of media channels enables the brand to remain visible and live at the intersection of Chipotlane culture.  
Their agile approach, innovative mindset and relentless commitment to measurement have led to ongoing success. For example, our campaign to support the quesadilla launch was omnichannel with relevant creative across online video, digital and social media platforms as well as via traditional TV spots.  
We also celebrated team Chipotle, a group of American athletes who love the brand long before they became famous. Their personalized unwrapped videos provide an inside look at Chipotle's athlete, super fans and what it takes to compete at the highest level. It also highlights that training hard and eating real food with real ingredients go hand in hand. Furthermore, our Burritos and Bitcoin campaign around National Burrito Day was one of our most successful social initiatives to date, with billions of impressions for this culturally relevant promotion. These are just a few examples of the brand's work to drive culture, drive difference and ultimately, drive a purchase. Another important pillar of our marketing efforts is a steady stream of new menu innovation, with a cadence of on average about 2 to 3 per year.  
Cauliflower Rice was a seasonal item that enhanced our lifestyle bowls and was successful bringing in new guests. We launched quesadillas as a permanent digital exclusive offering in March, and this menu item continues to perform well as it appears in about 10% of our transactions and is also helping attract new customers to Chipotle.  
Our talented culinary team is far from finished and our pipeline is filled with promise. I'm pleased to report that smoked brisket has been validated by our stage-gate process. In addition, we are also in the early stages of developing other exciting menu items that we will validate using our stage-gate that will bring news and new customers to the brand. To conclude, Chipotle is a unique brand committed to fostering a culture that values and champions our diversity while leveraging the individual talents of all team members to grow our business, elevate our brand and cultivate a better world.  
Well-trained and supported people preparing safe, delicious food and delivering excellent guest experiences are at the heart of our success. A big thank you to all our hard-working employees for making this possible. As a result, I'm convinced more than ever that we have the right team, the right culture and the right strategies to allow Chipotle to be a premier growth company for many years to come. With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials."
26446,717035841,2348340,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2021",2021-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report solid second quarter results with sales growing 38.7% year-over-year to $1.9 billion as comp sales grew 31.2%. Restaurant-level margin of 24.5% was more than double the 12.2% margin from",1352,"Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report solid second quarter results with sales growing 38.7% year-over-year to $1.9 billion as comp sales grew 31.2%. Restaurant-level margin of 24.5% was more than double the 12.2% margin from last year and represents the highest margin since 2015. And earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $7.46, a significant improvement over last year's adjusted EPS of $0.40. Just like last quarter, the second quarter had unusual expenses related to our 2018 performance share modification related to COVID, restaurant asset impairments and closure costs, legal expenses as well as transformation costs, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.86, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $6.60.  
Looking ahead to Q3, while uncertainty still exists with the potential impact of the Delta variant, as well as the pace of the economic recovery, if current sales trends continue, we expect our comps to be in the low to mid-double-digit range, which implies a nice sequential acceleration in our geometric 2-year stack. 
This is due to the menu price increase we took in early June, which is holding strong so far, as well as in-restaurant sales continuing to recover. Of course, we'll closely monitor developments regarding the delta variant and follow all local protocols to ensure the safety of our restaurant teams and our customers.  
As Brian mentioned, in June, we increased our average hourly rate to $15 and subsequently took a 3.5% to 4% menu price increase to cover the cost in dollar terms. While average restaurant cash flow remains the same, this lowers margin by about 80 basis points and an increase in sales by about $100,000 on an annual basis. So the historic margin algorithm we have discussed is not as relevant going forward. However, we maintain our goal of being able to pass through approximately 40% of incremental sales to restaurant cash flow, which is an important piece of our earnings growth potential.  
This is critical as we march towards AUVs of $3 million as higher sales will lead to higher margins and cash on cash return -- restaurant returns should increase well above the low to mid-60% range we're seeing today.  
Let me now go through the key P&L line items. Food costs were 30.4% in Q2, a decrease of nearly 300 basis points from last year. This was due primarily to leverage from menu price increases as well as lower beef prices, which were partially offset by higher costs associated with new menu items and avocados. Given the current environment, it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that Q3 is going to be challenged by several industry-wide issues, most notably beef and freight costs as well as staffing shortages at our suppliers.  
We anticipate these commodity headwinds will negatively impact the quarter by an additional 60 to 80 basis points, essentially offsetting the benefit of menu price increases. This will result in food cost for Q3 being at or slightly above the percentage we saw in Q2. Over the next few quarters, we'll have greater visibility on how much of this inflation is permanent versus transitory, and we can take the appropriate actions as needed to help offset any lasting impacts.  
Labor costs for the quarter were 24.5%, a decrease of 370 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage and to a lesser extent, efficiencies related to digital orders which were partially offset by higher wages that we saw for just 1 month during the quarter. We expect labor cost to be in the low 26% range during Q3 to reflect a full quarter of our wage increase.  
Other operating costs for the quarter were 15.2%, a decrease of 400 basis points from last year due primarily to sales leverage and lower promotional expenses. Marketing promo costs for the quarter were 2.4%, a decrease of 260 basis points versus the prior year due to a significant level of free delivery promotions last year.  
We anticipate marketing expense to be in the mid-2% range in Q3, while the full year 2021 marketing spend is expected to remain about 3% of sales. Overall, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid-15% range for the quarter. G&A for the quarter was $146 million on a GAAP basis or $119 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $23.5 million for the previously mentioned modification to our 2018 performance shares, $2.1 million for legal expenses and $1.2 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes $92 million in underlying G&A, about $22.5 million related to noncash stock comp and nearly $4.5 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity vesting and stock option exercises. 
Looking to Q3, we expect our underlying G&A to be around $96 million as we continue to make investments primarily in technology to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will likely be around $25 million in Q3, although this amount could move up or down based on our absolute performance. We also expect to recognize around $4 million related to performance-based bonus expenses and employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter as well as about $1 million related to our All Manager Conference scheduled for Q1 of next year. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 23.7% on a GAAP basis and 22.4% on a non-GAAP basis.  
And similar to last quarter, our effective tax rate benefited from option exercises and share vesting at elevated stock prices. For fiscal 2021, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.  
Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with nearly $1.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt, along with a $500 million untapped revolver. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $145 million of our stock at an average price of $1,408. We had about $208 million remaining on our share authorization as of June 30 and expect to continue to prioritize using excess free cash flow to repurchase stock. But as I've said before, the best returns we can generate are by investing in more Chipotles.  
And during Q2, we opened 56 new restaurants with 45 of these, including a Chipotlane. And despite some external challenges, the development team continues to do an excellent job building new restaurants as well as developing a robust new unit development pipeline. For the full year, we now expect to be at or slightly above our prior 2021 guidance of 200 new restaurants with more than 70%, including a Chipotlane. As of June 30, we had a total of 240 Chipotlanes, including 8 conversions and 6 relocations, and they continue to enhance access into convenience forecasts while demonstrating superior performance. New Chipotlanes are opening with about 20% higher sales compared to the non-Chipotlanes opened during the same time period. Over the trailing 12 months, Chipotlane restaurants continue to drive about a 15% higher overall digital sales mix compared to non-Chipotlanes and is skewed heavily towards order ahead, our highest margin transaction. And a 2-year geometric comp at the 88 Chipotlane restaurants that have been open more than a year continues to outperform the non-Chipotlane restaurants from the same period.  
Along its early days, Chipotlane conversions and relocations, which are both going through the stage-gate process, are yielding encouraging results. We'll continue to learn and refine our approach to judiciously accelerate our Chipotlane portfolio, whether it be in older existing restaurants, strategic relocations of existing restaurants or through new restaurant additions.  
In closing, I want to reiterate how proud and thankful I am to all Chipotle team members for their tireless efforts. They're helping create value every day for our business, our communities, our shareholders, and each other, which is taking our amazing brand to new heights. As one strong team unified by our purpose and values, we remain committed to driving our powerful and durable economic model. Needless to say, my optimism for Chipotle's long-term potential has never been higher. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

So I'm just wondering like what has changed in the marketplace that's allowing you to get there now? And maybe that's a function of also growing the pipeline for next year, if there's anything you can say even qualitatively on that.  
And then just the second part is around best practices. Like how are things going outside of the U.S.? How is Canada? I think maybe the first Chipotlane opened. How is Western Europe, I think you're going to suburbs and testing technology. What are some shared best practices?"

To get to your specific question about new unit openings. Obviously, we're halfway through the year. So that gives us more confidence in where we're going to end the year. 
And I think we talked about coming into the year, how we had a really strong pipeline of units that were planned to be open. The team has done a phenomenal job in securing the people capability to be ready to open the restaurants. They've done a phenomenal job on the supply chain to ensure that we have everything we need to open restaurants, and we've continued to have really great openings. 
So the combination of sites lined up, supply chain in place, people capability ready to go, gives us just that much more confidence on how we'll finish out the year to reinforce our guidance around 200-plus new openings. And we continue to build a really robust pipeline going forward. that's primarily driven by Chipotlanes, which is also a huge enabler for the business going forward.  
Your second question about what are we seeing in Canada and Europe. Canada continues to perform, and we're really excited about the opportunity of opening more restaurants up there. Obviously, Canada has been a little bit slower on the reopening process. But even despite that, they continue to deliver great economics and frankly, are performing in line with the U.S., and we're very optimistic about how we can continue to open and grow in Canada. 
In Europe, I think I mentioned this in some of our recent investor meetings. We just opened 2 new restaurants outside of London, and both of those are off to really good starts. We're just a couple of weeks in but we love the diversity of assets that we're opening. We love the fact that we have our digital assets all in place. And I'm optimistic about what we're going to learn, so that we can really give clarity on the opportunity in Europe down the road. 
But that's still in the early stages of our stage-gate process. And I think I've mentioned this in the past, probably COVID has slowed us down in our learning there than anywhere else. But love what we're seeing in the U.S. on new units, and it's exciting to the economics we're getting out of Canada."

And what we're seeing is the overlap is still in that 15-plus percent range of people doing both channels. which leaves the door open for a lot of incremental occasions or different occasions. The 1 thing that is driving some of the bounce back in our dining room business is we are seeing more business at lunch. And we're also seeing that lunch business occur Monday through Friday. 
And then when you look at kind of like suburban versus urban, that's another place where you're starting to see clearly people return to work or return to normal, I would say behaviors throughout their day. So the lunch occasion is definitely coming back while we're hanging on to all these new occasions around dinner and a lot of these off-premise occasions we've been talking about over time. 
I'm guessing we'll continue to see the overlap slowly go up from here, because as more people return to the dining room, I'm hoping they've had really positive experiences digitally that will suggest, hey, I want to give Chipotle a try in the dining room and vice versa. Hopefully, people that are dining room-only people have heard great things about our rewards program, our digital system and they'll start giving that to try. But the thing I love about the 2 businesses, they serve different occasions, different needs. And I think that proves over the long run, these things are incremental or complementary."

So I would say, it went as expected, and we'll continue to keep an eye on our value proposition going forward. And I would tell you, the good news is, I think our value proposition remains very strong, so that if we're faced with any headwinds that warrants the need for pricing, I think we can do it with confidence knowing that the brand is really strong and our value proposition is really strong."

And importantly, when we get into that range, we're going to have cash on cash returns on our restaurants, which today are very attractive at 60%, 65%. They're going to be in the 80%, 90%, even approaching 100% returns. And that's -- frankly, internally, that's something we've always looked at.

I mean, listen, there's still that possibility that we could take additional pricing action to fully close the gap. I just think there's so much going on right now with inflation and the question about whether inflation is transitory or permanent. We've got labor inflation. We took a big move there. We'll see how that shakes out. And now we've got the Delta variant as well. There's just a lot of unknowns. 
And so what we don't want to do is sit here and declare that we're going to do something with certainty between now and the end of the year. I think what we want to do is, let's see how the menu price continues to be accepted by customers. So far, really, really good, really seeing no resistance whatsoever. Let's see what happens to inflation and let's see what happens to the economy over the next several months, and we'll make the appropriate decisions at the appropriate time. 
But I think the important thing, John, is that we've got a lot of upward mobility on our margins. We have pricing power.

So to answer your first question, the employee value proposition that we're bringing forward with the higher wages, the ability to grow into $100,000 opportunity in very short order has worked very well. And I give a lot of credit to our guys in the field with being out there, recruiting and retaining our talent. And we're in a really good labor spot relative to, as you look at our historical performances, we're back to where we were in 2019 and frankly, a little bit better, which is great to see. 
And also, the growth in our company is really resonating with our employees. Our general managers know that they have the ability to become field leaders and our field leaders know they have the ability to become team directors. And folks that are shift managers and kitchen managers know, there's going to be lots of general manager jobs available. So that's why I'd say the whole employee value proposition, I think, is really resonating. And combine that with the company's purpose, and we've made tremendous progress on what was really a difficult situation that popped up in, call it, February and March with the business just frankly coming back faster than we were able to hire. But now our hiring is caught up. 
To answer your other part of the question, we still have work to do to get our great throughput model back in place. It's been, geez, well over a year since folks saw lines. And for some of our employees, it's the first time they're seeing lines. And for customers, too, part of the process of getting people to move down the line quickly is, they need to know how to order, what they want to order and getting back to individual meals, as well as our team members being quick to move them down the line, but doing it in an accurate way. 
So we still have opportunity on the throughput front, but I think that's just a matter of retraining building that muscle on our throughput pillars, and I'm confident we're going to capture that opportunity. Our operators are focused on it."

Look, the way I would describe it is, we're going to be investing in ways to get better throughput executed in both the digital make line and our front line. And we're looking at investments on helping our teams with smarter prep, having the right food available at the right time, better forecasting, better staffing. These are all things that will just allow us, frankly, to provide more burritos and bowls digitally, as well as more burritos and bowls on the front line. So we're really focused on the fact that we've got a lot of capacity in these restaurants. So whatever we can do to invest in our people or operation, to enable them to provide more burritos and bowls per minute is a huge leverage point for us. 
So that's like, at the highest level, that's how I think about it. I mean, there's various things in simple projects that provide certain benefits, but the higher order thing we're after is, how do we ultimately end up with just enhanced throughput, both for the digital business and the frontline business and in such a way where we still get no compromise on customization, quality of food and now with our digital business accuracy."

We have started our journey of getting into these group occasions and these off-premise occasions, but COVID really accelerated that. So what I would tell you is, probably the best piece of news that I've seen in our data is to see that our lunch business is coming back, because as soon as people are given the opportunity to go back to their behaviors of going to their office, dropping their kids off at school, activities, whatever it may be, they're back to wanting to eat out lunch, and that's an on-premise occasion that we have seen a nice uptick, I believe."

If you have a dislocation for some period of time, that 40% is going to vary. But we know, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, when we know we have pricing power, we're in a position because we're all company-owned, that we take a long-term view. We can watch how the inflation unfolds over the next few months, the next few quarters. We can see how much is transitory, how much is going to be permanent. And we could take the right pricing action at the right time. 
So we don't have to be in a hurry to do it like some franchise organizations might be, feel a little bit more pressure to do that. But the 40% flow-through, that assumes just kind of over a longer period of time, as you're moving from this $2.5 million volume up to $3 million, that as long as over that period of time, maybe not every quarter, maybe not every year, but over that period of time, we're able to offset inflation with some modest pricing increases, we can have that 40% flow through."

But what I think you can expect to see is, as things stabilize, as they become more predictable, we'll be able to return even more value to shareholders through buybacks. But we also have the revolver as well, which gives us a little bit of breathing room. 
But last year, when the pandemic started, it became pretty clear that these were very different times, and we needed to make sure that we had enough assets or enough cash in the balance sheet, so we can invest in our people, invest in technology, continue to open up our restaurants and not give up on any of our long-term strategies. 
And so we're still retaining a bit of a conservatism with managing our balance sheet. But again, as things become more certain, you can expect to see more buybacks in the future. And again, it will be opportunistic. We'll take advantage when the price moves down, just like we did during this quarter."

First of all, the rewards program probably represents about 25% of our customers, roughly, is the way to think about it. And the thing that's great about our rewards customers are, they have a higher ticket, they have higher frequency, because usually they're more skewed towards digital, which is consistent with what we see in our digital business. And I do believe as we continue to enhance things like our rewards program, where now you know you can redeem your points for lower denominations and get like chips and guac or a T-shirt or whatever. That's just going to dial up engagement for people. We didn't change the reward necessary to achieve a burrito, but we did enhance opportunities to engage with the brand at different levels. So I think that's going to be enticing for more people to join the rewards program. And those that are in, they'll continue, I think, to incentivize their behavior accordingly.

Chipotle's second quarter results highlight the strength of our brand and our people, as we demonstrated growing momentum in our business. Over the past 15 months, our teams have done an admirable job navigating and executing against macro complexities while giving us great optimism for where we go from here. While COVID challenges remain, including uncertainty regarding the impact of the Delta variant, I'm confident that our teams are up to the challenge and we're hopeful that we'll gradually see a more stable environment over time. 
Specific to Chipotle, we're pleased that all of our restaurants are now open and most are back to normal operations. For the quarter, we reported sales of $1.9 billion, representing 38.7% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 31.2% comparable restaurant sales growth. Restaurant-level margin of 24.5% was more than double the 12.2% we reported last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $7.46, representing a significant increase over the $0.40 reported last year. Digital sales growth of 10.5% year-over-year, representing 48.5% of sales. And we opened 56 new restaurants, including 45 with the Chipotlanes. And I'm delighted to report that Q3 is also off to a strong start.  
While our trailing 12-month AUV is $2.41 million, the underlying run rate during the quarter is now above the historical peak of $2.5 million AUV. When we started this transformation a little over 3 years ago, I was often asked whether I thought we could get back to our peak $2.5 million volumes. My answer was yes. And when we achieve it, we will talk about growth beyond that. 
So it's a nice achievement for our organization to have $2.5 million AUVs again. But more importantly, we have growth strategies that will take us to the next leg of our journey, $3 million AUVs, along with industry-leading returns on invested capital that improve as we continue to add Chipotlanes.  
Stronger restaurant-level economics, combined with significant unit growth should allow us to optimize earnings power for many years to come. In fact, we remain confident in our key growth strategies and believe that over the longer term, they will allow us to have 6,000 restaurants in North America with AUVs pushing well beyond $3 million. Yes, the opportunity ahead of us remains significant. 
So what are the key strategies that are resonating with guests and allowing us to win today while we create the future? To no one's surprise, they are the same ones we've been talking about for some time, namely: opening and running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement; engaging with customers through our loyalty program to drive transactions and frequency; making the brand visible, relevant and loved; and utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation. 
Let me now provide a brief update on each of these, starting with our outstanding operations. This is a key focal point as our business is building on our digital gains along with in-restaurant strength due to a more confident and mobile consumer as well as the hard work our team has done to build more love for Chipotle. We've continued to make operational adjustments to adapt to the constantly changing environment, which has led us to recovering about 70% of in-restaurant sales thus far while retaining about 80% of digital sales. 
It's no secret that running great restaurants requires great people with a terrific culture, and we are privileged to have the best of both. Despite the labor challenges in certain parts of the country, the team has remained focused on safety, reliability, excellent culinary and experiences. I'm extremely proud of our world-class employee value proposition. We're providing industry-leading benefits, including a new virtual mental health platform, expanded debt-free degrees, attractive wages that were recently increased to an average of $15 per hour, specialized job training and development and significant career advancement opportunities. 
And because more than 90% of our restaurant management roles are internal promotes, employees who join the Chipotle family know they have the opportunity to grow their careers with us. Through investing in our people, we have been able to maintain the stability of our workforce over the last 2 years. Knowing that our people are the key to our growth, we have been diligent in our recruiting focus since the start of the year. In reimagining the applicant experience, we're leveraging partnerships that allow us to engage in authentic conversations with prospective candidates and share all the opportunity Chipotle has to offer. 
Our coast-to-coast Career Day event last week resulted in us hiring thousands of additional team members to meet current demand and accommodate future growth. These efforts have dramatically helped improve our labor position. And as a result, our restaurants are attracting and retaining excellent employees in a tough labor environment. 
After visiting several restaurants this past month, I'm encouraged to see more and more guests enjoying their meals in our dining rooms. They order Chipotle because they can get the exact customized meal they want, made with real ingredients faster than anywhere else. As a result, we are committed to teaching, training and validating the 5 pillars of throughput every day, during every shift to ensure we meet our high standards and provide a great guest experience. 
Over the past few years, Chipotle has evolved to a point where we now have 2 sizable businesses, in-restaurant as well as our record-breaking digital platform that are helping us become a real food-focused digital lifestyle brand. During the second quarter, digital sales grew about 11% year-over-year to $916 million and represented nearly 49% of sales. While COVID has, of course, helped bolster these digital gains, ongoing technology investments and operational excellence have been the critical success factors. 
Some examples of the digital innovations we've introduced include the addition of our concierge chatbot, Pepper, to the Chipotle app, which has the ability to answer common questions and resolve issues more efficiently, thus freeing up our customer care team's time to help guests with more complicated situations. We also gave guests the ability to easily rate their order right in the app and online at chipotle.com, providing our restaurant operations teams with actionable insights on how to maintain and improve the digital guest experience. 
Additionally, we have opened a digital-only kitchen, continued expanding our digital drive-throughs with Chipotlanes being the majority of our new restaurant openings, refreshed group ordering and invested in digital internationally by launching the Chipotle app in Canada and implementing our digital assets in Europe. While the results and positive feedback on these innovations show us we're on the right track, we know there's still more to do to enhance the customer experience by expanding access and minimizing friction. 
Not only are we pleased with the level of digital sales and overall mix, we're also delighted to see that our highest margin transaction, digital pickup orders, is gaining traction, and we expect this to continue as we add more Chipotlanes and customers experience the value of this occasion. As I mentioned earlier, we held on to about 80% of our digital gains exiting Q2. This highlights our digital experience as sticky because it is everything customers love about Chipotle with added convenience. 
And due to the pandemic, many new consumers were introduced to Chipotle via our digital channels and are now using us for alternative and often incremental occasions. Naturally, we believe our digital sales mix will moderate as capacity restrictions ease and guests feel more comfortable physically ordering and dining in our restaurants. However, we expect absolute digital sales dollars to find a new equilibrium in 2021 and grow from there. We're encouraged to see that so far in July, we continue to hold on to these digital gains even as in-store recovery has strengthened. 
Moving next to the loyalty program, which is a key enabler of our digital ecosystem and an expanding network that now has more than 23 million members. With this large base of consumers, Chipotle can distribute its own content more and more effectively and drive deeper levels of engagement within this community than ever before. We are leveraging our CRM platform to drive brand engagement and send personalized messages to help supercharge our super fans. We have proven that we can influence decisions along a guest buying journey when we offer them the right individually tailored offers at the right time. We're continuously improving our analytics and are consistently able to generate more transactions from light, medium and high-frequency users. 
With the recent announcement of Rewards exchange, we're optimistic we can continue to build upon our success. The updated functionality provides greater customization and flexibility to redeem rewards and allows guests to earn rewards faster, all of which is expected to improve engagement and drive additional frequency. While we are off to a terrific start, we will continue to invest in the program to take it to the next level and have other enhancements to the program that are expected to be rolled out by year-end. 
While the loyalty program is used to help drive frequency, our marketing efforts are primarily designed to bring more people to the brand. The combination of reach-based media and a successful frequency-driven loyalty program make a great 1-2 punch that both brings in new users and increases transactions with our existing customers. The marketing team continues to ensure that relevant creative across a wide variety of media channels enables the brand to remain visible and live at the intersection of Chipotlane culture. 
Their agile approach, innovative mindset and relentless commitment to measurement have led to ongoing success. For example, our campaign to support the quesadilla launch was omnichannel with relevant creative across online video, digital and social media platforms as well as via traditional TV spots. 
We also celebrated team Chipotle, a group of American athletes who loved the brand long before they became famous. Their personalized unwrapped videos provide an inside look at Chipotle's athlete, super fans and what it takes to compete at the highest level. It also highlights that training hard and eating real food with real ingredients go hand in hand. 
Furthermore, our Burritos and Bitcoin campaign around National Burrito Day was one of our most successful social initiatives to date, with billions of impressions for this culturally relevant promotion. These are just a few examples of the brand's work to drive culture, drive difference and ultimately, drive a purchase. 
Another important pillar of our marketing efforts is a steady stream of new menu innovation, with a cadence of on average about 2 to 3 per year. Cauliflower Rice was a seasonal item that enhanced our lifestyle bowls and was successful bringing in new guests. We launched quesadillas as a permanent digital exclusive offering in March, and this menu item continues to perform well as it appears in about 10% of our transactions and is also helping attract new customers to Chipotle. 
Our talented culinary team is far from finished and our pipeline is filled with promise. I'm pleased to report that smoked brisket has been validated by our stage-gate process. In addition, we are also in the early stages of developing other exciting menu items that we will validate using our stage-gate that will bring news and new customers to the brand. 
To conclude, Chipotle is a unique brand committed to fostering a culture that values and champions our diversity while leveraging the individual talents of all team members to grow our business, elevate our brand and cultivate a better world. 
Well-trained and supportive people preparing safe, delicious food and delivering excellent guest experiences are at the heart of our success. A big thank you to all our hard-working employees for making this possible. As a result, I'm convinced more than ever that we have the right team, the right culture and the right strategies to allow Chipotle to be a premier growth company for many years to come. With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials."
26446,717035841,2383557,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2021",2021-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report solid second quarter results with sales growing 38.7% year-over-year to $1.9 billion as comp sales grew 31.2%. Restaurant-level margin of 24.5% was more than double the 12.2% margin from",1353,"Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report solid second quarter results with sales growing 38.7% year-over-year to $1.9 billion as comp sales grew 31.2%. Restaurant-level margin of 24.5% was more than double the 12.2% margin from last year and represents the highest margin since 2015. And earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $7.46, a significant improvement over last year's adjusted EPS of $0.40. 
Just like last quarter, the second quarter had unusual expenses related to our 2018 performance share modification related to COVID, restaurant asset impairments and closure costs, legal expenses as well as transformation costs, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.86, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $6.60. 
Looking ahead to Q3, while uncertainty still exists with the potential impact of the Delta variant as well as the pace of the economic recovery, if current sales trends continue, we expect our comps to be in the low to mid-double-digit range, which implies a nice sequential acceleration in our geometric 2-year stack. This is due to the menu price increase we took in early June, which is holding strong so far, as well as in-restaurant sales continuing to recover. Of course, we'll closely monitor developments regarding the Delta variant and follow all local protocols to ensure the safety of our restaurant teams and our customers. 
As Brian mentioned, in June, we increased our average hourly rate to $15 and subsequently took a 3.5% to 4% menu price increase to cover the cost in dollar terms. While average restaurant cash flow remains the same, this lowers margin by about 80 basis points and it increases sales by about $100,000 on an annual basis. So the historic margin algorithm we have discussed is not as relevant going forward. However, we maintain our goal of being able to pass through approximately 40% of incremental sales to restaurant cash flow, which is an important piece of our earnings growth potential. This is critical as we march towards AUVs of $3 million as higher sales will lead to higher margins and cash on cash return -- restaurant returns should increase well above the low to mid-60% range we're seeing today. 
Let me now go through the key P&L line items. Food costs were 30.4% in Q2, a decrease of nearly 300 basis points from last year. This was due primarily to leverage from menu price increases as well as lower beef prices, which were partially offset by higher costs associated with new menu items and avocados. Given the current environment, it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that Q3 is going to be challenged by several industry-wide issues, most notably beef and freight costs as well as staffing shortages at our suppliers. 
We anticipate these commodity headwinds will negatively impact the quarter by an additional 60 to 80 basis points, essentially offsetting the benefit of menu price increases. This will result in food cost for Q3 being at or slightly above the percentage we saw in Q2. Over the next few quarters, we'll have greater visibility on how much of this inflation is permanent versus transitory, and we can take the appropriate actions as needed to help offset any lasting impacts. 
Labor costs for the quarter were 24.5%, a decrease of 370 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage and to a lesser extent, efficiencies related to digital orders, which were partially offset by higher wages that we saw for just 1 month during the quarter. We expect labor cost to be in the low 26% range during Q3 to reflect a full quarter of our wage increase. 
Other operating costs for the quarter were 15.2%, a decrease of 400 basis points from last year due primarily to sales leverage and lower promotional expenses. Marketing promo costs for the quarter were 2.4%, a decrease of 260 basis points versus the prior year due to a significant level of free delivery promotions last year. 
We anticipate marketing expense to be in the mid-2% range in Q3, while the full year 2021 marketing spend is expected to remain about 3% of sales. Overall, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid-15% range for the quarter. 
G&A for the quarter was $146 million on a GAAP basis or $119 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $23.5 million for the previously mentioned modification to our 2018 performance shares, $2.1 million for legal expenses and $1.2 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes $92 million in underlying G&A, about $22.5 million related to noncash stock comp and nearly $4.5 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity vesting and stock option exercises. 
Looking to Q3, we expect our underlying G&A to be around $96 million as we continue to make investments primarily in technology to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will likely be around $25 million in Q3, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. We also expect to recognize around $4 million related to performance-based bonus expenses and employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter as well as about $1 million related to our All Manager Conference scheduled for Q1 of next year. 
Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 23.7% on a GAAP basis and 22.4% on a non-GAAP basis. And similar to last quarter, our effective tax rate benefited from option exercise and share vesting at elevated stock prices. For fiscal 2021, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items. 
Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with nearly $1.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt, along with a $500 million untapped revolver. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $145 million of our stock at an average price of $1,408. We had about $208 million remaining on our share authorization as of June 30, and expect to continue to prioritize using excess free cash flow to repurchase stock. 
But as I've said before, the best returns we can generate are by investing in more Chipotlanes. And during Q2, we opened 56 new restaurants with 45 of these including a Chipotlane. And despite some external challenges, the development team continues to do an excellent job building new restaurants as well as developing a robust new unit development pipeline. For the full year, we now expect to be at or slightly above our prior 2021 guidance of 200 new restaurants with more than 70%, including a Chipotlane. As of June 30, we had a total of 240 Chipotlanes, including 8 conversions and 6 relocations, and they continue to enhance access and convenience for our guests while demonstrating superior performance. 
New Chipotlanes are opening with about 20% higher sales compared to the non-Chipotlanes opened during the same time period. Over the trailing 12 months, Chipotlane restaurants continue to drive about a 15% higher overall digital sales mix compared to non-Chipotlanes and is skewed heavily towards order ahead, our highest margin transaction. And a 2-year geometric comp at the 88 Chipotlane restaurants that have been open more than a year continues to outperform the non-Chipotlane restaurants from the same period. 
Along its early days, Chipotlane conversions and relocations, which are both going through the stage-gate process, are yielding encouraging results. We'll continue to learn and refine our approach to judiciously accelerate our Chipotlane portfolio, whether it be in older existing restaurants, strategic relocations of existing restaurants or through new restaurant additions. 
In closing, I want to reiterate how proud and thankful I am to all Chipotle team members for their tireless efforts. They're helping create value every day for our business, our communities, our shareholders, and each other, which is taking our amazing brand to new heights. As one strong team unified by our purpose and values, we remain committed to driving our powerful and durable economic model. Needless to say, my optimism for Chipotle's long-term potential has never been higher. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

So I'm just wondering like what has changed in the marketplace that's allowing you to get there now? And maybe that's a function of also growing the pipeline for next year, if there's anything you can say even qualitatively on that? 
And then just the second part is around best practices. Like how are things going outside of the U.S.? How is Canada? I think maybe the first Chipotlane opened. How is Western Europe? I think you're going to suburbs and testing technology. What are some shared best practices?"

To get to your specific question about new unit openings -- obviously, we're halfway through the year. So that gives us more confidence in where we're going to end the year. 
And I think we talked about coming into the year, how we had a really strong pipeline of units that were planned to be open. The team has done a phenomenal job in securing the people capability to be ready to open the restaurants. They've done a phenomenal job on the supply chain to ensure that we have everything we need to open restaurants, and we've continued to have really great openings. 
So the combination of sites lined up, supply chain in place, people capability ready to go, gives us just that much more confidence on how we'll finish out the year to reinforce our guidance around 200-plus new openings. And we continue to build a really robust pipeline going forward that's primarily driven by Chipotlanes, which is also a huge enabler for the business going forward. 
Your second question about what are we seeing in Canada and Europe. Canada continues to perform, and we're really excited about the opportunity of opening more restaurants up there. Obviously, Canada has been a little bit slower on the reopening process. But even despite that, they continue to deliver great economics and frankly, are performing in line with the U.S., and we're very optimistic about how we can continue to open and grow in Canada. 
In Europe, I think I mentioned this in some of our recent investor meetings. We just opened 2 new restaurants outside of London, and both of those are off to really good starts. We're just a couple of weeks in but we love the diversity of assets that we're opening. We love the fact that we have our digital assets all in place. And I'm optimistic about what we're going to learn, so that we can really give clarity on the opportunity in Europe down the road. 
But that's still in the early stages of our stage-gate process. And I think I've mentioned this in the past, probably COVID has slowed us down in our learning there than anywhere else. But love what we're seeing in the U.S. on new units, and it's exciting to the economics we're getting out of Canada."

And what we're seeing is the overlap is still in that 15-plus percent range of people doing both channels. which leaves the door open for a lot of incremental occasions or different occasions. The one thing that is driving some of the bounce back in our dining room business is we are seeing more business at lunch. And we're also seeing that lunch business occur Monday through Friday. 
And then when you look at kind of like suburban versus urban, that's another place where you're starting to see clearly people return to work or return to normal, I would say, behaviors throughout their day. So the lunch occasion is definitely coming back while we're hanging on to all these new occasions around dinner and a lot of these off-premise occasions we've been talking about over time. 
I'm guessing we'll continue to see the overlap slowly go up from here, because as more people return to the dining room, I'm hoping they've had really positive experiences digitally that will suggest, hey, I want to give Chipotle a try in the dining room and vice versa. Hopefully, people that are dining room-only people have heard great things about our rewards program, our digital system and they'll start giving that a try. But the thing I love about the 2 businesses, they serve different occasions, different needs. And I think that proves, over the long run, these things are incremental or complementary."

Let's see what happens to inflation and let's see what happens to the economy over the next several months, and we'll make the appropriate decisions at the appropriate time. 
But I think the important thing, John, is that we've got a lot of upward mobility on our margins. We have pricing power. Now it's just a matter of how and when we decide to use that pricing power to either protect margins or to invest in our people like we just did with the wages, but nothing's been locked and loaded in terms of what we will do between now and the end of the year."

So to answer your first question, the employee value proposition that we're bringing forward with the higher wages, the ability to grow into $100,000 opportunity in very short order has worked very well. And I give a lot of credit to our guys in the field with being out there, recruiting and retaining our talent. And we're in a really good labor spot relative to, as you look at our historical performances, we're back to where we were in 2019 and frankly, a little bit better, which is great to see. 
And also, the growth in our company is really resonating with our employees. Our general managers know that they have the ability to become field leaders, and our field leaders know they have the ability to become team directors. And folks that are shift managers and kitchen managers know there's going to be lots of general manager jobs available. So that's why I'd say the whole employee value proposition, I think, is really resonating. And combine that with the company's purpose, and we've made tremendous progress on what was really a difficult situation that popped up in, call it, February and March with the business just frankly coming back faster than we were able to hire. But now our hiring has caught up. 
To answer your other part of the question, we still have work to do to get our great throughput model back in place. It's been, geez, well over a year since folks saw lines. And for some of our employees, it's the first time they're seeing lines. And for customers, too. Part of the process of getting people to move down the line quickly is, they need to know how to order, what they want to order and getting back to individual meals, as well as our team members being quick to move them down the line, but doing it in an accurate way. 
So we still have opportunity on the throughput front, but I think that's just a matter of retraining, building that muscle on our throughput pillars, and I'm confident we're going to capture that opportunity. Our operators are focused on it."

So I think our dining rooms are going to keep coming back. And I also think it's human nature. You want to eat out, like you like a change of scenery.

But what I think you can expect to see is, as things stabilize, as they become more predictable, we'll be able to return even more value to shareholders through buybacks. But we also have the revolver as well, which gives us a little bit of breathing room. 
But last year, when the pandemic started, it became pretty clear that these were very different times, and we needed to make sure that we had enough assets or enough cash in the balance sheet so we can invest in our people, invest in technology, continue to open up our restaurant and not give up on any of our long-term strategies. 
And so we're still retaining a bit of a conservatism with managing our balance sheet. But again, as things become more certain, you can expect to see more buybacks in the future. And again, it will be opportunistic. We'll take advantage when the price moves down, just like we did during this quarter."

And I do believe as we continue to enhance things like our rewards program, where now you know you can redeem your points for lower denominations and get like chips and guac or a T-shirt or whatever. That's just going to dial up engagement for people. 
We didn't change the reward necessary to achieve a burrito, but we did enhance opportunities to engage with the brand at different levels.

Chipotle's third quarter results highlight strong momentum in our business, fueled by a multipronged growth strategy and a passionate team that's delighted to see more guests coming back into our restaurants.",3354,"Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. Chipotle's third quarter results highlight strong momentum in our business, fueled by a multipronged growth strategy and a passionate team that's delighted to see more guests coming back into our restaurants. We continue to retain about 80% of digital sales, but have now recovered nearly 80% of in-restaurant sales. While COVID impacts will likely persist for a few more quarters, we are hopeful that the worst is behind us and society can shortly return to a more normal environment. 
Personally, I'm thrilled to welcome our restaurant support center leaders back to the office beginning in November, which will allow us to optimize creativity, comradery and effectiveness, key elements that help make Chipotle a unique and powerful brand. For the quarter, we reported record quarterly sales of $2 billion, representing 21.9% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by a 15.1% increase in comparable restaurant sales, restaurant-level margin of 23.5% and was 400 basis points higher than the 19.5% we reported last year. 
Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $7.02, representing an increase of 86.7% year-over-year. digital sales growth of 8.6% year-over-year, representing 42.8% of sales, and we opened 41 new restaurants, including 36 with the Chipotlane. And I'm pleased to report that Q4 is off to a great start. These results highlight that our key strategies continue to resonate with guests and allow us to win today while we create the future. While we regularly get asked what's next, I believe our current growth drivers have plenty of runway and will be critical to us reaching our longer-term goal of 6,000 restaurants in North America with AUVs above $3 million and improving returns on invested capital. 
To remind everyone, we're focusing on 5 key areas: number one, opening and running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences. Number two, utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation, number three, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement; number four, engaging with customers through our loyalty program to drive transactions and frequency; and last, but certainly not least, number five, making the brand visible, relevant and loved. 
Let me now provide a brief update on each of these, starting with operations. well trained and supported employees consistently preparing delicious food and delivering excellent guest experiences are at the heart of our success. We're fortunate to have amazing employees at our restaurants who have stayed focused on safety, reliability and excellent culinary despite the dynamic and challenging environment. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, our people are our greatest asset, and I can't thank them enough for all their efforts. We are extremely proud of Chipotle's world-class employee value proposition that includes industry-leading benefits, attractive wages, specialized training and development access to education and a transparent pathway to significant career advancement opportunities. 
We believe these efforts are helping to attract and retain great employees, which is more important than ever given the challenging labor environment we're all experiencing today. Over the past 18 months, we've made operational adjustments to adapt to our constantly changing environment in support of our in-restaurant business as well as our record-breaking digital business. As a result, we've had to allocate labor as needed among the different roles. -- including the DML and the front line, depending on available staff to accommodate the needs of our customers and our restaurant teams. This flexibility has allowed us to keep our frontline open given our ability to divert orders on the digital line as needed to overcome periodic staffing challenges. 
This is part of the normal business balancing that occurs at the discretion of on-site managers and has not had a material impact on our business in the past. This was true prepandemic and is more relevant now as dining room volumes recover. The good news is that I believe we are finally getting back to prepandemic operations, and I couldn't be more excited. 
We're fortunate to have a dedicated digital make line and a dedicated dining room serving line. Our frontline represented nearly 60% of our business or $1.1 billion of sales for the quarter. It is big and it is growing. We are committed to ensuring guests on the front line get the customized meal they want made with real ingredients, excellent culinary and faster than anywhere else. We still have some work to do, but our goal is to provide exceptional throughput as speed of service is a foundational element of convenience that our guests truly value. 
Therefore, we are committed to teaching, training and validating the 5 pillars of throughput every day during every shift to ensure we meet our high standards and provide a great guest experience. While taking good care of guests is always a top priority, utilizing our stage gate process to continue innovating is critical to our growth. The great news is that Chipotle is delicious food that you feel good about eating, which creates an emotional connection with our customers, and they love to see ongoing innovation from us. As a result, we introduced new menu items on a regular cadence. And as it helps bring in additional customers, drive frequency with existing users and gives us an opportunity to create buzz around the brand. 
Recently, we launched Smoked Brisket for a limited time across all our U.S. and Canadian restaurants. Our culinary team spent the last 2 years developing the perfect smoke risk at recipe that is unique to our brand and pairs flawlessly with our fresh, real ingredients. This is our third new menu item this year, following on the success of our Salantroline Colaflower rice and handcrafted Casadia. Early customer feedback on this entree, which is expected to last through November, has been very positive, and we're delighted to see an increase attract new customers to Chipotle. By the way, if you haven't had a chance to try to brisket, you really are missing out. And we're far from being done. Plant-based Carita is currently being tested in a couple of markets and our talented culinary team is in the early stages of developing other exciting menu items. 
All that being said, our stage gate process is not limited to new menu innovations. We use it for many parts of the business, including development. As you know, we validated new restaurant expansion in Canada earlier this year, impressive unit economics with AUVs and margins equal to or above those in the U.S. led us to accelerate development in this market. We've opened 1 new restaurant in Canada year-to-date and have several more planned before year-end, our first ever Chipotlane that's scheduled to open next week. 
Similarly, we are now in the early stages of using this process to learn, iterate and eventually validate expansion in Western Europe. Covid slowed our ability to execute several critical initiatives However, with restrictions easing, we're making nice progress and have implemented some of our digital assets as well as begun to test alternative formats and explore new trade areas. The recent openings have exceeded expectations. So while we continue to view international expansion as a medium to longer-term opportunity, I remain quite optimistic about its future contribution to the Chipotle story. 
A more near-term pillar of growth has been our ongoing digital transformation, which is helping Chipotle become a real food-focused digital lifestyle brand. During the third quarter, digital sales grew nearly 9% year-over-year to $840 million and represented 43% of sales. We're not surprised to see the mix moderate as the world continues to reopen. However, we're pleased to see our digital sales dollars continue to grow despite lapping tough comparisons. In fact, -- Our year-to-date digital sales of nearly $2.7 billion are just slightly below the $2.8 billion we achieved during all of last year. Digital is proving to be sticky as its a frictionless and convenient experience that has been aided by continuous technology investments to improve operational execution, innovation and the customer value proposition. As a result of the pandemic, many new consumers were introduced to Chipotle via our digital channels and are now using us for alternative occasions. The thing I love about having 2 separate businesses is that they serve different needs that will likely prove to be incremental and complementary over the long run. This is reinforced by the fact that different guests are accessing Chipotle through different channels. 
Currently, about 65% of our guests use in-restaurant as remain access point, nearly 20% use digital as their primary channel and the remaining 15% to 20% use both channels. We're encouraged by this dynamic as it gives us several future opportunities including the ability to convert more of our in-restaurant guests into higher frequency digital users. 
Not only are we pleased with the level of digital sales and overall mix, but we're also delighted to see that our highest margin transaction digital pickup orders, is gaining traction. This channel represented slightly more than half of digital sales in Q3. -- As always, we're not being complacent and continue to look for ways to enhance convenience and access through alternate restaurant formats, digital-only menu offerings and leveraging our large and growing loyalty program. 
Speaking of the loyalty program, we're excited to have more than 24.5 million members, many of whom are new to the brand. This gives us a large captive audience to engage with and distribute content that promotes our values as well as motivates our super fans. We continue to leverage our CRM sophistication by focusing a lot more on personalization and using predictive modeling to trigger journeys primarily for new and lapsed customers. These personalized messages are more brand related as opposed to offers or discounts which is allowing us to optimize program foundation and economics. All these efforts, along with the use of enhanced analytics are allowing us to consistently attract more visits from loyalty members than nonmembers. No doubt, the loyalty program has moved from a crawl to the walk stage, and we still have a lot of room to grow, offering new ways to engage with Chipotle is essential to the ongoing evolution of our digital business. 
Our first enhancement was Rewards Exchange, which provides greater customization and flexibility to redeem rewards and allows guests to earn rewards faster. More recently, we announced Extra an exclusive feature that gamifies Chipotle Rewards with personalized challenges to an extra points and/or collect achievement badges in order to drive engagement. As the program grows, so does our ability to provide sophisticated and relevant communications to our guests, which will ultimately deepen the relationship between members and the brand. We are pleased with our progress to date, but believe with ongoing investments and further leveraging of data-driven insights, we can get even better. Amplifying all the growth initiatives mentioned thus far are the collective efforts of the i marketing team, which are designed to make Chipotle more visible, more relevant and more loved. We believe that Real food has the power to change the world and using custom creative across a wide variety of media channels that allow us to drive culture, drive difference and ultimately drive a purchase. For example, we use numerous campaigns to stay relevant via important sporting events such as the basketball championships, where we hit $1 million worth of free burritos and our TV advertising. 
We also utilize social media, including our website to authentically highlight real food for real athletes during the broadcast from Tokyo. And of course, to celebrate the launch of smoke Bisquit, we offered an exclusive peak to our loyalty members prior to a full launch supported by a media plan across online video, digital and social media platforms as well as traditional TV spots. All of these helped to attract new guests into the Chipotle family as well as increased frequency of existing users. We're fortunate to have an innovative marketing team that wants to be a leader, not a follower. And our marketing organization is built on a culture of accountability that encourages new ideas, is committed to experimentation and is ruthless on measuring returns. And isn't afraid to pivot to different opportunities if they don't perform to our high standards. 
Every day, this team is focused on driving sales today while enhancing our brand for tomorrow. Chipotle is committed to fostering a culture that values and champions are diversity while leveraging the individual talents of all team members to grow our business, elevate our brand and cultivate a better world. 
Our team has proven their ability to be resilient and successfully execute against macro complexities. Again, a huge thank you to our nearly 95,000 employees for all their efforts. As a result, I believe we are better positioned to drive sustainable, long-term growth than we were before the pandemic, which makes me even more excited about what we can accomplish in the years ahead. With Jack, here's Jack to walk you through the financials. 
Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report solid third quarter results with sales growing 21.9% year-over-year to $2 billion as comp sales grew 15.1% and restaurant level margin of 23.5% expanded 400 basis points over last year, and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $7.02, representing 86.7% year-over-year growth. The third quarter had a GAAP tax benefit that I'll discuss shortly, which was partially offset by expenses related to a previously disclosed modification to our 2018 performance shares and transformation expenses, which netted to positively impact our earnings per share by $0.16 leading to GAAP EPS of $7.18. As we look ahead to Q4, there remains uncertainty on several fronts, including COVID-related impacts as well as inflationary and staffing pressures. But given our strong underlying business momentum, we expect our comps to be in the low to mid-double digits, which is encouraging, considering there will be about 200 basis points less in pricing contribution during Q4 versus Q3 and as we lap some of our delivery menu price increases and our brisket LTL will be for a partial quarter as compared to the full quarter of Cardeasata last year. Let me now go through the P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Our supply chain team has done an outstanding job navigating the numerous industry-wide disruptions, which led to food costs being 30.3% in Q3, a decrease of 200 basis points from last year. This was due primarily to leverage from menu price increases which were partially offset by higher costs associated with beef and freight that unfortunately are continuing to worsen. It's hard to predict how much of these headwinds will ultimately be temporary versus permanent, but they're likely to persist for the foreseeable future. In addition, Q4 will also include the higher cost risk at LTO, which collectively will result in our food cost being in the low 31% range for the quarter. 
Labor costs for the third quarter were 25.8%, an increase of about 40 basis points from last year. This increase was driven by our strategy to increase average nationwide wages to $15 per hour, which is partially offset by menu price increases, sales leverage and a onetime employee retention credit. Given ongoing elevated wage inflation and greater new unit openings, we expect labor cost to be in the mid-26% range in Q4. 
Other operating costs for the quarter were 15.1%, a decrease of 170 basis points from last year due primarily to price and sales leverage. Marketing promo costs for the quarter were 2.4%, about 20 basis points lower than we spent last year. While Q3 tends to be a seasonally lower advertising quarter, the timing of some initiatives also shifted into Q4 this year. As a result, we anticipate marketing expense to be around 4% in Q4 to support smoke biscuit and for the latest brand messaging under our Behind the Foil campaign. 
For the full year 2021, marketing spend is expected to remain right about 3% of sales. Overall, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid-16% range for the fourth quarter. Looking at overall restaurant margins. We expect Q4 were to be in the 20% to 21% range. Our Q4 under flying margin would be around 22% when you normalize marketing spend and remove the temporary. Despite these challenges, we remain confident in our ability to drive as our average unit volumes increase. 
G&A for the quarter was $146 million on a GAAP basis or $137 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $7.6 million for the previously mentioned modification for 2018 performance shares and $1.6 million related to transformation and other expenses. G&A also includes about $100 million in underlying G&A, about $28 million related to noncash stock compensation about $8.5 million related to higher performance-based bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting and stock option exercises and roughly $600,000 related to our upcoming -- All Manager Conference. 
Looking to Q4, we expect our underlying G&A to be right around $101 million as we continue to make investments primarily in tech to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will likely be around $27 million in Q4 and although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. We also expect to recognize around $5.5 million related to performance-based bonus expense and employer taxes associated with shares that vested during the quarter as well as about $1.5 million related to our all-manager conference. 
Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 14.7% on a GAAP basis and 19.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Both rates benefited from our option exercises and share vesting at elevated stock prices. In addition, our GAAP tax rate included a return to provision benefit for additional NOLs generated on our 2020 federal income tax return and carry back to prior years. For Q4, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy as we ended Q3 with $1.2 billion in cash restricted cash and investments with no debt, along with a $500 million untapped revolver. During the quarter, we repurchased $99 million of our stock at an average price of $1,813 and and we expect to continue using excess free cash flow to opportunistically repurchase our stock. However, opening more Chipotles continues to be the best return we can generate. 
During Q3, despite a few delays in opening time lines, we opened 41 new restaurants with 36 of these, including the Chipotlanes. While we're experiencing construction inflationary pressures, subcontractor, labor shortages, critical equipment shortages and landlord delivery delays, our development team is doing an excellent job opening these new restaurants. In fact, we currently have more than 110 restaurants under construction. And while timing is somewhat unpredictable, this gives us confidence in ending the year at or slightly above the 200 new restaurants with now more than 75%, including a Chipotlane versus our prior expectation of 70%. 
Also, the team has done a nice job building a robust new unit pipeline which we believe will allow us to accelerate openings in 2022. But because of the challenges I just mentioned and how they could impact the time line, we'll provide 2022 opening guidance during our Q4 call. As of September 30, we had a total of 284 Chipotlane, including 12 conversions and 8 relocations, they continue to enhance access and convenience for our guests while demonstrating stellar performance. And while it's early days, Chipotlane conversions and relocations are yielding encouraging results. We'll leverage our stage gate process to learn and refine our strategic approach to accelerating our Chipotle portfolio. 
I'd like to close today by thanking all of our Chipotle team members for the exceptional results we're reporting today as well as their hard work and dedication and helping sustain our long-term powerful economic model. Maintaining a 40% pass-through on incremental sales as we expand AUVs, will lead to higher margins and improving cash-on-cash restaurant returns. You can see why we remain optimistic about our future. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

But you've seen the same kind of list that we have seen that their forecast for some materials, not necessarily what we're buying that are into the double digits sometimes well into the double digits. Now we're not really seeing that. I mean we're seeing isolated spikes, but most of our ingredients are okay. They're all pressured to the upside. And what we want to do is really take a look, be patient and see how much of this is really because of things like shipping, like things that come in from outside this country. The freight is astronomically high and the ability to get the supply we need is very, very challenging. So we want to see how that normalizes. There's material shortages, not just with our food and paper, but also with our openings as well. Some of that is going to normalize as well. So there's a lot for us to learn. Definitely, there's upward pressure. And the thing that I would just tell you is we feel very comfortable that any inflation that is affecting our margins today, we have the ability to offset it.

We're going to watch it for a few quarters and see what happens. But ultimately, our expectation -- I think it gets back to the first question about when we get the $3 million volumes, do we expect the margin to be that same kind of 27%, 20, 8-ish percent, -- We absolutely do. 
Yes. The only thing I would add to that is, along those lines, the good news for us is we still have tremendous growth. We still have a lot of work that then can always be ongoing to drive more efficiencies and cost out of the business. And then on top of that, we've got this great value proposition that allows us to take advantage of pricing once we understand the combination of growth, cost efficiencies and then our value proposition.

And we're fortunate that we've got great leadership throughout our organization. So when you go into a restaurant that is struggling with staffing, we seek out to understand why. Do we have the right leader? Do we have the right culture? Once we understand that, we make sure we've got the right wages, the right benefits and people understand the true career opportunity to grow at Chipotle. And what we find is, look, once they -- we know we got the right leader and people get recruited into a great culture, they understand the career growth opportunity. We do a really good job there of winning that hiring competition. And then obviously, in each of these markets, we have to make sure that our wages continue to be competitive. And again, this is another opportunity that I think is unique to Chipotle that we've got the ability to move if we need to on a restaurant-by-restaurant basis.

The Chipotlanes typically open up somewhere in that 10% to 15% range higher on sales -- Their margin obviously is higher for 2 reasons. One, because the sales are higher, and we know that our higher volume restaurants flow through a higher margin. And then there's also the efficiency that we talked about where much more of the digital business -- first of all, the digital business is usually 10% to 15% higher. So if we're doing 45% say, in a non-Chipotlane, we'd be doing 55 or higher in a Chipotlane and it skews towards order ahead, our highest margin transaction. So the return is much, much better. The incremental investment cost generally is going to be about $75,000, $85,000, something like that. So with those kind of sales and those kind of higher margins, it's by far, a superior return. In terms of Chipotlane, the Chipotlane in the typical restaurant that you'll see open up, it's not any smaller than it's a focal restaurant, so it doesn't take a differ'ent footprint. What we are experimenting with, though, is a smaller footprint with the Chipotlane, where we might be able to go into a same location, the same location would be where you've got 2 restaurants already. They could be very, very high-volume restaurants. And there just isn't really enough room to economically put a third restaurant in between those 2. Well, if you can reduce the footprint, which reduces the rent, reduces the investment cost and because we have higher margins with Chipotlane and because customers more than 50% of them want to go through the Chipotlane order head and pick up. Well, it's mostly digital, and almost half of that is order head and pickup. We do have an opportunity economically to drop in a restaurant between those 2 high-volume restaurants. We're in the early days of that. We're just experimenting with that, but we think that, that's got some legs going forward. And that, Chris, would be incremental. Those would be deals that we wouldn't have done without the Chipotlane format."

Just curious, based on what you've said, if it's kind of fair to think about incremental benefits from a few, I guess, including that dining room traffic goes from 80% to 100% at some point, digital sales remain incremental in that scenario. Obviously, the additional pricing that you just spoke to I guess, staffing up and maybe the efficiency from the crews just getting better as dine in traffic comes back. Curious if it's kind of fair to think about all of those as incremental from here? And then if there's any others that you would call out kind of above and beyond everything that's been working and supporting momentum to date."

So look, I definitely think you touched on a lot of them, which is we still have opportunities for better throughput on our front line. I just mentioned that we're continuing to get faster on our digital business. So just running the operation, to your point, as we continue to get more fully staffed with more trained, well-developed people, executing against the great pillars of throughput that we know we need to execute there's upside in the business there. There's also upside in the strategies that I outlined in the beginning of the conversation today, which is we're going to continue to take advantage of our huge and growing rewards program. We've got -- we're closing around $25 million or were $24.5 million that's like a 40% increase versus where we were a year ago this time. So obviously, you're not going to continue to grow at that clip that database, but what we are growing is our capability in taking advantage of that database to drive behavior, engagement, commitment to our business. Obviously, we'll continue to smartly use menu and culinary innovation. So that's not going to stop. And when you think about our access that we're providing to people, I think our value proposition is going to really shine through going forward. So I just think that's another huge advantage. Even as I look around, I would put our Chicken Burritos up against a lot of food out there. And when you start to look at where pricing is going and a lot of other menus, our value proposition, I think, looks even more compelling. So I don't know what that's worth, but what I do know is I like being in a position of a really strong value proposition going forward given the environment that I think we're all going to be facing."

Chipotle's third quarter results highlight strong momentum in our business, fueled by a multipronged growth strategy and a passionate team that's delighted to see more guests coming back into our restaurants.",2191,"Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. Chipotle's third quarter results highlight strong momentum in our business, fueled by a multipronged growth strategy and a passionate team that's delighted to see more guests coming back into our restaurants. We continue to retain about 80% of digital sales, but have now recovered nearly 80% of in-restaurant sales. While COVID impacts will likely persist for a few more quarters, we are hopeful that the worst is behind us and society can shortly return to a more normal environment. 
Personally, I'm thrilled to welcome our restaurant support center leaders back to the office beginning in November, which will allow us to optimize creativity, comradery and effectiveness, key elements that help make Chipotle a unique and powerful brand. For the quarter, we reported record quarterly sales of $2 billion, representing 21.9% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by a 15.1% increase in comparable restaurant sales, restaurant-level margin of 23.5% was 400 basis points higher than the 19.5% we reported last year. 
Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $7.02, representing an increase of 86.7% year-over-year, digital sales growth of 8.6% year-over-year, representing 42.8% of sales, and we opened 41 new restaurants, including 36 with the Chipotlane. And I'm pleased to report that Q4 is off to a great start. These results highlight that our key strategies continue to resonate with guests and allow us to win today while we create the future. While we regularly get asked what's next, I believe our current growth drivers have plenty of runway and will be critical to us reaching our longer-term goal of 6,000 restaurants in North America with AUVs above $3 million and improving returns on invested capital. 
To remind everyone, we're focusing on 5 key areas: number one, opening and running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; number two, utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation; number three, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement; number four, engaging with customers through our loyalty program to drive transactions and frequency; and last, but certainly not least, number five, making the brand visible, relevant and loved. 
Let me now provide a brief update on each of these, starting with operations. Well trained and supported employees consistently preparing delicious food and delivering excellent guest experiences are at the heart of our success. We're fortunate to have amazing employees at our restaurants who have stayed focused on safety, reliability and excellent culinary despite the dynamic and challenging environment. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, our people are our greatest asset, and I can't thank them enough for all their efforts. We are extremely proud of Chipotle's world-class employee value proposition that includes industry-leading benefits, attractive wages, specialized training and development, access to education and a transparent pathway to significant career advancement opportunities. 
We believe these efforts are helping to attract and retain great employees, which is more important than ever given the challenging labor environment we're all experiencing today. Over the past 18 months, we've made operational adjustments to adapt to our constantly changing environment in support of our in-restaurant business as well as our record-breaking digital business. As a result, we've had to allocate labor as needed among the different roles, including the DML and the front line, depending on available staff to accommodate the needs of our customers and our restaurant teams. This flexibility has allowed us to keep our frontline open given our ability to divert orders on the digital lines as needed to overcome periodic staffing challenges. 
This is part of the normal business balancing that occurs at the discretion of on-site managers and has not had a material impact on our business in the past. This was true prepandemic and is more relevant now as dining room volumes recover. The good news is that I believe we are finally getting back to prepandemic operations, and I couldn't be more excited. 
We're fortunate to have a dedicated digital make line and a dedicated dining room serving line. Our frontline represented nearly 60% of our business or $1.1 billion of sales for the quarter. It is big and it is growing. We are committed to ensuring guests on the front line get the customized meal they want made with real ingredients, excellent culinary and faster than anywhere else. We still have some work to do, but our goal is to provide exceptional throughput as speed of service is a foundational element of convenience that our guests truly value. 
Therefore, we are committed to teaching, training and validating the 5 pillars of throughput every day during every shift to ensure we meet our high standards and provide a great guest experience. While taking good care of guests is always a top priority, utilizing our stage gate process to continue innovating is critical to our growth. The great news is that Chipotle is delicious food that you feel good about eating, which creates an emotional connection with our customers, and they love to see ongoing innovation from us. As a result, we introduced new menu items on a regular cadence as it helps bring in additional customers, drive frequency with existing users and gives us an opportunity to create buzz around the brand. 
Recently, we launched Smoked Brisket for a limited time across all our U.S. and Canadian restaurants. Our culinary team spent the last 2 years developing the perfect smoked brisket recipe that is unique to our brand and pairs flawlessly with our fresh, real ingredients. This is our third new menu item this year, following on the success of our Cilantro-Lime Cauliflower Rice and Hand-Crafted Quesadilla. Early customer feedback on this entree, which is expected to last through November, has been very positive, and we're delighted to see an increase in both check size and transactions. Quesadillas, which we launched as a permanent digital exclusive offering in March, continues to perform well and is also helping to attract new customers to Chipotle. By the way, if you haven't had a chance to try to brisket quesadilla, you really are missing out. And we're far from being done. Plant-based chorizo is currently being tested in a couple of markets and our talented culinary team is in the early stages of developing other exciting menu items. 
All that being said, our stage gate process is not limited to new menu innovations. We use it for many parts of the business, including development. As you know, we validated a new restaurant expansion in Canada earlier this year. Impressive unit economics with AUVs and margins equal to or above those in the U.S. led us to accelerate development in this market. We've opened 1 new restaurant in Canada year-to-date and have several more planned before year-end, including our first ever Chipotlane that's scheduled to open next week. 
Similarly, we are now in the early stages of using this process to learn, iterate and eventually validate expansion in Western Europe. COVID slowed our ability to execute several critical initiatives. However, with restrictions easing, we're making nice progress and have implemented some of our digital assets as well as begun to test alternative formats and explore new trade areas. The recent openings have exceeded expectations. So while we continue to view international expansion as a medium to longer-term opportunity, I remain quite optimistic about its future contribution to the Chipotle story. 
A more near-term pillar of growth has been our ongoing digital transformation, which is helping Chipotle become a real food-focused digital lifestyle brand. During the third quarter, digital sales grew nearly 9% year-over-year to $840 million and represented 43% of sales. We're not surprised to see the mix moderate as the world continues to reopen. However, we're pleased to see our digital sales dollars continue to grow despite lapping tough comparisons. 
In fact, our year-to-date digital sales of nearly $2.7 billion are just slightly below the $2.8 billion we achieved during all of last year. Digital is proving to be sticky as its a frictionless and convenient experience that has been aided by continuous technology investments to improve operational execution, innovation and the customer value proposition. As a result of the pandemic, many new consumers were introduced to Chipotle via our digital channels and are now using us for alternative occasions. 
The thing I love about having 2 separate businesses is that they serve different needs that will likely prove to be incremental and complementary over the long run. This is reinforced by the fact that different guests are accessing Chipotle through different channels. 
Currently, about 65% of our guests use in-restaurant as their main access point, nearly 20% use digital as their primary channel and the remaining 15% to 20% use both channels. We're encouraged by this dynamic as it gives us several future opportunities including the ability to convert more of our in-restaurant guests into higher frequency digital users. 
Not only are we pleased with the level of digital sales and overall mix, but we're also delighted to see that our highest margin transactions, digital pickup orders, is gaining traction. This channel represented slightly more than half of digital sales in Q3. As always, we're not being complacent and continue to look for ways to enhance convenience and access through alternate restaurant formats, digital-only menu offerings and leveraging our large and growing loyalty program. 
Speaking of the loyalty program, we're excited to have more than 24.5 million members, many of whom are new to the brand. This gives us a large captive audience to engage with and distribute content that promotes our values as well as motivates our super fans. We continue to leverage our CRM sophistication by focusing a lot more on personalization and using predictive modeling to trigger journeys primarily for new and lapsed customers. These personalized messages are more brand related as opposed to offers or discounts which is allowing us to optimize program foundation and economics. All these efforts, along with the use of enhanced analytics are allowing us to consistently attract more visits from loyalty members than nonmembers. No doubt, the loyalty program has moved from a crawl to the walk stage, and we still have a lot of room to grow, offering new ways to engage with Chipotle is essential to the ongoing evolution of our digital business. 
Our first enhancement was Rewards Exchange, which provides greater customization and flexibility to redeem rewards and allows guests to earn rewards faster. More recently, we announced Extras, an exclusive feature that gamifies Chipotle Rewards with personalized challenges to an extra points and/or collect achievement badges in order to drive engagement. As the program grows, so does our ability to provide sophisticated and relevant communications to our guests, which will ultimately deepen the relationship between members and the brand. We are pleased with our progress to date, but believe with ongoing investments and further leveraging of data-driven insights, we can get even better. 
Amplifying all the growth initiatives I mentioned thus far are the collective efforts of the marketing team, which are designed to make Chipotle more visible, more relevant and more loved. We believe that real food has the power to change the world and using custom creative across a wide variety of media channels that allow us to drive culture, drive difference and ultimately drive a purchase. For example, we use numerous campaigns to stay relevant via important sporting events such as the basketball championships, where we hit $1 million worth of free burritos in our TV advertising. 
We also utilize social media, including our website to authentically highlight real food for real athletes during the broadcast from Tokyo. And of course, to celebrate the launch of Smoked Brisket, we offered an exclusive peek to our loyalty members prior to a full launch supported by a media plan across online video, digital and social media platforms as well as traditional TV spots. All of these helped to attract new guests into the Chipotle family as well as increased frequency of existing users. We're fortunate to have an innovative marketing team that wants to be a leader, not a follower. And our marketing organization is built on a culture of accountability that encourages new ideas, is committed to experimentation and is ruthless on measuring returns. And isn't afraid to pivot to different opportunities if they don't perform to our high standards. 
Every day, this team is focused on driving sales today while enhancing our brand for tomorrow. Chipotle is committed to fostering a culture that values and champions our diversity while leveraging the individual talents of all team members to grow our business, elevate our brand and cultivate a better world. 
Our team has proven their ability to be resilient and successfully execute against macro complexities. Again, a huge thank you to our nearly 95,000 employees for all their efforts. As a result, I believe we are better positioned to drive sustainable, long-term growth than we were before the pandemic, which makes me even more excited about what we can accomplish in the years ahead. With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials."

We're pleased to report solid third quarter results with sales growing 21.9% year-over-year to $2 billion as comp sales grew 15.1%. Restaurant level margin of 23.5% expanded 400 basis points over last year, and",1189,"Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report solid third quarter results with sales growing 21.9% year-over-year to $2 billion as comp sales grew 15.1%. Restaurant level margin of 23.5% expanded 400 basis points over last year, and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $7.02, representing 86.7% year-over-year growth. The third quarter had a GAAP tax benefit that I'll discuss shortly, which was partially offset by expenses related to a previously disclosed modification to our 2018 performance shares and transformation expenses, which netted to positively impact our earnings per share by $0.16, leading to GAAP EPS of $7.18. 
As we look ahead to Q4, there remains uncertainty on several fronts, including COVID-related impacts as well as inflationary and staffing pressures. But given our strong underlying business momentum, we expect our comps to be in the low to mid-double digits, which is encouraging, considering there will be about 200 basis points less in pricing contributions during Q4 versus Q3 as we lap some of our delivery menu price increases and our brisket LTO will be for a partial quarter as compared to the full quarter of Carne Asada last year. 
Let me now go through the P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Our supply chain team has done an outstanding job navigating the numerous industry-wide disruptions, which led to food costs being 30.3% in Q3, a decrease of 200 basis points from last year. This was due primarily to leverage from menu price increases which were partially offset by higher costs associated with beef and freight that unfortunately are continuing to worsen. It's hard to predict how much of these headwinds will ultimately be temporary versus permanent, but they're likely to persist for the foreseeable future. In addition, Q4 will also include the higher cost brisket LTO, which collectively will result in our food cost being in the low 31% range for the quarter. 
Labor costs for the third quarter were 25.8%, an increase of about 40 basis points from last year. This increase was driven by our strategy to increase average nationwide wages to $15 per hour, which is partially offset by menu price increases, sales leverage and a onetime employee retention credit. Given ongoing elevated wage inflation and greater new unit openings, we expect labor cost to be in the mid-26% range in Q4. 
Other operating costs for the quarter were 15.1%, a decrease of 170 basis points from last year due primarily to price and sales leverage. Marketing promo costs for the quarter were 2.4%, about 20 basis points lower than we spent last year. While Q3 tends to be a seasonally lower advertising quarter, the timing of some initiatives also shifted into Q4 this year. As a result, we anticipate marketing expense to be around 4% in Q4 to support Smoked Brisket and for the latest brand messaging under our Behind the Foil campaign. 
For the full year 2021, marketing spend is expected to remain right about 3% of sales. Overall, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid-16% range for the fourth quarter. Looking at overall restaurant margins. We expect Q4 were to be in the 20% to 21% range. Our Q4 underlying margin would be around 22% when you normalize marketing spend and remove the temporary headwinds from the brisket LTO. Despite these challenges, we remain confident in our ability to drive -- as our average unit volumes increase. 
G&A for the quarter was $146 million on a GAAP basis or $137 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $7.6 million for the previously mentioned modification for 2018 performance shares and $1.6 million related to transformation and other expenses. G&A also includes about $100 million in underlying G&A, about $28 million related to noncash stock compensation, about $8.5 million related to higher performance-based bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting and stock option exercises and roughly $600,000 related to our upcoming All Managers Conference. 
Looking to Q4, we expect our underlying G&A to be right around $101 million as we continue to make investments primarily in tech to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will likely be around $27 million in Q4, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. We also expect to recognize around $5.5 million related to performance-based bonus expense and employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter as well as about $1.5 million related to our All Managers Conference. 
Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 14.7% on a GAAP basis and 19.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Both rates benefited from our option exercises and share vesting at elevated stock prices. In addition, our GAAP tax rate included a return to provision benefit for additional NOLs generated on our 2020 federal income tax returns and carry back to prior years. For Q4, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy as we ended Q3 with $1.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt, along with a $500 million untapped revolver. During the quarter, we repurchased $99 million of our stock at an average price of $1,813 and we expect to continue using excess free cash flow to opportunistically repurchase our stock. However, opening more Chipotles continues to be the best return we can generate. 
During Q3, despite a few delays in opening time lines, we opened 41 new restaurants with 36 of these including a Chipotlane. While we're experiencing construction inflationary pressures, subcontractor, labor shortages, critical equipment shortages and landlord delivery delays, our development team is doing an excellent job opening these new restaurants. In fact, we currently have more than 110 restaurants under construction. And while timing is somewhat unpredictable, this gives us confidence in ending the year at or slightly above the 200 new restaurants with now more than 75% including a Chipotlane versus our prior expectation of 70%. 
Also, the team has done a nice job building a robust new unit pipeline which we believe will allow us to accelerate openings in 2022. But because of the challenges I just mentioned and how they could impact the time line, we'll provide 2022 opening guidance during our Q4 call. As of September 30, we had a total of 284 Chipotlane, including 12 conversions and 8 relocations, they continue to enhance access and convenience for our guests while demonstrating stellar performance. And while it's early days, Chipotlane conversions and relocations are yielding encouraging results. We'll leverage our stage gate process to learn and refine our strategic approach to accelerating our Chipotle portfolio. 
I'd like to close today by thanking all of our Chipotle team members for the exceptional results we're reporting today as well as their hard work and dedication and helping sustain our long-term powerful economic model. Maintaining a 40% pass-through on incremental sales as we expand AUVs will lead to higher margins and improving cash-on-cash restaurant returns. You can see why we remain optimistic about our future. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

So I would tell you that's been the biggest shift. And then we've also gone back and put individual assets in all of our existing restaurants. And we're starting to see that take hold as well. So it's very early. A lot of these restaurants just opened in the last months or weeks, and we're really happy though with the way that it started.

Jeff, I would say -- I mean, listen, we're dealing with the same inflationary environment that all restaurants and really all businesses are dealing with nowadays. Some of it comes from labor. And I'm not talking about labor in our P&L. I'm talking about our supplier labor. Everyone's dealing with the same kind of challenge. Some of it is raw material shortages as well. And so it's very hard to predict. I would say the inflation in the quarter was not that bad. It was mid-single-digit type inflation. But you've seen the same kind of list that we have seen that their forecast for some materials, not necessarily what we're buying, that are into the double digits sometimes well into the double digits. 
Now we're not really seeing that. I mean we're seeing isolated spikes, but most of our ingredients are okay. They're all pressured to the upside. And what we want to do is really take a look, be patient and see how much of this is really because of things like shipping, like things that come in from outside this country. The freight is astronomically high and the ability to get the supply we need is very, very challenging. So we want to see how that normalizes. There's material shortages, not just with our food and paper, but also with our openings as well. Some of that is going to normalize as well. 
So there's a lot for us to learn. Definitely, there's upward pressure. And the thing that I would just tell you is we feel very comfortable that any inflation that is affecting our margins today, we have the ability to offset it. It's just a matter of let's be patient.

So we're not going to worry about pressure at a particular quarter. on the margins, we're going to watch it for a few quarters and see what happens.

The thing that's attractive about that is not everybody wants to wait to redeem for full-size entree, and this opens the door for them to redeem faster, get kind of rewarded for taking action as we see people continue to engage in the rewards program. So it continues to work really well to take advantage of new users, medium users or heavy users that want to engage with the brand and then we're able to influence their behaviors, resulting in more frequency and higher ticket."

And now we have these scenarios where things pop up and you have to deal with it accordingly, whether it's exclusions as it relates to COVID or kids going back to school, you're in kind of the normal course of having to make sure that you're always recruiting, and then we got to make sure we're getting people trained up.

The Chipotlanes typically open up somewhere in that 10% to 15% range higher on sales -- Their margin obviously is higher for 2 reasons. One, because the sales are higher, and we know that our higher volume restaurants flow through a higher margin. And then there's also the efficiency that we talked about where much more of the digital business -- first of all, the digital business is usually 10% to 15% higher. So if we're doing 45% say, in a non-Chipotlane, we'd be doing 55% or higher in a Chipotlane and it skews towards order ahead, our highest margin transaction. So the return is much, much better. 
The incremental investment cost generally is going to be about $75,000, $85,000, something like that. So with those kind of sales and those kind of higher margins, it's by far, a superior return. In terms of Chipotlane, the Chipotlane in the typical restaurant that you'll see open up, it's not any smaller than a typical restaurant, so it doesn't take a different footprint. What we are experimenting with, though, is a smaller footprint with the Chipotlane, where we might be able to go into a same location. 
The same location would be where you've got 2 restaurants already. They could be very, very high-volume restaurants and there just isn't really enough room to economically put a third restaurant in between those 2. Well, if you can reduce the footprint, which reduces the rent, reduces the investment cost and because we have higher margins with Chipotlane and because customers, more than 50% of them want to go through the Chipotlane, order head and pick up. Well, it's mostly digital, and almost half of that is order ahead and pickup. We do have an opportunity economically to drop in a restaurant between those 2 high-volume restaurants. We're in the early days of that. We're just experimenting with that, but we think that, that's got some legs going forward. And that, Chris, would be incremental. Those would be deals that we wouldn't have done without the Chipotlane format."

There's not a risk that we won't get the 200 opening. I don't think there's a risk that we won't get to or beyond 200. but more than a previous year, more than a typical year, there's timing risk in that. And so I think we'll get to that 200 plus. But I think it gives you an idea of how robust our pipeline was. Without these timing risk, we would have been well beyond 1,200 -- well beyond the 200. For next year, I also mentioned that we've got a very robust pipeline. So the good news here is our pipeline is really, really, really strong. 
We're doing everything we can to try to work through the timing issues, like we're preordering supplies, for example, so that we're not going to run out because we're preordering things. We're doing everything we can to work with our contractors. But if they have short labor or if they have exclusion because people are exposed to COVID, the construction site does shut down. Those are things that are just unavoidable. We're navigating as best we can through that. But most important is the pipeline is really, really strong.

So we never have to close our restaurants. And what we're able to do is then allocate accordingly. The other thing that we've learned that's another benefit of this digital business is we have restaurants within a couple of miles of each other, and delivery doesn't get impacted if you ship from one restaurant to another. So if we have to throttle back our digital business in 1 restaurant because we're a little light on staffing so that we can keep the front line running smoothly, the good news is we got another restaurant right around the corner that is able to fulfill that digital order. And so we don't see a lot of drop-off in the business that way. 
But at the end of the day, I wish all our restaurants were fully staffed. And I know we're missing sales because not all of them are fully staffed. So there is still upside in getting our staffing solved in every single restaurant. The good news is we're in really good shape for the majority of our restaurants. Our teams have done a phenomenal job. And it's going to be something that we're going to have to continue to work hard and it's one of those things where it's not going to get any easier.

Obviously, we'll continue to smartly use menu and culinary innovation. So that's not going to stop. And when you think about our access that we're providing to people, I think our value proposition is going to really shine through going forward. So I just think that's another huge advantage.
