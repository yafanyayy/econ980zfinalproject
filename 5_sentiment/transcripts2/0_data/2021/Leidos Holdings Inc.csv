Before we close the door on last year, I'd like to take a moment to thank the approximately 39,000 Leidos employees, our business partners and our customers for their unwavering commitment and collaboration in light of the COVID challenges. I'm inspired by what we accomplished in the past year together and the challenges that we will solve in this new year for the betterment of our communities and our customers' mission. 
Fourth quarter results reflect the resilience of our growing portfolio with new record levels of revenue and backlog, coupled with margin expansion and further balance sheet optimization. This performance positions us for above-market growth in 2021, fueled by our talented, diverse workforce who continue to engineer and deliver technologically innovative and secure solutions for our customers' evolving needs. 
Revenues for the quarter were $3.25 billion, up 10.1% from the prior year, reflecting 2 strategic acquisitions that closed in 2020. 
Q4's adjusted EBITDA of 11.3%, up 30 basis points compared to the prior year period, reflects strong program performance and indirect cost management that delivered 8% growth on non-GAAP EPS totaling $1.63 for the quarter. 
Net bookings of $3.3 billion in the quarter resulted in a book-to-bill slightly above 1 and 1.4x on a trailing 12-month basis. 
These solid results do not reflect any material contributions from the Navy NextGen program which was resolved in Leidos' favor late in the year, the $1.7 billion FAA NISC IV recompete award that is currently under protest, or the $1 billion Military and Family Life Counseling award that was announced in January. These 3 wins, coupled with a backlog that is more than 2.5x our historical annual revenue and a healthy new business pipeline, provide us with high confidence in our growth outlook in the new year and beyond. 
For the full year, we generated record revenue of $12.3 billion, an increase -- an annual increase of 10.8%. 
Full year revenue delivered 10.8% adjusted EBITDA margins that yielded non-GAAP earnings per share of $5.83. This represents 13% growth over the prior year. 
Additionally, the business generated over $1.3 billion of cash from operations for the year, far exceeding our initial 2020 guidance. 
Full year net bookings of $17.8 billion contributed to a record year-end backlog position of $31.9 billion, a year-over-year increase of over 32% or a healthy 23% after adjusting for acquired backlog. 
Turning now to several significant contract actions in the quarter that position the business for significant organic growth. 
In the Defense Solutions segment, the U.S. Court of federal claims ruled in favor of our Navy customer's award of the NGEN program where Leidos will unify, operate and maintain the shore-based networks and data management for the Department of Navy's Program Executive Office Digital to improve capability and service under one enterprise network construct. The single-award IDIQ has a 5-year base period of performance, followed by 3 1-year option periods with an approximate value of $7.7 billion if all options are exercised. Due to timing of the court's decision, no significant task orders were booked in the fourth quarter. 
Also in the Defense Solutions segment, the GAO denied a protest, clearing the path of the U.S. SOCOM tactical airborne multicenter sensor platform support task order, also known as STAMP 2 to Leidos. Under the contract, Leidos will provide pilot services, airborne sensor operations, hub-and-spoke operations and excursion support as well as other engineering support services in support of the programs to Javelin-8 and King Air 300 aircraft. The award has a total value of $649 million and includes a 1-year base period of performance, followed by 4 1-year option periods. 
Additionally, within the Intelligence Community, the company was awarded contracts collectively valued at $304 million, if all options are exercised. Though the specific nature of these contracts are classified, they encompass mission-critical services that help to counter global threats and strengthen national security. 
This morning, we announced the second of 2 strategic acquisitions that occurred over the last several months. Similar to transactions we closed in 2020, these recent deals support our strategic framework of adding capabilities and deepening customer relationships. We expect Gibbs & Cox and 1901 Group to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP EPS. 
The acquisition of Gibbs & Cox will extend our existing maritime business and add specific capabilities and services, such as naval architecture and marine engineering, 3D modeling and design and specialty engineering to the solution set that we offer to our customers. Gibbs & Cox has a rich history dating back to 1929, and their workforce is highly regarded in the industry and across the globe. In addition to being positioned on the front end of next-generation vessels, the business combination provides significant tailwinds for participation in the maritime unmanned market and accelerates Gibbs & Cox' expansion in the undersea domain. We anticipate that the transaction will close in the second quarter after the completion of regulatory reviews. 
Second, in early December, we announced the strategic acquisition of 1901 Group, a leading cloud and digital modernization as a service provider. The transaction is now closed. And this quarter, we welcome the nearly 400 IT cloud and cyber specialists to the Leidos family. In addition to its deep bench of technical talent, the company has developed a robust as-a-service delivery model that is scalable, repeatable and affordable. As our customers continue to seek on- and off-premise managed service solutions, 1901 Group will expand our team's ability to address this accelerating market. Organizationally, 1901 Group is aligned with our defense group, and through collaboration with our CIO and CTO leadership, we are in the process of leveraging these new capabilities across the enterprise to the benefit of our customers. 
Looking to the macro environment. With the current year $740 billion NDAA passed into law, attention now turns to the President's pending fiscal year 2022 budget recommendation, which is unlikely to put pressure on defense industry outlays before fiscal year 2023. Given the great power competition and leading national security issues, we do not anticipate major cuts, but rather flattish to slightly declining budget numbers with focus on modernization and reprioritization. 
Also, with projected increased focus on health care demands and civil infrastructure, particularly transportation, we believe that our diverse portfolio of differentiated solutions is well aligned with the administration's and our customers' highest priorities. 
Next, I want to take a moment to highlight Leidos continued commitment to mental health and well-being of both our employees and our communities, a topic that has been increasingly more front-end center for families over the past 12 months. 
Approximately 3.5 years ago, we launched an initiative to do our part to tackle the opioid epidemic and challenged other companies to do the same. These efforts organically grew to also address the underlying contributors to substance misuse associated with mental health and well-being, including anxiety, depression and suicidal tendencies, all exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Last year, we added internal benefits and resources, for example, the offering of the Headspace app to our employees free of charge. We also elevated the conversation in our communities through continued engagements with the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America, with the DEA in support of their national take-back days and by working with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. In the most recent quarter, we formed a strong relationship with the Millican Institute Center for Public Health, including participating in multiple virtual global panels focused on addressing both mental health and substance misuse. 
Additionally, Leidos participated in Out of Darkness Suicide Prevention Virtual Experiences in Washington, D.C. and North Alabama. At both events, we raised awareness as well as critical funds needed to address the stigma surrounding suicide. 
We look forward to continuing to lead and support these critical health initiatives for our nation's citizens in this new year. 
Finally, I would like to mention that Leidos, for the fourth consecutive year, has been recognized as one of the 2021 World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Institute, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. This recognition is a testament to our employees worldwide who embody this core value. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer, for more detail on our results and our 2021 outlook."

I'll start by providing an overview of our 2020 results for both the fourth quarter and full year followed by a review of 2021 guidance. First, starting with revenue. Fourth quarter revenue gre",1896,"Thanks, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I'll start by providing an overview of our 2020 results for both the fourth quarter and full year followed by a review of 2021 guidance. 
First, starting with revenue. Fourth quarter revenue grew 10.1% over the prior year period driven by the acquisitions of Dynetics and the Security Detection & Automation Businesses, partially offset by 2019's 53-week year, which included a couple of additional business days in its final month. On an organic basis, we experienced contraction of approximately 3% due to the continuation of some COVID-19 impacts as well as the timing of customer procurements and delayed new starts, which more than offset new program wins and on-contract growth in parts of the portfolio. Our organic growth calculation excludes the performance of acquired businesses until a full year has passed. More details can be found on Slide 16 of the earnings presentation, which is available on our Investor Relations website. 
Full year revenue of $12.3 billion was at the lower end of our guidance range due to, one, better-than-expected indirect cost savings that translated into lower revenue on cost reimbursable programs; two, the favorable decision on the Navy NextGen award which occurred later in the quarter than previously estimated; and three, timing on new contract awards and on-contract -- on-contract growth decisions attributable to the ongoing effects of COVID. We expect a number of these events to become tailwinds for 2021. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins were 11.3%, 30 basis points higher than the prior year period. Our robust margins this quarter were driven by higher margins on new programs and favorable write-ups on existing programs due to strong program performance and reduced indirect rates. 
We delivered full year adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.8%, matching the top end of guidance. This represents our fourth consecutive year exceeding our 10% or higher long-term target. After adjusting for the $81 million net gain from the VirnetX legal matter and our estimated COVID-19 impacts, adjusted EBITDA margins would have been 10.4%, which is comparable to our 2019 performance. 
Fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.63 grew $0.12 over the prior year period. Contributions from strong program performance and increased volume on existing and new programs were the primary drivers of the 8% growth year-over-year. 
We exited the year with non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.83, a 13% increase over 2019 and at the upper end of our guidance range. 
Cash used in operating activities was $52 million. As projected in the third quarter earnings call, the net cash outflows were driven by the full repayment of the accounts receivable monetization facility, resulting in 0 utilization of the facility at year-end. 
It is also worth noting that we completed $67 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter, delivering on our commitment to return value to our shareholders. Our remaining share repurchase authorization under the program is approximately 7 million shares. 
Full year operating cash flows of $1.3 billion benefited primarily from 2 nonrecurring items: the $81 million net receipt from the VirnetX legal matter and $123 million of CARES Act deferred payroll taxes. These items, coupled with strong balance sheet management, higher labor utilization and the accelerated collection of receivables previously planned for 2021 drove a 34% increase over 2019, exceeding our previous guidance for operating cash flows. And you may recall that the original 2020 guide for operating cash flow was $1 billion. 
And to recap, the stronger cash from 2021 resulted from first, that $123 million of CARES Act payroll tax deferral; two, net advance payments of $74 million; four -- excuse me, three, higher staff utilization of about $70 million; and three -- four, the VirnetX cash flow issue of $81 million that was a tailwind for cash flow in the year. 
Bookings of $3.3 billion for the quarter resulted in a 1.0x book-to-bill, with record ending backlog of $31.9 billion. 
For the year, we booked over $17.7 billion of net awards, reflecting a 23% increase over 2019 and driving a 1.4x book-to-bill for the year. 
And now for an overview of our segment results. Defense Solutions revenue increased 16.5% over the prior year quarter and contracted 1.6% organically. Driving the strong growth was the Dynetics acquisition and the ramping of new programs. This growth was partially offset by delays to new awards, such as the Navy NGEN and STAMP 2 contracts, material timing and reduced volume on legacy contracts. And for the full year, Defense Solutions grew 16.5% over 2019, including 1.7% organically. 
Non-GAAP operating margins in the Defense Solutions segment of 8.9% contracted 90 basis points from the prior year quarter. The primary drivers of this change were a reduction in program volumes and the successful settlement of an outstanding legal matter in the fourth quarter of 2019, which drove higher margins 1 year ago. 
Defense Solutions booked over $2.3 billion in net awards, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.2x for the quarter. For the full year, Defense Solutions booked nearly $9 billion in net awards, a 5% increase over the prior year and driving a 1.2x book-to-bill for the full year. 
With regard to our Defense Solutions segment M&A, we are very pleased with Dynetics' contribution to the segment. The business delivered on the annualized revenue commitment, and we are particularly pleased with Dynetics pro forma full year growth rate of 50% as well as the business' positioning in the new year. 
In our Civil segment, revenue grew 5% over the prior year quarter and contracted 6.6% organically. The top line growth was driven by the acquisition of the Security Detection & Automation Businesses and new program wins. This increase was offset by reduced volumes on existing contracts and COVID-19 impacts to programs with our FAA and National Science Foundation customers. 
Civil non-GAAP operating margins of 12.3% increased 30 basis points over the prior year quarter. The primary drivers of the strong margins this quarter were product timing and mix, favorable net write-ups due to increased cost efficiencies on certain programs and reduced indirect rates. The Civil segment delivered full year non-GAAP operating margins of 11.7%, an 80 basis point increase over the prior year. 
Civil recorded over $700 million in net bookings for the quarter, resulting at a 0.9x book-to-bill and a 2.2x book-to-bill for the full year. 
Turning to the segment's M&A. The SD&A Business was impacted by a longer than previously expected decline in air travel, resulting in lower revenue for the year. Despite the extended effects of the global pandemic, we are pleased with our technology and competitive positioning as the market begins its path to recovery during the latter half of 2021. 
And finally, turning to our Health segment. Health segment revenues contracted 2.5% over the prior year quarter. The reduction was driven by lower material purchases on certain CMS programs and new business delays, partially offset by COVID-19 impact recoveries, particularly in our medical exam business. On a full year basis and after adjusting for acquisition and divestiture activity, the Health segment grew approximately 1% organically. 
Our health segment continues to be our hardest -- our highest-margin segment, generating non-GAAP operating margins of 18.5% in the quarter, a record high. This 250 basis point increase over the prior year quarter was driven by favorable net write-ups due to risk avoidance on certain programs, strong program performance on existing contracts and lower volume of business investments on a commercial IT venture. For the full year, Health segment non-GAAP operating margins were in line with 2019, increasing 10 basis points to 14.4%. 
The Health segment saw approximately $230 million of net bookings in the quarter, driving a book-to-bill of 0.5x, with a full year book-to-bill of 1.1x. 
And before I transition to next year's guidance, I want to give you an update on where we stand versus the 3-year financial targets that we shared with you at our 2019 Investor Day event. With 2 years now in the books, our organic revenue growth is running at 5.5% CAGR versus the 5% target we laid out at Investor Day. Free cash flow conversion of 127% is well ahead of our 100% or better target. And adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.6% exceeds the 10% established floor. 
As you may recall, we also had a $2.7 billion balanced cash deployment plan. And with 1 year to go, we've already deployed a total of $2.2 billion. As we head into 2021, our disciplined capital allocation philosophy remains the same. We remain committed to being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment-grade rating, returning a quarterly dividend to our shareholders, reinvesting for growth both organically and inorganically and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner. 
Now on to our 2021 guidance, which does not include the Gibbs & Cox deal that we announced this morning. And as we've done in the past, we will provide an update at our next quarterly earnings conference call after the receipt of regulatory approvals and deal closing. 
For 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $13.7 billion to $14.1 billion, reflecting growth in the range of 11% to 15% over 2020. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to grow more than 10% organically. This organic growth is driven by 3 factors: the contributions from contracts that successfully cleared protests, such as Navy NGEN and STAMP 2; the accelerated recovery in our medical exam business; and growth from acquisitions and additional new business, including our most recent [indiscernible] win in the Health segment. 
We expect adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.3% to 10.5% for the year. After adjusting for the $81 million net gain realized in 2020 from the VirnetX legal matter and the estimated COVID-19 impacts, 2021 adjusted EBITDA margins are consistent with 2020. 
We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS between $6.15 and $6.45 on the basis of 144 million shares outstanding. 
We expect operating cash flow in 2021 of at least $850 million. This guidance reflects increased net income in 2021 and also incorporates the partial repayment of $65 million in 2020 CARES Act payroll tax deferrals, $50 million in burn down of the prior year's customer advances and $170 million of increased working capital to support 2021's top line growth. 
For additional context, the business has delivered 120% free cash flow conversion of net income across the 3-year time frame of 2018 through 2020. We expect to deliver above 100% conversion across comparable time intervals going forward. 
And one other item to note. While we may utilize our accounts receivable monetization facility from time to time for short-term or strategic actions, our 2021 operating cash flow guidance does not include any contribution from the facility that was established in early 2020. 
Now a couple of other comments to help you with modeling 2021. We expect net interest expense of approximately $179 million excluding transaction-related expenses. 
We also expect a slightly higher non-GAAP tax rate in 2021 of 22%. 
Capital expenditures are targeted at approximately $170 million, a 7% decrease from 2020. As you may recall, 2020 capital expenditures were elevated due to the real estate investment costs associated with the build-out of our new headquarters and other real estate optimization activities. Our normalized go-forward run rate for -- excuse me, for CapEx is targeted at below 1.5% of revenue. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob so we can take some questions."

When we raised our guidance, we had Navy NextGen was in the court of federal claims. And we -- court of federal claims is a little bit unpredictable, unlike the GAO process which has a rigorous calendar and is kind of a 99-day thing. And it was our best estimate that the court of federal claims would rule, frankly, before the Thanksgiving holiday. I mean, at one time we thought it would actually happen in the second week of November. That did not happen. We didn't get a ruling out of the court of federal claims until December. So that delayed the start-up of the NextGen program by at least 1 month, maybe more. 
And then the other thing that happened, with this third wave of COVID, which I think COVID is very difficult to predict, our indirect costs went down even further as we went back to mandatory telework. And we saw our overhead and G&A costs go down even further than we had anticipated. And because about half of our portfolio is a cost-type contract, when we see a reduction in cost, it pulls revenue down with it. And those were the 2 major drivers. Maybe I'll turn it over to Jim if he wants to add some more color."

We have received a 2-month extension from the customer as they will go about their competitive evaluation of the 3 bidders.

There's a significant construction project that we would have been doing now that has been deferred to a later year when COVID will largely have abated or be gone and not considered a risk of bringing COVID down to the Antarctic. 
Another example is, I mean, obviously, we've talked about the impact on the SD&A Business, where while we've had a revenue impact there, we're working to consolidate operations, get our cost synergies and get the combined business to margins that are well above where the pro forma had been on the acquisition date. 
The other COVID impacts, we're still recovering and getting to the what would be higher than normal volumes in the medical exam business. So that business has a lot of backlog to run off and that is included in our view of 2021. 
And then the places where we're not seeing a lingering impact, a significant lingering impact, is that in our intelligence business, the customers there are largely, not 100%, but they're getting pretty close to it.

First, we think we understand what the Biden administration is going to do on the payroll tax deferral. And so we put that into our guidance. There is some discussion that they may defer it. If so, that could be a positive, about -- we have $123 million in the deferral, if they decide to defer it another year, not in the $1.9 trillion, but there's a subsequent bill that's likely to come, so that could be a nonrecurring item. 
On the asset-backed program, the accounts receivable, we use that when it's at advantageous based upon cost of borrowing, right? And that's really what the facility is there for as opposed to like a revolver or commercial paper program or using a 364-day facility. So that goes in and out depending upon that advantageous interest rate. 
But the overall cash story really was we had a great fourth quarter. And we had some advanced payments. We got paid. We got some nonrecurrings. And we far exceeded what we thought we would achieve in fourth quarter. And as a result, some of what would have been in 2021 happened in 2020. And we tried to take you through that reversal. 
And then this 10% to 15% growth that we expect next year requires working capital. We're a capital-light business model, but we still have working capital. And so when we grow just the difference between liabilities and assets, requires us to fund, and that comes out of cash.

Before we close the door on last year, I'd like to take a moment to thank the approximately 39,000 Leidos employees, our business partners and our customers for their unwavering commitment and collaboration in light of the COVID challenges. I'm inspired by what we accomplished in the past year together and the challenges that we will solve in this new year for the betterment of our communities and our customers' mission.  
Fourth quarter results reflect the resilience of our growing portfolio with new record levels of revenue and backlog, coupled with margin expansion and further balance sheet optimization. This performance positions us for above-market growth in 2021, fueled by our talented, diverse workforce who continue to engineer and deliver technologically innovative and secure solutions for our customers' evolving needs.  
Revenues for the quarter were $3.25 billion, up 10.1% from the prior year, reflecting 2 strategic acquisitions that closed in 2020.  
Q4's adjusted EBITDA of 11.3%, up 30 basis points compared to the prior year period, reflects strong program performance and indirect cost management that delivered 8% growth on non-GAAP EPS totaling $1.63 for the quarter.  
Net bookings of $3.3 billion in the quarter resulted in a book-to-bill slightly above 1 and 1.4x on a trailing 12-month basis.  
These solid results do not reflect any material contributions from the Navy NextGen program which was resolved in Leidos' favor late in the year, the $1.7 billion FAA NISC IV recompete award that is currently under protest, or the $1 billion Military and Family Life Counseling award that was announced in January. These 3 wins, coupled with a backlog that is more than 2.5x our historical annual revenue and a healthy new business pipeline, provide us with high confidence in our growth outlook in the new year and beyond.  
For the full year, we generated record revenue of $12.3 billion, an increase -- an annual increase of 10.8%.  
Full year revenue delivered 10.8% adjusted EBITDA margins that yielded non-GAAP earnings per share of $5.83. This represents 13% growth over the prior year.  
Additionally, the business generated over $1.3 billion of cash from operations for the year, far exceeding our initial 2020 guidance.  
Full year net bookings of $17.8 billion contributed to a record year-end backlog position of $31.9 billion, a year-over-year increase of over 32% or a healthy 23% after adjusting for acquired backlog.  
Turning now to several significant contract actions in the quarter that position the business for significant organic growth.  
In the Defense Solutions segment, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled in favor of our Navy customer's award of the NGEN program where Leidos will unify, operate and maintain the shore-based networks and data management for the Department of Navy's Program Executive Office Digital to improve capability and service under one enterprise network construct. The single-award IDIQ has a 5-year base period of performance, followed by 3 1-year option periods with an approximate value of $7.7 billion if all options are exercised. Due to timing of the court's decision, no significant task orders were booked in the fourth quarter.  
Also in the Defense Solutions segment, the GAO denied a protest, clearing the path of the U.S. SOCOM tactical airborne multicenter sensor platform support task order, also known as STAMP II to Leidos. Under the contract, Leidos will provide pilot services, airborne sensor operations, hub-and-spoke operations and excursion support as well as under -- other engineering support services in support of the programs De Havilland Dash 8 and King Air 300 aircraft. The award has a total value of $649 million and includes a 1-year base period of performance, followed by 4 1-year option periods.  
Additionally, within the Intelligence Community, the company was awarded contracts collectively valued at $304 million, if all options are exercised. Though the specific nature of these contracts are classified, they encompass mission-critical services that help to counter global threats and strengthen national security.  
This morning, we announced the second of 2 strategic acquisitions that occurred over the last several months. Similar to transactions we closed in 2020, these recent deals support our strategic framework of adding capabilities and deepening customer relationships. We expect Gibbs & Cox and 1901 Group to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP EPS. The acquisition of Gibbs & Cox will extend our existing maritime business and add specific capabilities and services, such as naval architecture and marine engineering, 3D modeling and design and specialty engineering to the solutions set that we offer to our customers. 
Gibbs & Cox has a rich history dating back to 1929, and their workforce is highly regarded in the industry and across the globe. In addition to being positioned on the front end of next-generation vessels, the business combination provides significant tailwinds for participation in the maritime unmanned market and accelerates Gibbs & Cox' expansion in the undersea domain. We anticipate that the transaction will close in the second quarter after the completion of regulatory reviews.  
Second, in early December, we announced the strategic acquisition of 1901 Group, a leading cloud and digital modernization as-a-service provider. The transaction is now closed. And this quarter, we welcome the nearly 400 IT cloud and cyber specialists to the Leidos family. In addition to its deep bench of technical talent, the company has developed a robust as-a-service delivery model that is scalable, repeatable and affordable. As our customers continue to seek on- and off-premise managed service solutions, 1901 Group will expand our team's ability to address this accelerating market. Organizationally, 1901 Group is aligned with our defense group, and through collaboration with our CIO and CTO leadership, we are in the process of leveraging these new capabilities across the enterprise to the benefit of our customers.  
Looking to the macro environment. With the current year $740 billion NDAA passed into law, attention now turns to the President's pending fiscal year 2022 budget recommendation, which is unlikely to put pressure on defense industry outlays before fiscal year 2023. Given the great power competition and leading national security issues, we do not anticipate major cuts, but rather flattish to slightly declining budget numbers with focus on modernization and reprioritization.  
Also, with projected increased focus on health care demands and civil infrastructure, particularly transportation, we believe that our diverse portfolio of differentiated solutions is well aligned with the administration's and our customers' highest priorities.  
Next, I want to take a moment to highlight Leidos continued commitment to mental health and well-being of both our employees and our communities, a topic that has been increasingly more front and center for families over the past 12 months.  
Approximately 3.5 years ago, we launched an initiative to do our part to tackle the opioid epidemic and challenged other companies to do the same. These efforts organically grew to also address the underlying contributors to substance misuse associated with mental health and well-being, including anxiety, depression and suicidal tendencies, all exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Last year, we added internal benefits and resources, for example, the offering of the Headspace app to our employees free of charge. We also elevated the conversation in our communities through continued engagements with the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America, with the DEA in support of their national take-back days and by working with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. In the most recent quarter, we formed a strong relationship with the Milken Institute Center for Public Health, including participating in multiple virtual global panels focused on addressing both mental health and substance misuse. Additionally, Leidos participated in Out of Darkness suicide prevention virtual experiences in Washington, D.C. and North Alabama. At both events, we raised awareness as well as critical funds needed to address the stigma surrounding suicide. We look forward to continuing to lead and support these critical health initiatives for our nation's citizens in this new year.  
Finally, I would like to mention that Leidos, for the fourth consecutive year, has been recognized as one of the 2021 World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Institute, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. This recognition is a testament to our employees worldwide who embody this core value.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Jim Reagan, our Chief Financial Officer, for more detail on our results and our 2021 outlook."

I'll start by providing an overview of our 2020 results for both the fourth quarter and full year followed by a review of 2021 guidance.  First, starting with revenue. Fourth quarter revenue gr",1891,"Thanks, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I'll start by providing an overview of our 2020 results for both the fourth quarter and full year followed by a review of 2021 guidance.  
First, starting with revenue. Fourth quarter revenue grew 10.1% over the prior year period driven by the acquisitions of Dynetics and the security detection and automation businesses, partially offset by 2019's 53-week year, which included a couple of additional business days in its final month. On an organic basis, we experienced contraction of approximately 3% due to the continuation of some COVID-19 impacts as well as the timing of customer procurements and delayed new starts, which more than offset new program wins and on-contract growth in parts of the portfolio. Our organic growth calculation excluded the performance of acquired businesses until a full year has passed. More details can be found on Slide 16 of the earnings presentation, which is available on our Investor Relations website.  
Full year revenue of $12.3 billion was at the lower end of our guidance range due to: one, better-than-expected indirect cost savings that translated into lower revenue on cost-reimbursable programs; two, the favorable decision on the Navy NextGen award, which occurred later in the quarter than previously estimated; and three, timing on new contract awards and on-contract growth decisions attributable to the ongoing effects of COVID. We expect a number of these events to become tailwinds for 2021.  
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins were 11.3%, 30 basis points higher than the prior year period. Our robust margin this quarter were driven by higher margins on new programs and favorable write-ups on existing programs due to strong program performance and reduced indirect rates.  
We delivered full year adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.8%, matching the top end of guidance. This represents our fourth consecutive year exceeding our 10% or higher long-term target.  
After adjusting for the $81 million net gain from the VirnetX legal matter and our estimated COVID-19 impacts, adjusted EBITDA margins would have been 10.4%, which is comparable to our 2019 performance.  
Fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.63 grew $0.12 over the prior year period. Contributions from strong program performance and increased volume on existing and new programs were the primary drivers of the 8% growth year-over-year.  
We exited the year with non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.83, a 13% increase over 2019 and at the upper end of our guidance range.  
Cash used in operating activities was $52 million. As projected in the third quarter earnings call, the net cash outflows were driven by the full repayment of the accounts receivable monetization facility, resulting in 0 utilization of the facility at year-end. It is also worth noting that we completed $67 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter, delivering on our commitment to return value to our shareholders. Our remaining share repurchase authorization under the program is approximately 7 million shares.  
Full year operating cash flows of $1.3 billion benefited primarily from 2 nonrecurring items: the $81 million net receipt from the VirnetX legal matter and $123 million of CARES Act-deferred payroll taxes. These items, coupled with strong balance sheet management, higher labor utilization and the accelerated collection of receivables previously planned for 2021 drove a 34% increase over 2019, exceeding our previous guidance for operating cash flows. And you may recall that the original 2020 guide for operating cash flow was $1 billion.  
And to recap, the stronger cash from 2021 resulted from: first, that $123 million of CARES Act payroll tax deferral; two, net advance payments of $74 million; four -- excuse me, three, higher staff utilization of about $70 million; and three -- four, the VirnetX cash flow issue of $81 million that was a tailwind for cash flow in the year.  
Bookings of $3.3 billion for the quarter resulted in a 1.0x book-to-bill, with record ending backlog of $31.9 billion.  
For the year, we booked over $17.7 billion of net awards, reflecting a 23% increase over 2019 and driving a 1.4x book-to-bill for the year.  
And now for an overview of our segment results. Defense Solutions revenue increased 16.5% over the prior year quarter and contracted 1.6% organically. Driving the strong growth was the Dynetics acquisition and the ramping of new programs. This growth was partially offset by delays to new awards, such as the Navy NGEN and STAMP II contracts, material timing and reduced volume on legacy contracts. And for the full year, Defense Solutions grew 16.5% over 2019, including 1.7% organically.  
Non-GAAP operating margins in the Defense Solutions segment of 8.9% contracted 90 basis points from the prior year quarter. The primary drivers of this change were a reduction in program volumes and the successful settlement of an outstanding legal matter in the fourth quarter of 2019, which drove higher margins 1 year ago.  
Defense Solutions booked over $2.3 billion in net awards, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.2x for the quarter. For the full year, Defense Solutions booked nearly $9 billion in net awards, a 5% increase over the prior year and driving a 1.2x book-to-bill for the full year.  
With regard to our Defense Solutions segment M&A, we are very pleased with Dynetics' contribution to the segment. The business delivered on the annualized revenue commitment, and we are particularly pleased with Dynetics' pro forma full year growth rate of 50% as well as the business' positioning in the new year.  
In our Civil segment, revenue grew 5% over the prior year quarter and contracted 6.6% organically. The top line growth was driven by the acquisition of the security detection and automation businesses and new program wins. This increase was offset by reduced volumes on existing contracts and COVID 9 -- COVID-19 impacts to programs with our FAA and National Science Foundation customers.  
Civil non-GAAP operating margins of 12.3% increased 30 basis points over the prior year quarter. The primary drivers of the strong margins this quarter were product timing and mix, favorable net write-ups due to increased cost efficiencies on certain programs and reduced indirect rates. The Civil segment delivered full year non-GAAP operating margins of 11.7%, an 80-basis-point increase over the prior year.  
Civil recorded over $700 million in net bookings for the quarter, resulting at a 0.9x book-to-bill and a 2.2x book-to-bill for the full year.  
Turning to the segment's M&A. The SD&A Business was impacted by a longer than previously expected decline in air travel, resulting in lower revenue for the year. Despite the extended effects of the global pandemic, we are pleased with our technology and competitive positioning as the market begins its path to recovery during the latter half of 2021.  
And finally, turning to our Health segment. Health segment revenues contracted 2.5% over the prior year quarter. The reduction was driven by lower material purchases on certain CMS programs and new business delays, partially offset by COVID-19 impact recoveries, particularly in our medical exam business. On a full year basis and after adjusting for acquisition and divestiture activity, the Health segment grew approximately 1% organically.  
Our Health segment continues to be our hardest -- our highest-margin segment, generating non-GAAP operating margins of 18.5% in the quarter, a record high. This 250-basis-point increase over the prior year quarter was driven by favorable net write-ups due to risk avoidance on certain programs, strong program performance on existing contracts and lower volume of business investments on a commercial IT venture. For the full year, Health segment non-GAAP operating margins were in line with 2019, increasing 10 basis points to 14.4%.  
The Health segment saw approximately $230 million of net bookings in the quarter, driving a book-to-bill of 0.5x, with a full year book-to-bill of 1.1x.  
And before I transition to next year's guidance, I want to give you an update on where we stand versus the 3-year financial targets that we shared with you at our 2019 Investor Day event. With 2 years now in the books, our organic revenue growth is running at 5.5% CAGR versus the 5% target we laid out at Investor Day. Free cash flow conversion of 127% is well ahead of our 100%-or-better target. And adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.6% exceeds the 10% established floor.
As you may recall, we also had a $2.7 billion balanced cash deployment plan. And with 1 year to go, we've already deployed a total of $2.2 billion. As we head into 2021, our disciplined capital allocation philosophy remains the same. We remain committed to being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment-grade rating, returning a quarterly dividend to our shareholders, reinvesting for growth both organically and inorganically and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner.  
Now on to our 2021 guidance, which does not include the Gibbs & Cox deal that we announced this morning. And as we've done in the past, we will provide an update at our next quarterly earnings conference call after the receipt of regulatory approvals and deal closing.
For 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $13.7 billion to $14.1 billion, reflecting growth in the range of 11% to 15% over 2020. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to grow more than 10% organically. This organic growth is driven by 3 factors: the contributions from contracts that successfully cleared protests, such as Navy NGEN and STAMP II; the accelerated recovery in our medical exam business; and growth from acquisitions and additional new business, including our most recent Niflec win in the Health segment.  
We expect adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.3% to 10.5% for the year. After adjusting for the $81 million net gain realized in 2020 from the VirnetX legal matter and the estimated COVID-19 impacts, 2021 adjusted EBITDA margins are consistent with 2020.  
We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS between $6.15 and $6.45 on the basis of 144 million shares outstanding.  
We expect operating cash flow in 2021 of at least 80 -- $850 million. This guidance reflects increased net income in 2021 and also incorporates the partial repayment of $65 million in 2020 CARES Act payroll tax deferrals, $50 million in burn down of the prior year's customer advances and $170 million of increased working capital to support 2021's top line growth.  
For additional context, the business has delivered 120% free cash flow conversion of net income across the 3-year time frame of 2018 through 2020. We expect to deliver above 100% conversion across comparable time intervals going forward.  
And one other item to note. While we may utilize our accounts receivable monetization facility from time to time for short-term or strategic actions, our 2021 operating cash flow guidance does not include any contribution from the facility that was established in early 2020.  
Now a couple of other comments to help you with modeling 2021. We expect net interest expense of approximately $179 million excluding transaction-related expenses.  
We also expect a slightly higher non-GAAP tax rate in 2021 of 22%.  
Capital expenditures are targeted at approximately $170 million, a 7% decrease from 2020. As you may recall, 2020 capital expenditures were elevated due to the real estate investment costs associated with the build-out of our new headquarters and other real estate optimization activities. Our normalized go-forward run rate for -- excuse me, for CapEx is targeted at below 1.5% of revenue.  
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob so we can take some questions."

When we raised our guidance, we had Navy NextGen was in the Court of Federal Claims. And we -- Court of Federal Claims is a little bit unpredictable, unlike the GAO process, which has a rigorous calendar and is kind of a 99-day thing. And it was our best estimate that the court of federal claims would rule, frankly, before the Thanksgiving holiday. I mean, at one time we thought it would actually happen in the second week of November. That did not happen. We didn't get a ruling out of the court of federal claims until December. So that delayed the start-up of the NextGen program by at least 1 month, maybe more.  
And then the other thing that happened, with this third wave of COVID, which I think COVID is very difficult to predict, our indirect costs went down even further as we went back to mandatory telework. And we saw our overhead and G&A costs go down even further than we had anticipated. And because about half of our portfolio is a cost-type contract, when we see a reduction in cost, it pulls revenue down with it. And those were the 2 major drivers. Maybe I'll turn it over to Jim if he wants to add some more color."

A lot of people don't know. We've always made the food that goes into space out of the NASA food lab at Johnson Space Center. 
 
Specifically about the lander program, which is I think where you'd like me to focus, we are at the end of what we call the base space contract, where we have done a preliminary design on our lander configuration. We have received a 2-month extension from the customer as they go about their competitive evaluation of the 3 bidders.

There's a significant construction project that we would have been doing now that has been deferred to a later year when COVID will largely have abated or be gone and not considered a risk of bringing COVID down to the Antarctic. 
Another example is, I mean, obviously, we've talked about the impact on the SD&A Business, where while we've had a revenue impact there, we're working to consolidate operations, get our cost synergies and get the combined business to margins that are well above where the pro forma had been on the acquisition date. 
The other COVID impacts, we're still recovering and getting to the what would be higher-than-normal volumes in the medical exam business. So that business has a lot of backlog to run off and that is included in our view of 2021. 
And then the places where we're not seeing a lingering impact, a significant lingering impact, is that in our intelligence business, the customers there are largely, not 100%, but they're getting pretty close to it.

And so we put that into our guidance. There is some discussion",275,"Yes. Let me touch on some of the strategics then Jim can walk you through the details. 
First, we think we understand what the Biden administration is going to do on the payroll tax deferral. And so we put that into our guidance. There is some discussion that they may defer it. If so, that could be a positive, about -- we have $123 million in the deferral if they decide to defer it another year, not in the $1.9 trillion, but there's a subsequent bill that's likely to come, so that could be a nonrecurring item. 
On the asset-backed program, the accounts receivable, we use that when it's advantageous based upon cost of borrowing, right? And that's really what the facility is there for as opposed to like a revolver or commercial paper program or using a 364-day facility. So that goes in and out depending upon that advantageous interest rate. 
But the overall cash story really was we had a great fourth quarter, and we had some advanced payments. We got paid. We got -- had some nonrecurrings. And we far exceeded what we thought we would achieve in fourth quarter. And as a result, some of what would have been in 2021 happened in 2020. And we tried to take you through that reversal. 
And then this 10% to 15% growth that we expect next year requires working capital. We're a capital-light business model, but we still have working capital. And so when we grow just the difference between liabilities and assets, requires us to fund, and that comes out of cash.
I don't know, Jim, you want to add more color?"

The other is customer advanced payments. We're 2 consecutive years now ending the year with previously unforecast big customer advanced payment balances. And we can forecast how we're working those off, but that could also represent some upside to operating cash flow when we look at it this time next year."

Chris will succeed Jim Reagan, who has chosen to retire following a long and distinguished career, in particular, the last 6 years as my good friend and business partner. I'll have a few remarks on this transition before I hand the call over to Jim. 
But first, let's jump into the quarter. First quarter results reflect the perseverance focus and tremendous execution of our employees and business partners. New quarterly record levels of revenue, non-GAAP EPS and backlog were achieved and significant organic growth was delivered across all business segments. This early momentum favorably positions Leidos to deliver on our full year financial commitments. Revenues for the quarter were $3.3 billion, up 14.7% from the prior year and up 9% organically, underscoring our accelerated recovery from last year's pandemic headwinds and the early ramp of new business wins. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.7%, up 240 basis points compared to the prior year period reflects strong program performance and the resolution of the longstanding MSA legal matter, which together delivered 45% growth on non-GAAP EPS of $1.73 for the quarter. 
Net bookings of $3.8 billion resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.2x and 1.3x on a trailing 12-month basis. This increase, driven by success in both our Solutions and Health segments, established a record backlog of $32.6 billion for a 13th consecutive quarter, providing greater clarity and confidence in near-term revenue growth expectations. 
I will now touch on a few of the major wins we received in the quarter,that underpin our growth in backlog. In the Health segment, the company was awarded a new prime contract to provide nonmedical counseling to military service members and their families through the Military and Family Life Counseling program, known as MFLC. This important work will be conducted at approximately 100 U.S. military installations or nearby civilian communities. We currently estimate revenues will be approximately $1 billion over the potential 7-year life of the program. This new award is especially timely with May being Mental Health Awareness Month. Military members and their families experience unique stresses. These include fears for the safety of the service member and feeling anxious or overwhelmed by deployment-related challenges and realities. Nearly 1 in 4 active duty service members show signs of a mental health condition. Children of service members are especially vulnerable. 1/3 of children with a deployed parent have psychological challenges such as depression, anxiety and behavior disorders. Through our work on the MFLC program, we provide confidential counseling to alleviate stresses and enhance military members and their family's ability to cope with these challenges. Counselors aim to prevent the escalation of stress into harmful conditions. About 1/4 of our employees are veterans. So this program is meaningful to us on many levels. 
Next, in the Civil segment, the company was awarded a prime contract by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to provide multi-energy portal systems for nonintrusive inspection of commercial vehicles at land and sea ports of entry. 
Under the contract, Leidos will integrate, deploy and train CBP staff to use its VACIS MEP with low-energy backscatter and high energy transmission cargo inspection system. The multiple award IDIQ contract has a total value of $480 million and a 5-year base period of performance and options up to 10 years of exercise. 
And in the Defense Solutions segment, the company was awarded a prime contract by the Naval Undersea Warfare Center to provide engineering, technical and management services for the Naval Array technical support center. Leidos will be responsible for production engineering, technical and logistics support of the U.S. Navy and foreign governments towed array assets. This single-award IDIQ contract is a total estimated value of $149 million. 
Finally, the company was awarded contracts valued at $822 million if all options are exercised by U.S. national security and intelligence clients. Though the specific nature of many of these contracts is classified, they all encompass mission-critical services that help to counter global threats and strengthen national security. 
Turning now to several notable accomplishments and events that took place in the quarter. We closed the 1901 Group acquisition in January, and as anticipated, the business is being levered across all of our business segments in both the performance of backlog programs and new program bids. The inclusion of 1901 Group's cloud-based solutions and fully integrated service delivery platform will enhance performance on our customers' important missions and continue to differentiate Leidos' value proposition across the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets we serve. 
Furthermore, as we shared with you on the February call, the Gibbs & Cox acquisition is nearing completion with yesterday's expiration of the HSR waiting period. With that gate cleared, we now expect the deal to close later in this month. 
Also, I want to take a moment to highlight the ongoing significant progress with the DoD Healthcare Management Systems Modernization program, otherwise known as DHMSM. The MHS Genesis electronic health record system is now 30% deployed and is currently live and operational at more than 42 military treatment facility commands across the country with nearly 41,000 active users. 
Notably, during this unprecedented global health care crisis, the system has provided advanced capabilities to support clinicians and advise -- and providers, including 24/7 access to medical and dental records and effectively tracking COVID-19 cases and mass vaccinations. Since its initial award, the program has been expanded to include the United States Coast Guard and the National Guard Reserve. We remain on schedule to deliver MHS Genesis by the end of calendar year 2023. 
Shifting to the macro environment. While we are still awaiting the release of the President's 2022 detailed budget request and subsequent multiyear defense projections, we are encouraged by last month's release of the high-level budget request. While the recommended defense funding level was in line with our expectations, our innovative technology and strategic investments remain squarely aligned with the administration's prioritization of certain critical need areas such as digital modernization, cybersecurity, autonomy and hypersonics. 
Additionally, we are very pleased with the proposed 16% increase in nondefense discretionary funding. This proposed growth supports the value proposition of our diverse business portfolio, which extends beyond defense and intelligence into the federal health and civil markets, including ports, borders and airport security. And while a continuing resolution in the fall is feeling like a near certainty, the typical annual disruptions may be muted given the no growth request for defense and the reality that under a CR, agencies generally continue to receive stop-gap funding in line with prior year's appropriation levels. 
With nearly $6 trillion of congressionally approved relief and stimulus funding since the start of the pandemic and a pending $2 trillion infrastructure request, we believe there could be additional opportunities for Leidos, particularly in our Civil segment. 
Areas of interest include airport and FAA upgrades as well as civil agency research and development. However, we will need to see the final details when they become available to better understand what is truly addressable over the multiyear infrastructure plan. 
With regard to the administration's decision to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by early September, Leidos has been directed to leave the region within the same time line. We currently estimate the revenue impact to be less than 1% of our Defense Solutions segment's current year revenue. 
While program level customer discussions are still evolving, our best estimates have been incorporated into the guidance that Jim will cover later in the call. 
As we recently marked the 1-year milestone of this devastating pandemic at the end of Q1, I want to provide you with another update on our Leidos Relief Foundation, and now it has been assisting Leidos employees who have been impacted by the virus. 
Since March of 2020, the fund has raised and distributed over $1.7 million through generous personal donations from employees, members of the executive team and the Board of Directors, including company match contributions. 
With those funds over 500 Leidos families who have suffered a COVID-19 hardship or loss of a loved one, have received financial assistance. The ongoing generosity of our colleagues is inspiring in a constant reminder of our share values, no matter the challenge. 
Finally, as I noted at the top of the call, I will close my prepared remarks with a few comments on the upcoming CFO transition here at Leidos. On behalf of our Board of Directors and management team, I want to thank Jim for his countless contributions to this company and wish him all the best in his planned retirement. Jim joined us 6 years ago and has been my steadfast adviser and business partner. Jim and his team has grown the business over 160%, built an investment-grade balance sheet and delivered significant total shareholder return. While Jim's contributions were critical in strategic planning and M&A deal structuring, for key transactions, value creation takes place in successful business transformations and building and nurturing culture and talent. And that is where Jim made the biggest impact for our employees, our customers and our shareholders. 
Thank you, Jim. However, I will save my goodbye since you'll be continuing to be an adviser through year-end. 
Meanwhile, I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors has elected Chris Cage as our next Chief Financial Officer, effective July 5 of this year, the beginning of our third quarter. Chris is a great example of the talent development and succession planning process here at Leidos. Chris joined the company in 1999 and many of you have had a chance to interact with him over the last several years as he has held a series of financial leadership roles with increasing responsibility, most recently as our Chief Accounting Officer. His financial experience and deep understanding of our business has prepared him and therefore, our company for continued success. 
Since it's May 4, before I turn the call over to Jim, I just wanted to say, May 4th be with you. I will now turn the call over to Jim Reagan for more details on our first quarter results and guidance."

Upon reflection, I've had a very fulfilling career. And these past 6 years here at Leidos have been truly special on account of all of the passionate and brilliant people who work here. I deeply value the relationships that we've built and the accomplishments that we have achieved together. I have great confidence in Chris' ability to lead the finance organization, and I look forward to working with him on a seamless transition. 
With that, I'll start by providing an overview of our first quarter 2021 results, followed by an update to the 2021 guidance. We are pleased with our strong start and growth momentum through the first quarter of 2021. First quarter revenue grew 14.7% over the prior year quarter and 8.9% organically. The increase in revenue was driven by the Dynetics, SD&A and 1901 Group acquisitions, growing on our existing growth on our existing programs and increased contribution from new programs. 
This solid start to the year aligns with our fourth quarter messaging and showcases our resilient program execution fundamentals with all segments delivering double-digit top line growth. 
Adjusted EBITDA margins of 11.7% grew 240 basis points over the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by program performance, mix and continued indirect cost management as well as the benefit from the successful settlement of the MSA legal matter. Excluding the positive impact of this $26 million legal reserve adjustment, adjusted EBITDA margins would have been approximately 11%. 
First quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.73 grew $0.54 over the prior year quarter driven by strong execution and organic growth as well as the settlement of the MSA legal matter. Without the settlement, non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $1.59, reflecting 34% growth year-over-year. Operating cash flows for the quarter were $239 million. Excluding the net proceeds from the accounts receivable monetization facility, operating cash flows would have been approximately $145 million. The decision to utilize the facility enabled us to buy back approximately $100 million of Leidos stock on the open market during the quarter, which aligns with our long-term balanced capital allocation strategy which consists of being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment-grade rating and returning a quarterly dividend to our shareholders, reinvesting for growth, both organically and inorganically and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner. 
Additionally, first quarter operating cash flow does not reflect any net cash hit from the MSA settlement which is expected to be realized in the second quarter. Bookings of $3.8 billion were strong across all segments, resulting in a 1.2x consolidated book-to-bill and record ending backlog of $32.6 billion. This represents 15% growth in backlog from the first quarter of 2020. 
Now for an overview of our segment results. Defense Solutions revenue increased 14.8% over the year -- year-over-year and 9.2% organically. Driving this strong growth was the Dynetics acquisition, The diligent execution of new programs, such as the CBP traveler processing and vetting software system and growth on existing programs. 
As a reminder, consistent with our policy, Dynetics revenue will now be included in our organic revenue calculation since we owned the business for a full year effective February 2021. 
Defense Solutions non-GAAP operating margins of 9.2% increased 240 basis points from the prior year period, reflecting strong program growth on certain contracts, reduced indirect expenditures and the recovery of a previously reserved international receivable. 
Defense Solutions booked nearly $2 billion in net awards for the quarter resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.0x and 1.3x on a trailing 12-month basis. 
In our Civil segment, revenues grew 17.1% from the prior year quarter and 6.1% organically. This growth was driven by the SD&A acquisition and volume growth on our existing programs. Non-GAAP operating margins in the Civil segment grew 110 basis points year-over-year driven by the net benefit from the MSA legal reserve adjustment, partially offset by lower margins on certain programs. Civil recorded approximately $700 million in net bookings for the quarter, resulting in a 0.9x book-to-bill and 1.1x on a trailing 12-month basis. 
And finally, turning to our Health segment. Health segment revenues increased 11.5% over the prior year quarter on both a gross and organic basis. This growth was driven by increased volumes on existing programs, including the continued backlog burn down in our medical exam business and timing of wave deployments on the DHMSM contract. 
Health segment non-GAAP operating margins were strong at 18.6%, an increase of 310 basis points over the prior year quarter, reflecting increased volume and growth on programs with our VA and DoD customers and reduced business investments on a commercial IT venture. We expect elevated levels of non-GAAP operating margin to continue through the first half of 2021 and return to normalized segment levels starting in the third quarter. 
The Health segment booked over $1.2 billion net awards driven by the successful win of the Military and Family Life Counseling contract, which resulted in a book-to-bill of 2.1x for the quarter and 1.6% on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Before I turn to guidance, I want to give you a quick update on the $7.7 billion Navy engine program. Transition and onboarding are going well. But due to the late fourth quarter resolution in the courts, the pace of the ramp was lighter than the first quarter. We expect the ramp to pick up considerably over the next 2 quarters, giving us confidence in the organic contribution in both this year and next, as outlined in last quarter's earnings call. 
Moving now to the remainder of the year. We are increasing our guidance for adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow to account for 2 distinct items. The settlement of the MSA legal matter and reduced share count resulting from our share repurchase during the quarter. Our guidance does not reflect the announced acquisition of Gibbs & Cox. As we've done in the past, we will provide an update in our next quarterly earnings call after the deal has closed. Our guidance range for revenue remains unchanged. We expect to deliver between $13.7 billion and $14.1 billion of revenue for the quarter -- for the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins for the year between 10.5% and 10.7%, a 20 basis point increase at the midpoint from the previous guidance, reflecting the benefit from the MSA legal matter. 
As a result of the $100 million share repurchase executed in the first quarter and the net gain from the legal matter, we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.20 to a range of $6.35 to $6.65 on the basis of 143 million shares outstanding. 
And finally, to account for the expected net proceeds from the MSA legal matter, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance by $25 million to at or above $875 million for the year. This updated guidance assumes no full year contribution from the accounts receivable monetization facility. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob so we can take some questions."

Now that said, we do have an R&D budget that we underspent a bit in the fourth quarter, and we expect that the level of R&D spending to tick up a bit through the balance of the year. And that's important for our long-term strategic priorities that are going to grow the business at strong levels going forward. 
Last thing that I would say is that there's -- as we think about the margin in defense for the rest of the year, it's going to continue to be strong, but I don't think you should necessarily be thinking of the Q1 level being something you'll see every quarter for the rest of the year."

Our largest customer is the VA, but we do them across the board. And during COVID, there was a period of time we were shut down in a period of time that our efficiency was diminished because of such distancing. And so there is an inventory or backlog of people who want these exams, and it grew pretty much through last year to -- really for us an all-time high. Our commitment has been to work literally nights and weekends to overstaff our clinics to work off the backlog and we're benefiting in this quarter by that, although we did have some weather in Texas and other states that tamped our quarter down just a little bit. But we think it will take us into the third quarter before we get back to a normal run rate. And that's our best estimate today, Cai. And we look at that -- well, the team looks at it every day. I look at it -- Jim and I look at it on a weekly basis, and we look at it by region and by type of exam. But we're making good progress. The backlog is significant, and we think it's probably going to affect third quarter as well. And this is all positive, by the way, as it was severely negative a year ago. And we talked through that a year ago. 
As we think about the increase in the budget, and about all we know at this point, Cai, is what agencies look like they're getting the increase. And we're all waiting for the PB to come out. But it does look like these are agencies for which we have a significant presence and significant heritage contracts. So it's civil infrastructure. It's also some health. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there's going to be ports and borders and airports, FAA infrastructure. Those seem to be prime. There's probably going to be some roads and bridges, which is not really all that relevant to us. We think there may be some smart cities, smart highways And we do have some contracts with Department of Transportation. So we may benefit there. But the details are yet to be revealed. And when we're on the call next quarter, we will have the budget, and we'll be able to address those better than. But thanks for your question, Cai."

There are some politicians that we talk to who say, it's -- I assume it's sequester and it's a tit for tat. So if you're going to take Civil up, you have to take Defense up. I don't think that's exactly where we're going to land. I think we're probably going to have a higher growth number on Civil than Defense. By the way, the defense number, depending upon whether you call it 704 or 715 or 753 does include the pay raise and now OCO in the base budget. So if you look at it from that standpoint, the overall, you could say has some downward pressure. The areas that we compete, we view as just generally flat. We are, though, I think when the dust settles, and we get through the CR, we get a bill are expecting maybe a high single, low double-digit increase on the civil side. And that's going to benefit our health and our civil group. We've already, as you would expect, put teams together to try to anticipate where those funds are going to be spent and to make sure that we're doing the prep work to get ready to provide customers value on programs that they're going to come forward with. We actually think cybersecurity is a good area for us. We think DHS, what's called the CSA, which is their cybersecurity office, which tends to deal with cybersecurity in the dot-com space. We expect them both to get money in the base bill and money in the infrastructure bill. So cybersecurity overall looks like a good place to be. Thanks, Gavin."

It's always hard to call trends, and I'm not sure we've seen because not all of the officials have even been confirmed on the Biden administration.

And we will see dividends of that in quarters to come. But the performance at Dynetics is really solid, and they continue to win programs in their relevant area. And our hypersonic glide body facility is up and running. I was down there 2 weeks ago, 3 weeks ago. It's gone classified. We actually have parts that we're building. And really, across the board, Dynetics is going well. 
I will give you a little bit of insight on HLS. I can't give you much. So there were 3 bidders, 2 of which everybody in the country knows and us. And the contract was given to SpaceX. And upon our debrief and our review, we felt that things needed a closer look, and so we did file a protest. And I'm not going to disclose a lot of what's in our protest. There is some stuff out on the web. There was actually a good article written out of the Washington Post that I would refer you to, and I would also caution that the Washington Post is owned by one of the companies that was a competitor. But I still thought that the article was very thoughtful and is a good basis of trying to understand what's going on in the HLS program. And because a protest is really sort of -- it's not quite a lawsuit, but certainly a dispute with a customer. I'd just rather not comment at length on our protest, but they typically last about 99 days. And so in a couple of months, we will see what comes out of the HLS program."

Chris will succeed Jim Reagan, who has chosen to retire following a long and distinguished career, in particular, the last 6 years as my good friend and business partner. I'll have a few remarks on this transition before I hand the call over to Jim.  
But first, let's jump into the quarter. First quarter results reflect the perseverance focus and tremendous execution of our employees and business partners. New quarterly record levels of revenue, non-GAAP EPS and backlog were achieved and significant organic growth was delivered across all business segments. 
This early momentum favorably positions Leidos to deliver on our full year financial commitments. Revenues for the quarter were $3.3 billion, up 14.7% from the prior year and up 9% organically, underscoring our accelerated recovery from last year's pandemic headwinds and the early ramp of new business wins. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.7%, up 240 basis points compared to the prior year period reflects strong program performance and the resolution of the longstanding MSA legal matter, which together delivered 45% growth on non-GAAP EPS of $1.73 for the quarter.  
Net bookings of $3.8 billion resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.2x and 1.3x on a trailing 12-month basis. 
This increase, driven by success in both our Solutions and Health segments, established a record backlog of $32.6 billion for a 13th consecutive quarter, providing greater clarity and confidence in near-term revenue growth expectations.  
I will now touch on a few of the major wins we received in the quarter, that underpin our growth in backlog. In the Health segment, the company was awarded a new prime contract to provide nonmedical counseling to military service members and their families through the Military and Family Life Counseling program, known as MFLC. 
This important work will be conducted at approximately 100 U.S. military installations or nearby civilian communities. We currently estimate revenues will be approximately $1 billion over the potential 7-year life of the program. This new award is especially timely with May being Mental Health Awareness Month. 
Military members and their families experience unique stresses. These include fears for the safety of the service member and feeling anxious or overwhelmed by deployment-related challenges and realities.  Nearly 1 in 4 active duty service members show signs of a mental health condition. Children of service members are especially vulnerable. 
1/3 of children with a deployed parent have psychological challenges such as depression, anxiety and behavior disorders. Through our work on the MFLC program, we provide confidential counseling to alleviate stresses and enhance military members and their family's ability to cope with these challenges. 
Counselors aim to prevent the escalation of stress into harmful conditions. About 1/4 of our employees are veterans. So this program is meaningful to us on many levels.  
Next, in the Civil segment, the company was awarded a prime contract by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to provide multi-energy portal systems for nonintrusive inspection of commercial vehicles at land and sea ports of entry.  
Under the contract, Leidos will integrate, deploy and train CBP staff to use its VACIS MEP with low-energy backscatter and high energy transmission cargo inspection system. 
The multiple award IDIQ contract has a total value of $480 million and a 5-year base period of performance and options up to 10 years of exercise.  
And in the Defense Solutions segment, the company was awarded a prime contract by the Naval Undersea Warfare Center to provide engineering, technical and management services for the Naval Array Technical Support Center. 
Leidos will be responsible for production engineering, technical and logistics support of the U.S. Navy and foreign governments towed array assets. This single-award IDIQ contract is a total estimated value of $149 million.  
Finally, the company was awarded contracts valued at $822 million if all options are exercised by U.S. national security and intelligence clients. 
Though the specific nature of many of these contracts is classified, they all encompass mission-critical services that help to counter global threats and strengthen national security.  
Turning now to several notable accomplishments and events that took place in the quarter. We closed the 1901 Group acquisition in January, and as anticipated, the business is being levered across all of our business segments in both the performance of backlog programs and new program bids. 
The inclusion of 1901 Group's cloud-based solutions and fully integrated service delivery platform will enhance performance on our customers' important missions and continue to differentiate Leidos' value proposition across the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets we serve.  
Furthermore, as we shared with you on the February call, the Gibbs & Cox acquisition is nearing completion with yesterday's expiration of the HSR waiting period. With that gate cleared, we now expect the deal to close later in this month.  
Also, I want to take a moment to highlight the ongoing significant progress with the DoD Healthcare Management Systems Modernization program, otherwise known as DHMSM. 
The MHS GENESIS electronic health record system is now 30% deployed and is currently live and operational at more than 42 military treatment facility commands across the country with nearly 41,000 active users.  
Notably, during this unprecedented global health care crisis, the system has provided advanced capabilities to support clinicians and advise -- and providers, including 24/7 access to medical and dental records and effectively tracking COVID-19 cases and mass vaccinations. 
Since its initial award, the program has been expanded to include the United States Coast Guard and the National Guard and Reserve. We remain on schedule to deliver MHS GENESIS by the end of calendar year 2023.  
Shifting to the macro environment. While we are still awaiting the release of the President's 2022 detailed budget request and subsequent multiyear defense projections, we are encouraged by last month's release of the high-level budget request. 
While the recommended defense funding level was in line with our expectations, our innovative technology and strategic investments remain squarely aligned with the administration's prioritization of certain critical need areas such as digital modernization, cybersecurity, autonomy and hypersonics.  
Additionally, we are very pleased with the proposed 16% increase in nondefense discretionary funding. This proposed growth supports the value proposition of our diverse business portfolio, which extends beyond defense and intelligence into the federal health and civil markets, including ports, borders and airport security. 
And while a continuing resolution in the fall is feeling like a near certainty, the typical annual disruptions may be muted given the no growth request for defense and the reality that under a CR, agencies generally continue to receive stop-gap funding in line with prior year's appropriation levels.  
With nearly $6 trillion of congressionally approved relief and stimulus funding since the start of the pandemic and a pending $2 trillion infrastructure request, we believe there could be additional opportunities for Leidos, particularly in our Civil segment.  
Areas of interest include airport and FAA upgrades as well as civil agency research and development. However, we will need to see the final details when they become available to better understand what is truly addressable over the multiyear infrastructure plan.  
With regard to the administration's decision to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by early September, Leidos has been directed to leave the region within the same time line. We currently estimate the revenue impact to be less than 1% of our Defense Solutions segment's current year revenue.  While program level customer discussions are still evolving, our best estimates have been incorporated into the guidance that Jim will cover later in the call.  
As we recently marked the 1-year milestone of this devastating pandemic at the end of Q1, I want to provide you with another update on our Leidos Relief Foundation, and now it has been assisting Leidos employees who have been impacted by the virus.  
Since March of 2020, the fund has raised and distributed over $1.7 million through generous personal donations from employees, members of the executive team and the Board of Directors, including company match contributions.  
With those funds over 500 Leidos families who have suffered a COVID-19 hardship or loss of a loved one, have received financial assistance. 
The ongoing generosity of our colleagues is inspiring in a constant reminder of our share values, no matter the challenge.  
Finally, as I noted at the top of the call, I will close my prepared remarks with a few comments on the upcoming CFO transition here at Leidos. 
On behalf of our Board of Directors and management team, I want to thank Jim for his countless contributions to this company and wish him all the best in his planned retirement. 
Jim joined us 6 years ago and has been my steadfast adviser and business partner. Jim and his team has grown the business over 160%, built an investment-grade balance sheet and delivered significant total shareholder return. 
While Jim's contributions were critical in strategic planning and M&A deal structuring, for key transactions, value creation takes place in successful business transformations and building and nurturing culture and talent.  And that is where Jim made the biggest impact for our employees, our customers and our shareholders.  
Thank you, Jim. However, I will save my goodbye since you'll be continuing to be an adviser through year-end.  Meanwhile, I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors has elected Chris Cage as our next Chief Financial Officer, effective July 5 of this year, the beginning of our third quarter. Chris is a great example of the talent development and succession planning process here at Leidos. Chris joined the company in 1999 and many of you have had a chance to interact with him over the last several years as he has held a series of financial leadership roles with increasing responsibility, most recently as our Chief Accounting Officer. His financial experience and deep understanding of our business has prepared him and therefore, our company for continued success.  
Since it's May 4, before I turn the call over to Jim, I just wanted to say, May 4th be with you. I will now turn the call over to Jim Reagan for more details on our first quarter results and guidance."

Upon reflection, I've had a very fulfilling career. And these past 6 years here at Leidos have been truly special on account of all of the passionate and brilliant people who work here. 
I deeply value the relationships that we've built and the accomplishments that we have achieved together. I have great confidence in Chris' ability to lead the finance organization, and I look forward to working with him on a seamless transition.  
With that, I'll start by providing an overview of our first quarter 2021 results, followed by an update to the 2021 guidance. We are pleased with our strong start and growth momentum through the first quarter of 2021. 
First quarter revenue grew 14.7% over the prior year quarter and 8.9% organically. The increase in revenue was driven by the Dynetics, SD&A and 1901 Group acquisitions, growing on our existing growth on our existing programs and increased contribution from new programs.  
This solid start to the year aligns with our fourth quarter messaging and showcases our resilient program execution fundamentals with all segments delivering double-digit top line growth.  
Adjusted EBITDA margins of 11.7% grew 240 basis points over the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by program performance, mix and continued indirect cost management as well as the benefit from the successful settlement of the MSA legal matter. Excluding the positive impact of this $26 million legal reserve adjustment, adjusted EBITDA margins would have been approximately 11%.  
First quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.73 grew $0.54 over the prior year quarter driven by strong execution and organic growth as well as the settlement of the MSA legal matter. Without the settlement, non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $1.59, reflecting 34% growth year-over-year. 
Operating cash flows for the quarter were $239 million. Excluding the net proceeds from the accounts receivable monetization facility, operating cash flows would have been approximately $145 million. 
The decision to utilize the facility enabled us to buy back approximately $100 million of Leidos stock on the open market during the quarter, which aligns with our long-term balanced capital allocation strategy which consists of being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment-grade rating and returning a quarterly dividend to our shareholders, reinvesting for growth, both organically and inorganically and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner.  
Additionally, first quarter operating cash flow does not reflect any net cash benefit from the MSA settlement which is expected to be realized in the second quarter. Bookings of $3.8 billion were strong across all segments, resulting in a 1.2x consolidated book-to-bill and record ending backlog of $32.6 billion. This represents 15% growth in backlog from the first quarter of 2020.  
Now for an overview of our segment results. Defense Solutions revenue increased 14.8% over the year -- year-over-year and 9.2% organically. Driving this strong growth was the Dynetics acquisition, the diligent execution of new programs, such as the CBP traveler processing and vetting software system and growth on existing programs.  
As a reminder, consistent with our policy, Dynetics revenue will now be included in our organic revenue calculation since we owned the business for a full year effective February 2021.  
Defense Solutions non-GAAP operating margins of 9.2% increased 240 basis points from the prior year period, reflecting strong program growth on certain contracts, reduced indirect expenditures and the recovery of a previously reserved international receivable.  Defense Solutions booked nearly $2 billion in net awards for the quarter resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.0x and 1.3x on a trailing 12-month basis.  
In our Civil segment, revenues grew 17.1% from the prior year quarter and 6.1% organically. This growth was driven by the SD&A acquisition and volume growth on our existing programs. 
Non-GAAP operating margins in the Civil segment grew 110 basis points year-over-year driven by the net benefit from the MSA legal reserve adjustment, partially offset by lower margins on certain programs. 
Civil recorded approximately $700 million in net bookings for the quarter, resulting in a 0.9x book-to-bill and 1.1x on a trailing 12-month basis.  
And finally, turning to our Health segment. Health segment revenues increased 11.5% over the prior year quarter on both a gross and organic basis. 
This growth was driven by increased volumes on existing programs, including the continued backlog burn down in our medical exam business and timing of wave deployments on the DHMSM contract.  
Health segment non-GAAP operating margins were strong at 18.6%, an increase of 310 basis points over the prior year quarter, reflecting increased volume and growth on programs with our VA and DoD customers and reduced business investments on a commercial IT venture. 
We expect elevated levels of non-GAAP operating margin to continue through the first half of 2021 and return to normalized segment levels starting in the third quarter.  
The Health segment booked over $1.2 billion net awards driven by the successful win of the Military and Family Life Counseling contract, which resulted in a book-to-bill of 2.1x for the quarter and 1.6% on a trailing 12-month basis.  
Before I turn to guidance, I want to give you a quick update on the $7.7 billion Navy NGEN program. Transition and onboarding are going well. But due to the late fourth quarter resolution in the courts, the pace of the ramp was lighter than the first quarter. We expect the ramp to pick up considerably over the next 2 quarters, giving us confidence in the organic contribution in both this year and next, as outlined in last quarter's earnings call. 
Moving now to the remainder of the year. We are increasing our guidance for adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow to account for 2 distinct items. The settlement of the MSA legal matter and reduced share count resulting from our share repurchase during the quarter. Our guidance does not reflect the announced acquisition of Gibbs & Cox. 
As we've done in the past, we will provide an update in our next quarterly earnings call after the deal has closed. Our guidance range for revenue remains unchanged. We expect to deliver between $13.7 billion and $14.1 billion of revenue for the quarter -- for the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins for the year between 10.5% and 10.7%, a 20 basis point increase at the midpoint from the previous guidance, reflecting the benefit from the MSA legal matter. 
As a result of the $100 million share repurchase executed in the first quarter and the net gain from the legal matter, we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.20 to a range of $6.35 to $6.65 on the basis of 143 million shares outstanding. 
And finally, to account for the expected net proceeds from the MSA legal matter, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance by $25 million to at or above $875 million for the year. This updated guidance assumes no full year contribution from the accounts receivable monetization facility. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob so we can take some questions."

And Sheila, as you know, our Health Group has traditionally been our highest margin and our highest growth area, and it's not surprising to us that others have seen the market as attractive as we have. 
And the interesting thing about the Health market is it's always been highly competitive. And whether it's 1 of our competitors getting into 1 of our traditional businesses, it's just changing the name of the competitor. And it is a very much a commercial world. 
And now we see the Biden administration, maybe the human infrastructure bill as it comes to pass, is continuing to increase the spend. 
And we think it raises the importance of agencies like CMS and Social Security. And that's going to attract maybe some new competitors and maybe some nontraditional competitors, which in our strategic view of the market, we have always expected. 
And we believe we are successful in that market because we offer a value-added service to our customers. And we are, if you will, sharpening our tools and getting ready for what we think will be a significant growth in the top line in the market overall."

I think more fundamentally, the business has performed well on an execution basis. 
Companies with portfolios of our size always have a program or 2 that are not making their planned margins, but the execution of the Defense group has been going pretty well, including the strong management of indirect cost, which has also been something that's provided them with a lift. 
Now that said, we do have an R&D budget that we underspent a bit in the fourth quarter, and we expect that the level of R&D spending to tick up a bit through the balance of the year. And that's important for our long-term strategic priorities that are going to grow the business at strong levels going forward. 
Last thing that I would say is that there's -- as we think about the margin in defense for the rest of the year, it's going to continue to be strong, but I don't think you should necessarily be thinking of the Q1 level is being something you'll see every quarter for the rest of the year."

Our largest customer is the VA, but we do them across the Board. 
And during COVID, there was a period of time we were shut down in a period of time that our efficiency was diminished because of social distancing. And so there is an inventory or backlog of people who want these exams, and it grew pretty much through last year to -- really for us an all-time high. 
Our commitment has been to work literally nights and weekends to overstaff our clinics to work off the backlog and we're benefiting in this quarter by that, although we did have some weather in Texas and other states that tamped our quarter down just a little bit. But we think it will take us into the third quarter before we get back to a normal run rate. And that's our best estimate today, Cai. 
And we look at that -- well, the team looks at it every day. I look at it -- Jim and I look at it on a weekly basis, and we look at it by region and by type of exam. But we're making good progress. The backlog is significant, and then we think it's probably going to affect third quarter as well. And this is all positive, by the way, as it was severely negative a year ago. And we talked through that a year ago. 
As we think about the increase in the budget, and about all we know at this point, Cai, is what agencies look like they're getting the increase. And we're all waiting for the PB to come out. But it does look like these are agencies for which we have a significant presence and significant heritage contracts. So it's Civil infrastructure. It's also some Health. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there's going to be ports and borders and airports, FAA infrastructure. 
Those seem to be prime. There's probably going to be some roads and bridges, which is not really all that relevant to us. We think there may be some smart cities, smart highways and we do have some contracts with Department of Transportation. So we may benefit there. 
But the details are yet to be revealed. And when we're on the call next quarter, we will have the budget, and we'll be able to address those better than. But thanks for your question, Cai."

And if Senator, Manchin from West Virginia, who has some influence. I think they'll come down a little bit and defense may go up. 
There are some politicians that we talk to who say, it's -- I assume it's sequester and it's a tit for tat. So if you're going to take Civil up, you have to take Defense up. I don't think that's exactly where we're going to land. I think we're probably going to have a higher growth number on Civil than Defense. 
By the way, the Defense number, depending upon whether you call it 704 or 715 or 753 does include the pay raise and now OCO in the base budget. So if you look at it from that standpoint, the overall, you could say has some downward pressure. The areas that we compete, we view as just generally flat. 
We are, though, I think when the dust settles, and we get through the CR, we get a bill are expecting maybe a high single, low double-digit increase on the civil side. And that's going to benefit our Health and our Civil group. We've already, as you would expect, put teams together to try to anticipate where those funds are going to be spent and to make sure that we're doing the prep work to get ready to provide customers value on programs that they're going to come forward with. 
We actually think cybersecurity is a good area for us. We think DHS, what's called the CSA, which is their cybersecurity office, which tends to deal with cybersecurity in the dot-com space. We expect them both to get money in the base bill and money in the infrastructure bill. So cybersecurity overall looks like a good place to be. Thanks, Gavin."

Where frankly, the risk of performance is on us, and then we can invest and we can put in RPAs or something to drive more efficiency in the contract. 
With something we call a cost-based contract, we're kind of limited on the earnings potential based upon the fee that we did on the contract. And with fixed price, we -- again, we are almost immediately rewarded for technology and innovation on the contract. 
It's always hard to call trends, and I'm not sure we've seen because not all of the officials have even been confirmed on the Biden administration. I wouldn't say that we have seen a trend away from T&M. When you started, I thought you're going to talk about OTAs, and I would simply say OTAs are alive and well, and I don't see that changing. 
If -- and maybe this is wishful thinking, I would like to see the customers go to more fixed price because I think it fix their cost, so they don't have to worry about year-over-year plus ops.

We would expect this administration will spend a lot of money on renewables. And we see the charter and the work and the National Energy Technology Lab really growing as we think about wind and solar and hydro. And so that will grow. And then there are a lot of other places. We do work on the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. 
And really across the board, we do some work for the Army up in Fort Detrick, in the medical field.

And more so overseas where funding is tied to the ticket surcharges. So we're going to be below our business case when we bought the L3 business for this year. 
That being said, in the U.S., we continue to see strong activity by TSA and customs and border patrol in buying equipment because in the U.S., the purchasing dollars are really not tied to volume. They're tied to the federal budget. 
And as I said in my prepared remarks, we got an award on VACIS, we had got an award on rail at the border. We are bidding on upgrading, adding something called CT at the checkpoint at major airports. We actually have a prototype in demo at Dulles. If you come and visit us, you will likely -- well, if you leave from here, you will go through our CT at the checkpoint scanner at Dulles Airport. 
And we would expect some of the infrastructure dollars out of the stimulus bill to be spent on ports and borders, maybe some on airport, and we're already looking at those opportunities.

First of all, the Dynetics integration and the team is going really well. 
Their growth on a stand-alone basis is really eye watering. And we've integrated our Leidos Innovation Center into Dynetics to better cross-fertilize our technology with their technology. And that is really created a lot of excitement. 
And we will see dividends of that in quarters to come. But the performance at Dynetics is really solid, and they continue to win programs in their relevant area. And our hypersonic glide body facility is up and running. I was down there 2 weeks ago, 3 weeks ago. It's gone classified. We actually have parts that we're building. And really, across the board, Dynetics is going well. 
I will give you a little bit of insight on HLS. I can't give you much. So there were 3 bidders, 2 of which everybody in the country knows and us. And the contract was given to SpaceX. And upon our debrief and our review, we felt that things needed a closer look, and so we did file a protest. And I'm not going to disclose a lot of what's in our protest. There is some stuff out on the web. 
There was actually a good article written out of the Washington Post that I would refer you to, and I would also caution that the Washington Post is owned by one of the companies that was a competitor. But I still thought that the article was very thoughtful and is a good basis of trying to understand what's going on in the HLS program. 
And because a protest is really sort of -- it's not quite a lawsuit, but certainly a dispute with a customer. I'd just rather not comment at length on our protest, but they typically last about 99 days. And so in a couple of months, we will see what comes out of the HLS program."

Chris will succeed Jim Reagan, who has chosen to retire following a long and distinguished career, in particular, the last 6 years as my good friend and business partner. I'll have a few remarks on this transition before I hand the call over to Jim.  
But first, let's jump into the quarter. First quarter results reflect the perseverance focus and tremendous execution of our employees and business partners. New quarterly record levels of revenue, non-GAAP EPS and backlog were achieved and significant organic growth was delivered across all business segments. 
This early momentum favorably positions Leidos to deliver on our full year financial commitments. Revenues for the quarter were $3.3 billion, up 14.7% from the prior year and up 9% organically, underscoring our accelerated recovery from last year's pandemic headwinds and the early ramp of new business wins. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.7%, up 240 basis points compared to the prior year period reflects strong program performance and the resolution of the longstanding MSA legal matter, which together delivered 45% growth on non-GAAP EPS of $1.73 for the quarter.  
Net bookings of $3.8 billion resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.2x and 1.3x on a trailing 12-month basis. 
This increase, driven by success in both our Solutions and Health segments, established a record backlog of $32.6 billion for a 13th consecutive quarter, providing greater clarity and confidence in near-term revenue growth expectations.  
I will now touch on a few of the major wins we received in the quarter, that underpin our growth in backlog. In the Health segment, the company was awarded a new prime contract to provide nonmedical counseling to military service members and their families through the Military and Family Life Counseling program, known as MFLC. 
This important work will be conducted at approximately 100 U.S. military installations or nearby civilian communities. We currently estimate revenues will be approximately $1 billion over the potential 7-year life of the program. This new award is especially timely with May being Mental Health Awareness Month. 
Military members and their families experience unique stresses. These include fears for the safety of the service member and feeling anxious or overwhelmed by deployment-related challenges and responsibilities.  Nearly 1 in 4 active duty service members show signs of a mental health condition. Children of service members are especially vulnerable. 
1/3 of children with a deployed parent have psychological challenges such as depression, anxiety and behavior disorders. Through our work on the MFLC program, we provide confidential counseling to alleviate stresses and enhance military members and their family's ability to cope with these challenges. 
Counselors aim to prevent the escalation of stress into harmful conditions. About 1/4 of our employees are veterans. So this program is meaningful to us on many levels.  
Next, in the Civil segment, the company was awarded a prime contract by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to provide multi-energy portal systems for nonintrusive inspection of commercial vehicles at land and sea ports of entry.  
Under the contract, Leidos will integrate, deploy and train CBP staff to use its VACIS MEP with low-energy backscatter and high energy transmission cargo inspection system. 
The multiple award IDIQ contract has a total value of $480 million and a 5-year base period of performance and options up to 10 years if exercised.  
And in the Defense Solutions segment, the company was awarded a prime contract by the Naval Undersea Warfare Center to provide engineering, technical and management services for the Naval Array Technical Support Center. 
Leidos will be responsible for production engineering, technical and logistics support of the U.S. Navy and foreign governments towed array assets. This single-award IDIQ contract has a total estimated value of $149 million.  
Finally, the company was awarded contracts valued at $822 million if all options are exercised by U.S. national security and intelligence clients. 
Though the specific nature of many of these contracts is classified, they all encompass mission-critical services that help to counter global threats and strengthen national security.  
Turning now to several notable accomplishments and events that took place in the quarter. We closed the 1901 Group acquisition in January, and as anticipated, the business is being levered across all of our business segments in both the performance of backlog programs and new program bids. 
The inclusion of 1901 Group's cloud-based solutions and fully integrated service delivery platform will enhance performance on our customers' important missions and continue to differentiate Leidos' value proposition across the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets we serve.  
Furthermore, as we shared with you on the February call, the Gibbs & Cox acquisition is nearing completion with yesterday's expiration of the HSR waiting period. With that gate cleared, we now expect the deal to close later in this month.  
Also, I want to take a moment to highlight the ongoing significant progress with the DoD Healthcare Management Systems Modernization program, otherwise known as DHMSM. 
The MHS GENESIS electronic health record system is now 30% deployed and is currently live and operational at more than 42 military treatment facility commands across the country with nearly 41,000 active users.  
Notably, during this unprecedented global health care crisis, the system has provided advanced capabilities to support clinicians and advise -- and providers, including 24/7 access to medical and dental records and effectively tracking COVID-19 cases and mass vaccinations. 
Since its initial award, the program has been expanded to include the United States Coast Guard and the National Guard and Reserve. We remain on schedule to deliver MHS GENESIS by the end of calendar year 2023.  
Shifting to the macro environment. While we are still awaiting the release of the President's 2022 detailed budget request and subsequent multiyear defense projections, we are encouraged by last month's release of the high-level budget request. 
While the recommended defense funding level was in line with our expectations, our innovative technology and strategic investments remain squarely aligned with the administration's prioritization of certain critical need areas such as digital modernization, cybersecurity, autonomy and hypersonics.  
Additionally, we are very pleased with the proposed 16% increase in nondefense discretionary funding. This proposed growth supports the value proposition of our diverse business portfolio, which extends beyond defense and intelligence into the federal health and civil markets, including ports, borders and airport security. 
And while a continuing resolution in the fall is feeling like a near certainty, the typical annual disruptions may be muted given the no growth request for defense and the reality that under a CR, agencies generally continue to receive stop-gap funding in line with prior year's appropriation levels.  
With nearly $6 trillion of congressionally approved relief and stimulus funding since the start of the pandemic and a pending $2 trillion infrastructure request, we believe there could be additional opportunities for Leidos, particularly in our Civil segment.  
Areas of interest include airport and FAA upgrades as well as civil agency research and development. However, we will need to see the final details when they become available to better understand what is truly addressable over the multiyear infrastructure plan.  
With regard to the administration's decision to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by early September, Leidos has been directed to leave the region within the same time line. We currently estimate the revenue impact to be less than 1% of our Defense Solutions segment's current year revenue.  While program level customer discussions are still evolving, our best estimates have been incorporated into the guidance that Jim will cover later in the call.  
As we recently marked the 1-year milestone of this devastating pandemic at the end of Q1, I want to provide you with another update on our Leidos Relief Foundation, and how it has been assisting Leidos employees who have been impacted by the virus.  
Since March of 2020, the fund has raised and distributed over $1.7 million through generous personal donations from employees, members of the executive team and the Board of Directors, including company match contributions.  
With those funds over 500 Leidos families who have suffered a COVID-19 hardship or loss of a loved one, have received financial assistance. 
The ongoing generosity of our colleagues is inspiring and a constant reminder of our shared values, no matter the challenge.  
Finally, as I noted at the top of the call, I will close my prepared remarks with a few comments on the upcoming CFO transition here at Leidos. 
On behalf of our Board of Directors and management team, I want to thank Jim for his countless contributions to this company and wish him all the best in his planned retirement. 
Jim joined us 6 years ago and has been my steadfast adviser and business partner. Jim and his team has grown the business over 160%, built an investment-grade balance sheet and delivered significant total shareholder return. 
While Jim's contributions were critical in strategic planning and M&A deal structuring, for key transactions, value creation takes place in successful business transformations and building and nurturing culture and talent.  And that is where Jim made the biggest impact for our employees, our customers and our shareholders.  
Thank you, Jim. However, I will save my goodbye since you'll be continuing to be an adviser through year-end.  Meanwhile, I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors has elected Chris Cage as our next Chief Financial Officer, effective July 5 of this year, the beginning of our third quarter. Chris is a great example of the talent development and succession planning process here at Leidos. Chris joined the company in 1999 and many of you have had a chance to interact with him over the last several years as he has held a series of financial leadership roles with increasing responsibility, most recently as our Chief Accounting Officer. His financial experience and deep understanding of our business has prepared him and therefore, our company for continued success.  
Since it's May 4, before I turn the call over to Jim, I just wanted to say, May 4th be with you. I will now turn the call over to Jim Reagan for more details on our first quarter results and guidance."

Upon reflection, I've had a very fulfilling career. And these past 6 years here at Leidos have been truly special on account of all of the passionate and brilliant people who work here. 
I deeply value the relationships that we've built and the accomplishments that we have achieved together. I have great confidence in Chris' ability to lead the finance organization, and I look forward to working with him on a seamless transition.  
With that, I'll start by providing an overview of our first quarter 2021 results, followed by an update to the 2021 guidance. We are pleased with our strong start and growth momentum through the first quarter of 2021. 
First quarter revenue grew 14.7% over the prior year quarter and 8.9% organically. The increase in revenue was driven by the Dynetics, SD&A and 1901 Group acquisitions, growing on our existing growth on our existing programs and increased contribution from new programs.  
This solid start to the year aligns with our fourth quarter messaging and showcases our resilient program execution fundamentals with all segments delivering double-digit top line growth.  
Adjusted EBITDA margins of 11.7% grew 240 basis points over the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by program performance, mix and continued indirect cost management as well as the benefit from the successful settlement of the MSA legal matter. Excluding the positive impact of this $26 million legal reserve adjustment, adjusted EBITDA margins would have been approximately 11%.  
First quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.73 grew $0.54 over the prior year quarter driven by strong execution and organic growth as well as the settlement of the MSA legal matter. Without the settlement, non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $1.59, reflecting 34% growth year-over-year. 
Operating cash flows for the quarter were $239 million. Excluding the net proceeds from the accounts receivable monetization facility, operating cash flows would have been approximately $145 million. 
The decision to utilize the facility enabled us to buy back approximately $100 million of Leidos stock on the open market during the quarter, which aligns with our long-term balanced capital allocation strategy which consists of being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment-grade rating and returning a quarterly dividend to our shareholders, reinvesting for growth, both organically and inorganically and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner.  
Additionally, first quarter operating cash flow does not reflect any net cash benefit from the MSA settlement which is expected to be realized in the second quarter. Bookings of $3.8 billion were strong across all segments, resulting in a 1.2x consolidated book-to-bill and record ending backlog of $32.6 billion. This represents 15% growth in backlog from the first quarter of 2020.  
Now for an overview of our segment results. Defense Solutions revenue increased 14.8% over the year -- year-over-year and 9.2% organically. Driving this strong growth was the Dynetics acquisition, the diligent execution of new programs, such as the CBP traveler processing and vetting software system and growth on existing programs.  
As a reminder, consistent with our policy, Dynetics revenue will now be included in our organic revenue calculation since we owned the business for a full year effective February 2021.  
Defense Solutions non-GAAP operating margins of 9.2% increased 240 basis points from the prior year period, reflecting strong program growth on certain contracts, reduced indirect expenditures and the recovery of a previously reserved international receivable.  Defense Solutions booked nearly $2 billion in net awards for the quarter resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.0x and 1.3x on a trailing 12-month basis.  
In our Civil segment, revenues grew 17.1% from the prior year quarter and 6.1% organically. This growth was driven by the SD&A acquisition and volume growth on our existing programs. 
Non-GAAP operating margins in the Civil segment grew 110 basis points year-over-year driven by the net benefit from the MSA legal reserve adjustment, partially offset by lower margins on certain programs. 
Civil recorded approximately $700 million in net bookings for the quarter, resulting in a 0.9x book-to-bill and 1.1x on a trailing 12-month basis.  
And finally, turning to our Health segment. Health segment revenues increased 11.5% over the prior year quarter on both a gross and organic basis. 
This growth was driven by increased volumes on existing programs, including the continued backlog burn down in our medical exam business and timing of wave deployments on the DHMSM contract.  
Health segment non-GAAP operating margins were strong at 18.6%, an increase of 310 basis points over the prior year quarter, reflecting increased volume and growth on programs with our VA and DoD customers and reduced business investments on a commercial IT venture. 
We expect elevated levels of non-GAAP operating margin to continue through the first half of 2021 and return to normalized segment levels starting in the third quarter.  
The Health segment booked over $1.2 billion net awards driven by the successful win of the Military and Family Life Counseling contract, which resulted in a book-to-bill of 2.1x for the quarter and 1.6% on a trailing 12-month basis.  
Before I turn to guidance, I want to give you a quick update on the $7.7 billion Navy NGEN program. Transition and onboarding are going well. But due to the late fourth quarter resolution in the courts, the pace of the ramp was lighter than the first quarter. We expect the ramp to pick up considerably over the next 2 quarters, giving us confidence in the organic contribution in both this year and next, as outlined in last quarter's earnings call. 
Moving now to the remainder of the year. We are increasing our guidance for adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow to account for 2 distinct items. The settlement of the MSA legal matter and reduced share count resulting from our share repurchase during the quarter. Our guidance does not reflect the announced acquisition of Gibbs & Cox. 
As we've done in the past, we will provide an update in our next quarterly earnings call after the deal has closed. Our guidance range for revenue remains unchanged. We expect to deliver between $13.7 billion and $14.1 billion of revenue for the quarter -- for the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins for the year between 10.5% and 10.7%, a 20 basis point increase at the midpoint from the previous guidance, reflecting the benefit from the MSA legal matter. 
As a result of the $100 million share repurchase executed in the first quarter and the net gain from the MSA  legal matter, we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.20 to a range of $6.35 to $6.65 on the basis of 143 million shares outstanding. 
And finally, to account for the expected net proceeds from the MSA legal matter, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance by $25 million to at or above $875 million for the year. This updated guidance assumes no full year contribution from the accounts receivable monetization facility. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob so we can take some questions."

And now we see the Biden administration, maybe the human infrastructure bill as it comes to pass, is continuing to increase the spend. 
And we think it raises the importance of agencies like CMS and Social Security. And that's going to attract maybe some new competitors and maybe some nontraditional competitors, which in our strategic view of the market, we have always expected.

I think more fundamentally, the business has performed well on an execution basis. 
Companies with portfolios of our size always have a program or 2 that are not making their planned margins, but the execution of the Defense group has been going pretty well, including the strong management of indirect cost, which has also been something that's provided them with a lift. 
Now that said, we do have an R&D budget that we underspent a bit in the fourth quarter, and we expect that the level of R&D spending to tick up a bit through the balance of the year. And that's important for our long-term strategic priorities that are going to grow the business at strong levels going forward. 
Last thing that I would say is that there's -- as we think about the margin in defense for the rest of the year, it's going to continue to be strong, but I don't think you should necessarily be thinking of the Q1 level is being something you'll see every quarter for the rest of the year."

Our largest customer is the VA, but we do them across the Board. 
And during COVID, there was a period of time we were shut down and a period of time that our efficiency was diminished because of social distancing. And so there is an inventory or backlog of people who want these exams, and it grew pretty much through last year to -- really for us an all-time high. 
Our commitment has been to work literally nights and weekends to overstaff our clinics to work off the backlog and we're benefiting in this quarter by that, although we did have some weather in Texas and other states that tamped our quarter down just a little bit. But we think it will take us into the third quarter before we get back to a normal run rate. And that's our best estimate today, Cai. 
And we look at that -- well, the team looks at it every day. I look at it -- Jim and I look at it on a weekly basis, and we look at it by region and by type of exam. But we're making good progress. The backlog is significant, and then we think it's probably going to affect third quarter as well. And this is all positive, by the way, as it was severely negative a year ago. And we talked through that a year ago. 
As we think about the increase in the budget, and about all we know at this point, Cai, is what agencies look like they're getting the increase. And we're all waiting for the PB to come out. But it does look like these are agencies for which we have a significant presence and significant heritage contracts. So it's Civil infrastructure. It's also some Health. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there's going to be ports and borders and airports, FAA infrastructure.  Those seem to be prime. There's probably going to be some roads and bridges, which is not really all that relevant to us. We think there may be some smart cities, smart highways and we do have some contracts with Department of Transportation. So we may benefit there. 
But the details are yet to be revealed. And when we're on the call next quarter, we will have the budget, and we'll be able to address those better then. But thanks for your question, Cai."

And if Senator Manchin from West Virginia, who has some influence. I think they'll come down a little bit and defense may go up. 
There are some politicians that we talk to who say, it's -- I assume it's sequester and it's a tit for tat. So if you're going to take Civil up, you have to take Defense up. I don't think that's exactly where we're going to land. I think we're probably going to have a higher growth number on Civil than Defense. 
By the way, the Defense number, depending upon whether you call it 704 or 715 or 753 does include the pay raise and now OCO in the base budget. So if you look at it from that standpoint, the overall, you could say has some downward pressure. The areas that we compete, we view as just generally flat. 
We are, though, I think when the dust settles, and we get through the CR, and we get a bill are expecting maybe a high single, low double-digit increase on the civil side. And that's going to benefit our Health and our Civil group. We've already, as you would expect, put teams together to try to anticipate where those funds are going to be spent and to make sure that we're doing the prep work to get ready to provide customers value on programs that they're going to come forward with. 
We actually think cybersecurity is a good area for us. We think DHS, what's called the CSA, which is their cybersecurity office, which tends to deal with cybersecurity in the dot-com space.

Where frankly, the risk of performance is on us, and then we can invest and we can put in RPAs or something to drive more efficiency in the contract. 
With something we call a cost-based contract, we're kind of limited on the earnings potential based upon the fee that we bid on the contract. And with fixed price, we -- again, we are almost immediately rewarded for technology and innovation on the contract. 
It's always hard to call trends, and I'm not sure we've seen because not all of the officials have even been confirmed on the Biden administration. I wouldn't say that we have seen a trend away from T&M. When you started, I thought you're going to talk about OTAs, and I would simply say OTAs are alive and well, and I don't see that changing. 
If -- and maybe this is wishful thinking, I would like to see the customers go to more fixed price because I think it fix their cost, so they don't have to worry about year-over-year plus ops.

And we see the charter and the work and the National Energy Technology Lab really growing as we think about wind and solar and hydro. And so that will grow. And then there are a lot of other places.

That being said, in the U.S., we continue to see strong activity by TSA and customs and border patrol in buying equipment because in the U.S., the purchasing dollars are really not tied to volume. They're tied to the federal budget. 
And as I said in my prepared remarks, we got an award on VACIS, we had got an award on rail at the border. We are bidding on upgrading, adding something called CT at the checkpoint at major airports. We actually have a prototype in demo at Dulles. If you come and visit us, you will likely -- well, if you leave from here, you will go through our CT at the checkpoint scanner at Dulles Airport. 
And we would expect some of the infrastructure dollars out of the stimulus bill to be spent on ports and borders, maybe some on airport, and we're already looking at those opportunities.

Their growth on a stand-alone basis is really eye watering. And we've integrated our Leidos Innovation Center into Dynetics to better cross-fertilize our technology with their technology. And that has really created a lot of excitement. 
And we will see dividends of that in quarters to come. But the performance at Dynetics is really solid, and they continue to win programs in their relevant area. And our hypersonic glide body facility is up and running. I was down there 2 weeks ago, 3 weeks ago. It's gone classified. We actually have parts that we're building. And really, across the board, Dynetics is going well. 
I will give you a little bit of insight on HLS. I can't give you much. So there were 3 bidders, 2 of which everybody in the country knows and us. And the contract was given to SpaceX. And upon our debrief and our review, we felt that things needed a closer look, and so we did file a protest. And I'm not going to disclose a lot of what's in our protest. There is some stuff out on the web. 
There was actually a good article written out of the Washington Post that I would refer you to, and I would also caution that the Washington Post is owned by one of the companies that was a competitor. But I still thought that the article was very thoughtful and is a good basis of trying to understand what's going on in the HLS program. 
And because a protest is really sort of -- it's not quite a lawsuit, but certainly a dispute with a customer. I'd just rather not comment at length on our protest, but they typically last about 99 days. And so in a couple of months, we will see what comes out of the HLS program."

Our results in the second quarter reflect our leadership position in the government technology market. I am tremendously proud of the way Leidos has responded throughout the pandemic as our employees and business partners continually delivered for our customers and shareholders. While we remain vigilant with the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases, Leidos is stronger than ever, with new quarterly record levels of revenue and backlog, consistent with our industry-leading organic growth. 
As I look at the quarter, 4 messages stand out. First, our strong financial results demonstrate that our strategy is working. Second, our business development momentum is setting the stage for future growth. Third, we're effectively deploying capital to broaden our offerings in attractive markets. And fourth, we're building an engaged and effective workforce. I'll now drill down on each of these 4 key messages. 
Number one, our strong financial performance was highlighted by double-digit organic growth and adjusted EBITDA margins above our long-term target. Revenue for the quarter were $3.45 billion, up 18% from the prior year on a total basis and up 16% organically. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.4% were in line with guidance and above the long-term target we established 2 years ago. After adjusting for the onetime gain in the second quarter of 2020, non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 37%. These results didn't just happen. Rather they are a direct result of our strategy. We've differentiated ourselves within the market through scale, which creates a more competitive cost structure and expanded capability to take share and position in vital markets. We've also leveraged our cost structure to make key technology investments, which further separates us from our peers. 
Number two, our business development engine continued the momentum that is driving our industry-leading organic growth. We achieved net bookings of $3.8 billion in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1, our 14th consecutive quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1 or greater. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio is now 1.2. As a result, total backlog at the end of the quarter stood at a record $3 billion, which was up 9% on a year-over-year basis. 
In our Health segment, we were awarded a new fixed-price contract with a ceiling value of almost $1 billion to improve the health of military reservice before, during and after deployment. Under this contract, known as the Reserve Health Readiness Program, or RHRP, we'll provide physical, mental health and dental assessments along with laboratory and diagnostic services supported by a secure IT infrastructure and customer service call center. Americas more than 1 million reserve component personnel stand ready to support and defend our nation when it's called upon. It's our honor to support them. 
In our Defense Solutions segment, the Transportation Security Administration awarded us a $470 million prime contract to integrate transportation screening equipment at airports all around the country. Based on our policy, we only booked a small initial task order in the quarter, although we expect to achieve the full value over the life of the contract. This work is a reconfiguration of work we've been forming -- we've been performing for over 12 years. And we also maintain screening equipment for TSA at all U.S. federalized airports, helping TSA ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce as one of the core ways Leidos is making the world safer, healthier and more efficient. 
In our Civil segment, the Federal Aviation Administration notified us that they have given us initial tasking as part of a long-term extension for the continued systems integration sustainment and enhancement of the En Route Automation Modernization, or ERAM system. The ERAM system is critical for operations in the national aerospace system and at the 20 air route traffic control centers in the Continental U.S. We didn't book anywhere close to the $6.8 billion ceiling value, but it speaks to the confidence that the FAA has in Leidos. We expect to begin the 2022 government fiscal year with a continuing resolution, but customers will still be able to fund work in critical needs areas. Our positive outlook is bolstered by the level of proposal activity. At the end of the quarter, we had $49 billion in submits outstanding,of which $35 billion is new work for us. 
Number three, we're deploying capital to complete our offerings in attractive markets to spur profitable growth. In May, we completed the acquisition of Gibbs & Cox, which brings us world-class naval architecture, design and engineering services. They designed 68% of the Navy's current surface combatant fleet and are truly a national asset. This deal enhances how we're viewed across the Navy and opens up significant market opportunity for us. Our strategic planning process had identified maritime as an attractive market where we were underpenetrated. 
To enable synergies, especially around unmanned surface and subsurface systems, Gibbs & Cox will be combined with Leidos' Maritime Systems division and operate under Dynetics within the Defense Solutions segment. 
In addition, we're seeing early returns from our 1901 Group acquisition which we closed in January of this year. Most directly, 1901 is providing significant support to the NGEN program transition and operations. They've significkantly expanded their workforce, grown the current enterprise IT operations center in Virginia and accelerate the establishment of new N-GEN service desk locations in San Diego, Norfook and Boise. 1901's platform delivered IT services made them the best choice for the program's requirements in this area. 
1901 was also instrumental in securing a $125 million follow-on contract with the Bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives for managed IT services. 1901's strong customer relationships with the ATF, coupled with their efficient as-a-service delivery model, made them key to the bid and execution strategies. 
In addition into deploying capital to spurn growth, we were also committed to returning capital to shareholders. To that end, our Board just approved a 6% increase to the quarterly dividend. This increase reflects the confidence of the Board of Directors and the management team in the quality of our earnings and our ability to generate cash. 
Number four. This is a people business, and this quarter offered further proof that we are an employer of choice that can attract the workforce needed to meet our financial commitments. During the quarter, we hired more than 4,500 people. And at the end of the quarter, we were more than 42,000 strong. Our headcount grew 6% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. Our ability to attract top talent in this manner is important as we staff up to successfully execute the new programs. 
One of the reasons we are attractive to job applicants is that we invest in talent management and career development. We regularly review talent and plan development actions including rotations at all levels throughout the company. 
As an example, Executive Vice President, Jim Cantor, recently announced his intent to retire after his distinguished 31-year career at Leidos. This enabled us to reconfigure our team to optimize performance given our rapid growth and the changes in market priorities. I asked Vicki Shankh who is leading our intelligence group to assume the new role of Executive Vice President, Corporate Operations. In her new role, Vicki will drive operational performance and implementation of strategic functional initiatives. Roy Stevens who led business development and strategy succeeded Vicki as the President of the Intelligence Group. 
In addition, I asked Chief Human Resources Officer, Paul Angola, to lead a strategic effort to chart our way forward in the national security space market. These changes will help us prepare for an uncertain future. A few weeks ago, we kicked off the $1 million move-the-needle sweepstakes to encourage our employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and Hasson are coming back together. At the time, all of our facilities were open and all vaccinated individuals were able to work without a mask. A lot has changed in the past weeks. The highly contagious delta variant and the infection trends are disturbing. As we have throughout the pandemic, we'll comply with all CDC guidelines, and most of our facilities will require masks regardless of vaccination status. 
While we do not expect that our customers will be shutting down their offices again, we cannot be certain. In the face of that uncertainty, we have decided to keep our current forward guidance in place. and Chris will walk you through that in more detail. 
For me, part of returning to normal is being able to get together face-to-face with our investors and analysts. It is our intent to host an Investor Day in New York on October 7. We have a compelling story to tell, and we look forward to doing just that. We'll closely watch for COVID protocols from New York City and update you if our plans change. 
Finally, Frank Kendall has stepped down from our Board to serve as the Secretary of the Air Force. I want to thank Frank for his service to Leidos and more importantly, to the Air Force, the Department of Defense and the nation. 
I'll now turn the call over to Chris Cage. I'm delighted to have Chris step up to the CFO role and join us on these calls."

I've worked at Leidos for 23 years, and I've personally benefited from the forward-thinking developmental programs that Roger referenced earlier. My predecessor and Mentor, Jim Reagan, created a very strong team in set of processes and disciplines that I've had the opportunity to help shape over the last few years. 
Going forward, my initial areas of focus will be threefold: delivering on our financial commitments, integrating acquisitions and prioritizing spending on investments to execute our strategy. 
With that, let's jump right into the second quarter fiscal year 2021 results. Beginning with the income statement on Slide 5. I'll first run through the financial results at the corporate level, then turn to the segment level to address the primary revenue and profitability drivers. As Roger said, the highlight of the quarter was our organic growth, which is truly unprecedented in our industry at our scale. Revenue quarter were $3.45 billion, up 18% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding acquired revenues of $58 million, revenues increased 16% organically. 
Notably, revenues grew organically across all 3 reportable segments. The organic growth is somewhat inflated by the drop in our revenues last year as a result of the pandemic. when, for example, our VA disability exam business was almost entirely shut down. Even if we add back the $132 million direct pandemic effect in the prior year, organic revenue growth was still 11%. Adjusted EBITDA was $359 million for the second quarter, which was up 5% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from 11.8% to 10.4% over the same period. Excluding the VirnetX gain from the prior period, adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 140 basis points in the quarter. This was primarily due to strong program management, higher volumes on some fixed price programs and better direct labor utilization. Non-GAAP net income was $218 million for the second quarter, which was down 2% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.52, also down 2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. Excluding the impact of VirnetX came from last year's results, non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 37%. 
Our effective tax rate on non-GAAP income in the quarter was 24% compared to the 22% we anticipated for fiscal year 2021, this negatively impacted non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.04. The tax rate increase was primarily across our international business. The largest single driver was that in Q2, we recognized the full impact of a recently enacted increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate from 19% to 25%. 
Now for an overview of the segment results on Slide 6. Defense Solutions revenues increased by 14% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the acquisitions of 1901 Group and Gibbs & Cox, organic revenue was up 12%, primarily from ramping up recent contract wins such as NGEN and increased weapon systems development within Dynetics. Civil revenues increased 5% compared to the prior year quarter, with about half coming from the SD&A acquisition and half driven by increased demand on large programs such as Hanford site integration. 
Health revenues increased 62% compared to the prior year quarter, and all of that growth was organic. We had a large year-over-year increase on the [ DIMM Sum program ] as well as a nice ramp on the new Military and Family Life Counseling program, or MFLC. 
The largest increase, though, was in the VA disability examination business in our QTC subsidiary. Remember, this was the business hardest hit by the pandemic in the year ago quarter and now volumes are higher than ever as we continue to work through the backlog of exams. 
On the margin front, Defense Solutions non-GAAP operating income margin for the quarter came in at 8.3%, which was up 20 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Civil non-GAAP operating margin declined from 12.9% in the prior year quarter to 9.1% as we had fewer deliveries of our border and port security systems and airport screening systems. 
Finally, and most significantly, health non-GAAP operating income margin for the quarter was up to 17.8% compared to 5.3% in the prior year quarter. This quarter's strong margin performance benefited from the significantly increased revenue volume, but the year-over-year improvement was enabled by the strategic investments we made a year ago to keep our workforce in place and ready to meet the coming customer demand. 
Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $17 million and free cash flow, which is net of capital expenditures, was a usage of $4 million. During the second quarter, we settled the accounts receivable monetization program, which negatively affected our operating and free cash flow by $94 million. 
On a year-to-date basis, the AR monetization program is neutral to cash flow, and we do not plan to sell any more receivables. During the quarter, we used working capital to fund the start-up of new programs and the expansion of existing programs and drive strong organic growth. You can see this impact most clearly in the drawdown of advanced payments compared to last year. 
Cash generation from the business segments was right on plan for the first half of the year and actually ahead of last year. But that performance is overshadowed by onetime nonoperational cash benefits in the first half of 2020. These include $225 million from the AR monetization program; $85 million from VirnetX; $48 million in CARES Act tax deferrals; and $103 million in lower cash taxes, which is just a timing issue. 
During the second quarter, we paid down $27 million of debt and returned $48 million to shareholders in quarterly dividends. As laid out in Friday's 8-K, our Board of Directors approved a 6% increase in the dividend beginning in September. This is our first increase in 2 years and reflects our confidence in the future outlook and commitment to shareholder returns. 
In addition, we paid net consideration of $376 million to acquire Gibbs & Cox, which positions us to provide a broad set of engineering solutions to the U.S. and international navies. Gibbs & Cox is contributing a little more than $100 million in revenues this year at margins above the Defense Solutions segment average, given its higher proportion of fixed price work. 
To finance the transaction, we borrowed $380 million with a 1-year maturity at very attractive terms, no more than LIBOR plus 113 basis points. As of July 2, 2021, we had $338 million in cash and cash equivalents and $5.1 billion of debt. 
Last month, we established a commercial paper program for short-term liquidity management. Commercial paper will give us more flexibility at a lower cost than selling accounts receivables. Commercial paper is only available to us because our debt is investment grade, and we view our investment-grade rating as a strategic asset. Over the remainder of the year, our primary capital deployment priority will be debt pay down as we return to a normalized leverage ratio of 3x. 
We remain committed to our long-term balanced capital deployment strategy, which consists of being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment-grade rating, breaking a quarterly dividend to our shareholders reinvesting for growth, both organically and inorganically and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner. 
On to the forward outlook. As shown on Slide 8, we're maintaining our guidance for fiscal year 2021, including revenue between $13.7 billion and $14.1 billion; adjusted EBITDA margin between 10.5% and 10.7%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $6.35 and $6.65; and operating cash flow at or above $875 million. As the year progresses, we normally tighten our guidance ranges, but there are a lot of forces at play, including worsening of the COVID situation with a more contagious Delta variant in stagnation and vaccination rates as well as ongoing challenges in the global supply chain, especially around computer chips. 
On revenues, NGEN is ramping well, but this is still a new customer and new contract. So we don't want to have an established history of order flow and don't want to get ahead of ourselves. The Intelligence Community award decisions have slowed noticeably, and we're also incrementally more cautious on the bounce back of the international airport screening market. So we're not forecasting a return to growth there until 2023. The Gibbs & Cox acquisition should keep us comfortably in our revenue range, but it likely won't put us above the range. We expect revenue to grow fairly linearly through the back half of the year from Q2 levels. Growth drivers in the third and fourth quarters include the full contribution of Gibbs & Cox, the continued ramp on NGEN, MFC and several other programs. Towards the end of the year, we expect the VA medical exams will begin to return to their pre-pandemic levels. On EBITDA margins, year-to-date performance in the second quarter was 11.1% to land in the guidance range for the year, adjusted EBITDA margin for the back half of the year will be around the same level as this quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS will generally follow revenue and margin. However, we're now forecasting the FY '21 tax rate to be between 23% and 23.5% instead of our original 22% forecast, which slightly outweighs the accretion from Gibbs & Cox. 
In addition to the international tax headwinds I mentioned earlier, we're now forecasting a lower deduction for share-based compensation based on stock price performance over the first half of the year. 
Finally, we expect cash flow to follow our normal pattern and accelerate in the back half of the year to land us at the guided level. Over the past 5 years, we've generated an average of 65% annual operating cash flow in the third and fourth quarters. That pattern will be slightly more pronounced this year as a result of the working capital that we have devoted in the first half of this year to drive 17% year-over-year growth. We have a detailed execution plan to achieve our operating cash flow guidance. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Hector so we can take some questions."

So we suspect we'll be talking about NASA ages through the third and fourth quarter, unfortunately. 
On DAS, it's a big contract up at DISA. We're hoping it will be a fourth quarter award. It could easily slide into first quarter. And I would suspect, Cai, that, that will be protested 1 way or the other. The UDS bid, which is at NGA, which is in the nominally $4 billion to $5 billion, a significantly large bid.

Number one, Roger talked about 1901, the contribution that's making to our portfolio. And that would really be an enabler across not only the defense opportunities in enterprise IT, but also into the Civil segment and others to help us deliver those capabilities more cost effectively and drive margin uplift. So we see that as something that will help us there. Obviously, in the Civil segment, margin will ride up with the recovery in our security products business and not just the aviation side, but as I mentioned, ports and borders and there are opportunities, whether it's within the infrastructure bill or otherwise with our customers internationally for that line of business that we're very bullish on. So those things would help us lift margins in that area, and we do have to be prepared for health margins moderating back down a bit as the exam backlog works its way down.

That team is performing exceptionally well. Flex is really on a nice trajectory to ramp up, and those margins will be lower than other parts of the portfolio initially, but they'll have an opportunity to increase over time. And we've got 0 contribution from RHRP in these numbers, right? So that will be something that we'll look forward to next year to really ramp up as that program gets underway. So the exam business is above its historical levels, but quite honestly, that team has delivered so well that the customer is looking to send more work our way over time. And so we're prepared to accommodate them and their needs, however possible. And so the hope is that we can continue that at a nice clip."

When we all have 5G, the functionality that you will carry in your pocket is going to increase by an order of magnitude. And that with cloud and as a service, we could see that as spurring a whole new round of investment and application, migration. So we're very bullish. 
Now I will caution everyone, it's our typical federal government authorized appropriate then it gets distributed to the agencies. They put plans together then they put out RFPs and they have industry days and we bid. And I don't -- I want to sound too negative here, but it takes a long time for money like that to flow through the system to where we win contracts, we start performing, we turn it into revenue and then finally into cash and earnings.

A bigger concern for us is really what's going on outside of the U.S. And as you know, we have significant operations in Australia, the U.K., the Middle East. And they are hunkering down again. In Australia, not only is it difficult to get in the country, it's difficult to get around the country to go from Melbourne, to Canberra and to Sydney. And I think Chris addressed it well, but our SD&A business and certainly the part that we acquired is heavily dependent on international business. which is dependent upon tariffs on airline tickets. And when the volume is down, the money is not there. And although we have not lost any significant competitions in the SD&A business, we have seen many, many canceled and delayed. So I think the impact for us will be in our Civil segment in the business that we refer to as security detection and automation."

So someone with a lifestyle polygraph, a security clearance and can program in a computer language called Python in the national capital region around D.C. Yes, we're seeing a lot of competition for that person. And in order to get the staff that we need, we have to compete, and that is driving up labor in those areas. In other areas, there's a lot of people available. We've been able to meet our hiring goals. And of course, as we have said on this call, we have a strategy to deconcentrate our work in the national capital region and move to areas of the country where the workforce is more readily available. Our 1901 acquisition, which I know we haven't talked a lot about, has a significant presence in Blacksburg, and a great relationship with Virginia Tech. And that was just one more reason why it was attractive to us, and it opens a new workforce for us. We have a software development center in Morgantown, at West Virginia University. We have one in Charlesville at UVA, and now we have one in Blacksburg. 
Overall, we're expecting to hire maybe a number that's in the 9,000 to 10,000 new -- And we're at the -- I think I said 4,500. We're a little bit better than that now. because of the Navy NextGen staffing, which has continued to go very, very well. And we have enjoyed what we call incumbent capture where people who are under contract with the prior contractor have elected to come to work at Leidos.

We have a portfolio mix, which is a little bit -- it's almost 50-50. It's a little bit off from that, which is fixed price. And some of our fixed-price work is what we call time and materials, but think of that as fixed rate. right? So it's so much per hour and the customer buys a number of hours. And then we have what we call our cost reimbursable or cost type contracts. And I'll -- Let me start very simple and then I'll see if I can address your question. 
Clearly, on the cost reimbursable work, if there is wage inflation, that is essentially becomes a pass-through to the customer. And that's not, as maybe not quite as positive as it sounds because customers live on annual budgets. And if you're a NASA customer, you have X for a program in a given year, you don't have X plus inflation. And so if our wages increase inside a budget year, often the customer will have to decrease scope because they don't have any additional funds to execute the program. And then, of course, on fixed price, we have said we will do a program or complete a task for a fixed dollar amount. And the therefore, rely on us to balance the cost per hour with the number of hours. And our challenge, and I think it will be the challenge across the industry, if we see significant wage inflation above what we estimate when we bid, then we're going to have to find new efficiencies in service and delivery to offset that inflation. And we're always trying to do that. That's why sometimes on fixed-price programs, our profit margin might be a little bit better. And we'll just have to do more of that. Part of the again, going back to our 1901 comment, the excitement about 1901 is it has an as-a-service platform, which is really independent on labor. So we charge so much for a service, and we use essentially application IT platform to deliver that. And there's a lot of opportunity for us to create new efficiencies through the service and delivery model."

Just to add on to Roger's point, you hit most of the issues here. Every year, we do a detailed pricing build up multiyear pricing buildup for our indirect and our direct labor costs and certainly contemplate some level of inflation as we build multiyear projections around that. If it turns out that wage inflation is outpacing what we've estimated, we have an opportunity to refresh that, which we will do, and we'll build those costs in. And so you really are just -- at any given time, you might win some contracts where you price them with the old rates. And to Roger's point, you have to find opportunities to drive efficiencies to protect margins. But on the future bids, we're pricing in what we think it requires to execute the work. So we're very transparent about that with our customers. And we've got good competitive intel on where we think we need to be on a price to win.

So as we get to 2022 planning make sure we've got good line of sight on what the latest expectations are. But this year, with the guidance range we provided, we think we gave ourselves some latitude for some potential delays, modest delays across the supply chain.

Our results in the second quarter reflect our leadership position in the government technology market. I am tremendously proud of the way Leidos has responded throughout the pandemic, as our employees and business partners continually delivered for our customers and shareholders. While we remain vigilant with the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases, Leidos is stronger than ever, with new quarterly record levels of revenue and backlog, consistent with our industry-leading organic growth. 
As I look at the quarter, 4 messages stand out. First, our strong financial results demonstrate that our strategy is working. Second, our business development momentum is setting the stage for future growth. Third, we are effectively deploying capital to broaden our offerings in attractive markets. And fourth, we're building an engaged and effective workforce. I'll now drill down on each of these 4 key messages.  
Number one, our strong financial performance was highlighted by double-digit organic growth and adjusted EBITDA margins above our long-term target. Revenue for the quarter were $3.45 billion, up 18% from the prior year on a total basis and up 16% organically. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.4% were in line with guidance and above the long-term target we established 2 years ago. After adjusting for the onetime gain in the second quarter of 2020, non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 37%. These results didn't just happen. Rather they are a direct result of our strategy. We've differentiated ourselves within the market through scale, which creates a more competitive cost structure and expanded capability to take share and position in vital markets. We've also leveraged our cost structure to make key technology investments, which further separates us from our peers.  
Number two, our business development engine continued the momentum that is driving our industry-leading organic growth. We achieved net bookings of $3.8 billion in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1, our 14th consecutive quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1 or greater. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio is now 1.2. As a result, total backlog at the end of the quarter stood at a record $33.5 billion, which was up 9% on a year-over-year basis.  
In our Health segment, we were awarded a new fixed-price contract with a ceiling value of almost $1 billion to improve the health of military reservists before, during and after deployment. Under this contract, known as the Reserve Health Readiness Program, or RHRP, we'll provide physical, mental health and dental assessments along with laboratory and diagnostic services, supported by a secure IT infrastructure and customer service call center. America's more than 1 million reserve component personnel stand ready to support and defend our nation when it's called upon. It's our honor to support them.  
In our Defense Solutions segment, the Transportation Security Administration awarded us a $470 million prime contract to integrate transportation screening equipment at airports all around the country. Based on our policy, we only booked a small initial task order in the quarter, although we expect to achieve the full value over the life of the contract. This work is a reconfiguration of work we've been forming -- we've been performing for over 12 years, and we also maintain screening equipment for TSA at all U.S. federalized airports. Helping TSA ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce is one of the core ways Leidos is making the world safer, healthier and more efficient.  
In our Civil segment, the Federal Aviation Administration notified us that they have given us initial tasking as part of a long-term extension for the continued systems integration, sustainment and enhancement of the En Route Automation Modernization, or ERAM system. The ERAM system is critical for operations in the National Aerospace System and at the 20 air route traffic control centers in the Continental U.S. We didn't book anywhere close to the $6.8 billion ceiling value, but it speaks to the confidence that the FAA has in Leidos. We expect to begin the 2022 government fiscal year with a continuing resolution, but customers will still be able to fund work in critical needs areas. Our positive outlook is bolstered by the level of proposal activity. At the end of the quarter, we had $49 billion in submits outstanding, of which $35 billion is new work for us.  
Number three, we're deploying capital to complete our offerings in attractive markets to spur profitable growth. In May, we completed the acquisition of Gibbs & Cox, which brings us world-class naval architecture, design and engineering services. They designed 68% of the Navy's current surface combatant fleet and are truly a national asset. This deal enhances how we're viewed across the Navy and opens up significant market opportunity for us. Our strategic planning process had identified maritime as an attractive market where we were underpenetrated.  
To enable synergies, especially around unmanned surface and subsurface systems, Gibbs & Cox will be combined with Leidos' maritime systems division and operate under Dynetics within the Defense Solutions segment.  
In addition, we're seeing early returns from our 1901 Group acquisition, which we closed in January of this year. Most directly, 1901 is providing significant support to the NGEN program transition and operations. They've significantly expanded their workforce, grown the current enterprise IT operations center in Virginia and accelerate the establishment of new NGEN service desk locations in San Diego, Norfolk and Boise. 1901's platform-delivered IT services made them the best choice for the program's requirements in this area.  
1901 was also instrumental in securing $125 million follow-on contract with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for managed IT services. 1901's strong customer relationships with the ATF, coupled with their efficient as-a-service delivery model, made them key to the bid and execution strategies.  
In addition to deploying capital to spurn growth, we were also committed to returning capital to shareholders. To that end, our Board just approved a 6% increase to the quarterly dividend. This increase reflects the confidence of the Board of Directors and the management team in the quality of our earnings and our ability to generate cash.  
Number four. This is a people business, and this quarter offered further proof that we are an employer of choice that can attract the workforce needed to meet our financial commitments. During the quarter, we hired more than 4,500 people. And at the end of the quarter, we were more than 42,000 strong. Our headcount grew 6% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. Our ability to attract top talent in this manner is important as we staff up to successfully execute the new programs.  
One of the reasons we are attractive to job applicants is that we invest in talent management and career development. We regularly review talent and plan development actions, including rotations at all levels throughout the company.  
As an example, Executive Vice President, Jim Cantor, recently announced his intent to retire after his distinguished 31-year career at Leidos. This enabled us to reconfigure our team to optimize performance given our rapid growth and the changes in market priorities. I asked Vicki Schmanske, who is leading our Intelligence Group, to assume the new role of Executive Vice President, Corporate Operations. In her new role, Vicki will drive operational performance and implementation of strategic, functional initiatives. Roy Stevens, who led Business Development and Strategy, succeeded Vicki as the President of the Intelligence Group.  
In addition, I asked Chief Human Resources Officer, Paul Engola, to lead a strategic effort to chart our way forward in the national security space market. These changes will help us prepare for an uncertain future. A few weeks ago, we kicked off the Million Dollar Move the Needle sweepstakes to encourage our employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and hasten our coming back together. At the time, all of our facilities were open and all vaccinated individuals were able to work without a mask. A lot has changed in the past weeks. The highly contagious Delta variant and the infection trends are disturbing. As we have throughout the pandemic, we'll comply with all CDC guidelines, and most of our facilities will require masks regardless of vaccination status.  
While we do not expect that our customers will be shutting down their offices again, we cannot be certain. In the face of that uncertainty, we have decided to keep our current forward guidance in place. And Chris will walk you through that in more detail.  
For me, part of returning to normal is being able to get together face to face with our investors and analysts. It is our intent to host an Investor Day in New York on October 7. We have a compelling story to tell, and we look forward to doing just that. We'll closely watch for COVID protocols from New York City and update you if our plans change. 
Finally, Frank Kendall has stepped down from our Board to serve as the Secretary of the Air Force. I want to thank Frank for his service to Leidos and, more importantly, to the Air Force, the Department of Defense and the nation.  
I'll now turn the call over to Chris Cage. I'm delighted to have Chris step up to the CFO role and join us on these calls."

I've worked at Leidos for 23 years, and I've personally benefited from the forward-thinking developmental programs that Roger referenced earlier. My predecessor and mentor, Jim Reagan, created a very strong team and set of processes and disciplines that I've had the opportunity to help shape over the last few years.  
Going forward, my initial areas of focus will be threefold: delivering on our financial commitments, integrating acquisitions and prioritizing spending on investments to execute our strategy.  
With that, let's jump right into the second quarter fiscal year 2021 results. Beginning with the income statement on Slide 5. I'll first run through the financial results at the corporate level, then turn to the segment level to address the primary revenue and profitability drivers. As Roger said, the highlight of the quarter was our organic growth, which is truly unprecedented in our industry at our scale. Revenues for the quarter were $3.45 billion, up 18% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding acquired revenues of $58 million, revenues increased 16% organically.  
Notably, revenues grew organically across all 3 reportable segments. The organic growth is somewhat inflated by the drop in our revenues last year as a result of the pandemic when, for example, our VA disability exam business was almost entirely shut down. Even if we add back the $132 million direct pandemic effect in the prior year, organic revenue growth was still 11%. Adjusted EBITDA was $359 million for the second quarter, which was up 5% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from 11.8% to 10.4% over the same period. Excluding the VirnetX gain from the prior period, adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 140 basis points in the quarter. This was primarily due to strong program management, higher volumes on some fixed-price programs and better direct labor utilization. Non-GAAP net income was $218 million for the second quarter, which was down 2% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.52, also down 2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. Excluding the impact of VirnetX gain from last year's results, non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 37%.  
Our effective tax rate on non-GAAP income in the quarter was 24% compared to the 22% we anticipated for fiscal year 2021. This negatively impacted non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.04. The tax rate increase was primarily across our international business. The largest single driver was that in Q2, we recognized the full impact of a recently enacted increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate, from 19% to 25%.  
Now for an overview of the segment results on Slide 6. Defense Solutions' revenues increased by 14% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the acquisitions of 1901 Group and Gibbs & Cox, organic revenue was up 12%, primarily from ramping up recent contract wins such as NGEN and increased weapon systems development within Dynetics. Civil revenues increased 5% compared to the prior year quarter, with about half coming from the SD&A acquisition and half driven by increased demand on large programs such as Hanford site integration.  
Health revenues increased 62% compared to the prior year quarter, and all of that growth was organic. We had a large year-over-year increase on the DHMSM program as well as a nice ramp on the new Military and Family Life Counseling program, or MFLC.  
The largest increase though was in the VA disability examination business in our QTC subsidiary. Remember, this was the business hardest hit by the pandemic in the year ago quarter, and now volumes are higher than ever as we continue to work through the backlog of exams.  
On the margin front, Defense Solutions' non-GAAP operating income margin for the quarter came in at 8.3%, which was up 20 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Civil non-GAAP operating margin declined from 12.9% in the prior year quarter to 9.1%, as we had fewer deliveries of our border and port security systems and airport screening systems.  
Finally, and most significantly, Health non-GAAP operating income margin for the quarter was up to 17.8% compared to 5.3% in the prior year quarter. This quarter's strong margin performance benefited from the significantly increased revenue volume, but the year-over-year improvement was enabled by the strategic investments we made a year ago to keep our workforce in place and ready to meet the coming customer demand.  
Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $17 million and free cash flow, which is net of capital expenditures, was a usage of $4 million. During the second quarter, we settled the accounts receivable monetization program, which negatively affected our operating and free cash flow by $94 million.  
On a year-to-date basis, the AR monetization program is neutral to cash flow, and we do not plan to sell any more receivables. During the quarter, we used working capital to fund the start-up of new programs and the expansion of existing programs and drive strong organic growth. You can see this impact most clearly in the drawdown of advanced payments compared to last year.  
Cash generation from the business segments was right on plan for the first half of the year and actually ahead of last year. But that performance is overshadowed by onetime nonoperational cash benefits in the first half of 2020. These include $225 million from the AR monetization program; $85 million from VirnetX; $48 million in CARES Act tax deferrals; and $103 million in lower cash taxes, which is just a timing issue. 
During the second quarter, we paid down $27 million of debt and returned $48 million to shareholders in quarterly dividends. As laid out in Friday's 8-K, our Board of Directors approved a 6% increase in the dividend beginning in September. This is our first increase in 2 years and reflects our confidence in the future outlook and commitment to shareholder returns.  
In addition, we paid net consideration of $376 million to acquire Gibbs & Cox, which positions us to provide a broad set of engineering solutions to the U.S. and international navies. Gibbs & Cox is contributing a little more than $100 million in revenues this year at margins above the Defense Solutions segment average, given its higher proportion of fixed-price work.  
To finance the transaction, we borrowed $380 million with a 1-year maturity at very attractive terms, no more than LIBOR plus 113 basis points. As of July 2, 2021, we had $338 million in cash and cash equivalents and $5.1 billion of debt.  
Last month, we established a commercial paper program for short-term liquidity management. Commercial paper will give us more flexibility at a lower cost than selling accounts receivable. Commercial paper is only available to us because our debt is investment grade, and we view our investment-grade rating as a strategic asset. Over the remainder of the year, our primary capital deployment priority will be debt paydown as we return to a normalized leverage ratio of 3x.  
We remain committed to our long-term balanced capital deployment strategy, which consists of: being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment-grade rating; returning a quarterly dividend to our shareholders; reinvesting for growth, both organically and inorganically; and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner.  
On to the forward outlook. As shown on Slide 8, we're maintaining our guidance for fiscal year 2021, including revenue between $13.7 billion and $14.1 billion; adjusted EBITDA margin between 10.5% and 10.7%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $6.35 and $6.65; and operating cash flow at or above $875 million. As the year progresses, we normally tighten our guidance ranges, but there are a lot of forces at play, including potential worsening of the COVID situation with a more contagious Delta variant in stagnation and vaccination rates as well as ongoing challenges in the global supply chain, especially around computer chips.  
On revenues, NGEN is ramping well, but this is still a new customer and new contract, so we don't want to have an established history of order flow and don't want to get ahead of ourselves. The Intelligence Community award decisions have slowed noticeably, and we're also incrementally more cautious on the bounce back of the international airport screening market. So we're not forecasting a return to growth there until 2023. The Gibbs & Cox acquisition should keep us comfortably in our revenue range, but it likely won't put us above the range. We expect revenue to grow fairly linearly through the back half of the year from Q2 levels. Growth drivers in the third and fourth quarters include the full contribution of Gibbs & Cox, the continued ramp on NGEN, MFLC and several other programs. 
Towards the end of the year, we expect the VA medical exams will begin to return to their pre-pandemic levels. On EBITDA margins, year-to-date performance in the second quarter was 11.1%. To land in the guidance range for the year, adjusted EBITDA margin for the back half of the year will be around the same level as this quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS will generally follow revenue and margin. However, we're now forecasting the FY '21 tax rate to be between 23% and 23.5% instead of our original 22% forecast, which slightly outweighs the accretion from Gibbs & Cox.  
In addition to the international tax headwinds I mentioned earlier, we're now forecasting a lower deduction for share-based compensation based on stock price performance over the first half of the year.  
Finally, we expect cash flow to follow our normal pattern and accelerate in the back half of the year to land us at the guided level. Over the past 5 years, we've generated an average of 65% annual operating cash flow in the third and fourth quarters. That pattern will be slightly more pronounced this year as a result of the working capital that we have devoted in the first half of this year to drive 17% year-over-year growth. We have a detailed execution plan to achieve our operating cash flow guidance.  
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Hector so we can take some questions."

But what we've seen overall is it just has taken them longer to get through their acquisition process and awards, recompetes, new business that we had put in our plan have taken literally months or quarters to come to fruition. And what that has meant for us and for others in the industry, rather than booking a full increment of a recompete, we're getting shorter extensions. And so it's not really contributing to the increase in backlog. But in the last quarter or 2, we really haven't lost a significant amount of business. It's just been like a lot of things in COVID, things have just been moving to the right."

And so it may take them another 3, 4 weeks to do their corrective action and then you tack another 3 months on the back of that. So we suspect we'll be talking about NASA ages through the third and fourth quarter, unfortunately. 
On DES, it's a big contract up at DISA. We're hoping it will be a fourth quarter award. It could easily slide into first quarter. And I would suspect, Cai, that, that will be protested one way or the other. The UDS bid, which is at NGA, which is in the nominally $4 billion to $5 billion, a significantly large bid. We expected that to come out July and August. There are some other things going on at NGA, which is in the intel group, Sheila's question, which may cause that to be delayed. It could happen in August, it could happen in September. Frankly, the acquisition team at NGA is really busy. And when they get around to clearing the award, they'll make the award.

That's what we'll lay out when we get to Investor Day in October. But there's more going on to what you pointed out, and those are various due to observations. Number one, Roger talked about 1901, the contribution that's making to our portfolio. And that would really be an enabler across not only the defense opportunities in enterprise IT, but also into the Civil segment and others to help us deliver those capabilities more cost effectively and drive margin uplift. So we see that as something that will help us there. Obviously, in the Civil segment, margin will ride up with the recovery in our security products business. And not just the aviation side, but as I mentioned, ports and borders and there are opportunities, whether it's within the infrastructure bill or otherwise with our customers internationally for that line of business that we're very bullish on. So those things would help us lift margins in that area, and we do have to be prepared for Health margins moderating back down a bit as the exam backlog works its way down. But again, that will still be a robust part of the portfolio on margins. So more to come in October, but I don't think you should read in that we're resetting to 10% longer term."

And we've got zero contribution from RHRP in these numbers, right? So that will be something that we'll look forward to next year to really ramp up as that program gets underway.

In other areas, there's a lot of people available. We've been able to meet our hiring goals. And of course, as we have said on this call, we have a strategy to deconcentrate our work in the National Capital Region and move to areas of the country where the workforce is more readily available. Our 1901 acquisition, which I know we haven't talked a lot about, has a significant presence in Blacksburg and a great relationship with Virginia Tech. And that was just one more reason why it was attractive to us, and it opens up a new workforce for us.

Overall, we're expecting to hire maybe a number that's in the 9,000 to 10,000 new. And we're at the -- I think I said 4,500. We're a little bit better than that now because of the Navy Next Gen staffing, which has continued to go very, very well.

We have a portfolio mix, which is a little bit -- it's almost 50-50. It's a little bit off from that, which is fixed price. And some of our fixed-price work is what we call time and materials, but think of that as fixed rate, right? So it's so much per hour and the customer buys a number of hours. And then we have what we call our cost reimbursable or cost-type contracts. And I'll -- let me start very simple and then I'll see if I can address your question. 
Clearly, on the cost reimbursable work, if there is wage inflation, that is essentially becomes a pass-through to the customer. And that's not as -- maybe not quite as positive as it sounds because customers live on annual budgets. And if you're a NASA customer, you have x for a program in a given year, you don't have x plus inflation. And so if our wages increase inside a budget year, often the customer will have to decrease scope because they don't have any additional funds to execute the program. 
And then, of course, on fixed price, we have said we will do a program or complete a task for a fixed dollar amount. And they therefore rely on us to balance the cost per hour with the number of hours. And our challenge, and I think it will be the challenge across the industry, if we see significant wage inflation above what we estimate when we bid, then we're going to have to find new efficiencies in service and delivery to offset that inflation. And we're always trying to do that. That's why sometimes on fixed-price programs, our profit margin might be a little bit better. And we'll just have to do more of that. Part of the, again, going back to our 1901 comment, the excitement about 1901 is it has an as-a-service platform, which is really independent on labor.

And there's a lot of opportunity for us to create new efficiencies through the service and delivery model."

Just to add on to Roger's point, you hit most of the issues here. Every year, we do a detailed pricing buildup, multiyear pricing buildup for our indirect and our direct labor costs and certainly contemplate some level of inflation as we build multiyear projections around that. If it turns out that wage inflation is outpacing what we've estimated, we have an opportunity to refresh that, which we will do, and we'll build those costs in. And so you really are just -- at any given time, you might win some contracts where you price them with the old rates. And to Roger's point, you have to find opportunities to drive efficiencies to protect margins. But on the future bids, we're pricing in what we think it requires to execute the work. So we're very transparent about that with our customers, and we've got good competitive intel on where we think we need to be on a price to win.

The third quarter marked another strong quarter for Leidos, with record levels of revenue, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP diluted EPS and backlog. Our success is the direct result of building a business portfolio focused on vital missions and a workforce that is motivated to enhance those missions through technology, engineering and science. As we described at our October Investor Day, we see continued success ahead based on our scale, positioning and talented people. 
To organize my remarks, I'll address four messages. First, our financial results demonstrate our ability to grow organically, drive earnings and generate cash. Second, our business development engine delivered large and important awards that speak to our differentiated position in the market. Third, we're effectively deploying capital to create shareholder value. And fourth, we are investing in our people and building a company that we can all be proud of. 
Number one, our strong financial performance was highlighted by outstanding earnings and cash performance. Revenue of $3.48 billion were up organically 6% year-over-year ahead of the market. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.80, which was up 22% year-over-year driven by strong operating performance as reflected in our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.6%. Finally, we generated $565 million of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $541 million for our free cash flow conversion ratio of 211% of non-GAAP net income. With an asset-light model and ability to take EBITDA and to convert it to cash and a lean balance sheet, cash generation is a hallmark of Leidos. 
Number two, business development continued the momentum that is driving our industry-leading organic growth this year. We achieved net bookings of $4.7 billion in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4, our 15th consecutive quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. As a result, total backlog at the end of the quarter stood at a record $34.7 billion, which was up 9% on a year-over-year basis. 
I'll now touch on four of our key wins. We were awarded a $600 million prime contract to continue to support the Army Geospatial Center, Buckeye mission. We're providing mission-critical unclassified high-resolution color imagery and digital 3D terrain over all operationally relevant areas of the world. Our scale enabled us to invest in aircraft that we own and operate in a cadre of professionals to support the mission. Through this program, we provide our war fighters with a decisive advantage on the battlefield. And given the unclassified nature of the Buckeye data, support partner nations as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. 
The National Security Agency awarded us a $300 million prime contract to develop and modernize the agency's Technical Signals Intelligence mission. Under the contract, we provide the technical services to develop, deploy and sustain a wide range of enhanced TechSIGINT collection production and analysis capabilities that provide our nation's leaders and military troops with actionable intelligence and critical information to protect and defend our country. 
The U.S. Army awarded our Dynetics subsidiary, a $237 million, 2.5-year contract for the Enduring Indirect Fires Protection Capability, or IFPC, to produce a transportable system to engage and defeat cruise missile and unmanned aircraft system threats. Our solution uses an open system architecture that provides both flexibility and growth as well as full integration with the Army's integrated air and missile defense battle command system. Under this initial contract, we'll deliver 16 launcher prototypes and 60 interceptors. I view this as the seed corn. If we do it right, IFPC can grow into a $1 billion-plus program. The contract includes options for follow-on production of 400 launchers with associated interceptors. 
Finally, Customs and Border Protection awarded us another important multi-award IDIQ for nonintrusive inspection. So far this year, we've received two IDIQs with a total of $870 million in ceiling value and $200 million in tasking on those contracts. Safeguarding our nation's ports and borders is a critical priority, and CBP has set a goal of 100% screening of cars and cargo at the border versus the single-digit percentages that we achieved today. Congress has appropriated a significant amount of money for more screening. So we see this as a great opportunity for us. 
Number three, I view capital allocation as one of my key functions as CEO, and we're deploying capital to create shareholder value. During the quarter, we bought back $137 million of our stock through open market repurchases. 
At our Investor Day in October, we shared a target of $3.5 billion in cash flow from operations from 2022 through 2024. After considering capital expenditures, some debt paydown and our dividend program, we'll have approximately $2.2 billion to deploy across M&A and share repurchases. We're always looking at technology add-ons, and so that pipeline is pretty active. 
In Q3, we added a small strategic acquisition to our Dynetics subsidiary to accelerate some of its growth opportunities. Beyond that, there's currently nothing major on the horizon. 
We've built a portfolio that we're proud of, and we think we're well positioned to grow. We'll pursue large M&A only if we find a property along the way that could really help accelerate our strategy. 
Number four. People are at the heart of what we do, and this quarter demonstrated our ability to attract the talent that we need. During the quarter, we hired more than 2,900 people. And at the end of the quarter, we were more than 43,000 strong. Our headcount grew 2% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Still, recruiting is an evergreen challenge. We have about 1,400 funded vacancies and recruiting and retention remains areas of strategic focus for the leadership team. 
One of the reasons we're attractive to job applicants is that we invest in upskilling our people and building an innovation culture. As an example, in Q3, we held our first-ever Leidos Sphere, a 24-hour virtual technology conference that brought together employees from around the world to share technical solutions. CTOs, solutions architects and other technologists streamed presentations live from the U.S., Australia, Israel, and the U.K. I personally saw the clear value for participants with real-time answers to questions and lively chat discussions. In the time of increasingly complex global challenges, our global network of customers and colleagues working together to address those challenges is a competitive differentiator. 
Another part of what makes Leidos so attractive is that we're a values-based company. This leadership team is committed to Leidos being a great corporate citizen. We're mindful of our opportunities and responsibilities to our many stakeholders, especially as we grow. With our mission to make the world safer, healthier and more efficient, we believe we can build a future where our people and technology make a real impact. 
Having achieved our legacy greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal, we have now set new environmental goals as well as social and governance goals for 2030. Our new next-level Leidos ESG goals highlight key efforts related to cultivating inclusion, advancing environmental sustainability and promoting healthier lives. We believe these efforts will not only sustain and enrich our culture at Leidos, but they'll also have a positive impact on all of our stakeholders. We'll report our progress annually in our corporate responsibility report, which we've been publishing for more than a decade. 
Through this effort, we're committed to continued transparency in how we're doing from a diversity and environmental standpoint as well as making the lives of our employees and communities better. And so you'll see that in our disclosures. 
Before turning the call over to Chris, I'd like to address the current budget environment, as it gives important context for the guidance that he will be providing. 
As expected, Congress enacted a continuing resolution and suspended the debt ceiling to avoid a shutdown and economic turmoil. Each is now set to expire on December 3. The current thinking is that Congress will try to package the spending bills together into an omnibus spending bill for the President to sign before December 3, or they may kick the can down the road and pass another CR that could last until next March. 
In addition, the House has indicated that it plans to attempt to pass two large legislative items this week or maybe this month. The first, the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure framework to improve the country's roads, bridges, broadband and other critical infrastructure priorities has already passed the Senate, so it would head to present -- it would head to President Biden's desk for signature. The second, the $1.75 trillion Build Back Better proposal to overhaul the nation's health care, education, climate and tax laws would head to the Senate for debate. 
The faith of both bills is still unclear as is the path forward on the spending bills and the debt ceiling. In the face of this uncertainty, some of our customers have tamped down their normal spending patterns. Given the mission-critical nature of our work, we expect only a modest impact to our results, while the budget issues remain unresolved. 
I'll now turn the call over to Chris Cage."

Let's jump right into the third quarter results,",1083,"Thanks, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Roger said, Q3 was an outstanding quarter for earnings and cash, and I'm proud of the team for delivering such strong operating performance. 
Let's jump right into the third quarter results, beginning with the income statement on Slide 5. Revenues for the quarter were $3.48 billion, up 7% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding acquired revenues of $47 million, revenues increased 6% organically with organic growth across all three reportable segments. 
We're pleased to continue to outpace the market, but revenues were below our expectation. The main driver of the shortfall was in lower margin material purchases due in part to supply chain issues for computers and technology components, and due to reduced activity levels due to concerns over the predictability of funding that Roger just mentioned. 
We were able to deliver strong earnings despite these factors. Adjusted EBITDA was $403 million for the third quarter, which was up 16% year-over-year. And adjusted EBITDA margin increased from 10.7% to 11.6% over the same period. This was primarily due to strong program management, higher volumes on some of our fixed price programs and better direct labor utilization. 
Non-GAAP net income attributable to Leidos common stockholders was $257 million for the third quarter, which was up 21% year-over-year. And non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.80, up 22% compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. 
Now for an overview of our segment results and key drivers on Slide 6. Defense Solutions revenues increased by 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the acquisitions of 1901 Group and Gibbs & Cox, organic revenue was up 1%. The largest growth driver was the NGEN ramp, which more than offset the completion of the human landing system-based contract within Dynetics. 
Civil revenues increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter, and all of the growth is now organic. The revenue increase was primarily driven by volume growth on existing programs, including the Antarctic support contract, our managed IT services support to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, where we're leveraging our 1901 Group acquisition and our engineering support to commercial energy providers. 
Health revenues increased 31% compared to the prior year quarter, and all of that growth was organic. We continue to see a nice ramp on the Military and Family Life Counseling program, and DHMSM had a large year-over-year increase based on deployment timing. Like last quarter, the largest year-over-year increase was in the disability examination business in our QTC subsidiary. 
On the margin front, Defense Solutions' non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter came in at 8.8%, which was unchanged compared to the prior year quarter. Civil non-GAAP operating margin declined from 10.5% in the prior year quarter to 9.6% as we had fewer deliveries of airport screening systems. Importantly, margins for both defense and Civil were up sequentially, consistent with our long-term view for these segments. 
Health non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was at 20.7% compared to 3.3% in the prior year quarter. This quarter's strong margin performance benefited from the significantly increased revenue volume on fixed unit price programs and the higher direct labor utilization. 
Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $565 million. And free cash flow, which is net of capital expenditures, was $541 million. The exceptional operating cash flow was driven by strong operational performance across the enterprise and higher customer advance payments, and came despite the $62 million cash tax headwind from last year's CARES Act deferral. 
During the quarter, we paid down $27 million of debt and repurchased 1.4 million shares. In total, we returned $188 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend program and share repurchases. As of October 1, 2021, we had $587 million in cash and cash equivalents and $5.1 billion of debt. 
As we close out the year, we remain committed to a target leverage ratio of 3x. Our long-term balanced capital deployment strategy remains the same and consists of being appropriately levered, maintaining our investment-grade rating, returning a quarterly dividend to shareholders, reinvesting for growth, both organically and inorganically and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner. 
On now to the forward outlook. As shown on Slide 8, we're updating our guidance for fiscal year 2021. Let's walk through the drivers for each metric. We now expect revenues between $13.7 billion and $13.9 billion, which is the bottom half of our previous range. Supply chain delays and customers holding back spending due to concerns over the predictability of funding are the primary drivers here. But some protests have also pushed revenue out of this year. And we're also mindful of the potential impact of vaccine mandates on our workforce. 
At the midpoint of revenue guidance, revenues in Q4 would increase about $70 million compared to Q3, driven by the continued ramp on new programs like NGEN, offsetting moderation in the volume of our medical exam business. At the revenue midpoint, organic growth for the year would be 9% and total revenue growth would be 12%. 
We expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin between 10.9% and 11.1%, which is above the previous range as a result of our Q3 outperformance. As the revenue composition shifts in the fourth quarter, we expect EBITDA margins will come back in and land in the mid-10% range. 
We expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year between $6.55 and $6.75. So we've increased the midpoint of the range by $0.15 based on our Q3 outperformance. Share repurchases in the third quarter will also add about $0.01 to Q4 non-GAAP diluted EPS. 
Finally, our expectation for cash from operations is unchanged at $875 million or greater. Our strong Q3 performance increases our confidence in meeting or exceeding $875 million for the year, but the advanced payments in Q3 will be a headwind to Q4 cash generation. 
Before I close, I want to highlight the 3-year targets we laid out at Investor Day last month. From 2022 through 2024, we're targeting an organic revenue CAGR of 5% to 6%, adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.5% or greater by 2024, free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% and cumulative cash flow from operations generation of approximately $3.5 billion. 
Our market positioning, industry-leading scale and technology differentiation support our position and ability to deliver on these targets. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob so we can take some questions."

I think our team has done an exceptional job running that business and continuing to optimize performance along the way. 
Clearly, this was a banner quarter with the growth and the margins above 20%. I would tell you, and we have told you, that is not where we see this being sustained. And we have worked down the backlog that came about through the pandemic. And we're seeing a level of referral volume continuing to stay fairly high. 
So there are some reasons to be a bit optimistic there. But it will come back down. And what we said before is when the business was running at a normal level, it was in the mid-teen margin. And while we don't guide by segment, I would tell you somewhere at that level is certainly the bottom end of what we feel comfortable with. But with the improvements in the business operations and the growth, I think there's opportunity to do better than that over time. 
So we're preparing for a scenario where health is not performing at these levels, and we've communicated that at Investor Day. And we're driving the rest of the business to make sure we're driving margins up over time. But again, couldn't be more happy with the performance of the health team, and we're going to sustain that performance as long as we can."

And on the material side, which is kind of tied up in some of the chip shortage, we've seen lack of material availability, most around the computing side, but some technology components impacting like our Dynetics or our ISR -- airborne ISR business. 
Think of that as roughly 1/3 of the impact, right? 
And then we've got the budgetary headwinds where we expected certain projects to come through. We're not seeing that activity from customers. That's another roughly 1/3 of the impact. 
And then there's this protest bucket. So we had a couple of programs that we won. And in fact, we had another program that we won last quarter on the TSA side, that Ted and said, which an OEM underneath that protest and so we're not able to do some of the work. So there's this bucket of protest activity that cost us some of the revenue miss as well. 
So there are a few of those things going on. We didn't talk about Afghanistan drawdown, but I would just add that in that that's certainly probably at the higher end of our previous estimates on what that impact would be. So there's a little bit of we expected or hoped that we would have some over the horizon support that's not really materializing.

And in defense, clearly, is where we're seeing the preponderance of some of the impacts that we've talked about. The Afghan drawdown, that was a headwind for the team this year and has hurt what would ordinarily be a growing airborne business. 
The material shortages, a lot of that in our intel customer space have been an impact. We previously talked earlier this year on the intelligence customer award delays having some impacts on the business as well. So those things are all factors that are driving that. And of course, the human landing system program. While we had never put that follow-on in our plan, clearly, the $240 million that we executed on that 10-month program, that's gone and that becomes a growth headwind. 
Now Dynetics, Roger featured the IFPC program in the quarter, and we're very bullish on the growth from that over time into the future. So we're excited about some of the programs that they're winning and executing on, but it is a different business model where you're not going to see some of those large franchise program wins in each and every quarter.

We do expect a modest ramp-up in Q4 from what we've been running at. And 1.5%, I would say that's kind of what we see as the upper bound, right? And our job is to make sure that each and every capital expenditure request passes muster as it relates to returns that we expect to generate from that, and we'll go through the detailed scrub of that and AOP. 
As you can imagine, there are some things from a supply chain issue also impacting us on the capital expenditure side, where Roger mentioned airborne assets and some of the planes that we're outfitting, we're not able to get some of the technology components to get those in operations. So that's taking longer than expected. And some of the facilities, especially on the Dynetics side for fabrication and some of our new wins, getting contractors, getting materials to get those things out that is taking a little bit longer. 
But -- so a little bit of uptick is what I would expect for the fourth quarter. And then as we head into next year, 1.5%, I'd say, is the upper bounds. And we'll kind of see how things play out as far as what the opportunity space looks like when we go through our planning process."

Just to reiterate what Chris mentioned, I can think of a couple of projects in the building that we're in, which we have put on hold because we can't get the material to finish it. There's something on the floor above us that we just had to wrap up and leave, follow and probably get it finished probably next year.

We have starting the transformation part of the program, which is to move the Navy into, if you will, the next generation of Azure network. And the program is actually running really, really well.

We have used the talent in 1901 really to derisk our engine ramping and staffing. They have an as-a-service platform and have a culture that just attracts people. And so we were able to set up a call center literally in a month using the people in 1901. And that has really allowed us to get ahead and provide that level of customer service that we want to get on NGEN. 
And it's the top line growth. There's a lot of work on 1901 that happens through the other units. And so the way we account for it, if they facilitate a sale in our Civil group, you'll see that revenue in our Civil group. And the way we account for acquisition revenue is the stand-alone 1901. 
On Gibbs & Cox, on a stand-alone basis, which is probably not all that relevant even today because we've combined our heritage LInC, liters Innovation Center, Maritime Group with Gibbs & Cox, but you don't see that in the way we account for the revenue. And the cross linkages, the synergies between the heritage maritime business where we would have Seiner and our Traps program and some other classified program and what goes on in Gibbs & Cox, you're not going to get that visibility in our GAAP reported financials. 
But the naval architecture work and the relationships at NAVC and in the Navy that now complement our autonomy business and the work that we do under the water has been terrific. And then Gibbs & Cox, on a stand-alone basis, continue to have strong support from the Navy, on the new frigate contract, on the new destroyer contract and they continue to grow and to staff.

And then we talked a lot about NGEN, and that's, again, a new customer with new buying behavior for us. And one of the things that we'll be in a position to do in the fourth quarter is procure a number of software licenses that they use and execute on. And as you can imagine, some of those arrangements are pay in advance to the software license providers. The way the Navy funds those is kind of an overtime model. So there's some of that that's built in and our expectations of working capital usage. 
Big picture, over time, I would tell you this, I mean, I like the way the team is managing working capital today. I think we're having the next year. We're programming in improvements where we can make them. We're thoughtful about certain particular business areas that might need a little bit of investment, but that's modest. 
And so generally speaking, our DSO this quarter at 60 days is something that I see as being able to be sustained, perhaps improved in certain spots. And right now, the way we're going to manage inventory, I think there's ability to continue to tighten that down and drive improvements into that. So I don't see a big change in our working capital usage to execute our growth plan over the next 3 years."

We're trying to place orders ahead of need. We would be willing to own and hold stock, if we can get it. We are trying to substitute what's in inventory for what's not in inventory. 
We are having discussions, frankly, with our customers about would they rather wait, would you rather have the x laptop now or the y laptop tomorrow. By the way, most of our customers are saying, no, we'll wait another month to get the y laptop. 
We've got really good visibility into our supply chain. We tend to have -- from a system standpoint, material resource and planning, our major suppliers connect into our system. So we sort of know where the supply is. We know when it's going to arrive. And as such, we don't want to get ahead of the arrival of the equipment. 
But like everybody in the industry, we see this as a delay, not a long-term problem. Something that will -- for most of us will correct early next year. I don't think we have the same issues that you might see in the auto industry or and others. And these are supplier partners that we've got 10-year, 20-year relationships with.

I'll try to give you a summary so that you have a good sense of where we are and what we're doing. 
First of all, we had a sweepstakes, what we call the carrot, where we encouraged our employees to get vaccinated, and we gave to employees a year's salary. That was very, very, very successful. We think a lot of people went and got back and say, it kind of came off the fence because of the -- we call it the move the needle sweepstakes, okay? 
We are now -- look -- by the way, our current status is to enter our facility, you have to be vaccinated today or you have to have a recent 72-hour COVID test. And that's all of our facilities. And then customer facilities, we have to follow whatever rule the customer has put in place, and it varies. It varies by customer, it varies by state and it varies by county. 
We all know there's an Executive Order 14042 that says everyone needs to be vaccinated by the 8th of December. We are working with the customers really down to every contract officer in every contract on what that looks like. I'm sure you know that it allows for exceptions because of the ADA and the Civil Rights Act, which means there is a health exception and a religious exception. We are processing exceptions, through a relatively rigorous process. We have, if you will, forms you have to fill out, and then we have a group of people who adjudicate that. 
You asked me what is our current vaccination status? I can give you a range. We think we're in the mid-90s today, right? And because that's PHI data and the requirement to verify your vaccination is not in place here until the 8th of December, we don't know for sure. But based upon all the data we've got, the number of people who have already updated -- uploaded their vaccination card, we think we are in those mid-90s. 
We worry about a small percentage number of people who won't apply for an exemption, won't get vaccinated and simply say, hey, I just don't believe it. I'm a non-vaccinator. We think that number is in the single-digit percentages. We're concerned, which is why we talked about it on the call. It could have an impact to revenue. 
If an employee -- if the mandate stays in place as it's written, and there's a lot of discussions even yesterday that the firm requirement of December 8 may be relaxed but it has not yet been, although there's a lot of rhetoric from the White House. But if an employee were not to be vaccinated, then we would treat that like any disciplinary action where we go through an oral and then a written and then they have to go through our employee disciplinary board and that will take literally months, as it would if you parked in somebody else's parking spot or something like that. And it is unlikely that we would involuntarily separate employees early. 
But there is a possibility that at some point, we're going to have to lay out some people because they don't get vaccinated. We don't want to do that. And we are working with the legislators and with the White House on a sensible implementation of the executive order. 
But I would tell you right now, it's fluid. There have been lawsuits filed. There are some states who have said, you can't comply. And so we're trying to understand state law versus federal law. Like I said, this could -- this explanation could go on at length, but what we want to do is to keep COVID out of our facilities and out of our customer facilities. 
And the EO gives us a great opportunity to do that, and we're going to do everything in our power to keep COVID out and be compliant with the rules and the laws and the Executive Order. But we care about our employees. And we are a people company and the workforce is really, really important, and we're going to do all we can to maintain jobs for our employees. 
One other benefit that we have, and then I'll cut this off, Mariana. As I said, it's probably longer than you wanted. Because of our diverse portfolio, we have parts of our business that are not subject to the Executive Order. We do work for some commercial customers. Actually, a considerable amount of work for commercial customers. 
If it's possible, based upon skill set and geographical location, if we have people who don't want to get the vaccine and they have a skill set that we can use in our Civil business and our civil health business and some other businesses, we can actually move those people to open jobs in other parts of the business and maintain their employment with Leidos. 
But that's not going to be true in every case. But the strength of having a diverse portfolio that we do have allows us to move people back and forth. And in this COVID world, a fair amount of people are working at home. So that adds to our flexibility that we could take someone who maybe was on a defense contract and move them to a civil commercial infrastructure program. But -- and we do have a process set up to do that. We are encouraging those non-vaccinators, if they would like, to take one of the jobs that we have in the commercial segment. Like I said, I can go on, but that's probably more than you wanted to know, but I appreciate the question."

And with the hiring that we're doing, especially in some geographical areas and some skill sets, the fight for talent is something that we are being very thoughtful about. 
Tobey, we have forward pricing rates. There's escalation assumed in the forward pricing rates. If we hire ahead or above that then on our cost type contracts that makes us a little less competitive when we flow through the customer. On our fixed price contracts, it lowers our fee. 
The numbers, as we look at '22 and '23 are really small because we procure about half of what we sell and our labor content is a percentage of that, and then you have to start seeing where we on labor category by labor category.

And it's why in our labor strategy, you have heard us talk about building centers of excellence in areas that are outside, some of the large geographical metropolitan areas like the 1901 Group gave us a large footprint in Blacksburg, which we love. By the way, Blacksburg is a fantastic place. A great place to work. The people who work there love it. They're big Virginia tech fans, and it is a very different economic environment than trying to hire someone in Reston, Virginia. And our strategy the past few years have been to be in places like Morgantown, West Virginia and Blacksburg, even St. Louis, which with the movement of the second headquarters of NGA has become a pretty exciting place for us to hire people and to grow."

And actually just had some discussion on this as a leadership team yesterday as part of our planning process that went through the analysis. And I would tell you that the budget that we're establishing for our merit increases for next year will be higher than what it's been the last several years. 
We're very cognizant of the fact that that's reality. But it's affordable to do so. And as we've talked about margin levers longer term, we understand that that's an area we're going to be making a little bit more investment. There's other areas we're going to deemphasize. 
So I don't see it as something that puts a big headwind on us. We know how to do this. We know how to attract talent, retain talent. And I think ultimately, doing the right thing on the front end with paying our people can offset costs elsewhere such as retention or other things that you have to put in place. 
So again, big picture, I don't think it's a material driver for near-term margin impacts and it's something we're certainly planning for."

The third quarter marked another strong quarter for Leidos, with record levels of revenue, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP diluted EPS and backlog. Our success is the direct result of building a business portfolio focused on vital missions and a workforce that is motivated to enhance those missions through technology, engineering and science.
As we described at our October Investor Day, we see continued success ahead based on our scale, positioning and talented people.
To organize my remarks, I'll address 4 messages. First, our financial results demonstrate our ability to grow organically, drive earnings and generate cash. Second, our business development engine delivered large and important awards that speak to our differentiated position in the market. Third, we're effectively deploying capital to create shareholder value. And fourth, we are investing in our people and building a company that we can all be proud of.
Number one, our strong financial performance was highlighted by outstanding earnings and cash performance. Revenue of $3.48 billion were up organically 6% year-over-year ahead of the market. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.80, which was up 22% year-over-year driven by strong operating performance as reflected in our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.6%. Finally, we generated $565 million of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $541 million for our free cash flow conversion ratio of 211% of non-GAAP net income, with an asset-light model and ability to take EBITDA and to convert it to cash and a lean balance sheet, cash generation is a hallmark of Leidos.
Number two, business development continued the momentum that is driving our industry-leading organic growth this year. We achieved net bookings of $4.7 billion in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4, our 15th consecutive quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. As a result, total backlog at the end of the quarter stood at a record $34.7 billion, which was up 9% on a year-over-year basis.
I'll now touch on 4 of our key wins. We were awarded a $600 million prime contract to continue to support the Army's Geospatial Center, BuckEye mission. We're providing mission-critical unclassified high-resolution color imagery and digital 3D terrain over all operationally relevant areas of the world. Our scale enabled us to invest in aircraft that we own and operate in a cadre of professionals to support the mission. Through this program, we provide our war fighters with a decisive advantage on the battlefield. And given the unclassified nature of the BuckEye data, support partner nations as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.
The National Security Agency awarded us a $300 million prime contract to develop and modernize the agency's Technical Signals Intelligence mission. Under the contract, we provide the technical services to develop, deploy and sustain a wide range of enhanced TechSIGINT collection, production and analysis capabilities that provide our nation's leaders and military troops with actionable intelligence and critical information to protect and defend our country.
The U.S. Army awarded our Dynetics subsidiary, a $237 million, 2.5-year contract for the Enduring Indirect Fires Protection Capability, or IFPC, to produce a transportable system to engage and defeat cruise missile and unmanned aircraft system threats. Our solution uses an open system architecture that provides both flexibility and growth as well as full integration with the Army's integrated air and missile defense battle command system. Under this initial contract, we'll deliver 16 launcher prototypes and 60 interceptors. I view this as the seed corn. If we do it right, IFPC can grow into a $1 billion-plus program. The contract includes options for follow-on production of 400 launchers with associated interceptors.
Finally, Customs and Border Protection awarded us another important multi-award IDIQ for nonintrusive inspection. So far this year, we've received 2 IDIQs with a total of $870 million in ceiling value and $200 million in tasking on those contracts. Safeguarding our nation's ports and borders is a critical priority, and CBP has set a goal of 100% screening of cars and cargo at the border versus the single-digit percentages that we achieved today. Congress has appropriated a significant amount of money for more screening. So we see this as a great opportunity for us.
Number three, I view capital allocation as one of my key functions as CEO, and we're deploying capital to create shareholder value. During the quarter, we bought back $137 million of our stock through open market repurchases.
At our Investor Day in October, we shared a target of $3.5 billion in cash flow from operations from 2022 through 2024. After considering capital expenditures, some debt paydown and our dividend program, we'll have approximately $2.2 billion to deploy across M&A and share repurchases. We're always looking at technology add-ons, and so that pipeline is pretty active.
In Q3, we added a small strategic acquisition to our Dynetics subsidiary to accelerate some of its growth opportunities. Beyond that, there's currently nothing major on the horizon.
We've built a portfolio that we're proud of, and we think we're well positioned to grow. We'll pursue large M&A only if we find a property along the way that could really help accelerate our strategy.
Number four. People are at the heart of what we do, and this quarter demonstrated our ability to attract the talent that we need. During the quarter, we hired more than 2,900 people. And at the end of the quarter, we were more than 43,000 strong. Our headcount grew 2% sequentially and 12% year-over-year.
Still, recruiting is an evergreen challenge. We have about 1,400 funded vacancies and recruiting and retention remains areas of strategic focus for the leadership team.
One of the reasons we're attractive to job applicants is that we invest in upskilling our people and building an innovation culture. As an example, in Q3, we held our first-ever Leidos Sphere, a 24-hour virtual technology conference that brought together employees from around the world to share technical solutions. CTOs, solutions architects and other technologists streamed presentations live from the U.S., Australia, Israel, and the U.K. I personally saw the clear value for participants with real-time answers to questions and lively chat discussions.
In the time of increasingly complex global challenges, our global network of customers and colleagues working together to address those challenges is a competitive differentiator.
Another part of what makes Leidos so attractive is that we're a values-based company. This leadership team is committed to Leidos being a great corporate citizen. We're mindful of our opportunities and responsibilities to our many stakeholders, especially as we grow. With our mission to make the world safer, healthier and more efficient, we believe we can build a future where our people and technology make a real impact.
Having achieved our legacy greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal, we have now set new environmental goals as well as social and governance goals for 2030. Our new next-level Leidos ESG goals highlight key efforts related to cultivating inclusion, advancing environmental sustainability and promoting healthier lives. We believe these efforts will not only sustain and enrich our culture at Leidos, but they'll also have a positive impact on all of our stakeholders. We'll report our progress annually in our corporate responsibility report, which we've been publishing for more than a decade.
Through this effort, we're committed to continued transparency in how we're doing from a diversity and environmental standpoint as well as making the lives of our employees and communities better. And so you'll see that in our disclosures.
Before turning the call over to Chris, I'd like to address the current budget environment, as it gives important context for the guidance that he will be providing.
As expected, Congress enacted a continuing resolution and suspended the debt ceiling to avoid a shutdown and economic turmoil. Each is now set to expire on December 3. The current thinking is that Congress will try to package the spending bills together into an omnibus spending bill for the President to sign before December 3, or they may kick the can down the road and pass another CR that could last until next March. In addition, the House has indicated that it plans to attempt to pass 2 large legislative items this week or maybe this month. The first, the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure framework to improve the country's roads, bridges, broadband and other critical infrastructure priorities has already passed the Senate, so it would head to the present -- it would head to President Biden's desk for signature. The second, the $1.75 trillion Build Back Better proposal to overhaul the nation's health care, education, climate and tax laws would head to the Senate for debate.
The faith of both bills is still unclear as is the path forward on the spending bills and the debt ceiling. In the face of this uncertainty, some of our customers have tamped down their normal spending patterns. Given the mission-critical nature of our work, we expect only a modest impact to our results, while the budget issues remain unresolved.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris Cage."

As Roger said, Q3 was an outstanding quarter for earnings and cash, and I'm proud of the team for delivering such strong operating performance.Let's jump right into the third quarter results, b",1083,"Thanks, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Roger said, Q3 was an outstanding quarter for earnings and cash, and I'm proud of the team for delivering such strong operating performance.
Let's jump right into the third quarter results, beginning with the income statement on Slide 5. Revenues for the quarter were $3.48 billion, up 7% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding acquired revenues of $47 million, revenues increased 6% organically with organic growth across all 3 reportable segments.
We're pleased to continue to outpace the market, but revenues were below our expectation. The main driver of the shortfall was in lower margin material purchases due in part to supply chain issues for computers and technology components. And due to reduced activity levels due to concerns over the predictability of funding that Roger just mentioned.
We were able to deliver strong earnings despite these factors. Adjusted EBITDA was $403 million for the third quarter, which was up 16% year-over-year. And adjusted EBITDA margin increased from 10.7% to 11.6% over the same period. This was primarily due to strong program management, higher volumes on some of our fixed price programs and better direct labor utilization.
Non-GAAP net income attributable to Leidos common stockholders was $257 million for the third quarter, which was up 21% year-over-year. And non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.80, up 22% compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2020.
Now for an overview of our segment results and key drivers on Slide 6. Defense Solutions revenues increased by 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the acquisitions of 1901 Group and Gibbs & Cox, organic revenue was up 1%. The largest growth driver was the NGEN ramp, which more than offset the completion of the human landing system-based contract within Dynetics.
Civil revenues increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter, and all of the growth is now organic. The revenue increase was primarily driven by volume growth on existing programs, including the Antarctic support contract, our managed IT services support to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, where we're leveraging our 1901 Group acquisition and our engineering support to commercial energy providers.
Health revenues increased 31% compared to the prior year quarter, and all of that growth was organic. We continue to see a nice ramp on the Military and Family Life Counseling program, and DHMSM had a large year-over-year increase based on deployment timing. Like last quarter, the largest year-over-year increase was in the disability examination business in our QTC subsidiary.
On the margin front, Defense Solutions' non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter came in at 8.8%, which was unchanged compared to the prior year quarter. Civil non-GAAP operating margin declined from 10.5% in the prior year quarter to 9.6% as we had fewer deliveries of airport screening systems. Importantly, margins for both defense and Civil were up sequentially, consistent with our long-term view for these segments.
Health non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was at 20.7% compared to 16.3% in the prior year quarter. This quarter's strong margin performance benefited from the significantly increased revenue volume on fixed unit price programs and the higher direct labor utilization.
Turning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $565 million. And free cash flow, which is net of capital expenditures, was $541 million. The exceptional operating cash flow was driven by strong operational performance across the enterprise and higher customer advance payments, and came despite the $62 million cash tax headwind from last year's CARES Act deferral.  
During the quarter, we paid down $27 million of debt and repurchased 1.4 million shares. In total, we returned $188 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend program and share repurchases.
As of October 1, 2021, we had $587 million in cash and cash equivalents and $5.1 billion of debt.
As we close out the year, we remain committed to a target leverage ratio of 3x. Our long-term balanced capital deployment strategy remains the same and consists of being appropriately levered, maintaining our investment-grade rating, returning a quarterly dividend to shareholders, reinvesting for growth, both organically and inorganically and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner.
On now to the forward outlook. As shown on Slide 8, we're updating our guidance for fiscal year 2021. Let's walk through the drivers for each metric. We now expect revenues between $13.7 billion and $13.9 billion, which is the bottom half of our previous range. Supply chain delays and customers holding back spending due to concerns over the predictability of funding are the primary drivers here. But some protests have also pushed revenue out of this year. And we're also mindful of the potential impact of vaccine mandates on our workforce.
At the midpoint of revenue guidance, revenues in Q4 would increase about $70 million compared to Q3, driven by the continued ramp on new programs like NGEN, offsetting moderation in the volume of our medical exam business. At the revenue midpoint, organic growth for the year would be 9% and total revenue growth would be 12%.
We expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin between 10.9% and 11.1%, which is above the previous range as a result of our Q3 outperformance. As the revenue composition shifts in the fourth quarter, we expect EBITDA margins will come back in and land in the mid-10% range.
We expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year between $6.55 and $6.75. So we've increased the midpoint of the range by $0.15 based on our Q3 outperformance. Share repurchases in the third quarter will also add about $0.01 to Q4 non-GAAP diluted EPS.
Finally, our expectation for cash from operations is unchanged at $875 million or greater. Our strong Q3 performance increases our confidence in meeting or exceeding $875 million for the year, but the advanced payments in Q3 will be a headwind to Q4 cash generation.
Before I close, I want to highlight the 3-year targets we laid out at Investor Day last month. From 2022 through 2024, we're targeting an organic revenue CAGR of 5% to 6%, adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.5% or greater by 2024, free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% and cumulative cash flow from operations generation of approximately $3.5 billion.
Our market positioning, industry-leading scale and technology differentiation support our position and ability to deliver on these targets.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob so we can take some questions."

And it's discretionary money on their part, but it's below the IDIQ ceiling. And I'm thinking in my mind primarily about 3 or 4 agencies. And those projects just haven't materialized.
And the base program is running fine and -- but we always anticipate maybe 10% on some of these IDIQ kind of test quarter contracts that will come in and a couple of agencies, specifically just haven't been spending their project money. And so it's something we sort of plan on. It's not unusual. We've seen it before when the budget uncertainty gets as bad as it is today. And pretty much eventually, they'll spend that money being it next year or the year after. So the work still needs to get done. It's just not getting done in third and fourth quarter."

I think our team has done an exceptional job running that business and continuing to optimize performance along the way.
Clearly, this was a banner quarter with the growth and the margins above 20%. I would tell you, and we have told you, that is not where we see this being sustained. And we have worked down the backlog that came about through the pandemic. And we're seeing a level of referral volume continuing to stay fairly high.
So there are some reasons to be a bit optimistic there. But it will come back down. And what we said before is when the business was running at a normal level, it was in the mid-teen margin. And while we don't guide by segment, I would tell you somewhere at that level is certainly the bottom end of what we feel comfortable with. But with the improvements in the business operations and the growth, I think there's opportunity to do better than that over time.
So we're preparing for a scenario where health is not performing at these levels, and we've communicated that at Investor Day. And we're driving the rest of the business to make sure we're driving margins up over time. But again, couldn't be more happy with the performance of the health team, and we're going to sustain that performance as long as we can."

So we're -- we took down the midpoint of our guidance of $100 million. So that's kind of the size of the pie, if you will. It's how we think about the potential headwinds that we're facing.
And on the material side, which is kind of tied up in some of the chip shortage, we've seen lack of material availability, most around the computing side, but some technology components impacting like our Dynetics or our ISR -- airborne ISR business.
Think of that as roughly 1/3 of the impact, right?
And then we've got the budgetary headwinds where we expected certain projects to come through. We're not seeing that activity from customers. That's another roughly 1/3 of the impact.
And then there's this protest bucket. So we had a couple of programs that we won. And in fact, we had another program that we won last quarter on the TSA side, that TEDS and SEDS, which an OEM underneath that protest and so we're not able to do some of the work. So there's this bucket of protest activity that cost us some of the revenue miss as well.
So there are a few of those things going on. We didn't talk about Afghanistan drawdown, but I would just add that in that's certainly probably at the higher end of our previous estimates on what that impact would be. So there's a little bit of we expected or hoped that we would have some over the horizon support that's not really materializing. So all those things added together kind of are the $100 million-ish guide down on the midpoint of our revenue."

When I highlighted the growth in our commercial energy customer business, which is above the segment average on margins, that will continue to see expansion, we believe, going into next year, which will help us. So again, the Civil business should be above the corporate average margins. It's slightly below right now, but that's a quarter-to-quarter thing that we see trending up."

I would also point to the execution in Q3 was quite strong in the program performance side. You'll see when you get into the Q that we had an excellent quarter on net write-ups and that helped us in the third quarter, pick our margins up to 11.6%.
But we're absolutely targeting kind of that mid-10 rate. And as we paid it in Investor Day, that's kind of our longer-term view on where the business should be. So all things considered in Q4 with the holiday season and uncertainty in health, we feel pretty good about landing in that area."

And so overall, that's a real strong business for us.
And then -- the other -- another area that's really been nice, and again, we talked about this already, is the new wins in the health group, which has allowed us to grow our health group faster than the rest of the business. And in order to do that, things like the Military and Family Life Counseling was a takeaway. The Reserve Health Readiness program was a takeaway from other people.
And we have -- as we said at our Investor Day, and Sheila, we've been talking about for years, we want to have that balanced portfolio.

And in defense, clearly, is where we're seeing the preponderance of some of the impacts that we've talked about. The Afghan drawdown, that was a headwind for the team this year and has hurt what would ordinarily be a growing airborne business.
The material shortages, a lot of that in our intel customer space have been an impact. We previously talked earlier this year on the intelligence customer award delays having some impacts on the business as well. So those things are all factors that are driving that. And of course, the Human Landing System program. While we had never put that follow-on in our plan, clearly, the $240 million that we executed on that 10-month program, that's gone and that becomes a growth headwind.
Now Dynetics, Roger featured the IFPC program in the quarter, and we're very bullish on the growth from that over time into the future. So we're excited about some of the programs that they're winning and executing on, but it is a different business model where you're not going to see some of those large franchise program wins in each and every quarter. So there's some variability on how the growth plays out.

And some of the facilities, especially on the Dynetics side for fabrication and some of our new wins, getting contractors, getting materials to get those things out that is taking a little bit longer.

We're trying to place orders ahead of need. We would be willing to own and hold stock, if we can get it. We are trying to substitute what's in inventory for what's not in inventory.
We are having discussions, frankly, with our customers about would they rather wait, would you rather have the X laptop now or the Y laptop tomorrow. By the way, most of our customers are saying, no, we'll wait another month to get the Y laptop.
We've got really good visibility into our supply chain. We tend to have -- from a system standpoint, material resource and planning, our major suppliers connect into our system. So we sort of know where the supply is. We know when it's going to arrive. And as such, we don't want to get ahead of the arrival of the equipment.
But like everybody in the industry, we see this as a delay, not a long-term problem. Something that will -- for most of us will correct early next year. I don't think we have the same issues that you might see in the auto industry or and others. And these are supplier partners that we've got 10-year, 20-year relationships with.
And we buy a lot of volume. And so we have a preferred position when they get into the server, the router, we are near the top of the list in getting our fair share.
But there's only so much you can do, which is why we talked about it this morning is if the chips aren't there, they're not being put on the board, they're not being put into the equipment and we can't put the equipment in the customer and take revenue credit."

So I could spend an hour on this. I'll try to give you a summary so that you have a good sense of where we are and what we're doing.

I'll try to give you a summary so that you have a good sense of where we are and what we're doing. 
First of all, we had a sweepstakes, what we call the carrot, where we encouraged our employees to get vaccinated, and we gave 10 employees a year's salary. That was very, very, very successful. We think a lot of people went and got back and say, it kind of came off the fence because of the -- we call it the move the needle sweepstakes, okay?
We are now -- look -- by the way, our current status is to enter our facility, you have to be vaccinated today or you have to have a recent 72-hour COVID test. And that's all of our facilities. And then customer facilities, we have to follow whatever rule the customer has put in place, and it varies. It varies by customer, it varies by state and it varies by county.
We all know there's an Executive Order 14042 that says everyone needs to be vaccinated by the 8th of December. We are working with the customers really down to every contract officer in every contract on what that looks like. I'm sure you know that it allows for exceptions because of the ADA and the Civil Rights Act, which means there is a health exception and a religious exception. We are processing exceptions, through a relatively rigorous process. We have, if you will, forms you have to fill out, and then we have a group of people who adjudicate that.
You asked me what is our current vaccination status? I can give you a range. We think we're in the mid-90s today, right? And because that's PHI data and the requirement to verify your vaccination is not in place here until the 8th of December, we don't know for sure. But based upon all the data we've got, the number of people who have already updated -- uploaded their vaccination card, we think we are in those mid-90s.
We worry about a small percentage number of people who won't apply for an exemption, won't get vaccinated and simply say, hey, I just don't believe it. I'm a non-vaccinator. We think that number is in the single-digit percentages. We're concerned, which is why we talked about it on the call. It could have an impact to revenue.
If an employee -- if the mandate stays in place as it's written, and there's a lot of discussion even yesterday that the firm requirement of December 8 may be relaxed but it has not yet been, although there's a lot of rhetoric from the White House. But if an employee were not to be vaccinated, then we would treat that like any disciplinary action where we go through an oral and then a written and then they have to go through our employee disciplinary board and that will take literally months, as it would if you parked in somebody else's parking spot or something like that. And it is unlikely that we would involuntarily separate employees early.
But there is a possibility that at some point, we're going to have to lay out some people because they don't get vaccinated. We don't want to do that. And we are working with the legislators and with the White House on a sensible implementation of the executive order.
But I would tell you right now, it's fluid. There have been lawsuits filed. There are some states who have said, you can't comply. And so we're trying to understand state law versus federal law. Like I said, this could -- this explanation could go on at length, but what we want to do is to keep COVID out of our facilities and out of our customer facilities.
And the EO gives us a great opportunity to do that, and we're going to do everything in our power to keep COVID out and be compliant with the rules and the laws and the Executive Order. But we care about our employees. And we are a people company and the workforce is really, really important, and we're going to do all we can to maintain jobs for our employees.
One other benefit that we have, and then I'll cut this off, Mariana. As I said, it's probably longer than you wanted. Because of our diverse portfolio, we have parts of our business that are not subject to the Executive Order. We do work for some commercial customers. Actually, a considerable amount of work for commercial customers.
If it's possible, based upon skill set and geographical location, if we have people who don't want to get the vaccine and they have a skill set that we can use in our Civil business and our civil health business and some other businesses, we can actually move those people to open jobs in other parts of the business and maintain their employment with Leidos.
But that's not going to be true in every case. But the strength of having a diverse portfolio that we do have allows us to move people back and forth. And in this COVID world, a fair amount of people are working at home. So that adds to our flexibility that we could take someone who maybe was on a defense contract and move them to a civil commercial infrastructure program. But -- and we do have a process set up to do that. We are encouraging those non-vaccinators, if they would like, to take one of the jobs that we have in the commercial segment. Like I said, I can go on, but that's probably more than you wanted to know, but I appreciate the question."

So we have yet to see the wage inflation but we are being thoughtful about that. And with the hiring that we're doing, especially in some geographical areas and some skill sets, the fight for talent is something that we are being very thoughtful about.
Tobey, we have forward pricing rates. There's escalation assumed in the forward pricing rates. If we hire ahead or above that then on our cost type contracts that makes us a little less competitive but we flow through the customer. On our fixed price contracts, it lowers our fee.
The numbers, as we look at '22 and '23 are really small because we procure about half of what we sell and our labor content is a percentage of that, and then you have to start seeing where we are on a labor category by labor category. So it's a risk item for everyone, for everyone in the industry, but it is not yet a significant risk for us. It's -- literally, I mean -- and Chris can probably give you some colors, in the single or double-digit millions.
But it's something we're being thoughtful about.
And it's why in our labor strategy, you have heard us talk about building centers of excellence in areas that are outside, some of the large geographical metropolitan areas like the 1901 Group gave us a large footprint in Blacksburg, which we love. By the way, Blacksburg is a fantastic place. A great place to work. The people who work there love it. They're big Virginia tech fans, and it is a very different economic environment than trying to hire someone in Reston, Virginia. And our strategy for the past few years have been to be in places like Morgantown, West Virginia and Blacksburg, and even St. Louis, which with the movement of the second headquarters of NGA has become a pretty exciting place for us to hire people and to grow."

And actually just had some discussion on this as a leadership team yesterday as part of our planning process that went through the analysis. And I would tell you that the budget that we're establishing for our merit increases for next year will be higher than what it's been the last several years.
We're very cognizant of the fact that that's reality. But it's affordable to do so. And as we've talked about margin levers longer term, we understand that that's an area we're going to be making a little bit more investment. There's other areas we're going to deemphasize.
So I don't see it as something that puts a big headwind on us. We know how to do this. We know how to attract talent, retain talent. And I think ultimately, doing the right thing on the front end with paying our people can offset costs elsewhere such as retention or other things that you have to put in place.
So again, big picture, I don't think it's a material driver for near-term margin impacts and it's something we're certainly planning for."
