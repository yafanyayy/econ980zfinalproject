61206100,702489055,2202528,"General Motors Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2021",2021-02-10,"Earnings Calls","General Motors Company","Executives","Thanks, Rocky, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining. This morning, we shared the details of our strong 2020 financial performance, including Q4 records for EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margin, EPS diluted adjusted and a record year for GM Financial. Th",2061,"Thanks, Rocky, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining. This morning, we shared the details of our strong 2020 financial performance, including Q4 records for EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margin, EPS diluted adjusted and a record year for GM Financial. These results were driven by the quick actions we took to recover from the early effects of the pandemic. 
Looking at the past year, our employees, suppliers and dealers rallied with speed and agility to support our customers and our communities as well as protecting the business. The pandemic has been a catalyst for finding new and better ways to work while strengthening our resolve to win. As some of our plants suspended production in the early days, our teams rapidly turned to producing critical care ventilators and personal protective equipment for patients and frontline health care workers. After our first conversation with Ventec Life Systems, we began production in just 30 days and we built 30,000 ventilators in 154 days. 
And with that same speed, we developed rigorous safety protocols so we could restart our operations around the globe. This collective spirit was inspiring, and it still drives us and it's contributing to the greatest era of transformation in the history of our company. In spite of the pandemic, we accelerated mission-critical businesses like our EV and AV initiative. We maximized production of full-size trucks, and we launched our new family of full-size SUVs safely and on time. 
We'll sustain this culture of innovation and leadership in 2021 and beyond, and that is my focus this morning. We are fully committed to a capital allocation strategy that invests in new and existing businesses to drive growth. We're going to generate that growth through our EV portfolio as well as businesses like BrightDrop, OnStar Insurance Services, subscription services like Super Cruise and OnStar Guardian and much more to come from our growth and innovation team. 
The semiconductor shortage won't slow our growth plans, and with our mitigation strategies, we still expect a very good year for General Motors. And Paul will share additional details in his remarks. We have strong underlying performance and very strong momentum with customers. Last year, for example, we posted our largest year-over-year U.S. market share gain since 1990, led by full-size trucks and SUVs. 
In 2020, GM was the full-size pickup sales leader in the United States, thanks to gains by the Chevrolet Silverado and record GMC Sierra deliveries, and we plan to expand our capacity in early 2022. The new Cadillac Escalade, GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban are leading the full-size SUV market. And GM China rode the increasing market preference for large MPVs and  luxury vehicles to year-over-year sales increases in these segments, including record deliveries for Cadillac. 
And as we look to the future, we are well positioned from a policy standpoint. I personally and members of our senior leadership team have had discussions with President Biden, Vice President Harris and several key cabinet appointees. The Biden administration is increasingly aligned around the importance of domestic manufacturing and the need for widespread adoption of EVs. We look forward to working with the administration on policies that support safer transportation with 0 emissions. 
When you look at the strategy we have shared, it should be clear. We will seize every opportunity to drive growth, expand our markets and enter new ones. Our Ultium platform is core to these initiatives. It is the foundation for our upcoming global family of EVs. With our first-generation LTM platform, we will now see a 40% battery cost reduction compared to today's Chevrolet Bolt EV. And we're already working on the next-generation of Ultium battery technology, which will deliver a 60% improvement over Bolt EV with double the energy density. To do this work, we've hired almost half of the 3,000 expected new tech employees across engineering, design and IT, and we expect to finish hiring by the end of the quarter. 
What is especially exciting to me is that our vision and our commitments and our aspirations are attracting incredibly talented people to GM. They believe in what we are doing, and when they arrive, they are finding like-minded colleagues already hard at work. Since we first introduced our growth strategy and related announcements in November, we have shared even more of the aggressive steps we are taking to accelerate our plan. We have committed to increasing our EV and AV investments to $27 billion from 2020 through 2025, including more than $7 billion this year alone. With this investment, we will launch 30 EVs globally and achieve EV market leadership in North America. In addition, by mid-decade, we plan to sell at least 1 million EVs per year in our 2 largest markets in North America and with our joint venture partners in China. 
During CES in January, we revealed a new GM brand identity that honors our past but signals our future. We also introduced a new safety brand, Periscope. It describes how we will advance toward a world with 0 crashes by integrating vehicle technology, research and advocacy. And we launched a new brand campaign called Everybody In, which is our call to action to get everyone in an EV. Everybody In is a powerful idea because we must all be all in to achieve our goals. We'll offer EVs across all of our brands and at price points and span the global EV market from the Wuling Hong Guang Mini to the Cadillac CELESTIQ. 
As for the GMC Hummer EV, we have prototypes on the road right now, and they are undergoing cold weather testing in Michigan's upper peninsula, then they will head to Yuma, Arizona into the toughest off-road trails in Moab, Utah. In the meantime, VIN 001 is already spoken for. As part of GMC's partnership with the Tunnel to Towers Foundation, the first GMC Hummer EV will be auctioned on March 27. All proceeds will go to assisting the families of fallen and disabled soldiers and first responders. 
We envision a future where there is an EV offering for everyone. Our future will be inclusive and comprehensive, and it will create new businesses and in some cases, new brands. BrightDrop is a powerful example. It is a new commercial EV business that targets delivery and logistics providers, particularly those in the parcel and food delivery industries with innovative 0 emission solutions. From a revenue standpoint, we'll provide vehicles like an EV600 van, which is a substantial opportunity in and of itself because the global market for light commercial vehicles is almost 9 million units today according to IHS Markit. 
And we believe demand for electric light commercial vehicles will grow quickly. The market seems to agree. In fact, third-party research estimates that the addressable market for eLCVs could be $30 billion by 2025 and double that in 2030. BrightDrop also allows us to create new sources of value for our customers beyond the vehicle, driving diverse income streams from a full ecosystem of product and services. FedEx Express is slated to receive the first EV600 later this year. 
The EV600s will help them meet their stated fuel efficiency goals as part of their broader sustainability strategy and electrification efforts. FedEx Express has also conducted a pilot with the BrightDrop EP1 electric pallet product and has another 1 planned. In this first pilot, the EP1 demonstrated significant productivity increases in the delivery process. 
Similarly, Merchants Fleet, which has more than 150,000 vehicles under management, is targeting to have 50% of its mobile fleet electric by 2025 and 50% of its managed clients fleet by 2030 and is moving forward with plans to put 12,600 BrightDrop EV600s into service. 
Another exciting and potentially lucrative source of growth is our Hydrotec fuel cell technology. Like BrightDrop, Hydrotec is proof that General Motors' vision of a world with 0 emissions isn't limited to passenger vehicles. Less than 2 weeks ago, Navistar, GM and One H2 announced a 0-emissions long-haul transportation ecosystem that will launch in 2024. Navistar will begin building Class 8 trucks for its launch customers, GM will supply Hydrotec fuel cells and One H2 will supply the hydrogen fueling infrastructure. It's an exciting way for us to partner in the Class 8 segment, a nearly $30 billion market in the U.S. alone and that one that we haven't seen before. 
And we believe this is just the beginning for Hydrotec. This is a nascent multibillion-dollar hydrogen power industry for trucking, for military, aerospace and stationary power applications that we are targeting directly as well as through GM Defense. 
Customers and shareholders will continue to see even more evidence throughout 2021 that we're executing our vision and plans for growth. One great example is right around the corner. On Sunday, GM will unveil the 2022 Bolt EUV, which arrives this summer and will be built in Orion, Michigan. The all-new Bolt EUV and refreshed Bolt EV feature unique exterior designs and new interiors. The Bolt EUV will provide nearly 3 inches more legroom than the Bolt EV and will have available wireless phone charging and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, allowing customers to easily access their music and podcasts. 
Like the original Bolt EV, the new Bolt EUV and refreshed Bolt EV will build on Chevy's commitment to attainable EVs. The Chevrolet Bolt EUV is the first Chevrolet and the first GM EV to offer Super Cruise technology, 1 of the 22 GM vehicles that will offer Super Cruise by 2023. Based on feedback from Cadillac customers, we're confident that we will build a steady stream of subscription revenue because our customers don't want to drive without it. 
In addition, GM, Cruze and Microsoft will increasingly leverage Azure, Microsoft's cloud and edge computing platform, to help commercialize self-driving vehicles at scale. And with new investment by GM, Microsoft, Honda and other institutional investors, the estimated valuation of Cruze now stands at $30 billion. And just yesterday, the California DMV released the 2020 disengagement data for autonomous vehicles, and we are very pleased with the excellent continuing improvement and leadership shown by Cruze. 
This fall, we'll begin building the GMC Hummer EV at our Factory ZERO in Detroit and Hamtramck. Work on our flagship EV plant is on track, and we cannot wait to start shipping vehicles to customers. Among its many advanced manufacturing capabilities, Factory ZERO will be the first U.S. auto plant equipped with 5G fixed mobile network technology. As we said in November, our $27 billion in EV and AV investments will include additional EV assembly and battery capability beyond what we've announced for Factory ZERO, Springhill in Tennessee and our LTM cells JV plant in Ohio, where hiring is already underway. In fact, employees will build prototypes later this year. 
Along the way, OnStar Insurance Services is on target to expand to all 50 states by the end of the year. What's happening inside our company and behind the scenes is also important to our success. Delivering this exciting new chapter for GM requires a special team that values diversity and inclusion, a safe workplace and the commitment to create a better, safer and more sustainable world. We aspire to be the most inclusive company in the world because it's the right thing to do and because diversity and inclusion are the foundation of a winning culture. 
I am deeply and personally engaged in this part of our strategy. Our strong values are a compelling tailwind for GM. They will drive creativity, agility and so much more for our future. This future also inspires us to do even more to help mitigate the efforts of climate change, and we will. Less than 2 weeks ago, we announced plans to become carbon-neutral in our global products and operations by 2040. We will set science-based targets to achieve carbon neutrality, and we aspire to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles globally by 2035. 
We will source 100% renewable energy to power our global sites by 2035, 5 years earlier than we announced just a year ago. And we have signed the Business Ambition pledge for a 1.5-degree Celsius, a call to action from a global coalition of UN agencies, business and industry leaders. Like everything else we do, we will provide updates on our progress, and we will hold ourselves accountable. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Paul."

Before I get into the results, I want to take a quick minute to thank Mary, the broader executive team and really the entire organization for the warm welcome that I've received in my time so far here at GM. I'm really excited for the opportunities that we have ahead of us as we build appreciation for the innovation that we are championing right now, whether it's in EV, AV, connected services or our overarching vision of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. 
We are executing well on our growth strategy and accelerating these opportunities with an emphasis on investing in new businesses while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. We believe we can take advantage of these once-in-a-generation opportunities to achieve strong profitable growth with a solid return on investment. Being a part of GM as it writes the next chapters of its history is a huge honor for me. I look forward to continuing the conversations I've had with the investment community thus far and getting to know those of you I have not yet had the chance to meet. 
Now let's get into the results. While 2020 was adversely impacted by production challenges experienced in the first half of the year, we demonstrated resilience and flexibility as we quickly moved to preserve liquidity and manage inventory while still launching an all-new lineup of our highly profitable full-size SUVs and prioritizing investments in our all-electric future. Even in the face of the pandemic, we generated results of $122.5 billion in net revenue, $9.7 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 7.9% margins, $4.90 in EPS diluted adjusted and $2.6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow in 2020. 
In the fourth quarter, we continued to see strength in demand as we generated $3.7 billion in EBIT-adjusted, including the $1.1 billion charge for Takata. We far exceeded the top end of the scenario shared on our Q3 earnings call, absent the impact of Takata due to strong performance in North America and GM Financial, in particular. We also drove strong Q4 net revenue of $37.5 billion, approximately 10% EBIT-adjusted margins and $1.93 in EPS diluted adjusted and $3.4 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. 
The Q4 $1.93 EPS diluted adjusted includes a negative impact of $0.59 from the Takata airbag inflator recall and a $0.26 gain from investments in PSA and Lordstown Motor Corporation. In Q4, we fully repaid the remaining balance on our corporate revolver draw and ended the year with strong automotive cash balance of $22.3 billion and total automotive liquidity of more than $40 billion. 
Let's take a closer look at North America. In the calendar year, North America delivered EBIT-adjusted of $9.1 billion, up $900 million year-over-year and a 9.4% margin. In Q4, North America delivered EBIT-adjusted of $2.6 billion, up $2.3 billion year-over-year as we moved past the effect of the 2019 strike. Continued performance from the launch of our all-new full-size SUVs and disciplined pricing on our full-size pickup trucks offset the impact of the Takata recall. 
U.S. retail sales have continued to recover, with Q4 GM results up 12% year-over-year despite limited inventories, closing the year strong with December retail sales up over 19% year-over-year. We have seen this strong performance continue into January, with sales up 9% year-over-year. Additionally, U.S. retail market share gains have been solid, up 1.4 percentage points year-over-year in Q4, exceeding 18% market share, driven by the newly launched full-size SUVs and high demand for large pickup trucks. 
And we are looking forward to retail EV growth, where we are seeing encouraging signs for demand. We're really excited about the launch of the GMC Hummer EV this fall. When we revealed that in Q4, it was the most-watched auto review in history with 1.3 billion impressions and 370 million views. And it created the highest website traffic of any GM model ever. We wanted to kick off GM's acceleration towards EVs with something as exciting as the GMC Hummer EV, a vehicle that we are very proud of. And it's just the beginning as we roll out 30 new EVs globally by 2025, with several high-volume entries in North America by 2023. 
Let's move to GM International. Full year EBIT-adjusted in GMI was a loss of $500 million, down $300 million year-over-year due to the effects of the pandemic on operations, particularly in China, partially offset by performance improvement outside of China. For the fourth quarter, we were encouraged by our progress with EBIT-adjusted of $300 million, up $400 million year-over-year due to positive price/mix and benefits from our cost actions, partially offset by weaker FX in South America. 
We delivered $500 million of equity income in China for the calendar year, including $200 million in Q4, in line with our expectations. As we progress through the year following Q1 lows, we saw market recovery and benefits from our launches and cost actions, returning to the approximately $200 million quarterly equity income run rate in Q2 through Q4. We received $500 million in dividends from our China automotive JVs in Q4, bringing total dividends to $1 billion for the year. 
Just a few comments on GM Financial, Cruze and our Corp segment before we turn to 2021. GM Financial posted revenue of $13.8 billion for the year and record EBT-adjusted of $2.7 billion. In the fourth quarter, GM Financial generated revenue of $3.4 billion and EBT-adjusted of $1 billion, a Q4 record, up $500 million year-over-year due to strong used vehicle prices, contributing to gains on sale of off-leased vehicles, improved credit performance and lower interest expense due to declining interest rates. 
Cruze costs for the year and in the quarter were $900 million and $300 million, respectively. 2020 was a huge year for Cruze. After substantial development and testing, Cruze has now reached the point where it has removed the human driver from behind the wheel and is now fully testing driverless cars on the streets of San Francisco successfully, as Mary noted earlier. We expect many more good things to come for Cruze in 2021. Cruze segment spend is projected to be about $1 billion in '21. 
Corp segment costs were $600 million for the year and better in the fourth quarter than the normal run rate of $1 billion due to investment gains. We expect the underlying spend in the Corp segment to be about $1.2 billion in 2021, an increase over our normal run rate as we are accounting for certain growth initiatives in the Corp segment. 
In late 2018, we made a strategic decision to accelerate our transformation for the future, to strengthen our core business, capitalize on the future of personal mobility and drive significant cost efficiencies. Our plan included a path to achieve $4 billion to $4.5 billion in cost savings through 2020. I'm pleased to report that we have achieved $4.5 billion in savings since 2018, including $200 million in Q4 and inclusive of $200 million of savings related to the wind-down of Holden and sale of our Thailand business. Having the right cost structure that aligns with our strategy is a key focus for us. We've made great progress with the actions taken over the past several years, and we will continue to pursue incremental efficiencies. 
Now let's turn to the 2021 outlook for the calendar year. As we enter 2021, we see ongoing industry recovery and strong demand for our most profitable products. The underlying business has never been more robust. I want to provide some macro context around 2021 to help set the stage. With continued recovery of the U.S. light vehicle industry in '21, we expect SAAR to be in the mid-16 million unit range, with a stronger second half as we experience normal seasonality in Q1 and expect to see an inflection point in the spring as vaccination rates increase and warmer weather lifts consumer sentiment and auto demand. 
In China, we expect the industry to grow year-over-year as the economy continues to recover. However, we expect a continued competitive pricing environment with increased environmental compliance costs. In South America, we expect continued commercial and portfolio strength to more than offset the macro headwinds. Finally, we expect commodity prices to be a significant headwind as Platinum Group Metals and steel prices have seen major increases in recent weeks and months. 
Our underlying 2021 performance is expected to be strong, including EBIT-adjusted in the $10 billion to $11 billion range as the fundamental business is robust, and we will offset significant commodity headwinds while increasing investments to support our growth strategy and EPS diluted adjusted in the range of $4.50 to $5.25. 
As Mary mentioned at the outset of this call, the industry-wide semiconductor supply shortage will also impact us this year, as it does many other industries. Included in the guidance I just provided is an estimated $1.5 billion to $2 billion in EBIT-adjusted full year impact driven by loss contribution margin, partially offset by mitigation efforts through cost and go-to-market actions. We expect the shortage to be temporary, and we'll look to focus on protecting supply of our highest demand products such as full-size trucks and SUVs as well as EVs. 
Importantly, we do not believe this short-term headwind will affect our long-term earnings power, and we remain committed to our growth initiatives and the EV acceleration we have previously communicated. From an adjusted automotive free cash flow perspective, we estimate a 2021 impact from the semiconductor shortage in the $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion range, putting 2021 adjusted automotive free cash flow guidance in the range of $1 billion to $2 billion. 
We announced the extension of downtime at Fairfax, and San Luis Potosí yesterday, which is included in our numbers above. Our intent is to make up as much production lost at these plants in the second half of the year as possible. We expect 2021 CapEx to be in the $9 billion to $10 billion range, which includes approximately $2 billion of deferred CapEx from 2020 as well as accelerated investments in our all-electric future. 
Also included in our guidance is cash outflow from the Takata recall, which we expect to occur over the next 2 to 3 years from the expense we took in fourth quarter. Nonoperating items included in our guidance worth mentioning include: higher year-over-year net interest expense  and an expected tax rate of approximately 24%, which is higher primarily from the tax deconsolidation of Cruze. 
Regarding earnings results cadence, we expect second half to be stronger than the first half, primarily as a result of some of the production downtime we will take in certain plants to manage the semiconductor supply shortages. 
Finally, I want to spend a minute on capital allocation. The top priority for us is to invest in both new and existing businesses, including previously announced investments to accelerate EV and AV growth while reducing complexity and leveraging current architectures across the ICE portfolio to drive better productivity and customer response, which will help fund investments in our future. To support this growth strategy, in 2021, we will spend more capital on EV and AV product programs than on gasoline and diesel power development for the first time in our history. 
Our capital allocation plan includes more than $6 billion spending on EV and $1 billion on AV in 2021, and we will fund key growth initiatives such as BrightDrop, OnStar Insurance Services, subscription services like Super Cruise and OnStar Guardian aimed at accessing new addressable markets that we have never tapped before, representing a significant top line growth opportunity. We will fund these growth investments with internally generated cash while maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. 
In summary, we had a strong finish to the year, highlighting the underlying strength of our business. We have again demonstrated our strength, flexibility, laser focus on execution and ability to manage through a significant disruption while still generating strong results. This focus will continue in '21 as we manage the challenges of the industry-wide semiconductor shortage while continuing to launch new and exciting products and services and position to GM -- position GM to win in the future of mobility, and I'm proud to be a part of this team. 
This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call."

I actually had 2 longer-term questions I wanted to ask you. One is, you alluded that some of the growth initiatives could result in new brands like BrightDrop but notice that BrightDrop is continuing to use the independent dealer model. Obviously, independent dealers make some money. They do cleave off some gross margin and F&I per vehicle, which some of the new entrants are suggesting is kind of a disadvantage for existing players. I'm wondering if there are changes to the way that BrightDrop is -- the franchise agreements work that kind of levels the playing field with new entrants."

But that's rough order of magnitude what we've included in our numbers. And of course, there's always some lag in terms of being able to respond to those prices. 
On the volume side, I would say that we -- these numbers are moving around rapidly, and between building vehicles that we will go back and retrofit with the components later in the second half and managing through second half makeup volumes, it's premature to talk about the volumes at this point in time.

I'm really excited because if you look at the fact that we're going to be putting Super Cruise on multiple vehicles and the strong customer reaction we've gotten from them, and that continues to grow and definitely contributes to a safer world, a 0 crashes world. And we've talked about the next generation of Super Cruise, and that will have even more capability that we'll be able to provide to vehicles and, in some cases, launch and provide additional functionality over the air. So that's something that will be quite significant by 2025. 
Then when you go to Cruze, they continue to hit their milestones. They're on track from a safety perspective because we've always said safety will be our overriding priority. They're also working on making sure the ride is enjoyable from a customer perspective. And again, they're making progress, I'm very enthused. You know that they're testing right now in San Francisco without drivers in the vehicle in certain situations. I'm not going to put a specific time frame on when we'll launch commercially, but the progress we're making puts us in a very good place that, that's not years away like people think or have talked about it. 
From -- are we a partner with existing rideshares, we have the ability to go and launch our own service. We already have our own application that is being leveraged by our employees right now. So we have -- I think when we are in a position that we can take the driver out of the vehicle from -- and launch the business commercially, we'll have many opportunities, and we'll do what's going to drive the biggest value from a shareholder perspective.

And so we will cover the full line and more when you think about products like BrightDrop and then our first mile, last mile. You put on top of that, the services that will be available through the vehicle that we've talked about, subscription service, and then you put things like insurance that we think we can do very well with the learnings we have from our connected vehicles.

The strong franchises in full-size trucks, full-size SUVs, midsize crossovers, and I'm also super excited about products like the Chevrolet Trailblazer and the Encore. So we have a really strong portfolio of products as we make this transition that's going to need limited investment. And then we're demonstrating right now, we also have a very capable manufacturing team, manufacturing workforce. We're transitioning the Detroit Hamtramck plant right now, Factory ZERO, to build electric vehicles. We've also announced Springhill. 
So we have a very well thought-through plan of how we will transition our manufacturing facilities to electric vehicles. We can do it in a pretty short time frame. And with the shorter vehicle development process we have for EVs, those 2 go hand-in-hand. And in some cases, investment that we're making to increase our ICE vehicles, we're doing that with a mind for what it will take to then have a quicker, less expensive conversion to EVs. 
So it's a very well integrated plan, will be customer-driven, but we're working hard to create a delightful EV ownership experience with the right range, the right charging, the services on top of it and the connectivity that we think we can grow as we make this transition and not have stranded assets."

That's due in part to -- we were planning, going into the year, on having a little bit of a build and inventory level benefiting working capital that as we make up production volumes in the second half, depending on how the semiconductor situation works itself out, we could see a year-end where inventories are flat or -- and not have that working capital benefit that we might otherwise see, which is why we put a little bit more cash impact into it."

And if there's strong customer demand for it in the future, there's nothing that precludes us from doing that, so taking your question very seriously, that's my answer. 
And I do want to answer your Norway question. I'm 97% Finnish so I like all the Scandinavian countries. We're actually very -- we look at what Norway has accomplished from EVs, and we think it's a message to have -- make everyone aware and drive awareness and adoption of EVs."

So can you tell us a little bit more about the demand you're seeing for these other attainable GM EVs in China and what kind of market you think there could be for them? Do you see the potential to export to markets outside of China? And should we think about their volume being incremental to the 1 million units discussed at the EV Day?"

Thanks for joining. This morning, we shared the details of our strong 2020 financial performance, including Q4 records for EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margin, EPS diluted adjusted and a record year for GM Financial. Th",2059,"Thanks, Rocky, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining. This morning, we shared the details of our strong 2020 financial performance, including Q4 records for EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margin, EPS diluted adjusted and a record year for GM Financial. These results were driven by the quick actions we took to recover from the early effects of the pandemic.  
Looking at the past year, our employees, suppliers and dealers rallied with speed and agility to support our customers and our communities as well as protecting the business. The pandemic has been a catalyst for finding new and better ways to work while strengthening our resolve to win. As some of our plants suspended production in the early days, our teams rapidly turned to producing critical care ventilators and personal protective equipment for patients and frontline health care workers. 
After our first conversation with Ventec Life Systems, we began production in just 30 days and we built 30,000 ventilators in 154 days. And with that same speed, we developed rigorous safety protocols so we could restart our operations around the globe. This collective spirit was inspiring, and it still drives us and it's contributing to the greatest era of transformation in the history of our company. 
In spite of the pandemic, we accelerated mission-critical businesses like our EV and AV initiative. We maximized production of full-size trucks, and we launched our new family of full-size SUVs safely and on time. We'll sustain this culture of innovation and leadership in 2021 and beyond, and that is my focus this morning. 
We are fully committed to a capital allocation strategy that invests in new and existing businesses to drive growth. We're going to generate that growth through our EV portfolio as well as businesses like BrightDrop, OnStar Insurance Services, subscription services like Super Cruise and OnStar Guardian and much more to come from our growth and innovation team. The semiconductor shortage won't slow our growth plans, and with our mitigation strategies, we still expect a very good year for General Motors, and Paul will share additional details in his remarks. 
We have strong underlying performance and very strong momentum with customers. Last year, for example, we posted our largest year-over-year U.S. market share gain since 1990, led by full-size trucks and SUVs. In 2020, GM was the full-size pickup sales leader in the United States, thanks to gains by the Chevrolet Silverado and record GMC Sierra deliveries, and we plan to expand our capacity in early 2022. The new Cadillac Escalade, GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban are leading the full-size SUV market. And GM China rode the increasing market preference for large MPVs and luxury vehicles to year-over-year sales increases in these segments, including record deliveries for Cadillac.  
And as we look to the future, we are well positioned from a policy standpoint. I personally and members of our senior leadership team have had discussions with President Biden, Vice President Harris and several key cabinet appointees. The Biden administration is increasingly aligned around the importance of domestic manufacturing and the need for widespread adoption of EVs. We look forward to working with the administration on policies that support safer transportation with 0 emissions.  
When you look at the strategy we have shared, it should be clear. We will seize every opportunity to drive growth, expand our markets and enter new ones. Our Ultium platform is core to these initiatives. It is the foundation for our upcoming global family of EVs. With our first-generation LTM platform, we will now see a 40% battery cost reduction compared to today's Chevrolet Bolt EV. And we're already working on the next-generation of Ultium battery technology, which will deliver a 60% improvement over Bolt EV with double the energy density. To do this work, we've hired almost half of the 3,000 expected new tech employees across engineering, design and IT, and we expect to finish hiring by the end of the quarter.  
What is especially exciting to me is that our vision and our commitments and our aspirations are attracting incredibly talented people to GM. They believe in what we are doing, and when they arrive, they are finding like-minded colleagues already hard at work. Since we first introduced our growth strategy and related announcements in November, we have shared even more of the aggressive steps we are taking to accelerate our plan. We have committed to increasing our EV and AV investments to $27 billion from 2020 through 2025, including more than $7 billion this year alone. With this investment, we will launch 30 EVs globally and achieve EV market leadership in North America. In addition, by mid-decade, we plan to sell at least 1 million EVs per year in our 2 largest markets in North America and with our joint venture partners in China.  
During CES in January, we revealed a new GM brand identity that honors our past but signals our future. We also introduced a new safety brand, Periscope. It describes how we will advance toward a world with 0 crashes by integrating vehicle technology, research and advocacy. And we launched a new brand campaign called Everybody In, which is our call to action to get everyone in an EV. Everybody In is a powerful idea because we must all be all in to achieve our goals. We'll offer EVs across all of our brands and at price points and span the global EV market from the Wuling Hong Guang Mini to the Cadillac CELESTIQ.
As for the GMC Hummer EV, we have prototypes on the road right now. And they are undergoing cold weather testing in Michigan's upper peninsula, then they will head to Yuma, Arizona into the toughest off-road trails in Moab, Utah. In the meantime, VIN 001 is already spoken for. As part of GMC's partnership with the Tunnel to Towers Foundation, the first GMC Hummer EV will be auctioned on March 27. All proceeds will go to assisting the families of fallen and disabled soldiers and first responders.  
We envision a future where there is an EV offering for everyone. Our future will be inclusive and comprehensive, and it will create new businesses, and in some cases, new brands. BrightDrop is a powerful example. It is a new commercial EV business that targets delivery and logistics providers, particularly those in the parcel and food delivery industries with innovative 0 emission solutions. From a revenue standpoint, we'll provide vehicles like an EV600 van, which is a substantial opportunity in and of itself because the global market for light commercial vehicles is almost 9 million units today according to IHS Markit.  
And we believe demand for electric light commercial vehicles will grow quickly. The market seems to agree. In fact, third-party research estimates that the addressable market for eLCVs could be $30 billion by 2025 and double that in 2030. BrightDrop also allows us to create new sources of value for our customers beyond the vehicle, driving diverse income streams from a full ecosystem of product and services. FedEx Express is slated to receive the first EV600 later this year.  
The EV600s will help them meet their stated fuel efficiency goals as part of their broader sustainability strategy and electrification efforts. FedEx Express has also conducted a pilot with the BrightDrop EP1 electric pallet product and has another 1 planned. In this first pilot, the EP1 demonstrated significant productivity increases in the delivery process.  
Similarly, Merchants Fleet, which has more than 150,000 vehicles under management, is targeting to have 50% of its mobile fleet electric by 2025 and 50% of its managed clients' fleet by 2030 and is moving forward with plans to put 12,600 BrightDrop EV600s into service.  
Another exciting and potentially lucrative source of growth is our Hydrotec fuel cell technology. Like BrightDrop, Hydrotec is proof that General Motors' vision of a world with 0 emissions isn't limited to passenger vehicles. Less than 2 weeks ago, Navistar, GM and OneH2 announced a zero-emission long-haul transportation ecosystem that will launch in 2024. Navistar will begin building Class 8 trucks for its launch customers, GM will supply Hydrotec fuel cells and OneH2 will supply the hydrogen fueling infrastructure. It's an exciting way for us to partner in the Class 8 segment, a nearly $30 billion market in the U.S. alone and that one that we haven't seen before. And we believe this is just the beginning for Hydrotec. This is a nascent multibillion-dollar hydrogen power industry for trucking, for military, aerospace and stationary power applications that we are targeting directly as well as through GM Defense.
Customers and shareholders will continue to see even more evidence throughout 2021 that we're executing our vision and plans for growth. One great example is right around the corner. On Sunday, GM will unveil the 2022 Bolt EUV, which arrives this summer and will be built in Orion, Michigan. The all-new Bolt EUV and refreshed Bolt EV feature unique exterior designs and new interiors. The Bolt EUV will provide nearly 3 inches more legroom than the Bolt EV and will have available wireless phone charging and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, allowing customers to easily access their music and podcasts.  
Like the original Bolt EV, the new Bolt EUV and refreshed Bolt EV will build on Chevy's commitment to attainable EVs. The Chevrolet Bolt EUV is the first Chevrolet and the first GM EV to offer Super Cruise technology, 1 of the 22 GM vehicles that will offer Super Cruise by 2023. Based on feedback from Cadillac customers, we're confident that we will build a steady stream of subscription revenue because our customers don't want to drive without it.
In addition, GM, Cruise and Microsoft will increasingly leverage Azure, Microsoft's cloud and edge computing platform, to help commercialize self-driving vehicles at scale. And with new investment by GM, Microsoft, Honda and other institutional investors, the estimated valuation of Cruise now stands at $30 billion. And just yesterday, the California DMV released the 2020 disengagement data for autonomous vehicles, and we are very pleased with the excellent continuing improvement and leadership shown by Cruise.  
This fall, we'll begin building the GMC Hummer EV at our Factory ZERO in Detroit and Hamtramck. Work on our flagship EV plant is on track, and we cannot wait to start shipping vehicles to customers. Among its many advanced manufacturing capabilities, Factory ZERO will be the first U.S. auto plant equipped with 5G fixed mobile network technology. As we said in November, our $27 billion in EV and AV investments will include additional EV assembly and battery capability beyond what we've announced for Factory ZERO, Spring Hill in Tennessee and our LTM cells JV plant in Ohio, where hiring is already underway. In fact, employees will build prototypes later this year. Along the way, OnStar Insurance Services is on target to expand to all 50 states by the end of the year. 
What's happening inside our company and behind the scenes is also important to our success. Delivering this exciting new chapter for GM requires a special team that values diversity and inclusion, a safe workplace and the commitment to create a better, safer and more sustainable world. We aspire to be the most inclusive company in the world because it's the right thing to do and because diversity and inclusion are the foundation of a winning culture.
I am deeply and personally engaged in this part of our strategy. Our strong values are a compelling tailwind for GM. They will drive creativity, agility and so much more for our future. This future also inspires us to do even more to help mitigate the efforts of climate change, and we will. Less than 2 weeks ago, we announced plans to become carbon-neutral in our global products and operations by 2040. We will set science-based targets to achieve carbon neutrality, and we aspire to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles globally by 2035.  
We will source 100% renewable energy to power our global sites by 2035, 5 years earlier than we announced just a year ago. And we have signed the Business Ambition Pledge for 1.5-degree Celsius, a call to action from a global coalition of UN agencies, business and industry leaders. Like everything else we do, we will provide updates on our progress, and we will hold ourselves accountable. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Paul."

Before I get into the results, I want to take a quick minute to thank Mary, the broader executive team and really the entire organization for the warm welcome that I've received in my time so far here at GM. I'm really excited for the opportunities that we have ahead of us as we build appreciation for the innovation that we are championing right now. Whether it's in EV, AV, connected services or our overarching vision of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.
We are executing well on our growth strategy and accelerating these growth opportunities with an emphasis on investing in new businesses while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. We believe we can take advantage of these once-in-a-generation opportunities to achieve strong profitable growth with a solid return on investment.  
Being a part of GM as it writes the next chapters of its history is a huge honor for me. I look forward to continuing the conversations I've had with the investment community thus far and getting to know those of you I have not yet had the chance to meet.  
Now let's get into the results. While 2020 was adversely impacted by production challenges experienced in the first half of the year, we demonstrated resilience and flexibility as we quickly moved to preserve liquidity and manage inventory while still launching an all-new lineup of our highly profitable full-size SUVs and prioritizing investments in our all-electric future. Even in the face of the pandemic, we generated results of $122.5 billion in net revenue, $9.7 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 7.9% margins, $4.90 in EPS diluted adjusted and $2.6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow in 2020.  
In the fourth quarter, we continued to see strength in demand as we generated $3.7 billion in EBIT-adjusted, including the $1.1 billion charge for Takata. We far exceeded the top end of the scenario shared on our Q3 earnings call, absent the impact of Takata due to strong performance in North America and GM Financial, in particular. We also drove strong Q4 net revenue of $37.5 billion, approximately 10% EBIT-adjusted margins and $1.93 in EPS diluted adjusted and $3.4 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow.  
The Q4 $1.93 EPS diluted adjusted includes a negative impact of $0.59 from the Takata airbag-inflator recall and a $0.26 gain from investments in PSA and Lordstown Motor Corporation. In Q4, we fully repaid the remaining balance on our corporate revolver draw and ended the year with strong automotive cash balance of $22.3 billion and total automotive liquidity of more than $40 billion.  
Let's take a closer look at North America. In the calendar year, North America delivered EBIT-adjusted of $9.1 billion, up $900 million year-over-year and a 9.4% margin. In Q4, North America delivered EBIT-adjusted of $2.6 billion, up $2.3 billion year-over-year as we moved past the effect of the 2019 strike. Continued performance from the launch of our all-new full-size SUVs and disciplined pricing on our full-size pickup trucks offset the impact of the Takata recall.  
U.S. retail sales have continued to recover, with Q4 GM results up 12% year-over-year despite limited inventories, closing the year strong with December retail sales up over 19% year-over-year. We have seen this strong performance continue into January, with sales up 9% year-over-year. Additionally, U.S. retail market share gains have been solid, up 1.4 percentage points year-over-year in Q4, exceeding 18% market share, driven by the newly launched full-size SUVs and high demand for large pickup trucks. 
And we are looking forward to retail EV growth, where we are seeing encouraging signs for demand. We're really excited about the launch of the GMC Hummer EV this fall. When we revealed that in Q4, it was the most watched auto reveal in history with 1.3 billion impressions and 370 million views. And it created the highest website traffic of any GM model ever. We wanted to kick off GM's acceleration towards EVs with something as exciting as the GMC Hummer EV, a vehicle that we are very proud of. And it's just the beginning as we roll out 30 new EVs globally by 2025, with several high volume entries in North America by 2023.
Let's move to GM International. Full year EBIT-adjusted in GMI was a loss of $500 million, down $300 million year-over-year due to the effects of the pandemic on operations, particularly in China, partially offset by performance improvement outside of China. For the fourth quarter, we were encouraged by our progress with EBIT-adjusted of $300 million, up $400 million year-over-year due to positive price/mix and benefits from our cost actions, partially offset by weaker FX in South America.  
We delivered $500 million of equity income in China for the calendar year, including $200 million in Q4, in line with our expectations. As we progress through the year following Q1 lows, we saw market recovery and benefits from our launches and cost actions, returning to the approximately $200 million quarterly equity income run rate in Q2 through Q4. We received $500 million in dividends from our China automotive JVs in Q4, bringing total dividends to $1 billion for the year.  
Just a few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and our Corp segment before we turn to 2021. GM Financial posted revenue of $13.8 billion for the year and record EBT-adjusted of $2.7 billion. In the fourth quarter, GM Financial generated revenue of $3.4 billion and EBT-adjusted of $1 billion, a Q4 record, up $500 million year-over-year due to strong used vehicle prices, contributing to gains on sale of off-leased vehicles, improved credit performance and lower interest expense due to declining interest rates.  
Cruise costs for the year and in the quarter were $900 million and $300 million, respectively. 2020 was a huge year for Cruise. After substantial development and testing, Cruise has now reached the point where it has removed the human driver from behind the wheel and is now fully testing driverless cars on the streets of San Francisco successfully, as Mary noted earlier. We expect many more good things to come for Cruise in 2021. Cruise segment spend is projected to be about $1 billion in '21.  
Corp segment costs were $600 million for the year and better in the fourth quarter than the normal run rate of $1 billion due to investment gains. We expect the underlying spend in the Corp segment to be about $1.2 billion in 2021, an increase over our normal run rate as we are accounting for certain growth initiatives in the Corp segment.  
In late 2018, we made a strategic decision to accelerate our transformation for the future to strengthen our core business, capitalize on the future of personal mobility and drive significant cost efficiencies. Our plan included a path to achieve $4 billion to $4.5 billion in cost savings through 2020. I'm pleased to report that we have achieved $4.5 billion in savings since 2018, including $200 million in Q4 and inclusive of $200 million of savings related to the wind-down of Holden and sale of our Thailand business. Having the right cost structure that aligns with our strategy is a key focus for us. We've made great progress with the actions taken over the past several years, and we will continue to pursue incremental efficiencies.  
Now let's turn to the 2021 outlook for the calendar year. As we enter 2021, we see ongoing industry recovery and strong demand for our most profitable products. The underlying business has never been more robust. I want to provide some macro context around 2021 to help set the stage. With continued recovery of the U.S. light vehicle industry in '21, we expect SAAR to be in the mid-16 million unit range, with a stronger second half as we experience normal seasonality in Q1 and expect to see an inflection point in the spring as vaccination rates increase and warmer weather lifts consumer sentiment and auto demand.  
In China, we expect the industry to grow year-over-year as the economy continues to recover. However, we expect a continued competitive pricing environment with increased environmental compliance costs. In South America, we expect continued commercial and portfolio strength to more than offset the macro headwinds. Finally, we expect commodity prices to be a significant headwind as platinum group metals and steel prices have seen major increases in recent weeks and months.  
Our underlying 2021 performance is expected to be strong, including EBIT-adjusted in the $10 billion to $11 billion range as the fundamental business is robust, and we will offset significant commodity headwinds while increasing investments to support our growth strategy and EPS diluted adjusted in the range of $4.50 to $5.25.  
As Mary mentioned at the outset of this call, the industry-wide semiconductor supply shortage will also impact us this year, as it does many other industries. Included in the guidance I just provided is an estimated $1.5 billion to $2 billion in EBIT-adjusted full year impact driven by loss contribution margin, partially offset by mitigation efforts through cost and go-to-market actions. We expect the shortage to be temporary, and we'll look to focus on protecting supply of our highest demand products such as full-size trucks and SUVs as well as EVs.  
Importantly, we do not believe this short-term headwind will affect our long-term earnings power, and we remain committed to our growth initiatives and the EV acceleration we have previously communicated. From an adjusted automotive free cash flow perspective, we estimate a 2021 impact from the semiconductor shortage in the $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion range, putting 2021 adjusted automotive free cash flow guidance in the range of $1 billion to $2 billion. 
We announced the extension of downtime at Fairfax, CAMI and San Luis Potosi yesterday, which is included in our numbers above. Our intent is to make up as much production lost at these plants in the second half of the year as possible. We expect 2021 CapEx to be in the $9 billion to $10 billion range, which includes approximately $2 billion of deferred CapEx from 2020 as well as accelerated investments in our all-electric future.  
Also included in our guidance is cash outflow from the Takata recall, which we expect to occur over the next 2 to 3 years from the expense we took in fourth quarter. Nonoperating items included in our guidance worth mentioning include higher year-over-year net interest expense and an expected tax rate of approximately 24%, which is higher primarily from the tax deconsolidation of Cruise. Regarding earnings results cadence, we expect second half to be stronger than the first half, primarily as a result of some of the production downtime we will take in certain plants to manage the semiconductor supply shortages.  
Finally, I want to spend a minute on capital allocation. The top priority for us is to invest in both new and existing businesses, including previously announced investments to accelerate EV and AV growth while reducing complexity and leveraging current architectures across the ICE portfolio to drive better productivity and customer response, which will help fund investments in our future. To support this growth strategy, in 2021, we will spend more capital on EV and AV product programs than on gasoline and diesel power development for the first time in our history.  
Our capital allocation plan includes more than $6 billion spending on EV and $1 billion on AV in 2021, and we will fund key growth initiatives such as BrightDrop, OnStar Insurance Services, subscription services like Super Cruise and OnStar Guardian aimed at accessing new addressable markets that we have never tapped before, representing a significant top line growth opportunity. We will fund these growth investments with internally generated cash while maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet.  
In summary, we had a strong finish to the year, highlighting the underlying strength of our business. We have again demonstrated our strength, flexibility, laser focus on execution and ability to manage through a significant disruption while still generating strong results. This focus will continue in '21 as we manage the challenges of the industry-wide semiconductor shortage while continuing to launch new and exciting products and services and position to GM -- position GM to win in the future of mobility, and I'm proud to be a part of this team.  
This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call."

I would say that we're making some strides to offset that, and we're going to continue to target where we can in order to drive savings to help offset that. But that's rough order of magnitude what we've included in our numbers. And of course, there's always some lag in terms of being able to respond to those prices.
On the volume side, I would say that we -- these numbers are moving around rapidly. And between building vehicles that we will go back and retrofit with the components later in the second half and managing through second half makeup volumes, it's premature to talk about the volumes at this point in time. But that's where we've come up with the $1.5 billion to $2 billion, net of the initiatives that we think we can bring together to help offset through this."

I was hoping you'd update us on the latest thinking from yourselves and the Cruise team around when Cruise deploys, do you compete with -- against rideshare networks or do you partner with them or both? Just love some updated thoughts there. 
And then on the kind of AV investment inside of GM, it sounds like you're accelerating that as well. I was hoping, perhaps Mary, you could talk about the plan around the zero crash vision. How do we think about AV deployment within the GM vehicles, let's say, over the next 5 years? And kind of what kind of path should we expect there?"

I'm really excited because if you look at the fact that we're going to be putting Super Cruise on multiple vehicles and the strong customer reaction we've gotten from them, and that continues to grow and definitely contributes to a safer world, a 0 crashes world. And we've talked about the next generation of Super Cruise, and that will have even more capability that we'll be able to provide to vehicles and, in some cases, launch and provide additional functionality over the air. So that's something that will be quite significant by 2025. 
Then when you go to Cruise, they continue to hit their milestones. They're on track from a safety perspective because we've always said safety will be our overriding priority. They're also working on making sure the ride is enjoyable from a customer perspective. And again, they're making progress, I'm very enthused. You know that they're testing right now in San Francisco without drivers in the vehicle in certain situations. I'm not going to put a specific time frame on when we'll launch commercially, but the progress we're making puts us in a very good place that, that's not years away like people think or have talked about it.
From -- are we in a partner with existing rideshares? We have the ability to go and launch our own service. We already have our own application that is being leveraged by our employees right now. So we have -- I think when we are in a position that we can take the driver out of the vehicle from a -- and launch the business commercially, we'll have many opportunities, and we'll do what's going to drive the biggest value from a shareholder perspective. But I think at that point, you can think of it like a platform."

And you'll just see a steady launch of vehicles because we've said 2/3 of the 30 by '25 will be in the United States. 
You'll hear more about which vehicles are coming in what order as we start to move through the year. But I would say, as you then -- so that -- and from competitive reasons, we're not going to share too much but we'll continue to share more as we get closer to these launches as we go through this year and next. 
When you start to look at 2035, right now, we're a full-line manufacturer. And so we will cover the full line and more when you think about products like BrightDrop and then our first mile, last mile. You put on top of that the services that will be available through the vehicle that we've talked about, subscription service. And then you put things like insurance that we think we can do very well with the learnings we have from our connected vehicles.

When you look at our ICE business and the platforms we invested in over the last 5 years, we're well positioned and that's what puts us in a place where we can be investing more in EV and AV than we are in ICE. And so we're going to leverage the platforms that we already have.
The strong franchises in full-size trucks, full-size SUVs, midsize crossovers, and I'm also super excited about products like the Chevrolet Trailblazer and the Encore. So we have a really strong portfolio of products as we make this transition that's going to need limited investment. And then we're demonstrating right now, we also have a very capable manufacturing team, manufacturing workforce. We're transitioning the Detroit-Hamtramck plant right now, Factory ZERO, to build electric vehicles. We've also announced Spring Hill. 
So we have a very well thought through plan of how we will transition our manufacturing facilities to electric vehicles. We can do it in a pretty short time frame. And with the shorter vehicle development process we have for EVs, those 2 go hand-in-hand. And in some cases, investment that we're making to increase our ICE vehicles, we're doing that with a mind for what it will take to then have a quicker, less expensive conversion to EVs.  
So it's a very well-integrated plan. We'll be customer-driven, but we're working hard to create a delightful EV ownership experience with the right range, the right charging, the services on top of it and the connectivity that we think we can grow as we make this transition and not have stranded assets."

I don't recall as much discussion of EVs not powered by Ultium batteries. Although I see 1 example, the Wuling Hong Guang Mini EV has, in some recent months, been selling 33,000 or 35,000 units, an annualized run rate of 400,000. So can you tell us a little bit more about the demand you're seeing for these other attainable GM EVs in China and what kind of market you think there could be for them? Do you see the potential to export to markets outside of China? And should we think about their volume being incremental to the 1 million units discussed at the EV Day?"

We do want to see the EV tax credit. We think there's a period of time where that's still important. And frankly, we'd like to see that not penalize first movers.

If we assume that SAAR grows relatively slowly in a mature market and GM targets no ICE by 2035, what happens if adoption is lagging significantly, let's say, 50% or so? Logically, GM must be prepared to either shrink volume or compensate hardware revenue with other source of revenue. And keeping in mind, for me, shrinking if you got more growth and better margin, it's not, let's say, negative for the markets. It's quite the contrary. Expectedly, if you don't want to shrink or not planning to shrink, you need to work on squeezing your competitors especially basically making their growth in EVs more difficult.

I'm joined here today by GM Chairman and CEO, Mary Barra, GM CFO, Paul Jacobson; and GM Financial President, Dan Berce. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. 
I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra."

We r",2320,"Good morning, and thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call. Our start to this year was very strong with a record Q1 performance that was driven largely by robust product demand in the U.S. as well as an outstanding quarter for GM Financial. We remain confident that we will achieve our full year guidance. We are on a path to transform our company on the time line we have shared with you, and we are demonstrating our ability to accelerate our plan. 
Before I discuss the progress we've made on our transformation and growth strategy, I'll provide some highlights about our performance. I'm very pleased with the strength of our global business, which contributed to EBIT-adjusted of $4.4 billion and an EPS diluted adjusted of $2.25. The strong quarter was a full team effort, with people working in our plants all the way to our dealers. 
Global purchasing and supply chain, engineering and manufacturing have been especially nimble and opportunistic as we managed through the semiconductor shortage. For example, our engineers are creating effective solutions using chips that are more readily available or by identifying alternatives which can serve semiconductors where possible. Their work helped us maximize production of our highest demand and capacity-constrained vehicles, reducing downtime and further demonstrating our team's agility. 
While we have production downtime in the second quarter, we expect to have a strong first half with EBIT adjusted around $5.5 billion-ish. We are also reaffirming our guidance for the full year. And based on what we know today, we see the results coming in at the higher end of the $10 billion to $11 billion EBIT-adjusted range that we shared earlier this year. 
We remain committed to fund $7 billion in EV and AV investment that includes capital and engineering this year and accelerating 12 EV programs as we first announced last November. Paul will discuss our Q1 numbers and outlook in more detail in a few minutes. 
Looking ahead, I think there are many reasons why we are confident. For starters, we have great product momentum. Despite tight inventories, we maintain a clear lead in the full-size SUV market in the U.S. and our full-size pickups are in high demand. In China, our sales are rebounding sharply with the economy, and Cadillac achieved a record first quarter led by its SUV lineup of XT4 XT5 and XT6. 
In addition, we are executing one of the fastest production launches in our history. Last November, we said we would return full-size production -- pickup production to Asha assembly in Canada in early 2022. Because of the team's speed, we are pulling the start of retail production ahead into the fourth quarter of this year. The new time line and incremental volume will begin to have a meaningful impact next year as we ramp up production. But I'm sharing it with you now as another example of how we are working urgently to achieve key milestones. 
Let's turn now to our growth strategy, starting with a battery update. We intend to lead on all aspects of battery development and cost reduction, and we are moving quickly on every front. Our vertical integration approach to battery technology, which includes building our own cells, will help us scale quickly and efficiently to deploy new innovative chemistries that boost energy density and reduce cost over time. 
Ultium batteries are unique in the industry because of their large-format pouch style cells that can be stacked vertically or horizontally inside the battery pack. This allows engineers to optimize battery energy storage and layout for each vehicle design. Depending on the vehicle, Altium enables a GM estimated range of up to 450 miles or more on a full charge, with 0 to 60 miles per hour acceleration in 3 seconds. As we previously said, we realized -- we will realize a 40% battery cost reduction with our first-generation Altium platform compared with today's Chevrolet Bolt EV. 
And we're already on the road to delivering a 60% cost reduction compared to the Bolt EV, with the next generation of Altium, and we expect costs will continue to decrease from there. 
Currently, our next-gen lithium metal prototypes have completed about 150,000 simulated test miles, and we expect them to have nearly double the energy density of our current EV batteries. The team has already secured 49 patents for GM's lithium metal battery development, with another 45 pending. 
Our own work, along with the intellectual property from Solid Energy Systems will form the basis of our recent joint development agreement with SES, one of the companies we're working with to commercialize lithium metal batteries. We are targeting production of our next-gen Ultium battery by mid-decade, and we're also expanding our battery cell manufacturing footprint to control our cost and sell supply. 
Last month, Ultium Cells LLC, our joint venture with LG Energy Solutions, announced its second high-volume battery cell plant in the United States, and construction begins immediately on the site adjacent to our Springhill assembly plant in Tennessee. The new facility will create about 1,300 new manufacturing jobs when it comes online in late 2023. It will join the Ultium Cell LLC facility in Lordstown that is opening next year. 
And this is just the beginning, and we'll continue to expand our battery cell capacity on our way to achieving our goal of EV market share leadership in North America. 
Let's turn now to our Ultium-powered products. During the quarter, we unveiled the second new HUMMER EV, the 2024 GMC HUMMER EV SUV, which launches in 2023 and will be built at Factory ZERO and Detroit-Hamtramck. It will be available loaded with new GM-developed software-driven technologies, including crab lock, extract mode and many more features that are either industry-leading or segment differentiators. 
The Cadillac team unveiled the stunning LYRIQ production model, which we accelerated by 9 months. And as we've previously said, we have cut the development time of most of our EVs in half because of our use of virtual engineering and other software tools. Cadillac will take reservations beginning in September, with initial availability in the first half of 2022. 
We were also excited to confirm that Chevrolet will introduce a Silverado full-size electric pickup truck for retail and fleet buyers with a GM estimated 400 miles of range on a full charge for certain configurations. The initial interest has been overwhelming, especially from commercial and government customers. We gave a small number of them a sneak peek at the interior and exterior design. They said it exceeded their high expectations, with zero emissions, long range, pickup capability, innovative storage and strong value along with a powerful design. 
What's especially important is that this truck will be in a high-volume entry in one of the most popular and competitive segments in the industry. 
In addition to Ultium propulsion, Super Cruise is a feature that connects all of these vehicles and an increasing number of vehicles we're selling today. Since its debut in 2017, Super Cruise has twice been ranked as the best driver assistance technology in the industry by a leading third-party consumer group. Super Cruise is enhancing our reputation, elevating our brands and laying the foundation to generate substantial future subscription revenue for us as we move forward. 
To creatively illustrate how fun and liberating Super Cruise can be, Cadillac recently wrapped up its Time to Let Go campaign. It captured celebrities as they drove Cadillac escalate with Super Cruise and its new lane change capability. It was really fun to watch the reactions and how people quickly shifted from being cautiously curious to just peer excitement. We'll roll out Super Cruise to 22 models by the end of 2023, and we plan to add even more features. Our ultimate vision is that this system enables hands-free transportation in 95% of driving scenario. 
What makes our large-scale deployment of Super Cruise and all of its new features possible is our Vehicle Intelligence Platform, or VIP, which connects every vehicle system into one advanced high-speed and very secure network. VIP's 4.5 terabytes of data processing power per hour represents a fivefold increase from our previous electrical architecture. That's enough capacity to manage all of the data loads of our self-driving technology, driver assistance systems, electric propulsion, over-the-air updates of every vehicle module, plus capacity to manage future applications. 
It's also an enabler for Software as a Service, including new apps and capabilities that we can market to our customers, such as the latest must-have trailering and parking apps. By the end of '23, VIP will be on 7 million vehicles and 38 global models. 
Another major element of our growth strategy is our BrightDrop commercial delivery business, and it is progressing and on track. In March, our product and manufacturing teams reached an important milestone as they conducted EV 600 prototype builds. Plans to build the BrightDrop EV 600 at Cadillac -- excuse me, at GM Canada's Cami Assembly at Ingersoll, are progressing rapidly. The BrightDrop team remains on track to reach its goal of delivering EV 600s to its first customer, FedEx Express, by Q4 of this year. 
Interest is high, and we continue to have active discussions with many prospective new customers who are seeking the efficient and zero emission delivery solutions that BrightDrop offers. And this is encouraging as third parties estimate that the addressable market for ELCVs could be $30 billion by 2025 and double that in 2030. 
As our EV volumes grow, we are also investing in relationships to build a robust, reliable and easy-to-use public charging infrastructure. Last week, we revealed LTM Charge 360, an innovative and holistic approach that integrates charging networks, GM vehicle mobile apps and other products and services to simplify the charging experience for GM EB owners. It builds on our existing work and partnerships to support a charging ecosystem that will give GM EV owners more confidence and convenience. 
We have signed agreements with 7 major charging network, giving customers a more seamless access to nearly 60,000 plugs across the U.S. and China. As part of our existing collaboration with EVgo, we've opened the first 3 fast-charging stations in California, Florida and Washington, on our way to 2,700 plugs by the end of 2025. And we expect about 500 fast-charging stalls to go live by the end of this year. 
We'll continue to provide updates about Altium Charge 360, including new elements and collaborations. The last major EV development I want to share follows up on our joint announcement last year with Honda that we will co-develop 2 Ultium-based EVs for Honda to be built in North America by the GM team. Honda recently confirmed these vehicles, a large SUV for the Honda brand and one for the Acura brand, and will launch in North America market for the 2024 model year. This further validates our LTIM technology and we continue to work closely with Honda to expand our partnership and cooperation in key areas such as purchasing, research and development and connected services. 
Turning to AVs. Cruise continues to establish itself as a leading force in commercializing self-driving vehicle technology. At the latest funding round that closed after raising $2.75 billion, it included investments for Microsoft and Walmart, and this brings the valuation of Cruise to more than $30 billion with GM continuing to own a majority stake. 
Cruise is moving steadily closer to commercialization. It's real-world driverless vehicle testing in San Francisco and its last-mile delivery pilot with Walmart and in Arizona will help pave the way for new commitments like the one Cruise just signed with the city of Dubai. Cruise will be the city's exclusive provider of self-driving taxis and ride-hailing services, with plans to deploy up to 4,000 self-driving vehicles by 2030. Dubai chose crews over several competitors, so it's another great validation of cruises technology and our overall approach to autonomous vehicles. 
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I want to quickly update you on our coronavirus measures. We remain diligent and disciplined with our safety protocols to keep employees safe as variants in new hotspots emerge. The GM medical team continues to monitor new COVID-19 cases globally, and our vaccine task force teams are working to understand vaccine administration priorities for each country and determine how we can best assist our employees including operating vaccine clinics in several of our U.S. facilities. 
All the work GM medical has done behind the scenes was crucial as we restarted production last spring. And their work has helped the rest of the team stay focused on driving our business today and driving our growth strategy. I also want to recognize the entire GM team for its hard work, flexibility and resilience. In addition to our suppliers and our dealers who are helping us manage the semiconductor issues, we are also working to serve our customers and leveraging everything we can do to turn inventory quickly. 
Everyone has been remarkably dedicated, and it shows in our results, and we appreciate everyone's hard work. This is just the beginning for the next generation of General Motors. We are well on track with our plans to transform our company and lead the industry into the future, and we are pleased with the significant progress we have made on all fronts during the quarter. 
We look forward to building on the strong momentum and providing a more comprehensive update on our growth initiatives and progress later in the year. We plan to have an investor event in the Detroit area and will announce a date later in the summer because we would like this event to be face-to-face. We'll use this event to go deeper into our growth strategy and financial opportunities and everything that drives them, including software, hardware and services, along with our strong brands. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Paul to provide more details on our financial performance and our full year guidance."

Thanks for taking the time to join us this morning. This has been a very exciting first full quarter for me at GM.

This has been a very exciting first full quarter for me at GM. I see so much opportunity here for us to use our world-class capabilities in manufacturing, engineering and customer loyalty to really leverage these with our scale to achieve our growth initiatives. 
First, to set the stage before I get into the details, we had a great quarter, a first quarter record, in fact, despite the volatile backdrop. Our strong Q1 performance continues to highlight the resiliency of our business as well as our ability to take decisive actions to adapt to the fluid supply chain environment. In Q1, for example, we were able to build and wholesale more vehicles than forecasted and defer anticipated plant downtime. This strong operational execution, combined with the additional actions on price and expense reductions enabled us to deliver stronger-than-expected results for the quarter. 
We are collaborating across the global supply chain and working tirelessly to route available parts to the appropriate plants in order to maximize plant efficiency. We've been focused on leveraging every available semiconductor to build and ship our most popular and in-demand products, including our highly profitable full-size pickups and full-size SUVs. I'm very proud of the team for everything they've accomplished in the first quarter and what they're continuing to do, including strong pricing for every vehicle that we're able to produce, prioritizing production of higher-demand vehicles, continuing to be very controlled on costs and being agile across the board. 
As Mary mentioned, the full year 2021 guidance we outlined last quarter and reiterated a couple of times, remains intact and we expect to be at the higher end of our EBIT-adjusted range. We expect Q2 to reflect the largest impact of the production disruptions resulting from supply shortages The retiming of vehicles we produce without certain modules and plant downtime in the second quarter is expected to be significantly higher than Q1, resulting in lower EBIT adjusted quarter-over-quarter. 
Our current view is that our first half EBIT adjusted will be around $5.5 billion. Recognizing the situation remains fluid, we're cautiously optimistic that our second half will be similar to or better than the first half. Importantly, our commitment to the acceleration of our EV product programs has not changed. Our important upcoming launches, including our GMC HUMMER EV Super Truck and Cadillac LYRIQ are on track. And the construction in Lordstown Factory ZERO, Springhill and CAMI is progressing on schedule. We are still planning to invest $9 billion to $10 billion of CapEx in 2021. 
Finally, our earnings power and cash generation potential remains robust. In a more normalized environment, we expect that certain headwinds we're facing today will dissipate, but the strength of the underlying business powered by exceptional demand for our brands will remain. We expect that our normalized EBIT adjusted performance will be strong as we continue producing and selling our in-demand and highly profitable full-size trucks and SUVs, while continuing to launch new and exciting products and services that position GM to win in the future of mobility. 
So let's get into the strong results of the quarter in more detail. In Q1, we generated $32.5 billion in net revenue, $4.4 billion in EBIT adjusted, 13.6% EBIT-adjusted margin and $2.25 in EPS diluted adjusted, and minus $1.9 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. We exceeded expectations by driving strong price and mix performance in North America through our production prioritization actions and our go-to-market strategy.
 Additionally, high used vehicle prices due to low new vehicle inventories in part, drove record results at GM Financial. Our adjusted automotive free cash flow of minus $1.9 billion was lower $1 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by the working capital impact from plant downtime and inventory carrying value of approximately $1.2 billion associated with vehicles built without certain modules due to the shortage of chips, which will reverse when those vehicles are completed, partially offset by strong EBIT performance. We ended Q1 with a strong automotive cash balance of $19 billion and total automotive liquidity of more than $37 billion. 
So let's take a closer look at North America. In Q1, North America delivered EBIT adjusted of $3.1 billion, up $900 million year-over-year and a 12.1% EBIT-adjusted margin driven by continued strong pricing on our full-size pickups and performance from the launch of our new -- all-new full-size SUVs. Our average transaction prices were up 9% year-over-year for the quarter, with full-size trucks up 10% and full-size SUVs up over 20%, helping to overcome headwinds from commodity inflation and lower volumes. 
These results speak to the strength of the consumer and the strong brand equity we have in our products, which we plan to leverage as we roll out our EV portfolio. On the cost side, we continue to leverage efficiencies executed during COVID, including opportunities related to third-party services, travel and all discretionary spend. Teams across the organization have also gone above and beyond to meet strong and rising demand where they can. 
To drive strong sales with lower inventory, GM has introduced a new proprietary software application that helps dealers track vehicles from when they're completed at the plant to when they're released at their final destination. With many of our full-size trucks and SUVs being sold prior to arriving at the dealer or within days of hitting the lot, this software called Vin View allows dealers to both track vehicles and provide an informed estimated delivery time enhancing the customer's arrival confidence and experience. 
Additionally, we also have a software application called focused ordering that includes a dashboard, which combines vehicle trim options with market data to help dealers ensure they're ordering the most in-demand products to meet customer preferences. This has been a huge help in our prioritization efforts. For example, of all the 2021 light-duty crew cab sales in the first quarter, about 60% were based on this focused ordering dashboard. And these models are turning 5.5 days faster than nonfocused orders. 
In addition to these near-term benefits, we expect this technology to drive long-term cost efficiencies and lower inventories within the dealer network. And we still have a lot of excitement ahead of us this year as we complete renovation of Factory ZERO to launch the GMC HUMMER EV Super Truck this fall. Factory ZERO will also build the GMC HUMMER EV SUV and the Chevy Silverado full-size electric pickup, which is the first of many high-volume EV entries to come. And it will be the home of the Cruise Origin, a purpose-built all electric and shared self-driving vehicle. 
And also, as Mary announced, our second battery plant recently in the last 18 months, which is a great indicator of our acceleration. Combined, these plants will have a capacity of over 70-gigawatt hours of production, and there are more being planned. We'll make additional cell capacity announcements as we progress in our product rollout. 
Let's move to GM International. We continue to be encouraged by our progress in GMI with first quarter EBIT adjusted of $300 million, up $900 million year-over-year as we move past the initial effect of the pandemic in China. We also experienced positive price and mix benefits, as well as benefits from our structural cost actions across the segment. We delivered $300 million of equity income in China in Q1 due to higher volume stabilization in pricing and continued cost actions. 
EBIT-adjusted in GMI excluding China, was up $400 million year-over-year, the second consecutive profitable quarter, as the semiconductor and commodities impact in the quarter was more than offset by the favorable pricing and mix. With continued semiconductor driven plant downtime and low inventory levels, we expect Q2 to be challenged, but these results underscore the improvements in the region. 
A few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and our Corp segment. GM Financial has provided a significant offset to some of the semiconductor headwinds. Strong used vehicle prices, combined with consumer credit strength, helped to drive Q1 EBT adjusted of $1.2 billion, up $1 billion year-over-year. We received $600 million in dividends from GM Financial in Q1 and we anticipate dividends in 2021 from GMF will significantly exceed the 2020 dividend of $800 million, due in part to their expected upside in 2021. 
Cruise costs in the quarter were $200 million. And as Mary mentioned, Cruise continues to make great progress towards commercialization every day. Corp segment EBIT was $30 million in the quarter, a better-than-historical quarterly run rate, primarily due to mark-to-market gains in the period. 
Turning to our 2021 outlook for the calendar year. Last quarter, we outlined strong full year 2021 guidance of EBIT adjusted in the $10 billion to $11 billion range, including an estimated net semiconductor impact of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, which is calculated by taking loss contribution margin, offset by tactical efforts through costs, go-to-market actions and earnings growth at GM Financial. EPS diluted adjusted in the range of $4.50 to $5.25 and adjusted automotive free cash flow guidance in the $1 billion to $2 billion range, including an estimated semiconductor impact of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion. 
Since we shared guidance with you in February, the business has faced additional pressures due to semiconductor shortages as well as commodity inflation. Even though the gross impact of these headwinds has increased, the net impact remains the same as the company has identified additional mitigation initiatives, including pricing and mixed go-to-market strategies, growth at GM Financial, pull ahead of Oshawa full-size pickup production and other cost efficiencies. And what we've been able to prove in the fluid environment we're facing today is that we have the resiliency to flex to the challenges. 
In spite of the volatility in semiconductor availability, we're confident in achieving our full year 2021 outlook, including EBIT adjusted at the higher end of $10 billion to $11 billion, with the expectation that first half EBIT adjusted will be around $5.5 billion. We continue to expect EPS diluted adjusted of $4.50 and $5.25, and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1 billion to $2 billion. 
Our expectation is that Q2 will be the weakest quarter of the year as we increase plant downtime and continue to build vehicles without modules, impacting Q2 EBIT adjusted and working capital as we hold vehicles in inventory to wholesale later in the year once the semiconductors are received. 
We are managing the shortage through select plant downtime in the second quarter which may extend into the second half. However, we plan on operating through the traditional U.S. summer shutdown in early Q3 at select facilities. We do not believe this short-term semiconductor headwind will affect our long-term earnings power and we remain committed to our growth initiatives in the EV acceleration we've previously communicated. 
In the medium to long term, we are focused on working cooperatively with our supply base and the semiconductor manufacturers to improve our line of sight on the full supply chain mapping and gain more control over the chip itself. We're working to proactively implement risk mitigation strategies that will help avoid future disruptions to the supply chain. And we've also learned a lot over the last year about our and our dealers' ability to manage at lower inventory levels. We're taking these learnings to implement dealer efficiency tools to optimize inventory levels, and we are creating sales tools to allow for more online shopping and purchase options. 
Finally, I want to reiterate our capital allocation priorities. I mentioned that the top priority for us is to invest in both new and existing businesses, with more than half going to accelerate EV growth, as well as continue a strong ICE portfolio that funds our journey while maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. 
To summarize, we had a strong beginning to the year. highlighting the strength of our underlying business. We have again demonstrated our strength, our flexibility, our laser focus on execution and our ability to manage through a significant disruption while still generating strong results. There are still big challenges ahead of us, but we have the team and expertise to navigate this while not losing sight of our vision. We will continue investing in exciting new growth opportunities, including EVs, battery supply and technology and software solutions that will drive growth and desirable differentiated products and services for our customers. 
Despite the challenging environment, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong results in 2021 and I couldn't be more proud of the GM family. 
This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call."

So it's really the ingenuity and creativity of the team that is allowing us to build. Yes, the Renaissance fire did have an impact, and the team goes to work and figures out how to offset or minimize it, and that's what they're doing. 
So I think there was a lot of great problem-solving that was done in the in Q1. We have said we think Q2 will be the weakest, and then we see recovery coming in Q3 and Q4, and that's based on all the work the team is doing, working with suppliers, et cetera. So there's no -- it's just It's just chip by chip working the issues to find solutions, and that's what the team is so good at doing. 
And it remains very dynamic. So I think to look here today and try to quantify exactly what all the ins and outs are going to be for the rest of the year, I think it would -- that'd be data that has a pretty short shelf life. But I think what you can count on and what we see with all the work that's been done across the whole supply chain and engineering team is that we have confidence that we're going to be able to hit our guidance and that with everything we know today, we'll be at the top end."

Certainly, the timing is somewhat fluid, and you see that, the fact that the first quarter has blown out expectations in 2Q is under consensus. But if you actually look at the first half, when you add Q1 and Q2 together, it's actually exceeding where Street consensus was for the first half of the year.

I think -- I don't think anybody would say that dealer-inventory levels are optimized right now. Just drive by some lots, and you see empty lots. It certainly means that we're operating much, much lower than what I think we even think is optimal. But as we mentioned in the comments, there's a lot of tools that we're learning how to operate at these lean levels that I think will provide some long-term efficiencies. 
And the dealer network has done really an amazing job of not only working with us, but also providing an environment for the customer that where the vehicle may not be immediately available, they give them reassurance to help drive that purchase transaction versus the customer being disappointed that the vehicle that he or she wants -- doesn't want isn't there on the lot. 
So that visibility, I think, undoubtedly, will help us over the long term. And we're taking those lessons and we're figuring out how to make sure that we manage that as efficiently as we can. But we certainly came into the year expecting to build inventories out of -- coming out of the COVID situation. That clearly is challenged amid some of the production issues that we've seen with the semiconductor shortage. But we certainly hope to build as we get into perhaps late 2021 into 2022 to start getting inventory levels at what we think is a much safer value to have vehicles on the lots, where customers want to purchase them."

And really excited with the progress they're showing in San Francisco. Obviously, Dubai is very significant as well. So you take that and I've always said, we have kind of a revolutionary and an evolutionary strategy around driver assistance all the way to full Level 4, Level 5 autonomy. So you see Cruise really focused on that full autonomy. 
But Super Cruise, we continue to add more and more features. And we've said that we envision that to get 95% of being able to handle all solutions. Later in the decade, I believe, and there's a lot to still to unfold, but I believe we'll have personal autonomous vehicles, and then that will leverage the capability we have at Cruise with the capability that we have at the car company really be well positioned to delight the customers from that perspective. 
So both paths are very important because the technology we put on vehicles today, I think, makes them safer and delights the customers and it's going to give us an opportunity for subscription revenue. And then the ultimate work that we're doing at Cruise, I think that is full autonomous, really opens up more possibilities than I think we can outline today."

It's obviously a challenging environment to be able to be thinking about longer term, even 6 months, 9 months ahead as we are navigating through this. So I think what we see is, what I would say, cautious optimism. So while we talk about the second half of the year being similar or potentially slightly better than the first half, there's some caution in that. So for example, things like the used car vehicle prices that GM Financial is clearly benefiting from -- that's likely to stay in place as long as new car inventories remain low. So that's an example of, I would say, that a variable that's sort of hedged directly against the challenges of the semiconductor. 
But as more vehicles come online, and I think most industrial forecasts are that chip availability is going to be better in the second half than it is in the first half, and I think we think that's true as well, that could lead to pricing that maybe isn't as strong as it was in the first quarter. So I think we're trying to maintain some caution and some rationality. The reality is we're -- we and others are right in the middle of this, I think we're doing a really good job of managing through it as evidenced by the first quarter and the fact that the first half of the year is coming in above consensus estimates before we announced, that it's trying to provide a mix of reassurance in the projections that we've given, as well as some cautious optimism about what the future holds."

And I think as we continue to lean in and accelerate some of those vehicle programs. We are investing resources to be able to do that. As to the first part of your question, clearly, commodity inflation had a massive impact, you just need to look at some of the indices to be able to see that. But we're not really isolating that because we're taking all of the cost pressures that we've seen, both from our initial expectations and what's constantly changing, and putting that all into the same bucket. 
So much the same way that the semiconductor issue is fluid in day-to-day, so are the commodity prices going forward. So while we have a little bit of forward purchasing going on, obviously, in the supply chain, there's some exposure out there, but there's also some potential goodness if prices normalize. So We're trying to keep all of that very, very fluid as we manage it in the aggregate, both in terms of go-to-market strategies as well as production prioritization."

So I think it's going to end up being a little higher, especially when you look at our dealer network. I've got them sending me pictures if they have virtually nothing on the lot. 
So there's an optimal level significantly lower than it was in the past, but higher than it is now. I think what you're seeing now, though, is the ingenuity of our dealers and the new tools we provided that give them insight into what's coming, and they're selling deep, not only into the inventory, but deep into the pipeline of vehicles that are on the way.

As it relates to Dubai, I mean, I think it highlights the fact that as we grow not only in Dubai, but in other cities across the United States, across North America and across the world, we're uniquely positioned in the AV space because we have the ability to produce those vehicles. I mean we're already tooling up the Origin to be produced at Factory ZERO. So that's a huge opportunity for us. And to your point, that's going to drive to the bottom line. 
So I'm very excited about the future growth opportunities that we have with Cruise, with the production of the vehicles we'll do for that.

But you did say the first quarter came in better. So I guess the implication is that very little of that semi impact that you called out for the year happened in the first quarter. And then you've always called second quarter worse, but it does seem like maybe it's a little bit worse than a few months ago. So at least that's the impression I got. 
And since you did give more clear color on implied second quarter, I think what would really help investors here is if you could compare that second quarter production maybe versus expectations at the beginning of the year. And then as we go forward for the rest of the year, you mentioned GMF is better, we saw that in the guidance. But what -- and you mentioned pricing, but what are you, I guess, specifically assuming? Or how are you thinking about modeling pricing to offset things like higher commodities?"

I think to go back to the fact that this is obviously a very dynamic situation. I would say, in all honesty, that Q2 is probably worse than we expected. It was going to be a few months ago. But that's due in part to some",493,"So thanks for that question, Joe. I think to go back to the fact that this is obviously a very dynamic situation. I would say, in all honesty, that Q2 is probably worse than we expected. It was going to be a few months ago. But that's due in part to some of the timing of how we map this out. So what I would say is that we are carefully evaluating the short-term supply chain, the intermediate term supply chain and some of the longer-term issues as well. 
So depending on the confidence of where we see chips coming in and which chips and our ability to reallocate those and reprioritize those, we did see an opportunity to accelerate some production into Q1 to take advantage of the market that we see right now, which is obviously very, very strong and the confidence to be able to make up some of that volume in Q2. So that's why I think we need to be really cautious as we're thinking about the full year. What gives us the confidence is the agility that the team has displayed in being able to respond to this and how dynamic it really is. 
So part of the reason we don't want to anchor in on production volumes and so on is just because that's going to change. It's going to change next week. It's going to change the week after. Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse. So it's really trying to operate in at this level of where we need to take go-to-market strategies, where we need to prioritize mix, where we need to accelerate or potentially shut down a plant in anticipation of some challenges that are coming up over the short to medium term. Then that's kind of what we're doing. You saw that going into plant downtime in Q1. 
So I wouldn't say that Q1 was immune from the semiconductor challenges. I think certainly, the consumer has proven to be very robust. Used car values continue to go up, which I think is endemic of the inventory challenges that we see across the board and that everybody sees. So all of that is just -- is working in concert. into what I would say is a very agile plan for us to meet our objectives. 
It's also why we're trying to steer this to the first half versus Q1 and Q2. So there isn't necessarily a readthrough in the short term, because something that happens in March versus something that happens in April isn't really all that relevant to how we're thinking about managing through this. And that's why when we have the confidence of looking at where first half expectations were, despite the disparity between Q1 and Q2, we actually think that we're performing ahead of expectations that were outlined at the beginning of the year. We just want to be cautious about that in the back half, if that makes sense."

There seems to be clearly this war against ICE waged by governments, by consumers, regulators, right, and then lately OEMs, waging their own war against ICE.

And so I -- maybe it's too soon, but I'd love to get your view on when, along this journey away from ICE, would it be appropriate as you sit down with your auditors to think about curtailment of useful life and that impact, the financial impact? 
Because it could really change your results, and I think it's pretty relevant. If I'm wrong, tell me how I'm wrong because. I'm scratching my head thinking how do you avoid at some point? Is it just you're making too much damn money selling the ICE stuff right now and it's just that the fit isn't right and we need to wait for things to get worse?

For General Motors, I think this is a growth opportunity for us because there's a lot of EV interest on the coast. That's where we don't get what I would call our fair share. And frankly, I'm going after more than our fair share on the strength of our product portfolio. So that's point one. We see this as a growth opportunity not only in the U.S. in markets we are in, but in growing into other markets, we're currently not participating in. 
I would also say with the assets that we have right now, when you look at converting a plant from a plant that builds ICE vehicles to those that produce electric vehicles, there's a lot of reuse, body shop structures, machinery and equipment, a paint shop, which is a 30- to 35-year asset. It doesn't care if it's -- what the propulsion system is in the vehicle that we're going to be painting. And so there's a lot of capital that can be reused as we go forward. 
I would also say with every new internal combustion engine propelled vehicle that we put out, we're looking to make it better for the environment from a fuel economy emission CO2 perspective. And I also think you have to look at the fact that right now, battery costs are coming down, but look at what's in the marketplace right now. I think we're really one of the only people that have an all-electric vehicle that's as affordable as the Bolt EV. We got to make sure as we move to an all-electric future that it truly is for everyone. 
So that's more than an advertising tagline. That's something that General Motors is very much committed to making sure everybody -- because ESG has an S in the middle of it, which is making sure we're doing the right thing for everyone. So I think we're moving at a very quick speed to be able to provide EVs for everyone. I think it's going to be a growth opportunity for General Motors. And I think a lot of the assets that we currently have can be reused in an all-EV world."

We r",2314,"Good morning, and thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call. Our start to this year was very strong with a record Q1 performance that was driven largely by robust product demand in the U.S. as well as an outstanding quarter for GM Financial. We remain confident that we will achieve our full year guidance. We are on a path to transform our company on the time line we have shared with you, and we are demonstrating our ability to accelerate our plan.  
Before I discuss the progress we've made on our transformation and growth strategy, I'll provide some highlights about our performance. I'm very pleased with the strength of our global business, which contributed to EBIT-adjusted of $4.4 billion and an EPS diluted adjusted of $2.25. The strong quarter was a full team effort, with people working in our plants all the way to our dealers.  
Global purchasing and supply chain, engineering and manufacturing have been especially nimble and opportunistic as we managed through the semiconductor shortage. For example, our engineers are creating effective solutions using chips that are more readily available or by identifying alternatives that can serve semiconductors where possible. Their work helped us maximize production of our highest demand and capacity-constrained vehicles, reducing downtime and further demonstrating our team's agility.  
While we have production downtime in the second quarter, we expect to have a strong first half with EBIT adjusted around $5.5 billion-ish. We are also reaffirming our guidance for the full year. And based on what we know today, we see the results coming in at the higher end of the $10 billion to $11 billion EBIT-adjusted range that we shared earlier this year.
We remain committed to fund $7 billion in EV and AV investment that includes capital and engineering this year and accelerating 12 EV programs as we first announced last November. Paul will discuss our Q1 numbers and outlook in more detail in a few minutes.
Looking ahead, I think there are many reasons why we are confident. For starters, we have great product momentum. Despite tight inventories, we maintain a clear lead in the full-size SUV market in the U.S. and our full-size pickups are in high demand. In China, our sales are rebounding sharply with the economy, and Cadillac achieved a record first quarter, led by its SUV lineup of XT4, XT5 and XT6.  
In addition, we are executing one of the fastest production launches in our history. Last November, we said we would return full-size production -- pickup production to Oshawa Assembly in Canada in early 2022. Because of the team's speed, we are pulling the start of retail production ahead into the fourth quarter of this year. The new time line and incremental volume will begin to have a meaningful impact next year as we ramp up production. But I'm sharing it with you now as another example of how we are working urgently to achieve key milestones.  
Let's turn now to our growth strategy, starting with a battery update. We intend to lead on all aspects of battery development and cost reduction, and we are moving quickly on every front. Our vertical integration approach to battery technology, which includes building our own cells, will help us scale quickly and efficiently to deploy new innovative chemistries that boost energy density and reduce cost over time.  
Ultium batteries are unique in the industry because of their large-format pouch-style cells that can be stacked vertically or horizontally inside the battery pack. This allows engineers to optimize battery energy storage and layout for each vehicle design. Depending on the vehicle, Ultium enables a GM-estimated range of up to 450 miles or more on a full charge, with 0 to 60 miles per hour acceleration in 3 seconds. As we previously said, we realized -- we will realize a 40% battery cost reduction with our first-generation Ultium platform compared with today's Chevrolet Bolt EV.  
And we're already on the road to delivering a 60% cost reduction compared to the Bolt EV, with the next generation of Ultium, and we expect costs will continue to decrease from there.  
Currently, our next-gen lithium metal prototypes have completed about 150,000 simulated test miles, and we expect them to have nearly double the energy density of our current EV batteries. The team has already secured 49 patents for GM's lithium metal battery development, with another 45 pending.  
Our own work, along with the intellectual property from SolidEnergy Systems will form the basis of our recent joint development agreement with SES, one of the companies we're working with to commercialize lithium metal batteries. We are targeting production of our next-gen Ultium battery by mid-decade, and we're also expanding our battery cell manufacturing footprint to control our cost and cell supply.  
Last month, Ultium Cells LLC, our joint venture with LG Energy Solution, announced its second high-volume battery cell plant in the United States, and construction begins immediately on the site adjacent to our Spring Hill Assembly Plant in Tennessee. The new facility will create about 1,300 new manufacturing jobs when it comes online in late 2023. It will join the Ultium Cell LLC facility in Lordstown that is opening next year.  
And this is just the beginning, and we'll continue to expand our battery cell capacity on our way to achieving our goal of EV market share leadership in North America.  
Let's turn now to our Ultium-powered products. During the quarter, we unveiled the second new HUMMER EV, the 2024 GMC HUMMER EV SUV, which launches in 2023 and and will be built at Factory ZERO and Detroit-Hamtramck. It will be available loaded with new GM-developed software-driven technologies, including CrabWalk, Extract Mode and many more features that are either industry-leading or segment differentiators.  
The Cadillac team unveiled the stunning LYRIQ production model, which we accelerated by 9 months. And as we've previously said, we have cut the development time of most of our EVs in half because of our use of virtual engineering and other software tools. Cadillac will take reservations beginning in September, with initial availability in the first half of 2022.  
We were also excited to confirm that Chevrolet will introduce a Silverado full-size electric pickup truck for retail and fleet buyers with a GM estimated 400 miles of range on a full charge for certain configurations. The initial interest has been overwhelming, especially from commercial and government customers. We gave a small number of them a sneak peak at the interior and exterior design. They said it exceeded their high expectations, with zero emissions, long range, pickup capability, innovative storage and strong value, along with a powerful design. What's especially important is that this truck will be in a high-volume entry in one of the most popular and competitive segments in the industry.  
In addition to Ultium propulsion, Super Cruise is a feature that connects all of these vehicles, and an increasing number of vehicles we're selling today. Since its debut in 2017, Super Cruise has twice been ranked as the best driver assistance technology in the industry by a leading third-party consumer group. Super Cruise is enhancing our reputation, elevating our brands and laying the foundation to generate substantial future subscription revenue for us as we move forward.  
To creatively illustrate how fun and liberating Super Cruise can be, Cadillac recently wrapped up its It's Time to Let Go campaign. It captured celebrities as they drove the 2021 Cadillac Escalade with Super Cruise and its new lane change capability. It was really fun to watch the reactions and how people quickly shifted from being cautiously curious to just pure excitement. We'll roll out Super Cruise to 22 models by the end of 2023, and we plan to add even more features. Our ultimate vision is that this system enables hands-free transportation in 95% of driving scenario.
What makes our large-scale deployment of Super Cruise and all of its new features possible is our Vehicle Intelligence Platform, or VIP, which connects every vehicle system into one advanced high-speed and very secure network. VIP's 4.5 terabytes of data processing power per hour represents a fivefold increase from our previous electrical architecture. That's enough capacity to manage all of the data loads of our self-driving technology, driver assistance systems, electric propulsion, over-the-air updates of every vehicle module, plus capacity to manage future applications.  
It's also an enabler for Software-as-a-Service, including new apps and capabilities that we can market to our customers, such as the latest must-have trailering and parking apps. By the end of '23, VIP will be on 7 million vehicles and 38 global models.  
Another major element of our growth strategy is our BrightDrop commercial delivery business, and it is progressing and on track. In March, our product and manufacturing teams reached an important milestone as they conducted EV600 prototype builds. Plans to build the BrightDrop EV600 at Cadillac -- excuse me, at GM Canada's CAMI Assembly in Ingersoll, are progressing rapidly. The BrightDrop team remains on track to reach its goal of delivering EV600s to its first customer, FedEx Express, by Q4 of this year.  
Interest is high and we continue to have active discussions with many prospective new customers who are seeking the efficient and zero-emission delivery solutions that BrightDrop offers. And this is encouraging as third parties estimate that the addressable market for eLCVs could be $30 billion by 2025 and double that in 2030.  
As our EV volumes grow, we are also investing in relationships to build a robust, reliable and easy-to-use public charging infrastructure. Last week, we revealed Ultium Charge 360, an innovative and holistic approach that integrates charging networks, GM vehicle mobile apps and other products and services to simplify the charging experience for GM EV owners. It builds on our existing work and partnerships to support a charging ecosystem that will give GM EV owners more confidence and convenience.  
We have signed agreements with 7 major charging networks, giving customers a more seamless access to nearly 60,000 plugs across the U.S. and China. As part of our existing collaboration with EVgo, we've opened the first 3 fast-charging stations in California, Florida and Washington, on our way to 2,700 plugs by the end of 2025. And we expect about 500 fast-charging stalls to go live by the end of this year.  
We'll continue to provide updates about Ultium Charge 360, including new elements and collaborations. 
The last major EV development I want to share follows up on our joint announcement last year with Honda that we will co-develop 2 Ultium-based EVs for Honda to be built in North America by the GM team. Honda recently confirmed these vehicles, a large SUV for the Honda brand and one for the Acura brand, and will launch in North America market for the 2024 model year. This further validates our Ultium technology, and we continue to work closely with Honda to expand our partnership and cooperation in key areas such as purchasing, research and development and connected services.  
Turning to AVs. Cruise continues to establish itself as a leading force in commercializing self-driving vehicle technology. In the latest funding round that closed after raising $2.75 billion, it included investments from Microsoft and Walmart, and this brings the valuation of Cruise to more than $30 billion, with GM continuing to own a majority stake.  
Cruise is moving steadily closer to commercialization. It's real-world driverless vehicle testing in San Francisco and its last-mile delivery pilot with Walmart in Scottsdale, Arizona will help pave the way for new commitments like the one Cruise just signed with the city of Dubai. Cruise will be the city's exclusive provider of self-driving taxis and ride-hailing services, with plans to deploy up to 4,000 self-driving vehicles by 2030. Dubai chose Cruise over several competitors, so it's another great validation of Cruise's technology and our overall approach to autonomous vehicles.  
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I want to quickly update you on our coronavirus measures. We remain diligent and disciplined with our safety protocols to keep employees safe as variants in new hotspots emerge. The GM medical team continues to monitor new COVID-19 cases globally, and our vaccine task force teams are working to understand vaccine administration priorities for each country and determine how we can best assist our employees, including operating vaccine clinics in several of our U.S. facilities.  
All the work GM medical has done behind the scenes was crucial as we restarted production last spring. And their work has helped the rest of the team stay focused on driving our business today and driving our growth strategy. I also want to recognize the entire GM team for its hard work, flexibility and resilience. In addition to our suppliers and our dealers who are helping us manage the semiconductor issues, we are also working to serve our customers and leveraging everything we can do to turn inventory quickly.  
Everyone has been remarkably dedicated, and it shows in our results, and we appreciate everyone's hard work. This is just the beginning for the next generation of General Motors. We are well on track with our plans to transform our company and lead the industry into the future, and we are pleased with the significant progress we have made on all fronts during the quarter.  
We look forward to building on the strong momentum and providing a more comprehensive update on our growth initiatives and progress later in the year. We plan to have an investor event in the Detroit area and will announce a date later in the summer because we would like this event to be face-to-face. We'll use this event to go deeper into our growth strategy and financial opportunities and everything that drives them, including software, hardware and services, along with our strong brands.  
So with that, I'll turn it over to Paul to provide more details on our financial performance and our full year guidance."
61206100,711339115,2270871,"General Motors Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","General Motors Company","Executives","Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join us this morning. This has been a very exciting first full quarter for me at GM. I see so much opportunity here for us to use our world-class capabilities in manufacturing, eng",2098,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join us this morning. This has been a very exciting first full quarter for me at GM. I see so much opportunity here for us to use our world-class capabilities in manufacturing, engineering and customer loyalty to really leverage these with our scale to achieve our growth initiatives. 
First, to set the stage before I get into the details, we had a great quarter, a first quarter record, in fact, despite the volatile backdrop. Our strong Q1 performance continues to highlight the resiliency of our business as well as our ability to take decisive actions to adapt to the fluid supply chain environment. In Q1, for example, we were able to build and wholesale more vehicles than forecasted and defer anticipated plant downtime. This strong operational execution, combined with the additional actions on price and expense reductions enabled us to deliver stronger-than-expected results for the quarter. 
We're collaborating across the global supply chain and working tirelessly to route available parts to the appropriate plants in order to maximize plant efficiency. We've been focused on leveraging every available semiconductor to build and ship our most popular and in-demand products, including our highly profitable full-size pickups and full-size SUVs. I'm very proud of the team for everything they've accomplished in the first quarter and what they're continuing to do, including strong pricing for every vehicle that we're able to produce, prioritizing production of higher-demand vehicles, continuing to be very controlled on costs and being agile across the board. 
As Mary mentioned, the full year 2021 guidance we outlined last quarter and reiterated a couple of times remains intact, and we expect to be at the higher end of our EBIT-adjusted range. We expect Q2 to reflect the largest impact of the production disruptions, resulting from supply shortages. The retiming of vehicles we produce without certain modules and plant downtime in the second quarter is expected to be significantly higher than Q1, resulting in lower EBIT-adjusted quarter-over-quarter. 
Our current view is that our first half EBIT adjusted will be around $5.5 billion. Recognizing the situation remains fluid, we're cautiously optimistic that our second half will be similar to or better than the first half. Importantly, our commitment to the acceleration of our EV product programs has not changed. Our important upcoming launches, including our GMC HUMMER EV Super Truck and Cadillac LYRIQ are on track. And the construction in Lordstown, Factory ZERO, Spring Hill and CAMI is progressing on schedule. We are still planning to invest $9 billion to $10 billion of CapEx in 2021. 
Finally, our earnings power and cash generation potential remains robust. In a more normalized environment, we expect that certain headwinds we're facing today will dissipate, but the strength of the underlying business powered by exceptional demand for our brands will remain. We expect that our normalized EBIT-adjusted performance will be strong as we continue producing and selling our in-demand and highly profitable full-size trucks and SUVs, while continuing to launch new and exciting products and services that position GM to win in the future of mobility. 
So let's get into the strong results of the quarter in more detail. In Q1, we generated $32.5 billion in net revenue, $4.4 billion in EBIT adjusted, 13.6% EBIT-adjusted margin and $2.25 in EPS diluted adjusted, and minus $1.9 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. We exceeded expectations by driving strong price and mix performance in North America through our production prioritization actions and our go-to-market strategy.
Additionally, high used vehicle prices due to low new vehicle inventories in part drove record results at GM Financial. Our adjusted automotive free cash flow of minus $1.9 billion was lower $1 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by the working capital impact from plant downtime and inventory carrying value of approximately $1.2 billion associated with vehicles built without certain modules due to the shortage of chips, which will reverse when those vehicles are completed, partially offset by strong EBIT performance. We ended Q1 with a strong automotive cash balance of $19 billion and total automotive liquidity of more than $37 billion. 
So let's take a closer look at North America. In Q1, North America delivered EBIT adjusted of $3.1 billion, up $900 million year-over-year and a 12.1% EBIT-adjusted margin, driven by continued strong pricing on our full-size pickups and performance from the launch of our new -- all-new full-size SUVs. Our average transaction prices were up 9% year-over-year for the quarter, with full-size trucks up 10% and full-size SUVs up over 20%, helping to overcome headwinds from commodity inflation and lower volumes. 
These results speak to the strength of the consumer and the strong brand equity we have in our products, which we plan to leverage as we roll out our EV portfolio. On the cost side, we continue to leverage efficiencies executed during COVID, including opportunities related to third-party services, travel and all discretionary spend. Teams across the organization have also gone above and beyond to meet strong and rising demand where they can. 
To drive strong sales with lower inventory, GM has introduced a new proprietary software application that helps dealers track vehicles from when they're completed at the plant to when they're released at their final destination. With many of our full-size trucks and SUVs being sold prior to arriving at the dealer or within days of hitting the lot, this software called VINVIEW allows dealers to both track vehicles and provide an informed estimated delivery time, enhancing the customer's arrival confidence and experience. 
Additionally, we also have a software application called focused ordering that includes a dashboard, which combines vehicle trim options with market data to help dealers ensure they're ordering the most in-demand products to meet customer preferences. This has been a huge help in our prioritization efforts. For example, of all the 2021 light-duty crew cab sales in the first quarter, about 60% were based on this focused ordering dashboard. And these models are turning 5.5 days faster than non-focused orders. 
In addition to these near-term benefits, we expect this technology to drive long-term cost efficiencies and lower inventories within the dealer network. And we still have a lot of excitement ahead of us this year as we complete renovation of Factory ZERO to launch the GMC HUMMER EV Super Truck this fall. Factory ZERO will also build the GMC HUMMER EV SUV and the Chevy Silverado full-size electric pickup, which is the first of many high-volume EV entries to come. And it will be the home of the Cruise Origin, a purpose-built all-electric and shared self-driving vehicle. 
And also, as Mary announced, our second battery plant recently in the last 18 months, which is a great indicator of our acceleration. Combined, these plants will have a capacity of over 70-gigawatt hours of production, and there are more being planned. We'll make additional cell capacity announcements as we progress in our product rollout. 
Let's move to GM International. We continue to be encouraged by our progress in GMI, with first quarter EBIT adjusted of $300 million, up $900 million year-over-year as we move past the initial effect of the pandemic in China. We also experienced positive price and mix benefits, as well as benefits from our structural cost actions across the segment. We delivered $300 million of equity income in China in Q1 due to higher volumes, stabilization in pricing and continued cost actions. 
EBIT-adjusted in GMI, excluding China, was up $400 million year-over-year, the second consecutive profitable quarter, as the semiconductor and commodities impact in the quarter was more than offset by the favorable pricing and mix. With continued semiconductor-driven plant downtime and low inventory levels, we expect Q2 to be challenged, but these results underscore the improvements in the region. 
A few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and our Corp segment. GM Financial has provided a significant offset to some of the semiconductor headwinds. Strong used vehicle prices, combined with consumer credit strength, helped to drive Q1 EBT adjusted of $1.2 billion, up $1 billion year-over-year. We received $600 million in dividends from GM Financial in Q1, and we anticipate dividends in 2021 from GMF will significantly exceed the 2020 dividend of $800 million, due in part to their expected upside in 2021. 
Cruise costs in the quarter were $200 million. And as Mary mentioned, Cruise continues to make great progress towards commercialization every day. Corp segment EBIT was $30 million in the quarter, a better-than-historical quarterly run rate, primarily due to mark-to-market gains in the period. 
Turning to our 2021 outlook for the calendar year. Last quarter, we outlined strong full year 2021 guidance of EBIT adjusted in the $10 billion to $11 billion range, including an estimated net semiconductor impact of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, which is calculated by taking loss contribution margin, offset by tactical efforts through costs, go-to-market actions and earnings growth at GM Financial. EPS diluted adjusted in the range of $4.50 to $5.25 and adjusted automotive free cash flow guidance in the $1 billion to $2 billion range, including an estimated semiconductor impact of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion. 
Since we shared guidance with you in February, the business has faced additional pressures due to semiconductor shortages as well as commodity inflation. Even though the gross impact of these headwinds has increased, the net impact remains the same as the company has identified additional mitigation initiatives, including pricing and mixed go-to-market strategies, growth at GM Financial, pull ahead of Oshawa full-size pickup production and other cost efficiencies. And what we've been able to prove in the fluid environment we're facing today is that we have the resiliency to flex to the challenges. 
In spite of the volatility in semiconductor availability, we're confident in achieving our full year 2021 outlook, including EBIT adjusted at the higher end of $10 billion to $11 billion, with the expectation that first half EBIT adjusted will be around $5.5 billion. We continue to expect EPS diluted adjusted of $4.50 and $5.25, and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1 billion to $2 billion. 
Our expectation is that Q2 will be the weakest quarter of the year as we increase plant downtime and continue to build vehicles without modules, impacting Q2 EBIT adjusted and working capital as we hold vehicles in inventory to wholesale later in the year once the semiconductors are received. 
We're managing the shortage through select plant downtime in the second quarter, which may extend into the second half. However, we plan on operating through the traditional U.S. summer shutdown in early Q3 at select facilities. We do not believe this short-term semiconductor headwind will affect our long-term earnings power and we remain committed to our growth initiatives in the EV acceleration we've previously communicated. 
In the medium to long term, we are focused on working cooperatively with our supply base and the semiconductor manufacturers to improve our line of sight on the full supply chain mapping and gain more control over the chip itself. We're working to proactively implement risk mitigation strategies that will help avoid future disruptions to the supply chain. And we've also learned a lot over the last year about our and our dealers' ability to manage at lower inventory levels. We're taking these learnings to implement dealer efficiency tools to optimize inventory levels, and we are creating sales tools to allow for more online shopping and purchase options. 
Finally, I want to reiterate our capital allocation priorities. I mentioned that the top priority for us is to invest in both new and existing businesses, with more than half going to accelerate EV growth, as well as continue a strong ICE portfolio that funds our journey while maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. 
To summarize, we had a strong beginning to the year, highlighting the strength of our underlying business. We have again demonstrated our strength, our flexibility, our laser focus on execution and our ability to manage through a significant disruption while still generating strong results. There are still big challenges ahead of us, but we have the team and expertise to navigate this while not losing sight of our vision. We will continue investing in exciting new growth opportunities, including EVs, battery supply and technology and software solutions that will drive growth and desirable differentiated products and services for our customers. 
Despite the challenging environment, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong results in 2021, and I couldn't be more proud of the GM family. 
This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call."

I suspect Q1 was better than you expected and that maybe this Renesas fires having a larger impact near term than you anticipated. But maybe if you can help us a little bit with what's happening behind the scenes. Number one, what's embedded in the implied Q2 earnings? Are all the earnings essentially coming from China and maybe GMF, near term? 
Number two, I assume that the full year $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion impact from semis that you talked about has a very large gross negative volume impact and some very large offsets from pricing and other things. Maybe if you can provide some color on the gross effects. And then lastly, what gives you confidence in the recovery?

But I'd first start off by saying the team is working to get every chip we can and to look at how do we leverage, maybe chips that we weren't planning to use and how do we leverage them as well as simplifying some things. So it's really the ingenuity and creativity of the team that is allowing us to build. Yes, the Renesas fire did have an impact, and the team goes to work and figures out how to offset or minimize it, and that's what they're doing. 
So I think there was a lot of great problem-solving that was done in the in Q1. We have said, we think Q2 will be the weakest, and then we see recovery coming in Q3 and Q4, and that's based on all the work the team is doing, working with suppliers, et cetera. So there's no -- it's just, chip by chip, working the issues to find solutions, and that's what the team is so good at doing. 
But it remains very dynamic. So I think to look here today and try to quantify exactly what all the ins and outs are going to be for the rest of the year, I think it would -- that'd be data that has a pretty short shelf life. But I think what you can count on and what we see with all the work that's been done across the whole supply chain and engineering team is that we have confidence that we're going to be able to hit our guidance and that with everything we know today, we'll be at the top end."

So some days, it gets a little better, some days it gets a little bit worse. And what we're trying to do is just kind of reorient everybody around -- this semiconductor challenge was baked into our full year expectations. 
Certainly, the timing is somewhat fluid, and you see that. The fact that the first quarter has blown out expectations in 2Q is under consensus. But if you actually look at the first half, when you add Q1 and Q2 together, it's actually exceeding where Street consensus was for the first half of the year. So I think we're pleased with the way that we're managing through this, and we want to try to keep it to the big picture because we can really get lost in the details on how fluid the situation is."

I think -- I don't think anybody would say that dealer-inventory levels are optimized right now. Just drive by some lots, and you see empty lots. It certainly means that we're operating much, much lower than what I think we even think is optimal. But as we mentioned in the comments, there's a lot of tools that we're learning how to operate at these lean levels that I think will provide some long-term efficiencies. 
And the dealer network has done really an amazing job of not only working with us, but also providing an environment for the customer that where the vehicle may not be immediately available, they give them reassurance to help drive that purchase transaction versus the customer being disappointed that the vehicle that he or she wants -- doesn't want isn't there on the lot. 
So that visibility, I think, undoubtedly, will help us over the long term. And we're taking those lessons and we're figuring out how to make sure that we manage that as efficiently as we can. But we certainly came into the year expecting to build inventories out of -- coming out of the COVID situation. That clearly is challenged amid some of the production issues that we've seen with the semiconductor shortage. But we certainly hope to build as we get into perhaps late 2021 into 2022 to start getting inventory levels at what we think is a much safer value to have vehicles on the lots, where customers want to purchase them."

And really excited with the progress they're showing in San Francisco. Obviously, Dubai is very significant as well. So you take that and I've always said, we have kind of a revolutionary and an evolutionary strategy around driver assistance all the way to full level 4, level 5 autonomy. So you see Cruise really focused on that full autonomy. 
But Super Cruise, we continue to add more and more features. And we've said that we envision that to get 95% of being able to handle all solutions. Later in the decade, I believe, and there's a lot to still unfold, but I believe we'll have personal autonomous vehicles, and then that will leverage the capability we have at Cruise with the capability that we have at the car company to really be well positioned to delight the customers from that perspective. 
So both paths are very important because the technology we put on vehicles today, I think, makes them safer and delights the customers, and it's going to give us an opportunity for subscription revenue.

So Paul, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about sequential factors of profitability comparing first half to second half. So you're calling for similar levels of profitability of $5.5 billion each. But obviously, in the first half, you started off very strong in the first quarter and a lot of the headwinds in the second quarter are somewhat unusual and unlikely to repeat. So there's obviously some offset of raw materials and cost and pricing. But just could you sort of talk about these various factors?"

It's obviously a challenging environment to be able to be thinking about longer term, even 6 months, 9 months ahead as we are navigating through this. So I think what we see is, what I would say, cautious optimism",272,"Yes. Thanks, Emmanuel, for that question. It's obviously a challenging environment to be able to be thinking about longer term, even 6 months, 9 months ahead as we are navigating through this. So I think what we see is, what I would say, cautious optimism. So while we talk about the second half of the year being similar or potentially slightly better than the first half, there's some caution in that. So for example, things like the used car vehicle prices that GM Financial is clearly benefiting from -- that's likely to stay in place as long as new car inventories remain low. So that's an example of, I would say, a variable that's sort of hedged directly against the challenges of the semiconductor. 
But as more vehicles come online, and I think most industrial forecasts are that chip availability is going to be better in the second half than it is in the first half, and I think we think that's true as well, that could lead to pricing that maybe isn't as strong as it was in the first quarter. So I think we're trying to maintain some caution and some rationality. The reality is we're -- we and others are right in the middle of this. I think we're doing a really good job of managing through it, as evidenced by the first quarter and the fact that the first half of the year is coming in above consensus estimates before we announced, that it's trying to provide a mix of reassurance in the projections that we've given, as well as some cautious optimism about what the future holds."

And I think as we continue to lean in and accelerate some of those vehicle programs, we are investing resources to be able to do that. As to the first part of your question, clearly, commodity inflations had a massive impact, you just need to look at some of the indices to be able to see that. But we're not really isolating that because we're taking all of the cost pressures that we've seen, both from our initial expectations and what's constantly changing, and putting that all into the same bucket. 
So much the same way that the semiconductor issue is fluid in day-to-day, so are the commodity prices going forward. So while we have a little bit of forward purchasing going on, obviously, in the supply chain, there's some exposure out there, but there's also some potential goodness if prices normalize. So we're trying to keep all of that very, very fluid as we manage it in the aggregate, both in terms of go-to-market strategies as well as production prioritization."

I mean, is it really too tight? And what do you mean by like going back to something that's more normal? I mean if you look at the last 3 quarters, I mean I think the inventory was 492,000 in the third quarter of last year, and now you're at 335,000. So is it somewhere in that ZIP code?

So rest assured that this is not PowerPoint, these are real initiatives that are being executed on an accelerated fashion. 
As it relates to Dubai, I mean, I think it highlights the fact that as we grow not only in Dubai, but in other cities across the United States, across North America and across the world, we're uniquely positioned in the AV space because we have the ability to produce those vehicles. I mean we're already tooling up the Origin to be produced at Factory ZERO. So that's a huge opportunity for us. And to your point, that's going to drive to the bottom line. 
So I'm very excited about the future growth opportunities that we have with Cruise, with the production of the vehicles we'll do for that. But then with all these additional -- whether they're going into other markets, like we can leverage with Ultium, expanding in a market we don't really operate that much in right now from a commercial vehicle perspective with EVs, with BrightDrop and beyond, with things like OnStar Insurance and subscriptions for things like Super Cruise.

And since you didn't give more clear color on implied second quarter, I think what would really help investors here is if you could compare that second quarter production maybe versus expectations at the beginning of the year.

I would say, in all honesty, that Q2 is probably worse than we expected. It was going to be a few months ago. But that's due in part to some of the timing of how we map this out. So what I would say is that we are carefully evaluating the short-term supply chain, the intermediate term supply chain and some of the longer-term issues as well. 
So depending on the confidence of where we see chips coming in and which chips, and our ability to reallocate those and reprioritize those, we did see an opportunity to accelerate some production into Q1 to take advantage of the market that we see right now, which is obviously very, very strong and the confidence to be able to make up some of that volume in Q2. So that's why I think we need to be really cautious as we're thinking about the full year. What gives us the confidence is the agility that the team has displayed in being able to respond to this and how dynamic it really is. 
So part of the reason we don't want to anchor in on production volumes and so on is just because that's going to change. It's going to change next week. It's going to change the week after. Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse. So it's really trying to operate in at this level of where we need to take go-to-market strategies, where we need to prioritize mix, where we need to accelerate or potentially shut down a plant in anticipation of some challenges that are coming up over the short to medium term. Then that's kind of what we're doing. You saw that going into plant downtime in Q1. 
So I wouldn't say that Q1 was immune from the semiconductor challenges. I think, certainly, the consumer has proven to be very robust. Used car values continue to go up, which I think is endemic of the inventory challenges that we see across the board and that everybody sees. So all of that is just -- is working in concert into what I would say is a very agile plan for us to meet our objectives. 
It's also why we're trying to steer this to the first half versus Q1 and Q2. So there isn't necessarily a readthrough in the short term because something that happens in March versus something that happens in April isn't really all that relevant to how we're thinking about managing through this. And that's why we have the confidence of looking at where first half expectations were despite the disparity between Q1 and Q2. We actually think that we're performing ahead of expectations that were outlined at the beginning of the year. We just want to be cautious about that in the back half, if that makes sense."

And there seems to be, clearly, this war against ICE waged by governments, by consumers, regulators, right, and then lately OEMs, waging their own war against ICE. And when I talk to car companies and management teams like you on the topic of potential write-downs or impairments, I ask this because many of these investments, of course, that you've made in ICE go a decade or more, 15, maybe even closer to 20 years in some instances. And so I -- maybe it's too soon, but I'd love to get your view on when, along with this journey away from ICE, would it be appropriate as you sit down with your auditors to think about curtailment of useful life and that impact, the financial impact, because it could really change your results, and I think it's pretty relevant. 
If I'm wrong, tell me how I'm wrong, because I'm scratching my head thinking how do you avoid at some point? Is it just you're making too much damn money selling ICE stuff right now, and it's just that the fit isn't right and we need to wait for things to get worse? Help me out there on the impairment potential, over time. I'm not asking -- it's not a 2021 issue, but as we look out."

For General Motors, I think this is a growth opportunity for us because there's a lot of EV interest on the coast. That's where we don't get what I would call our fair share. And frankly, I'm going after more than our fair share on the strength of our product portfolio. So that's point one. We see this as a growth opportunity not only in the U.S. in markets we are in, but in growing into other markets we're currently not participating in. 
I would also say, with the assets that we have right now, when you look at converting a plant from a plant that builds ICE vehicles to those that produce electric vehicles, there's a lot of reuse, body shop structures, or machinery and equipment, a paint shop, which is a 30- to 35-year asset. It doesn't care if it's paint -- what the propulsion system is in the vehicle that we're going to be painting. And so there's a lot of capital that can be reused as we go forward. 
I would also say, with every new internal combustion engine propelled vehicle that we put out, we're looking to make it better for the environment from a fuel economy emission CO2 perspective. And I also think you have to look at the fact that right now, battery costs are coming down, but look at what's in the marketplace right now. I think we're really one of the only people that have an all-electric vehicle that's as affordable as the Bolt EV. We've got to make sure, as we move to an all-electric future, that it truly is for everyone. 
So that's more than an advertising tagline. That's something that General Motors is very much committed to, making sure everybody -- because ESG has an S in the middle of it, which is making sure we're doing the right thing for everyone. So I think we're moving at a very quick speed to be able to provide EVs for everyone. I think it's going to be a growth opportunity for General Motors. And I think a lot of the assets that we currently have can be reused in an all-EV world."

Thanks for joining us. Today, Paul and I will provide some insights into our record results and then talk about our outlook for the second half.

Today, Paul and I will provide some insights into our record results and then talk about our outlook for the second half. As we announced earlier, we achieved EBIT adjusted of $4.1 billion in the second quarter and $8.5 billion in the first half, including charges for recalls, primarily the Bolt EV. I really want to thank our employees and the extended GM team, including our suppliers and our dealers for helping us deliver such consistently strong results. Everyone continues to demonstrate remarkable resiliency and adaptability in a rapidly changing environment. 
In addition, our ROIC adjusted of 27.3% in the quarter significantly exceeded our target. This underlines how our strong returns enable us to reinvest in the future of this business. The reinvestment includes accelerated investments in our electric and autonomous strategy to build a future that is better for our customers and better for the environment, and we'll discuss this a bit more in a few minutes. 
All-electric is an important point of distinction. Because of the performance, range, flexibility and scalability of our Ultium and Hydrotec platforms, including the work we're doing to continually drive cost reduction, we don't need to depend on partial solutions like hybrids and electrified ICE vehicles. Instead, we're primarily focused on investments that achieve the end solution of zero emissions more quickly. 
Before we move on, I will share my perspective on our recall of the 2017 to '19 model year Bolt EVs and then the status of the semiconductor situation. So let's start with the Bolt. Across the company, we have made both product and workplace safety everyone's responsibility. Our focus is on prevention but also moving with a sense of urgency when problems do arise. When we learned of a potential of 2 new battery fires that were part of our previous recall population, we acted quickly. 
We did an investigation and our engineering analysis identified 2 rare manufacturing defects in some cells manufactured by our supplier in the '17 to '19 time frame, so we instituted a second recall with the overriding priority of doing the right thing. Because cells for 2020 and later vehicles were built using improved manufacturing processes, the recall does not impact newer Bolt EVs or EUVs. And since the recall, we have worked with our supplier and partner to make further process improvements. Just as important, the recall doesn't impact the Ultium platform. It is a different battery system, and our joint venture plants that manufacture Ultium cells will follow rigorous GM quality processes. 
As for semiconductors, the situation does remain fluid, and the supply chain continues to be impacted by events like what is happening right now with the COVID spike in Malaysia. While we informed our employees yesterday that some truck production will be impacted next week, even as we resume production at some crossover plants, we remain confident in our team's ability to continue to find creative solutions that minimize the impact on our highest-demand and capacity-constrained vehicles, including full-size trucks and SUVs. 
We are raising our guidance for full year EBIT-adjusted to $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion. And we are being cautious because of the uncertainty due to the Delta variant and its potential impact on the supply chain. But we do believe that the combination of our safety protocols and the rising vaccination rates will help minimize disruptions but we do have to note the situation does remain fluid. 
We are also putting long-term solutions in place to derisk our supply chain. This includes collaborating with semiconductor manufacturers and continuing to enhance transparency throughout the entire semiconductor supply chain. 
So now let's turn to growth. As I mentioned in my letter to shareholders, we are addressing the entire ecosystem to speed EV adoption and commercialization of self-driving technology at scale. We will offer a full range of vehicles and services that make EVs accessible to the largest possible customer base. We'll also create job opportunities for thousands of employees in our Ultium Cells joint venture. In addition, we will work to grow our businesses like BrightDrop, OnStar Insurance and other software and services, including subscriptions. 
The Cruise model for autonomous rideshare is another great example of an inclusive solution because it will make all-electric transportation more accessible and affordable. Delivering on our EV all-electric future requires a value change that is secure, sustainable, scalable and cost competitive. To do this, we are creating a diversified value chain of environmentally-friendly and geographically diverse footprints through investments, strategic partnerships and supply agreements. 
For example, we are working with suppliers to develop new sources in the United States for lithium, a key battery cell component, and accelerate the adoption of extraction methods which have less of an impact on the environment. We're taking a similar approach across other critical minerals needed to support our EV future. And we're confident that our strategy will secure our supply in a sustainable way as we accelerate our transition to EVs. 
We'll share more about these key topics and others, including battery cost and business opportunities that we're creating with software, at our investor event on October 6 and 7, which we hope will be in person because we are so looking forward to having you experience technologies like Watts to Freedom in the GMC Hummer EV pickup as well as Super Cruise, which we are constantly advancing its capabilities. Just last month, for example, we demonstrated the latest version of Super Cruise technology that will be featured on the Sierra 1500 Denali late in the 2022 model year. It will include the ability to trailer while driving hands-free. 
We will also update you on Cruise, which continues to make excellent progress towards launching its first fully driverless commercial service. GM remains a major accelerator of Cruise's mission with the purpose-built origin giving Cruise a huge competitive advantage. 
I also want to take a moment to share some new insights into our plan to launch more than 30 EVs globally by 2025 and become the EV market leader in North America. As we recently announced, because we are increasing our 2020 to 2025 capital and engineering investment from $27 billion to $35 billion, we will add 2 new vehicles to our commercial portfolio. The first is a full-sized battery electric cargo van for Chevrolet, which will exceed the expectations of small business owners, tradespeople and anyone else who has been well served by the Chevrolet Express. 
The second is a medium-duty truck that will put both Ultium and our Hydrotec hydrogen fuel cell technology to work, powering service and utility vehicles such as school buses, bucket trucks, wreckers and more. Both will complement BrightDrop and keep our commercial fleet market share growing, and we'll share more details about these products as we move forward. 
Now if you step back for a moment and think about what this means for the future of work and the greenhouse gas reduction from surface transportation, because when you say between these new trucks, BrightDrop, EV pickups coming from Chevrolet and GMC and our work with [indiscernible] locomotives and Navistar on semi trucks, we will have electric solutions for almost any towing or hauling jobs you can imagine. 
Hydrotec is a very important part of the equation because it expands our reach into additional growth markets. We're already at work on our first production fuel cells leveraging innovative manufacturing processes that can unlock economies of scale and reduce overall costs. This technology, along with our 4 U.S. battery plants that we have announced and the full portfolio of EVs we are planning, in addition to the customer experience we're creating, underscore once again how determined we are to lead. 
The determination reaches through the entire company. And when I meet with our employees, they tell me how incredibly excited they are to be part of a once-in-a-generation transformation that will truly change the world. Their tenacity and collective commitment to our vision are why we are delivering such strong business results and advancing our future so quickly. So now for a closer look at our results and the outlook, I'll turn the call over to Paul."

We appreciate you taking the time to join us this morning. We've just experienced another very exciting quarter for the company with robust financial performance, and we're taking advantage of opportunities to accelerate our growth strategy with the additional investments we announced in EV and AV technology and that which Mary just outlined. 
During the quarter, we announced expectations of first half EBIT adjusted in the $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion range, which we achieved despite an $800 million charge related to the Bolt EV recall and $400 million primarily related to the side airbag recall late in the quarter, which were not included in our first half guidance range. I'll get into the details of these results in a minute, but first, really wanted to highlight the overall strength in the business driven by the incredible demand environment for our new end-use vehicles, allowing us to deliver results that are better all-in than we expected coming into the year. 
For instance, we saw an increase in our vehicle production in May and June versus what was projected on our earnings call in early May, and we were able to pull ahead some chip availability into Q2 from Q3. This has all led to the significantly improved performance in the first half of the year. We are seeing new challenges in the third quarter due to global COVID outbreaks, including the current outbreak in Malaysia resulting in closures of assembly, test and packaging facilities for semiconductors. This remains, as we said, a fluid and rapidly changing environment. 
Given our first half performance and our expectations for the rest of the year, we are raising our full year EBIT-adjusted guidance to an expected range of $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion from the $10 billion to $11 billion previous range. While raw materials continue to be a significant year-over-year headwind as platinum group metals and steel prices have continued to increase this year, we have been mitigating the impact by managing several other factors, including pricing and mix, go-to-market strategies, record profits at GM Financial and other cost efficiencies. We are providing a wider guidance range than typical, given the fluid semiconductor situation and expect our variability within the range to be primarily driven by production volumes. 
So let's get into the strong results of the quarter in more detail. In Q2, we generated $34.2 billion in net revenue, $4.1 billion in EBIT adjusted, 12% EBIT-adjusted margin, $1.97 in EPS diluted adjusted and $2.5 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. We exceeded expectations by driving strong price and mix performance in North America through our production prioritization actions and our go-to-market strategy. Additionally, high used vehicle prices drove continued record results at GM Financial. 
So let's take a closer look at North America. In Q2, North America delivered EBIT adjusted of $2.9 billion against the backdrop of strong pricing on our full-size pickups and continued performance from the launch of our all-new full-size SUVs, partially offset by warranty charges in material and commodity costs. We generated a 10.4% EBIT-adjusted margin in the region. 
Our strong average transaction price is up over 14% year-over-year, speak to the high demand for our full-size trucks and SUVs. A big contributor to this increase is the demand for premium trims, our platinum sport and premium luxury trims on Escalades doubled. And on Yukon, our Denali and AT4 represent more than 2/3 of all Yukon sales. 
Our volume has been constrained by very tight inventories, which we believe is having a temporary impact on market share in the region. We ended the quarter with approximately 212,000 units in dealer inventory. We expect continued high demand in the second half of this year with continued low inventory into and through 2022. 
Let's move to GM International. GMI EBIT adjusted was up $300 million year-over-year as we experienced positive price and mix benefits across the segment. Second quarter equity income in China was $300 million, driven also by strong mix, stabilization in pricing and material cost performance, more than offsetting headwinds due to the chip supply shortage and higher commodity costs. In addition, we received a $600 million dividend from our China automotive JVs in Q2. 
EBIT adjusted in GMI, excluding China, was up $200 million year-over-year as a result of favorable pricing and mix. The underlying strength of the GMI business continues to improve as the team drives pricing, mix and cost optimization. However, we do expect some challenges in the second half, primarily due to semiconductor-driven plant downtime. 
Few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and our Corp segment. GM Financial has continued to deliver, with record Q2 EBT adjusted of $1.6 billion and is benefiting from both strong used vehicle prices and continued favorable consumer credit checks. We received $1.2 billion in dividends from GM Financial year-to-date, and we anticipate additional dividends to be paid in 2021 as we benefit from their record earnings. Cruise costs in the quarter were $300 million and Corp segment EBIT was a loss of $40 million, which was better than normal run rate due to mark-to-market gains on investments, partially offsetting costs. 
Now let's turn to our 2021 second half outlook. When thinking about the second half of the year performance, there are some fundamental pressures versus what we've seen in the first half. We've seen commodity inflation continue to rise. And while it's come down off the peaks, we expect second half commodity expense to be $1.5 billion to $2 billion higher than the first half of the year. 
At GM Financial, we expect second half headwinds of $1 billion to $1.5 billion versus the first half as we do not assume allowance adjustments experienced in the first half will repeat and we expect lower lease termination volume. Record high purchase rates are capping the gains at contract residual value and the start of credit normalization. We expect our growth initiative investments in the second half to increase by about $500 million. And the first half also contained $400 million in mark-to-market gains on equity investments that we do not assume will repeat. All of this adds up to about $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion of headwinds in the second half of the year. 
In addition, we expect North American volumes to be approximately 100,000 units lower in the second half versus the first, including some impact from our full-size pickup truck and SUV plants, primarily as a result of some of the near-term pressures in Malaysia impacting plants across North America. Otherwise, we expect the robust demand and pricing environment to continue as we get into 2022.  
From a full year perspective, we expect EPS diluted adjusted in the range of $5.40 to $6.40 and adjusted automotive free cash flow guidance in the $1 billion to $2 billion range. This semiconductor shortage, as we said, remains fluid and the supply chain challenges continue in the second half of the year. Our guidance assumes no year-end work-in-process inventory related to vehicles produced without modules. Significant cash flows could shift from 2021 to 2022 if we have these work-in-process vehicles held at year-end. We continue to expect CapEx for the year to be in the $9 billion to $10 billion range. 
So in summary, we had a very strong first half of the year. I think it highlights the strength of our underlying business. We've again demonstrated our flexibility, our laser focus on execution and our ability to manage through a significant disruption while generating strong results, and we don't expect that to change. There are still some challenges ahead of us, but we have the team and expertise to navigate this while not losing sight of our vision. 
We will continue investing in exciting new growth opportunities, including EVs, battery supply and technology and software solutions that will drive growth as well as desirable and differentiated products and services for our customers. We look forward to sharing more around these opportunities at our Investor Day on October 6 and 7. This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call."

So to be essentially flat to that level, we don't see as a material downgrade to kind of the trends that we've seen in the business right now. 
I think what you're hearing from us is sort of a very real acknowledgment of what we see out there with COVID. Now it may turn out to be less impactful than we think it is. But I think the approach that we've taken through this has been pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter as we're cautious. We started pointing out some of the challenges that we were seeing in the forward supply chain in Malaysia really going back into late May, early June time frame. And unfortunately, it just wasn't able to catch up on their vaccination rates, but they're making good progress. So we want to take a little bit of a cautious tone because we want to maintain credibility around these ranges. And if we see the environment improve, then I think we'll respond accordingly."

So Brian, I think if you look at our full-size truck production, we've actually been performing remarkably well. The shutdowns that were announced yesterday are really the first ones kind of the full -- first full ones that we've taken this year. So -- and it is somewhat short term that we see that, we're managing this week to week. I think the bulk of -- when we look at the bulk of the 100,000 units from first -- second half to first half is really in crossovers. We think truck production and full-size SUV are relatively stable over that time period. But again, we're going to continue to watch that. 
The vehicles that are built without the modules, I think, present for us, as we've talked about before, a strong option for us. In fact, when we have downtime in the plants like we've announced, we're actually using some of that where we've got availability of the chips that were slated for production that can't be produced. We're redeploying those into some of those vehicles that have been produced earlier, allows us to maintain a little bit of the wholesaling momentum going forward. 
So we're going to continue to watch that, we're going to continue to do it. We're being careful to make sure that above all else, we're managing quality for the vehicles, and the manufacturing and engineering teams have really done an amazing job of managing through the logistical difficulties of doing it. But we continue to see that as a very useful tool for us to navigate this in the short run."

So we're really well positioned with a nice portfolio, which allows us to focus our investment on electric -- full electric products. And as we work to make that transition, yes, we see, at the early days, some pricing pressure due to battery costs, but that's why we're so aggressively taking battery -- working to take battery costs down with multiple technology road maps. You will hear us talk more about that when we're together in October. 
But then we also see filling that gap will be the strong foundation that we have to build on as it relates to software and subscriptions. Now that we have our vehicle intelligent platform, which allows for full over-the-air updates and that we started launching that new VIP in 2019 with the CT4 and the CT5 and then the Corvette and it continues, that's going to give us a lot of opportunity for more software services that we can provide that customers value and therefore will pay for as well as subscriptions. 
So if you think about it, I see the opportunity we have, and then I haven't even really talked about the growth opportunity you have with leveraging the Ultium platform, leveraging the Hydrotec platform as well as growing our commercial vehicle business and with BrightDrop in some of the vehicles that we talked about today. So there's tremendous growth opportunity that will, as we get battery costs down, will be sitting on top of the strong margins we have today. 
So we see it in the interim kind of filling the hole, but we're working quickly and think we have a leadership position in battery cell cost. That's why we've announced the 4 plants. So I see a huge growth opportunity as we move through this transition."

Your costs were up $3.9 billion year-over-year in the quarter. Sounds like there's a few unusual pieces there like the warranty, which you called out, and I appreciate you talking about that $1.2 billion. That wasn't in Street expectations. And I think you had about $1 billion year-over-year in Q2 from nonrecurrence of last year's austerity. So that means that there's probably $1.7 billion or so of commodities and other materials year-over-year. And everyone's experiencing that. 
So my question is, do you think that, that means that actually that some of the -- a significant part of the pricing that we're seeing in the industry, we shouldn't think about that in isolation. We should think about that against the material and commodity because it's really just offsetting variable costs. And if so, just -- if you can just give us a sense of what you're kind of aiming for with regard to North American margins once the dust settles."

The -- I wouldn't attribute all -- you did a good breakdown of some of the cost inflation and the warranties and what we saw on the recalls. But I wouldn't attribute all the remaining to just inflation of the underlying materials because the other thing that's going on is we are producing a much richer mix with more options and features. So material costs are up but those are positive margin accretive sales, so we're actually encouraged by that going forward. 
So there's no doubt we've had strong margin performance. And I think what you said -- what we've tried to facilitate for the guidance that we put forward here is the underlying environment. I don't think we see any meaningful reasons to expect it to change in terms of the demand in the short run and even into 2022, where we continue to see depressed inventories. I think when the chip situation resolves itself, it's not going to probably be a massive sort of influx of manufacturing right out of the gate. 
So we do see continued tight inventories going into 2022. So I think one of the cautions about the second half is to not read too much into it and extrapolate that as a 2022 performance. We'll give more guidance on 2022 as we get through the budget process and towards the end of the year with what we see. But there's nothing fundamentally different about demand that we see changing in the near term."

So just to clarify, do you believe that once the dust settles, a 10%-plus margin is sustainable in North America?

And just secondly, just as we're thinking about that 2022, just starting from the midpoint of this year's guidance, you have $12.5 billion. It looks like if we just look at the commodity investment, GMF and mark-to-market delta that you laid out for the second half and offset that with the nonoccurrence of recalls, there's maybe a $2.5 billion drag into next year from those things. 
Can you just be a little bit more specific on what the recovery in volume actually means? Because this year, you're only going to do about 2.5 million vehicles. Are we correct in assuming that a more normal run rate for you at this point is in the 3.1 million, 3.2 million unit range?"

So I think you've attributed some of the headwinds, but like I said, we got to be cautious not to read into it. So for example, if you look at commodities, we saw some of the pressure in first half. The lion's share of it is hitting us in the second half, but commodity prices are down off their peaks. 
So while we'll see a little bit of pressure in the first half, if prices stay at these levels, we would actually expect a little bit of uplift as we go into the second half of '22. But there's a long time between here and there that we have to be cautious. And production will certainly be higher next year as we hope and expect that the chips will normalize. 
But like we said, from the very beginning, we've approached this thing with caution because I can't tell you how fluid it has been as we manage week to week. But I think when you look at the underlying results and what we've been able to produce in the first half of the year, I think what you've got is a team that has executed incredibly well even versus some of our peers and competitors, and I don't expect that to change going forward."

So for example, like D&A won't go up medium term from inflation but instead only as you replace assets over time, right, and your substantial hourly labor costs in the U.S. were, in 2019, already agreed upon through 2023, so you shouldn't be seeing the same pressure from wage inflation that other companies are likely to seek.

But I think if you look to the comments that I made that we're looking not only for semiconductors but for other critical minerals and other critical materials that we need for our battery strategy to have long-term supply, whether it's investment that we make, partnerships we do or supply agreements. And so I think when you look at that, along with the fact that some of these material or precious metals, we're looking to reduce our need for them with the technology, specifically the chemistry and the battery. So I think we're looking to manage that very carefully as we accelerate the move to EVs. And then for the hedge, I'll turn to you, Paul."

I mean, on the hedging, we use some options just mainly as sort of a cheaper insurance against large moves. We also just have some embedded price sharing mechanisms in the supply chain agreements themselves, whether it's averaging, et cetera. So we try to manage that holistically. I don't think we're overreacting to that because, look, materials inflation is just an underlying cost to the business, and we have to make sure that we can  take the steps necessary. 
So for example, the engineering team is always looking at ways to reduce material spend, drive efficiencies into the business, et cetera. And that's the most basic, most important hedge because it results in a permanent savings within the business. So I don't want to rely too much on sort of financial derivatives to delay or defer a problem that we need to be solving over the long term anyway."

Is this consistent with how you've been working with your suppliers in taking on a bit more of that cost? And do you have any estimate what that might have been in the quarter in terms of incremental material or component costs?

We really appreciate your questions and for participating today. I want to step back and say when we look at our team's dedication to everything that we have been working to offset and accelerate, we are building a stronger and a better future for our company and for our stakeholders and for the communities in which we live and work. 
By exceeding our business targets, we have the resources to move more quickly toward creating an all-EV future and all-AV future. And when you look at the combination of our Ultium battery platforms, our Hydrotec platforms for sealed cells as well as our software and platform that we've named Ultifi, we really think that we have a strategy that will allow us to drive higher revenue, operating efficiencies and improved and outstanding customer experience. 
When you look at Ultium, it does deliver better performance range, and then it gives us flexibility and scalability that is going to allow us to accelerate the EVs that we're going to put into market across the entire portfolio. And the work that we'll share more of what we're doing to continue to improve battery costs will also allow us to open up into not only more segments but also markets outside the auto industry. 
And then when you think about, from a software perspective, the strength that we have of OnStar, our ability to do over-the-air updates and the work that we have from a processing power perspective in the vehicle as well as the cybersecurity perspective, we think we have an ecosystem that will increase and build on the leading loyalty that we have will allow us to provide unmatched personalization. We'll expand features, like we've already talked about, with Super Cruise and really create new connected services. 
So I couldn't be more excited about the future of the business and the opportunities that we have for growth and margin expansion when we look at all these different businesses. So we look forward to hosting you in October, and we truly believe you will experience this future for yourselves. So thanks, everybody, again, for your time, and please stay safe."

Thanks for joining us. Today, Paul and I will provide some insights into our record results and then talk about our outlook for the second half. As we announced earlier, we achieved EBIT adjusted of $4.1 billio",1366,"Thanks, Rocky, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Today, Paul and I will provide some insights into our record results and then talk about our outlook for the second half. 
As we announced earlier, we achieved EBIT adjusted of $4.1 billion in the second quarter and $8.5 billion in the first half, including charges for recalls, primarily the Bolt EV. I really want to thank our employees and the extended GM team, including our suppliers and our dealers, for helping us deliver such consistently strong results. Everyone continues to demonstrate remarkable resiliency and adaptability in a rapidly changing environment.  
In addition, our ROIC adjusted of 27.3% in the quarter significantly exceeded our target. This underlines how our strong returns enable us to reinvest in the future of this business. The reinvestment includes accelerated investments in our electric and autonomous strategy to build a future that is better for our customers and better for the environment, and we'll discuss this a bit more in a few minutes.  
All-electric is an important point of distinction. Because of the performance, range, flexibility and scalability of our Ultium and Hydrotec platforms, including the work we're doing to continually drive cost reduction, we don't need to depend on partial solutions like hybrids and electrified ICE vehicles. Instead, we're primarily focused on investments that achieve the end solution of zero emissions more quickly.  
Before we move on, I will share my perspective on our recall of the 2017 to '19 model year Bolt EVs and then the status of the semiconductor situation. So let's start with the Bolt. Across the company, we have made both product and workplace safety everyone's responsibility. Our focus is on prevention but also moving with a sense of urgency when problems do arise. When we learned of a potential of 2 new battery fires that were part of our previous recall population, we acted quickly.  
We did an investigation and our engineering analysis identified 2 rare manufacturing defects in some cells manufactured by our supplier in the '17 to '19 time frame, so we instituted a second recall with the overriding priority of doing the right thing. Because cells for 2020 and later vehicles were built using improved manufacturing processes, the recall does not impact newer Bolt EVs or EUVs. And since that recall, we have worked with our supplier and partner to make further process improvements.  
Just as important, the recall doesn't impact the Ultium platform. It is a different battery system, and our joint venture plants that manufacture Ultium cells will follow rigorous GM quality processes.  
As for semiconductors, the situation does remain fluid, and the supply chain continues to be impacted by events like what is happening right now with the COVID spike in Malaysia. While we informed our employees yesterday that some truck production will be impacted next week, even as we resume production at some crossover plants, we remain confident in our team's ability to continue to find creative solutions that minimize the impact on our highest-demand and capacity-constrained vehicles, including full-size trucks and SUVs.  
We are raising our guidance for full year EBIT-adjusted to $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion. And we are being cautious because of the uncertainty due to the Delta variant and its potential impact on the supply chain. But we do believe that the combination of our safety protocols and the rising vaccination rates will help minimize disruptions, but we do have to note the situation does remain fluid.  
We are also putting long-term solutions in place to  derisk our supply chain. This includes collaborating with semiconductor manufacturers and continuing to enhance transparency throughout the entire semiconductor supply chain.
So now let's turn to growth. As I mentioned in my letter to shareholders, we are addressing the entire ecosystem to speed EV adoption and commercialization of self-driving technology at scale. We will offer a full range of vehicles and services that make EVs accessible to the largest possible customer base. We'll also create job opportunities for thousands of employees in our Ultium Cells joint venture. In addition, we will work to grow our businesses like BrightDrop, OnStar Insurance and other software and services, including subscriptions.  
The Cruise model for autonomous rideshare is another great example of an inclusive solution because it will make all-electric transportation more accessible and affordable. Delivering on our EV all-electric future requires a value change that is secure, sustainable, scalable and cost competitive. To do this, we are creating a diversified value chain of environmentally friendly and geographically diverse footprints through investments, strategic partnerships and supply agreements.  
For example, we are working with suppliers to develop new sources in the United States for lithium, a key battery cell component, and accelerate the adoption of extraction methods which have less of an impact on the environment. We're taking a similar approach across other critical minerals needed to support our EV future. And we're confident that our strategy will secure our supply in a sustainable way as we accelerate our transition to EVs. 
We'll share more about these key topics and others, including battery cost and business opportunities that we're creating with software, at our investor event on October 6 and 7, which we hope will be in person because we are so looking forward to having you experience technologies like Watts to Freedom in the GMC HUMMER EV pickup, as well as Super Cruise, which we are constantly advancing its capabilities. Just last month, for example, we demonstrated the latest version of Super Cruise technology that will be featured on the Sierra 1500 Denali late in the 2022 model year. It will include the ability to trailer while driving hands-free.  
We will also update you on Cruise, which continues to make excellent progress towards launching its first fully driverless commercial service. GM remains a major accelerator of Cruise's mission with the purpose-built origin, giving Cruise a huge competitive advantage.  
I also want to take a moment to share some new insights into our plan to launch more than 30 EVs globally by 2025 and become the EV market leader in North America. As we recently announced, because we are increasing our 2020 to 2025 capital and engineering investment from $27 billion to $35 billion, we will add 2 new vehicles to our commercial portfolio. The first is a full-sized battery electric cargo van for Chevrolet, which will exceed the expectations of small business owners, tradespeople and anyone else who has been well served by the Chevrolet Express.  
The second is a medium-duty truck that will put both Ultium and our Hydrotec hydrogen fuel cell technology to work, powering service and utility vehicles such as school buses, bucket trucks, wreckers and more. Both will complement BrightDrop and keep our commercial fleet market share growing, and we'll share more details about these products as we move forward.  
Now if you step back for a moment and think about what this means for the future of work and the greenhouse gas reduction from surface transportation, because when you say between these new trucks, BrightDrop, EV pickups coming from Chevrolet and GMC and our work with Wabtec on locomotives and Navistar on semi trucks, we will have electric solutions for almost any towing or hauling jobs you can imagine.  
Hydrotec is a very important part of the equation because it expands our reach into additional growth markets. We're already at work on our first production fuel cells leveraging innovative manufacturing processes that can unlock economies of scale and reduce overall costs. This technology, along with our 4 U.S. battery plants that we have announced and the full portfolio of EVs we are planning, in addition to the customer experience we're creating, underscore once again how determined we are to lead.  
The determination reaches through the entire company. And when I meet with our employees, they tell me how incredibly excited they are to be part of a once-in-a-generation transformation that will truly change the world. Their tenacity and collective commitment to our vision are why we are delivering such strong business results and advancing our future so quickly. So now for a closer look at our results and the outlook, I'll turn the call over to Paul."

We appreciate you taking the time to join us this morning. We've just experienced another very exciting quarter for the company with robust financial performance, and we're taking advantage of opportunities to accelerate our growth strategy with the additional investments we announced in EV and AV technology, that which Mary just outlined.  
During the quarter, we announced expectations of first half EBIT adjusted in the $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion range, which we achieved despite an $800 million charge related to the Bolt EV recall and $400 million primarily related to the side airbag recall late in the quarter, which were not included in our first half guidance range. I'll get into the details of these results in a minute, but first, really wanted to highlight the overall strength in the business driven by the incredible demand environment for our new end-use vehicles, allowing us to deliver results that are better all-in than we expected coming into the year.  
For instance, we saw an increase in our vehicle production in May and June versus what was projected on our earnings call in early May, and we were able to pull ahead some chip availability into Q2 from Q3. This has all led to the significantly improved performance in the first half of the year. We are seeing new challenges in the third quarter due to global COVID outbreaks, including the current outbreak in Malaysia resulting in closures of assembly, test and packaging facilities for semiconductors. This remains, as we said, a fluid and rapidly changing environment.  
Given our first half performance and our expectations for the rest of the year, we are raising our full year EBIT-adjusted guidance to an expected range of $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion from the $10 billion to $11 billion previous range. While raw materials continue to be a significant year-over-year headwind as platinum group metals and steel prices have continued to increase this year, we have been mitigating the impact by managing several other factors, including pricing and mix, go-to-market strategies, record profits at GM Financial and other cost efficiencies. 
We are providing a wider guidance range than typical, given the fluid semiconductor situation and expect our variability within the range to be primarily driven by production volumes.  
So let's get into the strong results of the quarter in more detail. In Q2, we generated $34.2 billion in net revenue, $4.1 billion in EBIT adjusted, 12% EBIT-adjusted margin, $1.97 in EPS diluted adjusted and $2.5 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. We exceeded expectations by driving strong price and mix performance in North America through our production prioritization actions and our go-to-market strategy. Additionally, high used vehicle prices drove continued record results at GM Financial.  
So let's take a closer look at North America. In Q2, North America delivered EBIT adjusted of $2.9 billion against the backdrop of strong pricing on our full-size pickups and continued performance from the launch of our all-new full-size SUVs, partially offset by warranty charges in material and commodity costs. We generated a 10.4% EBIT-adjusted margin in the region.  
Our strong average transaction prices, up over 14% year-over-year, speak to the high demand for our full-size trucks and SUVs. A big contributor to this increase is the demand for premium trims, our platinum sport and premium luxury trims on Escalades doubled. And on Yukon, our Denali and AT4 represent more than 2/3 of all Yukon sales.  
Our volume has been constrained by very tight inventories, which we believe is having a temporary impact on market share in the region. We ended the quarter with approximately 212,000 units in dealer inventory. We expect continued high demand in the second half of this year, with continued low inventory into and through 2022.  
Let's move to GM International. GMI EBIT adjusted was up $300 million year-over-year as we experienced positive price and mix benefits across the segment. Second quarter equity income in China was $300 million, driven also by strong mix, stabilization in pricing and material cost performance, more than offsetting headwinds due to the chip supply shortage and higher commodity costs. In addition, we received a $600 million dividend from our China automotive JVs in Q2.  
EBIT adjusted in GMI, excluding China, was up $200 million year-over-year as a result of favorable pricing and mix. The underlying strength of the GMI business continues to improve as the team drives pricing, mix and cost optimization. However, we do expect some challenges in the second half, primarily due to semiconductor-driven plant downtime.  
Few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and our Corp segment. GM Financial has continued to deliver, with record Q2 EBT adjusted of $1.6 billion and is benefiting from both strong used vehicle prices and continued favorable consumer credit checks. We received $1.2 billion in dividends from GM Financial year-to-date, and we anticipate additional dividends to be paid in 2021 as we benefit from their record earnings.  
Cruise costs in the quarter were $300 million and Corp segment EBIT was a loss of $40 million, which was better than normal run rate due to mark-to-market gains on investments, partially offsetting costs.  
Now let's turn to our 2021 second half outlook. When thinking about the second half of the year performance, there are some fundamental pressures versus what we've seen in the first half. We've seen commodity inflation continue to rise. And while it's come down off the peaks, we expect second half commodity expense to be $1.5 billion to $2 billion higher than the first half of the year.  
At GM Financial, we expect second half headwinds of $1 billion to $1.5 billion versus the first half as we do not assume allowance adjustments experienced in the first half will repeat and we expect lower lease termination volume. Record high purchase rates are capping the gains at contract residual value and the start of credit normalization. We expect our growth initiative investments in the second half to increase by about $500 million. And the first half also contained $400 million in mark-to-market gains on equity investments that we do not assume will repeat. All of this adds up to about $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion of headwinds in the second half of the year.  
In addition, we expect North American volumes to be approximately 100,000 units lower in the second half versus the first, including some impact from our full-size pickup truck and SUV plants, primarily as a result of some of the near-term pressures in Malaysia impacting plants across North America. Otherwise, we expect the robust demand and pricing environment to continue as we get into 2022.  
From a full year perspective, we expect EPS diluted adjusted in the range of $5.40 to $6.40 and adjusted automotive free cash flow guidance in the $1 billion to $2 billion range. This semiconductor shortage, as we said, remains fluid and the supply chain challenges continue in the second half of the year. Our guidance assumes no year-end work-in-process inventory related to vehicles produced without modules. Significant cash flows could shift from 2021 to 2022 if we have these work-in-process vehicles held at year-end. We continue to expect CapEx for the year to be in the $9 billion to $10 billion range. 
So in summary, we had a very strong first half of the year. I think it highlights the strength of our underlying business. We've again demonstrated our flexibility, our laser focus on execution and our ability to manage through a significant disruption while generating strong results, and we don't expect that to change. There are still some challenges ahead of us, but we have the team and expertise to navigate this while not losing sight of our vision. 
We will continue investing in exciting new growth opportunities, including EVs, battery supply and technology and software solutions that will drive growth as well as desirable and differentiated products and services for our customers. We look forward to sharing more around these opportunities at our Investor Day on October 6 and 7. This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call."

I think what you're hearing from us is sort of a very real acknowledgment of what we see out there with COVID. Now it may turn out to be less impactful than we think it is. But I think the approach that we've taken through this has been pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter as we're cautious. We started pointing out some of the challenges that we were seeing in the forward supply chain in Malaysia really going back into late May, early June time frame, and unfortunately, just wasn't able to catch up on their vaccination rates, but they're making good progress.

The shutdowns that were announced yesterday are really the first ones kind of the full -- first full ones that we've taken this year. So -- and it is somewhat short term that we see that. We're managing this week to week. I think the bulk of -- when we look at the bulk of the 100,000 units from first -- second half to first half is really in crossovers. We think truck production and full-size SUV are relatively stable over that time period. But again, we're going to continue to watch that. 
The vehicles that are built without the modules, I think, present for us, as we've talked about before, a strong option for us. In fact, when we have downtime in the plants like we've announced, we're actually using some of that where we've got availability of the chips that were slated for production that can't be produced. We're redeploying those into some of those vehicles that have been produced earlier, allows us to maintain a little bit of the wholesaling momentum going forward. 
So we're going to continue to watch that, we're going to continue to do it. We're being careful to make sure that above all else, we're managing quality for the vehicles, and the manufacturing and engineering teams have really done an amazing job of managing through the logistical difficulties of doing it. But we continue to see that as a very useful tool for us to navigate this in the short run."

So we're really well positioned with an ICE portfolio, which allows us to focus our investment on electric -- full electric products. And as we work to make that transition, yes, we see, at the early days, some pricing pressure due to battery costs, but that's why we're so aggressively taking battery -- working to take battery costs down with multiple technology road maps. You will hear us talk more about that when we're together in October. 
But then we also see, filling that gap will be the strong foundation that we have to build on as it relates to software and subscriptions. Now that we have our vehicle intelligent platform, which allows for full over-the-air updates and that we started launching that new VIP in 2019 with the CT4 and the CT5 and then the Corvette and it continues, that's going to give us a lot of opportunity for more software services that we can provide that customers value and, therefore, will pay for as well as subscriptions. 
So if you think about it, I see the opportunity we have, and then I haven't even really talked about the growth opportunity we have with leveraging the Ultium platform, leveraging the Hydrotec platform as well as growing our commercial vehicle business and with BrightDrop in some of the vehicles that we talked about today. So there's tremendous growth opportunity that will, as we get battery costs down, will be sitting on top of the strong margins we have today. 
So we see it, in the interim, kind of filling the hole, but we're working quickly and think we have a leadership position in battery cell cost. That's why we've announced the 4 plants. So I see a huge growth opportunity as we move through this transition."

Your costs were up $3.9 billion year-over-year in the quarter. Sounds like there's a few unusual pieces there like the warranty, which you called out, and I appreciate you talking about that $1.2 billion. That wasn't in Street expectations. And I think you had about $1 billion year-over-year in Q2 from nonrecurrence of last year's austerity. So that means that there's probably $1.7 billion or so of commodities and other materials year-over-year. And everyone's experiencing that. 
So my question is, do you think that, that means that actually that some of the -- a significant part of the pricing that we're seeing in the industry, we shouldn't think about that in isolation. We should think about that against the material and commodity because it's really just offsetting variable costs. And if so, just -- if you can just give us a sense of what you're kind of aiming for with regard to North American margins once the dust settles."

The -- I wouldn't attribute all -- you did a good breakdown of some of the cost inflation and the warranties and what we saw on the recalls. But I wouldn't attribute all the remaining to just inflation of the underlying materials because the other thing that's going on is we are producing a much richer mix with more options and features. So material costs are up, but those are positive margin-accretive sales, so we're actually encouraged by that going forward. 
So there's no doubt we've had strong margin performance. And I think what you said, what we've tried to facilitate for the guidance that we put forward here is the underlying environment. I don't think we see any meaningful reasons to expect it to change in terms of the demand in the short run and even into 2022, where we continue to see depressed inventories. I think when the chip situation resolves itself, it's not going to probably be a massive sort of influx of manufacturing right out of the gate. 
So we do see continued tight inventories going into 2022. So I think one of the cautions about the second half is to not read too much into it and extrapolate that as a 2022 performance. We'll give more guidance on 2022 as we get through the budget process and towards the end of the year with what we see. But there's nothing fundamentally different about demand that we see changing in the near term."

And just secondly, just as we're thinking about that 2022, just starting from the midpoint of this year's guidance, you have $12.5 billion. It looks like if we just look at the commodity investment, GMF and mark-to-market delta that you laid out for the second half and offset that with the nonoccurrence of recalls, there's maybe a $2.5 billion drag into next year from those things. 
Can you just be a little bit more specific on what the recovery in volume actually means? Because this year, you're only going to do about 2.5 million vehicles. Are we correct in assuming that a more normal run rate for you at this point is in the 3.1 million, 3.2 million unit range?"

So I think you've attributed some of the headwinds, but like I said, we got to be cautious not to read into it. So for example, if you look at commodities, we saw some of the pressure in first half. The lion's share of it is hitting us in the second half, but commodity prices are down off their peaks. 
So while we'll see a little bit of pressure in the first half, if prices stay at these levels, we would actually expect a little bit of uplift as we go into the second half of '22. But there's a long time between here and there that we have to be cautious. And production will certainly be higher next year as we hope and expect that the chips will normalize. 
But like we said, from the very beginning, we've approached this thing with caution because I can't tell you how fluid it has been as we manage week to week. But I think when you look at the underlying results and what we've been able to produce in the first half of the year, I think what you've got is a team that has executed incredibly well even versus some of our peers and competitors, and I don't expect that to change going forward."

So I'm not going to give you a specific number because it's going to depend by segment. But we believe that the optimized inventory level is higher than what it is today. But I think we'd all agree, it's pretty low but much lower than it has been with our historical levels. And it's because of everything we've learned in the way we are approaching selling online, taking orders in some cases. 
But also, we know there's a customer who wants to go to the dealer and drive off with a new vehicle. We want to service them as well. And that's why I think some of the tools we've put in place to help our dealers have the vehicles that they want is going to be very important. So again, I think we're going to be much more efficient, and it will be a true partnership with our dealers as we optimize on both ends."

And I'm excited to have more people experience Super Cruise, and we'll provide that opportunity at our Investor Day. So I do think there's a huge opportunity. 
We've also taken the cost down of what it takes to implement Super Cruise on a vehicle as we're expanding its capabilities, the number of roads that are mapped to be able to leverage it. And so this does give us an opportunity, either to sell it or to provide it as a vehicle subscription service that I think is going to be significant. And overall, I'm not going to break out Super Cruise specifically, but I will tell you when we are in our Investor Day, we will provide the opportunity we see broadly in connected vehicle services and subscriptions and then vehicle-related services like OnStar Insurance that is doing quite well as we expand that. So I think there's a huge opportunity in this service space based on the connected vehicle that gives us a very different margin profile and a true growth opportunity.

Do you think there's a scenario where you could actually stand to benefit from inflation applying broadly to your revenue but more selectively to your cost structure? So for example, like D&A won't go up medium term from inflation but instead only as you replace assets over time, right, and your substantial hourly labor costs in the U.S. were, in 2019, already agreed upon through 2023, so you shouldn't be seeing the same pressure from wage inflation that other companies are likely to see.

And more specifically, as we compare the $35 billion target to the prior $27 billion one that was as of last year, that increase is also largely a function of CapEx towards cell and vehicle plants rather than what you see as being any major incremental investment on R&D, whether on the technology or product side to commercialize EVs and AVs."

We really appreciate your questions and for participating today. I want to step back and say, when we look at our team's dedication to everything that we have been working to offset and accelerate, we are building a stronger and a better future for our company and for our stakeholders and for the communities in which we live and work. 
By exceeding our business targets, we have the resources to move more quickly toward creating an all-EV future and all-AV future. And when you look at the combination of our Ultium battery platforms, our Hydrotec platforms for fuel cells, as well as our software and platform that we've named Ultifi, we really think that we have a strategy that will allow us to drive higher revenue, operating efficiencies and improved and outstanding customer experience. 
When you look at Ultium, it does deliver better performance range, and then it gives us flexibility and scalability that is going to allow us to accelerate the EVs that we're going to put into market across the entire portfolio. And the work that we'll share more of what we're doing to continue to improve battery costs will also allow us to open up into not only more segments but also markets outside the auto industry. 
And then when you think about, from a software perspective, the strength that we have of OnStar, our ability to do over-the-year updates and the work that we have from a processing power perspective in the vehicle as well as the cybersecurity perspective, we think we have an ecosystem that will increase and build on the leading loyalty that we have will allow us to provide unmatched personalization. We'll expand features, like we've already talked about, with Super Cruise and really create new connected services. 
So I couldn't be more excited about the future of the business and the opportunities that we have for growth and margin expansion when we look at all these different businesses. So we look forward to hosting you in October, and we truly believe you will experience this future for yourselves. So thanks, everybody, again, for your time, and please stay safe."

It's great to have an opportunity to talk with you all again today. Before Paul and I discuss our third quarter results, I want to thank all of you who participated in person or remotely in our recent Investor Day. Our",1175,"Thanks, Rocky, and hello, everyone. It's great to have an opportunity to talk with you all again today. Before Paul and I discuss our third quarter results, I want to thank all of you who participated in person or remotely in our recent Investor Day. Our team really appreciated the opportunity to deep dive our growth strategy and to hear your perspectives. After spending time with our leaders and subject matter experts, I hope it's clear to you that we have assembled the right technology to have the right platforms, and we have the right talent to achieve our long-term goals, including doubling our annual revenue and expanding our margins. 
Our confidence comes from the fact that we are already making significant progress in transforming GM from a traditional automaker to really a platform innovator. You can see it in the conversion of the Orion Assembly and Factory ZERO plants as they've gone from building gas-powered cars to EVs, the construction of our Ultium Cell JV plant, the rapid expansion of Super Cruise, the development of Level 2 plus autonomy with Ultra Cruise, the lead Cruise has in Level 4 autonomous driving and our portfolio of 20 start-up businesses. 
You can also experience it in the software and services that will enhance our customers' lives and drive growth. And you can see it in our talent and expertise. This includes the new digital business team that we formed to establish digital market leadership for GM and our expanded Board of Directors who have deep experience in IT, e-commerce, software development, venture capital, cybersecurity and more. 
As one of you observed, the real magic happens in our vehicles at the intersection of the Ultium and Ultifi platforms. Ultium enables us to efficiently deliver the industry's broadest portfolio of EVs, including a diverse portfolio of truck entries. And the beauty of Ultifi is the way it will allow us to deploy new software and services rapidly and securely across our entire fleet. This includes Super Cruise upgrades and services we'll create in the future. 
And seeing is believing. I have to tell you, I will never forget the overwhelmingly positive reaction that people had after they experienced Super Cruise or had an opportunity to ride in the GMC HUMMER EV and experienced Watts to Freedom for the very first time. The same can be said for the Cadillac LYRIQ that we'll begin delivering to customers next spring. They were spoken for in just about 10 minutes after we opened the reservation site, so I think that starts to show the strong demand that we will see for the LYRIQ. 
Our next EV reveal will be the Chevrolet Silverado EV, and I can tell you the truck is amazing. Our dealers love it and so you won't want to miss it when we take the cover off at CES in early January. It will evoke passion and enthusiasm through great design and engineering, and we believe it will drive mass adoption of electric vehicles, specifically trucks. And I promise you that the capabilities of Ultium and Ultifi will be just as evident in mass market vehicles like the $30,000 Chevrolet EV Crossover, which we showed. And as Mark shared, we're also working on another EV that's even more affordable than that. 
So to be clear, we will also continue to improve the successful ICE vehicles that are funding our future, and we'll do that while improving them to reduce emissions and also offer new technologies. Our plan provides resources to leadership in key segments like trucks and SUVs during and after the transition to electric vehicles. And although it's only been about 3 weeks since Investor Day, the strategies and initiatives we talked about have advanced even further. 
Let's talk first about our work to build a strong and secure battery supply chain in North America. We've established and announced 4 major supply chain initiatives recently, and we expect to add more soon to support our growth, our performance and our cost reduction plans. And our goal is to eliminate supply chain risk that -- and control our own destiny as we rapidly scale our EV volume. A common thread that runs through these and our recent announcement is a clear commitment to U.S. leadership in EVs. 
For example, we will add 2 more battery plants in the U.S. by mid-decade. We also have plans to build EV motors and another EV truck facility here in the U.S. We look forward to sharing the details very soon. But keep in mind, this is just the beginning. As Gerald said at Investor Day, we forecast that North American EV assembly capacity will reach 20% by 2025 and climb to 50% by 2030. 
We're also bringing Ultium to China, starting with the LYRIQ, which is launching in early 2022. And GM China also recently announced it's doubling the size of its Advanced Design Center to support EV development. 
Cruise is the second opportunity that I want to highlight. As you know, we have always gated the progress of cruise by safety. As we speak, Cruise is just 1 state-level approval away from full regulatory approval to charge customers for rides in San Francisco. And it is still the only company with a permit to provide full driverless ride-hail service in the city. As Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said, the complementary skills of GM and Cruise have brought it to the cusp of commercialization. This includes the launch of the Cruise Origin that will be produced at Factory ZERO, and we have already built dozens of engineering development vehicles like the ones you saw during Investor Day. 
All of this is why joining Cruise is so high among experts in artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics and why Cruise is hosting another series of virtual recruiting events called Under the Hood on November 4. If you'd like to participate, please contact GM Investor Relations. 
Now let's turn to earnings. As we have shared before, we are taking advantage of GM's strong cash flow to fund our investments in growth. Our third quarter results, which while reflecting the near-term challenges of the global semiconductor supply chain issues, clearly shows the strength of our underlying business. We reported EBIT adjusted of $2.9 billion, which includes another strong performance by GM Financial and our joint ventures in China as well as a recall cost settlement with LG. LG has been and continues to be a very valued and respected partner, and we are working closely with them to deliver replacement battery modules for our customers. In fact, we began scheduling and completing repairs this month. 
While the semiconductor situation improves, I believe our full year performance will be strong from an earnings perspective and far ahead of where we expected to be at the beginning of the year. And most importantly, as we manage this dynamic environment, our clear focus is on transforming GM. So I'm going to turn the call over to Paul, who will share more about the quarter and our outlook."

We outlined our long-term strategy earlier this month, including the opportunity to double our revenues and expand margins by 2030. We believe that the strength of our underlying business today is a crucial element to delivering on that growth, and I'm proud of the execution by our team during the quarter in the face of continued challenges. 
So let's get into the results of the quarter in more detail. In Q3, we generated $26.8 billion in net revenue, $2.9 billion in EBIT adjusted, 10.9% EBIT-adjusted margin and $1.52 in EPS diluted adjusted. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was negative $4.4 billion during the quarter due to higher work-in-process inventory related to vehicles produced without certain modules and working capital impacts from plant downtime and lower production levels as a result of the ongoing semiconductor shortage. We expect the impact on working capital to unwind, contributing to positive cash flow as production increases and vehicles build without the modules are completed and wholesale. 
We realized strong price and mix performance in North America, again through our production prioritization actions and our go-to-market strategies. Additionally, used vehicle prices drove continued excellent results at GM Financial. In the quarter, we also reached an agreement with LG to substantially recover the cost of the recall. The pretax impact to the quarter of this recovery agreement and associated recall was $700 million. 
So let's take a closer look at North America. In Q3, North America delivered EBIT adjusted of $2.1 billion with continued strong pricing on our full-size pickups and SUVs and the recovery agreement with LG. We generated a 10.3% EBIT-adjusted margin in the region. From a pricing standpoint, we're continuing to see high customer demand for our products and limited dealer inventory, which is driving strong transaction prices and lower incentive spend. 
In the quarter, our incentive spend as a percentage of ATP fell to 4.6%, 7.4 percentage points below Q3 2020. And even with these ATPs, we are growing or maintaining share in key segments. For example, almost 7 out of every 10 customers in the full-size SUV segment purchased a Tahoe, Suburban or Yukon. The Escalade remains the best-selling large -- luxury SUV by a significant margin. 
That said, our overall volume and inventories remain low, which is impacting total market share in the region. We ended the quarter with approximately 129,000 units in U.S. dealer inventory. We foresee low inventories and strong pricing continuing well into next year even as production volumes are expected to increase. 
Let's move to GM International. GMI EBIT adjusted was $200 million, up $200 million year-over-year as we experienced positive price and mix benefits across the segment. China equity income was $300 million in the quarter despite the semiconductor impacts due to continued strong mix, stabilization in pricing and material cost performance. GMI, excluding China equity income, has made substantial progress toward breakeven despite the impact of semiconductors, reinforcing the structural progress on our path to sustainable profitability and cash flow. 
A few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and Corporate segments. GM Financial has continued its record-setting pace with Q3 EBT-adjusted of $1.1 billion as used vehicle prices and favorable consumer credit trends continue. We've received $1.8 billion in dividends from GM Financial year-to-date, and we anticipate additional dividends to be paid in the fourth quarter. Cruise losses in the quarter were $300 million and Corp EBIT was a loss of $200 million, in line with our run rate estimates of general and administrative costs, including investments in growth and our new businesses. 
Let's turn to the outlook for the rest of the year. Despite some ongoing volatility in the supply chain, which our teams continue to work to mitigate, we expect sequentially higher volumes in Q4. We also expect costs from commodities and logistics to increase along with investments in our growth initiatives. 
I want to make sure that we clearly articulate how we are performing relative to the guidance we have in the market. As you recall, we began the year with a guided range of $10 billion to $11 billion of EBIT adjusted and provided updated full year EBIT-adjusted guidance at Q2 earnings of $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion. We now expect to achieve EBIT adjusted approaching the high end of that range. Our EPS diluted adjusted range will increase to $5.70 to $6.70, driven by a revised full year effective tax rate due to favorable tax determinations and a mix of global earnings. We also expect to achieve EPS diluted adjusted approaching the high end of that range. 
Now I want to provide an update on our capital spending, including investments in our Ultium JVs. We now expect spend to be in the $8 billion to $9 billion range this year, slightly below the $9 billion to $10 billion range we previously provided. This decrease is a result of both innovative work by our team to reduce required capital investment while maintaining the schedule on our upcoming product programs as well as certain timing of invoices that will shift into early '22. 
Adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year is expected to be approximately $1 billion. Note that this guidance now includes the impact of remaining work-in-process inventory related to vehicles produced without certain modules at the end of the year. Through the fourth quarter, we expect to clear the majority of our work-in-process inventory but anticipate some inventory will remain at year-end. As we've indicated, these units will provide additional cash flow in the first half of 2022 as we wholesale the vehicles. 
To close, we're at an inflection point for GM and we're focused on new metrics and KPIs as we progress on this journey. We plan to begin to provide some interim milestones and KPIs that we will use to benchmark our performance relative to the growth plan that we laid out at our investor event. We look forward to sharing that with you in the coming months. As we execute on our growth plan, we will maintain the strong business we have today and these results demonstrate that. 
This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call."

That being said, when we look at Q4 volumes, they look more like what we kind of saw volumes in the second quarter, but we have significant sort of additional cost pressures that we've seen, most of which relate to either commodity inflation or, more importantly, investments that we're making in the growth side of the business and in our manufacturing facilities as well. So volume is certainly recovering off of where we were in Q3, which is consistent with what we said. And we would hope to see that and expect to see that as we go through 2022."

Now I know you've put out the target for your BEV margins to be equal to or better than ICE, and I know battery -- you've laid out certain battery targets, that's going to be a big part. But I'm wondering if you could just walk us through maybe the other areas where you could see opportunity to boost EV margins, setting aside the software opportunity? And just how usually those things could be attained? Is it just better architecture consolidation, greater vehicle simplicity? Is it more in-sourcing or more digital or quasi-direct to retail sales?

We're definitely leveraging the Ultium platform and being able to launch in roughly half the time, there's just savings coming from that from less engineering because we already are working off the platform as well as the way we've done the control system. 
And we're looking across all aspects of the vehicle to ensure that EVs are affordable, really focused on what customers want. We do extensive consumer clinics to understand what's going to be important. So I think you'll see us every aspect of the vehicle, we're looking to improve. And then the scale that we'll be able to get across platforms, I think, is going to drive it. The battery cost will be another. And then you mentioned it but on top of that will be the services and that revenue that you don't get until you sell a vehicle. So we are working on that plan quite aggressively."

Everything is moving around, obviously, as we've seen some -- a lot of volatility in, broadly, commodities and the supply chain. We've seen a little bit of that retrace from the highs of this summer. So we're triangulating around that, but we've seen a couple of billion dollars as we look at 2022 right now. But that could go either way, just based on the volatility we've seen.

That seamless integration of the technology along with leveraging Ultium as well as our manufacturing capability are a huge value. So I think the message on Cruise is we're well funded and we have rapid commercialization plans in front of us, and that's the play we're executing.

Having said that though, with the launch of EVs, I think in the software services we're going to have in the vehicle, we're not going to cede that to someone else because I think that revenue and managing that is very important, and none of it starts to accrue until you actually have the vehicle being driven. 
But having said that, I will just say, Adam, there's a lot of conversations going on right now. And again, we're going to look at what provides us the biggest growth opportunity, not only in EV sales but also in the whole software system to manage those fleets or provide different services to our customers. So I don't have anything specific to announce today, but I'd just say there's a lot of conversations underway."

I think, Paul, you had mentioned there's about 124,000 units in dealer inventory right now. There's some units in work in progress. If you can maybe let us know what that number is. Then also for both of you, where do you think that travel level should be in the U.S. as things normalize? Because I mean, pre crisis, you've been running right around 800,000 units, plus or minus. So it indicates that there can be very significant catch-up. 
But I guess the question is, where do you actually land and how much of the price activity that has been really positive because of tight inventory might be maintained. So really sort of short term, what are we actually looking at of effective inventory? And then long term, where do you think it stays hopefully tighter than history? And what does that mean for pricing?"

I think as production ramps up in terms of what we're seeing in demand, I think the opportunities to build inventory are going to be somewhat limited, which in the short run, I think, is a good thing for pricing and for what we see in terms of the demand environment. 
Midterm, we would expect to start building inventories off of these levels because it's not healthy where we see our dealers with empty lots, et cetera. And when consumers want to buy a vehicle, they want to buy a vehicle, they don't want to wait, and we're meant to have more inventory. And longer term, what I would say is go back to kind of what we've said from the beginning of this, that there's a lot of lessons learned in inventory management and certainly what the impact has been on pricing this year. And the right answer is certainly a lot more than what we have today but certainly quite a bit less than what we've carried historically going forward. So as we come through this over the longer term, we'll continue to manage that dynamically through the market, but I expect it to be less than historical levels."

And for those -- and we have a lot of dealers. Some are very high volume, some are smaller. So you can imagine as they weigh that decision of what's in the best interest for them, we work through that. So what we have now, I think, is a very efficient Cadillac dealer base that's very excited about the electrified -- our all EV products that are coming and are making the investments to support the customer extremely well. So I think it's going to be a model as we go forward. But I'm very pleased with how that has turned out. And again, we did it in -- with our dealers.

On the short term, I'm curious if you could put a finer point around how some of the cost pressure you expect in the fourth quarter are a good read across the run rate for how to think about 2022. And the reason I'm asking is if I understand you well, Paul, I think you expect Q4 volumes to be about in line with Q2, but then at the same time, the guided EBIT for Q4 is probably about half of what you did in Q2, so $2 billion versus the $4 billion. And so when I think of that $2 billion delta, seems like there's commodities in there and then there's investments in the future. So first, is my understanding correct? 
And second of all, how do I think about these costs going to next year? You spoke about commodities. What about the investments in the future? Is this the sort of like run rate that is required for your plan?"

In order to go back to Q2, we also have to understand that there were some onetime or shorter-term impact issues that were affecting that. So when you back that out of Q2 and kind of normalize it, you're looking at approximately $1 billion. So GMF had a true-up of some of its liabilities now that all that caught up to the credit terms and the used car prices, we're kind of on a run rate basis at GMF. That was included in Q2. 
We had some mark-to-market on investments as well. So if you take  about $1 billion out and then you look at roughly $1 billion to $1.5 billion kind of where we were Q4 to Q2, I would break that down into about half of that, so call it in the $700 million range being about the cost inflation and where we're seeing investment into the business on kind of a run rate, and then the other half being commodities, which should vary over time. And certainly, we've seen some of that pressure coming off of the peaks. I hope that answered your question."

So as we said at Investor Day, we said we -- plus or minus, we're going to maintain margins as we go forward because we think we have the capability to do that. But just to be clear, we're also going to make sure that we're doing the right investment. We're not going to constrain investment in the future growth opportunities.

I understand they are typically built into contracts, agreements for automakers to compensate suppliers for increases in raw material costs but generally not for other forms of inflation such as freight, logistics, labor, et cetera? 
On some of the earnings calls so far this quarter, suppliers have discussed attempting to negotiate for reimbursement for some of these, at least, noncommodity supply chain costs and even for the magnitude and suddenness of order cancellations due to the semiconductor shortage curtailing production, which again, I don't think we've historically seen automakers compensate suppliers for lower volumes stemming from factors outside of their control.

It's great to have an opportunity to talk with you all again today.

It's great to have an opportunity to talk with you all again today. Before Paul and I discuss our third quarter results, I want to thank all of you who participated in person or remotely in our recent Investor Day. 
Our team really appreciated the opportunity to deep dive our growth strategy and to hear your perspectives. After spending time with our leaders and subject matter experts, I hope it's clear to you that we have assembled the right technology to have the right platforms, and we have the right talent to achieve our long-term goals, including doubling our annual revenue and expanding our margins.
Our confidence comes from the fact that we are already making significant progress in transforming GM from a traditional automaker to really a platform innovator. You can see it in the conversion of the Orion Assembly and Factory ZERO plants as they've gone from building gas-powered cars to EVs, the construction of our Ultium Cell JV plant, the rapid expansion of Super Cruise, the development of Level 2 plus autonomy with Ultra Cruise, the lead Cruise has in Level 4 autonomous driving, and our portfolio of 20 start-up businesses.
You can also experience it in the software and services that will enhance our customers' lives and drive growth. And you can see it in our talent and expertise. This includes the new digital business team that we formed to establish digital market leadership for GM and our expanded Board of Directors who have deep experience in IT, e-commerce, software development, venture capital, cybersecurity and more.
As one of you observed, the real magic happens in our vehicles at the intersection of the Ultium and Ultifi platforms. Ultium enables us to efficiently deliver the industry's broadest portfolio of EVs, including a diverse portfolio of truck entries. And the beauty of Ultifi is the way it will allow us to deploy new software and services rapidly and securely across our entire fleet. This includes Super Cruise upgrades and services we'll create in the future.
And seeing is believing. I have to tell you, I will never forget the overwhelmingly positive reaction that people had after they experienced Super Cruise or had an opportunity to ride in the GMC HUMMER EV and experienced Watts to Freedom for the very first time. The same can be said for the Cadillac LYRIQ that we'll begin delivering to customers next spring. They were spoken for in just about 10 minutes after we opened the reservation site, so I think that starts to show the strong demand that we will see for the LYRIQ.
Our next EV reveal will be the Chevrolet Silverado EV, and I can tell you the truck is amazing. Our dealers love it, and so you won't want to miss it when we take the cover off at CES in early January. It will evoke passion and enthusiasm through great design and engineering, and we believe it will drive mass adoption of electric vehicles, specifically trucks. And I promise you that the capabilities of Ultium and Ultifi will be just as evident in mass market vehicles like the $30,000 Chevrolet EV crossover, which we showed. And as Mark shared, we're also working on another EV that's even more affordable than that.
So to be clear, we will also continue to improve the successful ICE vehicles that are funding our future, and we'll do that while improving them to reduce emissions and also offer new technologies. Our plan provides resources to [ main ] leadership in key segments like trucks and SUVs during and after the transition to electric vehicles. And although it's only been about 3 weeks since Investor Day, the strategies and initiatives we talked about have advanced even further.
Let's talk first about our work to build a strong and secure battery supply chain in North America. We've established and announced 4 major supply chain initiatives recently, and we expect to add more soon to support our growth, our performance and our cost reduction plans. And our goal is to eliminate supply chain risk that -- and control our own destiny as we rapidly scale our EV volume.
A common thread that runs through these and our recent announcement is a clear commitment to U.S. leadership in EVs. For example, we will add 2 more battery plants in the U.S. by mid-decade. We also have plans to build EV motors and another EV truck facility here in the U.S. We look forward to sharing the details very soon, but keep in mind this is just the beginning. 
As Gerald said at Investor Day, we forecast that North American EV assembly capacity will reach 20% by 2025 and climb to 50% by 2030. We're also bringing Ultium to China, starting with the LYRIQ, which is launching in early 2022. And GM China also recently announced it's doubling the size of its Advanced Design Center to support EV development.
Cruise is the second opportunity that I want to highlight. As you know, we have always gated the progress of Cruise by safety. As we speak, Cruise is just 1 state-level approval away from full regulatory approval to charge customers for rides in San Francisco. And it is still the only company with a permit to provide full driverless ride-hail service in the city.
As Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said, the complementary skills of GM and Cruise have brought it to the cusp of commercialization. This includes the launch of the Cruise Origin that will be produced at Factory ZERO, and we have already built dozens of engineering development vehicles like the ones you saw during Investor Day.
All of this is why joining Cruise is so high among experts in artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics, and why Cruise is hosting another series of virtual recruiting events called Under the Hood on November 4. If you'd like to participate, please contact GM Investor Relations.
Now let's turn to earnings. As we have shared before, we are taking advantage of GM's strong cash flow to fund our investments in growth. Our third quarter results, which while reflecting the near-term challenges of the global semiconductor supply chain issues, clearly shows the strength of our underlying business.
We reported EBIT-adjusted of $2.9 billion, which includes another strong performance by GM Financial and our joint ventures in China as well as a recall cost settlement with LG. LG has been and continues to be a very valued and respected partner, and we are working closely with them to deliver replacement battery modules for our customers. In fact, we began scheduling and completing repairs this month.
While the semiconductor situation improves, I believe our full year performance will be strong from an earnings perspective and far ahead of where we expected to be at the beginning of the year. And most importantly, as we manage this dynamic environment, our clear focus is on transforming GM.
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Paul, who will share more about the quarter and our outlook."

We appreciate you taking the time to join us. We outlined our long-term strategy earlier this month, including the opportunity to double our revenues and expand margins by 2030.

We outlined our long-term strategy earlier this month, including the opportunity to double our revenues and expand margins by 2030. We believe that the strength of our underlying business today is a crucial element to delivering on that growth, and I'm proud of the execution by our team during the quarter in the face of continued challenges.
So let's get into the results of the quarter in more detail. In Q3, we generated $26.8 billion in net revenue, $2.9 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 10.9% EBIT-adjusted margin and $1.52 in EPS-diluted-adjusted. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was negative $4.4 billion during the quarter due to higher work-in-process inventory related to vehicles produced without certain modules and working capital impacts from plant downtime and lower production levels as a result of the ongoing semiconductor shortage. 
We expect the impact on working capital to unwind, contributing to positive cash flow as production increases and vehicles build without the modules are completed and wholesaled. We realized strong price and mix performance in North America again through our production prioritization actions and our go-to-market strategies. Additionally, used vehicle prices drove continued excellent results at GM Financial. In the quarter, we also reached an agreement with LG to substantially recover the cost of the recall. The pretax impact to the quarter of this recovery agreement and associated recall was $700 million.
So let's take a closer look at North America. In Q3, North America delivered EBIT-adjusted of $2.1 billion with continued strong pricing on our full-size pickups and SUVs and the recovery agreement with LG. We generated a 10.3% EBIT-adjusted margin in the region. From a pricing standpoint, we're continuing to see high customer demand for our products and limited dealer inventory, which is driving strong transaction prices and lower incentive spend.
In the quarter, our incentive spend as a percentage of ATP fell to 4.6%, 7.4 percentage points below Q3 2020. And even with these ATPs, we are growing or maintaining share in key segments. For example, almost 7 out of every 10 customers in the full-size SUV segment purchased a Tahoe, Suburban or Yukon. The Escalade remains the best-selling large luxury SUV by a significant margin. That said, our overall volume and inventories remain low, which is impacting total market share in the region. We ended the quarter with approximately 129,000 units in U.S. dealer inventory. We foresee low inventories and strong pricing continuing well into next year even as production volumes are expected to increase.
Let's move to GM International. GMI EBIT-adjusted was $200 million, up $200 million year-over-year as we experienced positive price and mix benefits across the segment. China equity income was $300 million in the quarter despite the semiconductor impacts due to continued strong mix, stabilization in pricing and material cost performance. GMI, excluding China equity income, has made substantial progress toward breakeven despite the impact of semiconductors, reinforcing the structural progress on our path to sustainable profitability and cash flow.
A few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and Corporate segments. GM Financial has continued its record-setting pace with Q3 EBT-adjusted of $1.1 billion as used vehicle prices and favorable consumer credit trends continue. We've received $1.8 billion in dividends from GM Financial year-to-date, and we anticipate additional dividends to be paid in the fourth quarter. Cruise losses in the quarter were $300 million and Corp EBIT was a loss of $200 million, in line with our run rate estimates of general and administrative costs, including investments in growth and our new businesses.
Let's turn to the outlook for the rest of the year. Despite some ongoing volatility in the supply chain, which our teams continue to work to mitigate, we expect sequentially higher volumes in Q4. We also expect costs from commodities and logistics to increase along with investments in our growth initiatives.
I want to make sure that we clearly articulate how we are performing relative to the guidance we have in the market. As you recall, we began the year with a guided range of $10 billion to $11 billion of EBIT-adjusted and provided updated full year EBIT-adjusted guidance at Q2 earnings of $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion. We now expect to achieve EBIT-adjusted approaching the high end of that range. Our EPS-diluted-adjusted range will increase to $5.70 to $6.70, driven by a revised full year effective tax rate due to favorable tax determinations and a mix of global earnings. We also expect to achieve EPS-diluted-adjusted approaching the high end of that range.
Now I will provide an update on our capital spending, including investments in our Ultium JVs. We now expect spend to be in the $8 billion to $9 billion range this year, slightly below the $9 billion to $10 billion range we previously provided. This decrease is a result of both innovative work by our team to reduce required capital investment while maintaining the schedule on our upcoming product programs as well as certain timing of invoices that will shift into early '22.
Adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year is expected to be approximately $1 billion. Note that this guidance now includes the impact of remaining work-in-process inventory related to vehicles produced without certain modules at the end of the year. Through the fourth quarter, we expect to clear the majority of our work-in-process inventory but anticipate some inventory will remain at year-end. As we've indicated, these units will provide additional cash flow in the first half of 2022 as we wholesale the vehicles.
To close, we're at an inflection point for GM and we're focused on new metrics and KPIs as we progress on this journey. We plan to begin to provide some interim milestones and KPIs that we will use to benchmark our performance relative to the growth plan that we laid out at our investor event. We look forward to sharing that with you in the coming months. As we execute on our growth plan, we will maintain the strong business we have today and these results demonstrate that.
This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call."

That's certainly what we have seen. So we expect a pretty sizable step-up in volume sequentially from Q3 into Q4.
That being said, when we look at Q4 volumes, they look more like what we kind of saw volumes in the second quarter, but we have significant sort of additional cost pressures that we've seen, most of which relate to either commodity inflation or, more importantly, investments that we're making in the growth side of the business and in our manufacturing facilities as well. So volume is certainly recovering off of where we were in Q3, which is consistent with what we said. And we would hope to see that and expect to see that as we go through 2022."

And I think you're finally starting to see, like, the EV margins materialize at some [indiscernible] in the past.
Now I know you've put out the target for your BEV margins to be equal to or better than ICE, and I know battery -- you've laid out certain battery targets, that's going to be a big part. But I'm wondering if you could just walk us through maybe the other areas where you could see opportunity to boost EV margins, setting aside the software opportunity and just how easily those things could be attained.
Is it just better architecture consolidation, greater vehicle simplicity? Is it more in-sourcing or more digital or quasi-direct to retail sales? Just what other opportunities are there to improve the EV margins aside from the battery cost?"

Obviously, as we get scale, and the battery improvement is not insignificant but as we get the scale part of that and get scale with the vehicles, I think you're going to see margins improve. We're definitely leveraging the Ultium platform and being able to launch in roughly half the time, there's just savings coming from that from less engineering because we already are working off the platform as well as the way we've done the control system.
And we're looking across all aspects of the vehicle to ensure that EVs are affordable, really focused on what customers want. We do extensive consumer clinics to understand what's going to be important. So I think you'll see us, every aspect of the vehicle, we're looking to improve. And then the scale that we'll be able to get across platforms, I think, is going to drive it. The battery cost will be another. And then you mentioned it but on top of that will be the services and that revenue that you don't get until you sell a vehicle. So we are working on that plan quite aggressively."

We do have that commodity inflation, but we still remain convicted about our ability to be able to offset either that through productivity or through some of the pricing actions that we've seen. Certainly, we've seen the chips impact trim mixes and other things that we would otherwise want to be doing, but we've had to reduce a little bit.

So that's putting on some of the cost pressure going forward, but that is the type of long-term decisions that Mary has mentioned we're staying focused on as we go through this."

That seamless integration of the technology along with leveraging Ultium as well as our manufacturing capability are a huge value. So I think the message on Cruise is we're well funded and we have rapid commercialization plans in front of us, and that's the play we're executing.

But having said that, I will just say, Adam, there's a lot of conversations going on right now.

And longer term, what I would say is go back to kind of what we've said from the beginning of this, that there's a lot of lessons learned in inventory management and certainly what the impact has been on pricing this year.
And the right answer is certainly a lot more than what we have today but certainly quite a bit less than what we've carried historically going forward. So as we come through this over the longer term, we'll continue to manage that dynamically through the market, but I'd expect it to be less than historical levels."

I'm just curious how big that is in the base of Cadillac dealerships.

I think what has been accomplished with the Cadillac dealer base is very, very important and it was done the right way. We were clear with, as we transition Cadillac, it will be our lead brand moving to all-EV and wanted to make sure that the dealers were in partnership with us to make the investments that they needed to make to win selling electric vehicles.
And for those -- and we have a lot of dealers. Some are very high volume, some are smaller. So you can imagine as they weigh that decision of what's in the best interest for them, we work through that. So what we have now, I think, is a very efficient Cadillac dealer base that's very excited about the electrified -- our all-EV products that are coming and are making the investments to support the customer extremely well.
So I think it's going to be a model as we go forward. But I'm very pleased with how that has turned out. And again, we did it in -- with our dealers. And I think that's going to prove to be the right way to do it and very strong from a customer support perspective."

On the short term, I'm curious if you could put a finer point around how some of the cost pressure you expect in the fourth quarter are a good read across the run rate for how to think about 2022.
And the reason I'm asking is if I understand you well, Paul, I think you expect Q4 volumes to be about in line with Q2, but then at the same time, the guided EBIT for Q4 is probably about half of what you did in Q2, so $2 billion versus the $4 billion. And so when I think of that $2 billion delta, seems like there's commodities in there and then there's investments in the future. So first, is my understanding correct? 
And second of all, how do I think about these costs going to next year? You spoke about commodities. What about the investments in the future? Is this the sort of like run rate that is required for your plan?"

In order to go back to Q2, we also have to understand that there were some onetime or shorter-term impact issues that were affecting that. So when you back that out of Q2 and kind of normalize it, you're looking at approximately $1 billion. So GMF had true-up of some of its liabilities. Now that all that caught up to the credit terms and the used car prices, we're kind of on a run rate basis at GMF. That was included in Q2.
We had some mark-to-market on investments as well. So if you take about $1 billion out and then you look at roughly $1 billion to $1.5 billion kind of where we were Q4 to Q2, I would break that down into about half of that, so call it in the $700 million range being about the cost inflation and where we're seeing investment into the business on kind of a run rate, and then the other half being commodities, which should vary over time. And certainly, we've seen some of that pressure coming off of the peaks. I hope that answered your question."

Obviously, we're going to be in a pretty sizable launch cadence going forward for the next few years, and we're going to make sure that we invest in that. And then we've got engineering going on for multiple projects going forward. So I think we've got good control of that, where we stand and where we go.

So I was very encouraged to see your bullish long-term targets for margin as well as the goal to improve margins in the core automotive business by 2030.
My question is, how will you manage profitability in between, so between now and sort of like mid-decade as some of these EVs roll on and ramp up at a lower than average margin as well like some of these investments in the business as sort of like needed? How will you sort of ensure that the profitability sort of like is on an upward trajectory before the 2030 target?"

But we are also going to be focused on investing in businesses that are going to allow us to create software businesses that have a very different margin potential overall that's part of that.
So as we said at Investor Day, we said we -- plus or minus, we're going to maintain margins as we go forward because we think we have the capability to do that. But just to be clear, we're also going to make sure that we're doing the right investment. We're not going to constrain investment in the future growth opportunities. But the current modeling that we've done and the plan that we're executing and the targets that have been distributed that everybody is being held accountable to, we see roughly a steady and then improving toward the latter part of the decade with margins.

I understand there are typically built into contracts agreements for automakers to compensate suppliers for increases in raw material costs but generally not for other forms of inflation such as freight, logistics, labor, et cetera?
On some of the earnings calls so far this quarter, suppliers have discussed attempting to negotiate for reimbursement for some of these, at least, noncommodity supply chain costs and even for the magnitude and suddenness of order cancellations due to the semiconductor shortage curtailing production, which again, I don't think we've historically seen automakers compensate suppliers for lower volumes stemming from factors outside of their control.
So just wanted to check in with you to see how you expect these conversations may proceed and whether we should think about suppliers bearing the brunt of these noncommodity costs or if there maybe margin implications for GM?"

So we're working across the board because that's where the real value is, working with our suppliers to drive efficiencies across the business is ultimately what we all have to do to be able to counter inflationary aspects of the business.

We r",2289,"Good morning, and thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call. Our start to this year was very strong with a record Q1 performance that was driven largely by robust product demand in the U.S. as well as an outstanding quarter for GM Financial. We remain confident that we will achieve our full year guidance. We are on a path to transform our company on the time line we have shared with you, and we are demonstrating our ability to accelerate our plan.  
Before I discuss the progress we've made on our transformation and growth strategy, I'll provide some highlights about our performance. I'm very pleased with the strength of our global business, which contributed to EBIT-adjusted of $4.4 billion and an EPS diluted adjusted of $2.25. The strong quarter was a full team effort, with people working in our plants all the way to our dealers.  
Global purchasing and supply chain, engineering and manufacturing have been especially nimble and opportunistic as we managed through the semiconductor shortage. For example, our engineers are creating effective solutions using chips that are more readily available or by identifying alternatives that can serve semiconductors where possible. Their work helped us maximize production of our highest demand and capacity-constrained vehicles, reducing downtime and further demonstrating our team's agility.  
While we have production downtime in the second quarter, we expect to have a strong first half with EBIT adjusted around $5.5 billion-ish. We are also reaffirming our guidance for the full year. And based on what we know today, we see the results coming in at the higher end of the $10 billion to $11 billion EBIT-adjusted range that we shared earlier this year.
We remain committed to fund $7 billion in EV and AV investment that includes capital and engineering this year and accelerating 12 EV programs as we first announced last November. Paul will discuss our Q1 numbers and outlook in more detail in a few minutes.
Looking ahead, I think there are many reasons why we are confident. For starters, we have great product momentum. Despite tight inventories, we maintain a clear lead in the full-size SUV market in the U.S. and our full-size pickups are in high demand. In China, our sales are rebounding sharply with the economy, and Cadillac achieved a record first quarter, led by its SUV lineup of XT4, XT5 and XT6.  
In addition, we are executing one of the fastest production launches in our history. Last November, we said we would return full-size production -- pickup production to Oshawa Assembly in Canada in early 2022. Because of the team's speed, we are pulling the start of retail production ahead into the fourth quarter of this year. The new time line and incremental volume will begin to have a meaningful impact next year as we ramp up production. But I'm sharing it with you now as another example of how we are working urgently to achieve key milestones.  
Let's turn now to our growth strategy, starting with a battery update. We intend to lead on all aspects of battery development and cost reduction, and we are moving quickly on every front. Our vertical integration approach to battery technology, which includes building our own cells, will help us scale quickly and efficiently to deploy new innovative chemistries that boost energy density and reduce cost over time.  
Ultium batteries are unique in the industry because of their large-format pouch-style cells that can be stacked vertically or horizontally inside the battery pack. This allows engineers to optimize battery energy storage and layout for each vehicle design. Depending on the vehicle, Ultium enables a GM-estimated range of up to 450 miles or more on a full charge, with 0 to 60 miles per hour acceleration in 3 seconds. As we previously said, we realized -- we will realize a 40% battery cost reduction with our first-generation Ultium platform compared with today's Chevrolet Bolt EV.  
And we're already on the road to delivering a 60% cost reduction compared to the Bolt EV, with the next generation of Ultium, and we expect costs will continue to decrease from there.  
Currently, our next-gen lithium metal prototypes have completed about 150,000 simulated test miles, and we expect them to have nearly double the energy density of our current EV batteries. The team has already secured 49 patents for GM's lithium metal battery development, with another 45 pending.  
Our own work, along with the intellectual property from SolidEnergy Systems will form the basis of our recent joint development agreement with SES, one of the companies we're working with to commercialize lithium metal batteries. We are targeting production of our next-gen Ultium battery by mid-decade, and we're also expanding our battery cell manufacturing footprint to control our cost and cell supply.  
Last month, Ultium Cells LLC, our joint venture with LG Energy Solution, announced its second high-volume battery cell plant in the United States, and construction begins immediately on the site adjacent to our Spring Hill Assembly Plant in Tennessee. The new facility will create about 1,300 new manufacturing jobs when it comes online in late 2023. It will join the Ultium Cell LLC facility in Lordstown that is opening next year.  
And this is just the beginning, and we'll continue to expand our battery cell capacity on our way to achieving our goal of EV market share leadership in North America.  
Let's turn now to our Ultium-powered products. During the quarter, we unveiled the second new HUMMER EV, the 2024 GMC HUMMER EV SUV, which launches in 2023 and will be built at Factory ZERO and Detroit-Hamtramck. It will be available loaded with new GM-developed software-driven technologies, including CrabWalk, Extract Mode and many more features that are either industry-leading or segment differentiators.  
The Cadillac team unveiled the stunning LYRIQ production model, which we accelerated by 9 months. And as we've previously said, we have cut the development time of most of our EVs in half because of our use of virtual engineering and other software tools. Cadillac will take reservations beginning in September, with initial availability in the first half of 2022.  
We were also excited to confirm that Chevrolet will introduce a Silverado full-size electric pickup truck for retail and fleet buyers with a GM estimated 400 miles of range on a full charge for certain configurations. The initial interest has been overwhelming, especially from commercial and government customers. We gave a small number of them a sneak peek at the interior and exterior design. What's especially important is that this truck will be in a high-volume entry in one of the most popular and competitive segments in the industry.  
In addition to Ultium propulsion, Super Cruise is a feature that connects all of these vehicles, and an increasing number of vehicles we're selling today. Since its debut in 2017, Super Cruise has twice been ranked as the best driver assistance technology in the industry by a leading third-party consumer group. Super Cruise is enhancing our reputation, elevating our brands and laying the foundation to generate substantial future subscription revenue for us as we move forward.  
To creatively illustrate how fun and liberating Super Cruise can be, Cadillac recently wrapped up its It's Time to Let Go campaign. It captured celebrities as they drove the 2021 Cadillac Escalade with Super Cruise and its new lane change capability. It was really fun to watch the reactions and how people quickly shifted from being cautiously curious to just pure excitement. We'll roll out Super Cruise to 22 models by the end of 2023, and we plan to add even more features. Our ultimate vision is that this system enables hands-free transportation in 95% of driving scenario.
What makes our large-scale deployment of Super Cruise and all of its new features possible is our Vehicle Intelligence Platform, or VIP, which connects every vehicle system into one advanced high-speed and very secure network. VIP's 4.5 terabytes of data processing power per hour represents a fivefold increase from our previous electrical architecture. That's enough capacity to manage all of the data loads of our self-driving technology, driver assistance systems, electric propulsion, over-the-air updates of every vehicle module, plus capacity to manage future applications.  
It's also an enabler for Software-as-a-Service, including new apps and capabilities that we can market to our customers, such as the latest must-have trailering and parking apps. By the end of '23, VIP will be on 7 million vehicles and 38 global models.  
Another major element of our growth strategy is our BrightDrop commercial delivery business, and it is progressing and on track. In March, our product and manufacturing teams reached an important milestone as they conducted EV600 prototype builds. Plans to build the BrightDrop EV600 at Cadillac -- excuse me, at GM Canada's CAMI Assembly in Ingersoll, are progressing rapidly. The BrightDrop team remains on track to reach its goal of delivering EV600s to its first customer, FedEx Express, by Q4 of this year.  
Interest is high and we continue to have active discussions with many prospective new customers who are seeking the efficient and zero-emission delivery solutions that BrightDrop offers. And this is encouraging as third parties estimate that the addressable market for eLCVs could be $30 billion by 2025 and double that in 2030.  
As our EV volumes grow, we are also investing in relationships to build a robust, reliable and easy-to-use public charging infrastructure. Last week, we revealed Ultium Charge 360, an innovative and holistic approach that integrates charging networks, GM vehicle mobile apps and other products and services to simplify the charging experience for GM EV owners. It builds on our existing work and partnerships to support a charging ecosystem that will give GM EV owners more confidence and convenience.  
We have signed agreements with 7 major charging networks, giving customers a more seamless access to nearly 60,000 plugs across the U.S. and China. As part of our existing collaboration with EVgo, we've opened the first 3 fast-charging stations in California, Florida and Washington, on our way to 2,700 plugs by the end of 2025. And we expect about 500 fast-charging stalls to go live by the end of this year.  
We'll continue to provide updates about Ultium Charge 360, including new elements and collaborations. 
The last major EV development I want to share follows up on our joint announcement last year with Honda that we will co-develop 2 Ultium-based EVs for Honda to be built in North America by the GM team. Honda recently confirmed these vehicles, a large SUV for the Honda brand and one for the Acura brand, and will launch in North America market for the 2024 model year. This further validates our Ultium technology, and we continue to work closely with Honda to expand our partnership and cooperation in key areas such as purchasing, research and development and connected services.  
Turning to AVs. Cruise continues to establish itself as a leading force in commercializing self-driving vehicle technology. In the latest funding round that closed after raising $2.75 billion, it included investments from Microsoft and Walmart, and this brings the valuation of Cruise to more than $30 billion, with GM continuing to own a majority stake.  
Cruise is moving steadily closer to commercialization. It's real-world driverless vehicle testing in San Francisco and its last-mile delivery pilot with Walmart in Scottsdale, Arizona will help pave the way for new commitments like the one Cruise just signed with the city of Dubai. Cruise will be the city's exclusive provider of self-driving taxis and ride-hailing services, with plans to deploy up to 4,000 self-driving vehicles by 2030. Dubai chose Cruise over several competitors, so it's another great validation of Cruise's technology and our overall approach to autonomous vehicles.  
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I want to quickly update you on our coronavirus measures. We remain diligent and disciplined with our safety protocols to keep employees safe as variants in new hotspots emerge. The GM medical team continues to monitor new COVID-19 cases globally, and our vaccine task force teams are working to understand vaccine administration priorities for each country and determine how we can best assist our employees, including operating vaccine clinics in several of our U.S. facilities.  
All the work GM medical has done behind the scenes was crucial as we restarted production last spring. And their work has helped the rest of the team stay focused on driving our business today and driving our growth strategy. I also want to recognize the entire GM team for its hard work, flexibility and resilience. In addition to our suppliers and our dealers who are helping us manage the semiconductor issues, we are also working to serve our customers and leveraging everything we can do to turn inventory quickly.  
Everyone has been remarkably dedicated, and it shows in our results, and we appreciate everyone's hard work. This is just the beginning for the next generation of General Motors. We are well on track with our plans to transform our company and lead the industry into the future, and we are pleased with the significant progress we have made on all fronts during the quarter.  
We look forward to building on the strong momentum and providing a more comprehensive update on our growth initiatives and progress later in the year. We plan to have an investor event in the Detroit area and will announce a date later in the summer because we would like this event to be face-to-face. We'll use this event to go deeper into our growth strategy and financial opportunities and everything that drives them, including software, hardware and services, along with our strong brands.  
So with that, I'll turn it over to Paul to provide more details on our financial performance and our full year guidance."

Thanks for taking the time to join us this morning. This has been a very exciting first full quarter for me at GM.

This has been a very exciting first full quarter for me at GM. I see so much opportunity here for us to use our world-class capabilities in manufacturing, engineering and customer loyalty to really leverage these with our scale to achieve our growth initiatives. 
First, to set the stage before I get into the details, we had a great quarter, a first quarter record, in fact, despite the volatile backdrop. Our strong Q1 performance continues to highlight the resiliency of our business as well as our ability to take decisive actions to adapt to the fluid supply chain environment. In Q1, for example, we were able to build and wholesale more vehicles than forecasted and defer anticipated plant downtime. This strong operational execution, combined with the additional actions on price and expense reductions enabled us to deliver stronger-than-expected results for the quarter. 
We're collaborating across the global supply chain and working tirelessly to route available parts to the appropriate plants in order to maximize plant efficiency. We've been focused on leveraging every available semiconductor to build and ship our most popular and in-demand products, including our highly profitable full-size pickups and full-size SUVs. I'm very proud of the team for everything they've accomplished in the first quarter and what they're continuing to do, including strong pricing for every vehicle that we're able to produce, prioritizing production of higher-demand vehicles, continuing to be very controlled on costs and being agile across the board. 
As Mary mentioned, the full year 2021 guidance we outlined last quarter and reiterated a couple of times remains intact, and we expect to be at the higher end of our EBIT-adjusted range. We expect Q2 to reflect the largest impact of the production disruptions, resulting from supply shortages. The retiming of vehicles we produce without certain modules and plant downtime in the second quarter is expected to be significantly higher than Q1, resulting in lower EBIT-adjusted quarter-over-quarter. 
Our current view is that our first half EBIT adjusted will be around $5.5 billion. Recognizing the situation remains fluid, we're cautiously optimistic that our second half will be similar to or better than the first half. Importantly, our commitment to the acceleration of our EV product programs has not changed. Our important upcoming launches, including our GMC HUMMER EV Super Truck and Cadillac LYRIQ are on track. And the construction in Lordstown, Factory ZERO, Spring Hill and CAMI is progressing on schedule. We are still planning to invest $9 billion to $10 billion of CapEx in 2021. 
Finally, our earnings power and cash generation potential remains robust. In a more normalized environment, we expect that certain headwinds we're facing today will dissipate, but the strength of the underlying business powered by exceptional demand for our brands will remain. We expect that our normalized EBIT-adjusted performance will be strong as we continue producing and selling our in-demand and highly profitable full-size trucks and SUVs, while continuing to launch new and exciting products and services that position GM to win in the future of mobility. 
So let's get into the strong results of the quarter in more detail. In Q1, we generated $32.5 billion in net revenue, $4.4 billion in EBIT adjusted, 13.6% EBIT-adjusted margin and $2.25 in EPS diluted adjusted, and minus $1.9 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. We exceeded expectations by driving strong price and mix performance in North America through our production prioritization actions and our go-to-market strategy.
Additionally, high used vehicle prices due to low new vehicle inventories in part drove record results at GM Financial. Our adjusted automotive free cash flow of minus $1.9 billion was lower $1 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by the working capital impact from plant downtime and inventory carrying value of approximately $1.2 billion associated with vehicles built without certain modules due to the shortage of chips, which will reverse when those vehicles are completed, partially offset by strong EBIT performance. We ended Q1 with a strong automotive cash balance of $19 billion and total automotive liquidity of more than $37 billion. 
So let's take a closer look at North America. In Q1, North America delivered EBIT adjusted of $3.1 billion, up $900 million year-over-year and a 12.1% EBIT-adjusted margin, driven by continued strong pricing on our full-size pickups and performance from the launch of our new -- all-new full-size SUVs. Our average transaction prices were up 9% year-over-year for the quarter, with full-size trucks up 10% and full-size SUVs up over 20%, helping to overcome headwinds from commodity inflation and lower volumes. 
These results speak to the strength of the consumer and the strong brand equity we have in our products, which we plan to leverage as we roll out our EV portfolio. On the cost side, we continue to leverage efficiencies executed during COVID, including opportunities related to third-party services, travel and all discretionary spend. Teams across the organization have also gone above and beyond to meet strong and rising demand where they can. 
To drive strong sales with lower inventory, GM has introduced a new proprietary software application that helps dealers track vehicles from when they're completed at the plant to when they're released at their final destination. With many of our full-size trucks and SUVs being sold prior to arriving at the dealer or within days of hitting the lot, this software called VINVIEW allows dealers to both track vehicles and provide an informed estimated delivery time, enhancing the customer's arrival confidence and experience. 
Additionally, we also have a software application called focused ordering that includes a dashboard, which combines vehicle trim options with market data to help dealers ensure they're ordering the most in-demand products to meet customer preferences. This has been a huge help in our prioritization efforts. For example, of all the 2021 light-duty crew cab sales in the first quarter, about 60% were based on this focused ordering dashboard. And these models are turning 5.5 days faster than non-focused orders. 
In addition to these near-term benefits, we expect this technology to drive long-term cost efficiencies and lower inventories within the dealer network. And we still have a lot of excitement ahead of us this year as we complete renovation of Factory ZERO to launch the GMC HUMMER EV Super Truck this fall. Factory ZERO will also build the GMC HUMMER EV SUV and the Chevy Silverado full-size electric pickup, which is the first of many high-volume EV entries to come. And it will be the home of the Cruise Origin, a purpose-built all-electric and shared self-driving vehicle. 
And also, as Mary announced, our second battery plant recently in the last 18 months, which is a great indicator of our acceleration. Combined, these plants will have a capacity of over 70-gigawatt hours of production, and there are more being planned. We'll make additional cell capacity announcements as we progress in our product rollout. 
Let's move to GM International. We continue to be encouraged by our progress in GMI, with first quarter EBIT adjusted of $300 million, up $900 million year-over-year as we move past the initial effect of the pandemic in China. We also experienced positive price and mix benefits, as well as benefits from our structural cost actions across the segment. We delivered $300 million of equity income in China in Q1 due to higher volumes, stabilization in pricing and continued cost actions. 
EBIT-adjusted in GMI, excluding China, was up $400 million year-over-year, the second consecutive profitable quarter, as the semiconductor and commodities impact in the quarter was more than offset by the favorable pricing and mix. With continued semiconductor-driven plant downtime and low inventory levels, we expect Q2 to be challenged, but these results underscore the improvements in the region. 
A few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and our Corp segment. GM Financial has provided a significant offset to some of the semiconductor headwinds. Strong used vehicle prices, combined with consumer credit strength, helped to drive Q1 EBT adjusted of $1.2 billion, up $1 billion year-over-year. We received $600 million in dividends from GM Financial in Q1, and we anticipate dividends in 2021 from GMF will significantly exceed the 2020 dividend of $800 million, due in part to their expected upside in 2021. 
Cruise costs in the quarter were $200 million. And as Mary mentioned, Cruise continues to make great progress towards commercialization every day. Corp segment EBIT was $30 million in the quarter, a better-than-historical quarterly run rate, primarily due to mark-to-market gains in the period. 
Turning to our 2021 outlook for the calendar year. Last quarter, we outlined strong full year 2021 guidance of EBIT adjusted in the $10 billion to $11 billion range, including an estimated net semiconductor impact of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, which is calculated by taking loss contribution margin, offset by tactical efforts through costs, go-to-market actions and earnings growth at GM Financial. EPS diluted adjusted in the range of $4.50 to $5.25 and adjusted automotive free cash flow guidance in the $1 billion to $2 billion range, including an estimated semiconductor impact of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion. 
Since we shared guidance with you in February, the business has faced additional pressures due to semiconductor shortages as well as commodity inflation. Even though the gross impact of these headwinds has increased, the net impact remains the same as the company has identified additional mitigation initiatives, including pricing and mixed go-to-market strategies, growth at GM Financial, pull ahead of Oshawa full-size pickup production and other cost efficiencies. And what we've been able to prove in the fluid environment we're facing today is that we have the resiliency to flex to the challenges. 
In spite of the volatility in semiconductor availability, we're confident in achieving our full year 2021 outlook, including EBIT adjusted at the higher end of $10 billion to $11 billion, with the expectation that first half EBIT adjusted will be around $5.5 billion. We continue to expect EPS diluted adjusted of $4.50 and $5.25, and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1 billion to $2 billion. 
Our expectation is that Q2 will be the weakest quarter of the year as we increase plant downtime and continue to build vehicles without modules, impacting Q2 EBIT adjusted and working capital as we hold vehicles in inventory to wholesale later in the year once the semiconductors are received. 
We're managing the shortage through select plant downtime in the second quarter, which may extend into the second half. However, we plan on operating through the traditional U.S. summer shutdown in early Q3 at select facilities. We do not believe this short-term semiconductor headwind will affect our long-term earnings power and we remain committed to our growth initiatives in the EV acceleration we've previously communicated. 
In the medium to long term, we are focused on working cooperatively with our supply base and the semiconductor manufacturers to improve our line of sight on the full supply chain mapping and gain more control over the chip itself. We're working to proactively implement risk mitigation strategies that will help avoid future disruptions to the supply chain. And we've also learned a lot over the last year about our and our dealers' ability to manage at lower inventory levels. We're taking these learnings to implement dealer efficiency tools to optimize inventory levels, and we are creating sales tools to allow for more online shopping and purchase options. 
Finally, I want to reiterate our capital allocation priorities. I mentioned that the top priority for us is to invest in both new and existing businesses, with more than half going to accelerate EV growth, as well as continue a strong ICE portfolio that funds our journey while maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. 
To summarize, we had a strong beginning to the year, highlighting the strength of our underlying business. We have again demonstrated our strength, our flexibility, our laser focus on execution and our ability to manage through a significant disruption while still generating strong results. There are still big challenges ahead of us, but we have the team and expertise to navigate this while not losing sight of our vision. We will continue investing in exciting new growth opportunities, including EVs, battery supply and technology and software solutions that will drive growth and desirable differentiated products and services for our customers. 
Despite the challenging environment, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong results in 2021, and I couldn't be more proud of the GM family. 
This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call."

Are all the earnings essentially coming from China and maybe GMF, near term?

But I'd first start off by saying the team is working to get every chip we can and to look at how do we leverage, maybe chips that we weren't planning to use and how do we leverage them as well as simplifying some things. So it's really the ingenuity and creativity of the team that is allowing us to build. Yes, the Renesas fire did have an impact, and the team goes to work and figures out how to offset or minimize it, and that's what they're doing. 
So I think there was a lot of great problem-solving that was done in the in Q1. We have said, we think Q2 will be the weakest, and then we see recovery coming in Q3 and Q4, and that's based on all the work the team is doing, working with suppliers, et cetera. So there's no -- it's just, chip by chip, working the issues to find solutions, and that's what the team is so good at doing. 
But it remains very dynamic. So I think to look here today and try to quantify exactly what all the ins and outs are going to be for the rest of the year, I think it would -- that'd be data that has a pretty short shelf life. But I think what you can count on and what we see with all the work that's been done across the whole supply chain and engineering team is that we have confidence that we're going to be able to hit our guidance and that with everything we know today, we'll be at the top end."

Certainly, the timing is somewhat fluid, and you see that. The fact that the first quarter has blown out expectations in 2Q is under consensus. But if you actually look at the first half, when you add Q1 and Q2 together, it's actually exceeding where Street consensus was for the first half of the year. So I think we're pleased with the way that we're managing through this, and we want to try to keep it to the big picture because we can really get lost in the details on how fluid the situation is."

I think -- I don't think anybody would say that dealer-inventory levels are optimized right now. Just drive by some lots, and you see empty lots. It certainly means that we're operating much, much lower than what I think we even think is optimal. But as we mentioned in the comments, there's a lot of tools that we're learning how to operate at these lean levels that I think will provide some long-term efficiencies. 
And the dealer network has done really an amazing job of not only working with us, but also providing an environment for the customer that where the vehicle may not be immediately available, they give them reassurance to help drive that purchase transaction versus the customer being disappointed that the vehicle that he or she wants -- doesn't want isn't there on the lot. 
So that visibility, I think, undoubtedly, will help us over the long term. And we're taking those lessons and we're figuring out how to make sure that we manage that as efficiently as we can. But we certainly came into the year expecting to build inventories out of -- coming out of the COVID situation. That clearly is challenged amid some of the production issues that we've seen with the semiconductor shortage. But we certainly hope to build as we get into perhaps late 2021 into 2022 to start getting inventory levels at what we think is a much safer value to have vehicles on the lots, where customers want to purchase them."

So you take that and I've always said, we have kind of a revolutionary and an evolutionary strategy around driver assistance all the way to full level 4, level 5 autonomy. So you see Cruise really focused on that full autonomy. 
But Super Cruise, we continue to add more and more features. And we've said that we envision that to get 95% of being able to handle all solutions. Later in the decade, I believe, and there's a lot to still unfold, but I believe we'll have personal autonomous vehicles, and then that will leverage the capability we have at Cruise with the capability that we have at the car company to really be well positioned to delight the customers from that perspective. 
So both paths are very important because the technology we put on vehicles today, I think, makes them safer and delights the customers, and it's going to give us an opportunity for subscription revenue. And then the ultimate work that we're doing at Cruise, I think that is full autonomous, really opens up more possibilities than I think we can outline today."

It's obviously a challenging environment to be able to be thinking about longer term, even 6 months, 9 months ahead as we are navigating through this. So I think what we see is, what I would say, cautious optimism. So while we talk about the second half of the year being similar or potentially slightly better than the first half, there's some caution in that. So for example, things like the used car vehicle prices that GM Financial is clearly benefiting from -- that's likely to stay in place as long as new car inventories remain low. So that's an example of, I would say, a variable that's sort of hedged directly against the challenges of the semiconductor. 
But as more vehicles come online, and I think most industrial forecasts are that chip availability is going to be better in the second half than it is in the first half, and I think we think that's true as well, that could lead to pricing that maybe isn't as strong as it was in the first quarter. So I think we're trying to maintain some caution and some rationality. The reality is we're -- we and others are right in the middle of this. I think we're doing a really good job of managing through it, as evidenced by the first quarter and the fact that the first half of the year is coming in above consensus estimates before we announced, that it's trying to provide a mix of reassurance in the projections that we've given, as well as some cautious optimism about what the future holds."

And I think as we continue to lean in and accelerate some of those vehicle programs, we are investing resources to be able to do that. As to the first part of your question, clearly, commodity inflations had a massive impact, you just need to look at some of the indices to be able to see that. But we're not really isolating that because we're taking all of the cost pressures that we've seen, both from our initial expectations and what's constantly changing, and putting that all into the same bucket. 
So much the same way that the semiconductor issue is fluid in day-to-day, so are the commodity prices going forward. So while we have a little bit of forward purchasing going on, obviously, in the supply chain, there's some exposure out there, but there's also some potential goodness if prices normalize. So we're trying to keep all of that very, very fluid as we manage it in the aggregate, both in terms of go-to-market strategies as well as production prioritization."

So I think it's going to end up being a little higher, especially when you look at our dealer network. I've got them sending me pictures and they have virtually nothing on the lot. 
So there's an optimal level, significantly lower than it was in the past, but higher than it is now. I think what you're seeing now, though, is the ingenuity of our dealers and the new tools we provided that give them insight into what's coming, and they're selling deep, not only into the inventory, but deep into the pipeline of vehicles that are on the way.

As it relates to Dubai, I mean, I think it highlights the fact that as we grow not only in Dubai, but in other cities across the United States, across North America and across the world, we're uniquely positioned in the AV space because we have the ability to produce those vehicles. I mean we're already tooling up the Origin to be produced at Factory ZERO. So that's a huge opportunity for us. And to your point, that's going to drive to the bottom line.

But you did say the first quarter came in better. So I guess the implication is that very little of that semi impact that you called out for the year happened in the first quarter. And then you've always called second quarter worse, but it does seem like maybe it's a little bit worse than a few months ago. So at least that's the impression I got. 
And since you didn't give more clear color on implied second quarter, I think what would really help investors here is if you could compare that second quarter production maybe versus expectations at the beginning of the year. And then as we go forward for the rest of the year, you mentioned GMF is better, we saw that in the guidance. But what -- and you mentioned pricing, but what are you, I guess, specifically assuming? Or how are you thinking about modeling pricing to offset things like higher commodities?"

But that's due in part t",494,"So thanks for that question, Joe. I think I have to go back to the fact that this is obviously a very dynamic situation. I would say, in all honesty, that Q2 is probably worse than we expected. It was going to be a few months ago. But that's due in part to some of the timing of how we map this out. So what I would say is that we are carefully evaluating the short-term supply chain, the intermediate term supply chain and some of the longer-term issues as well. 
So depending on the confidence of where we see chips coming in and which chips, and our ability to reallocate those and reprioritize those, we did see an opportunity to accelerate some production into Q1 to take advantage of the market that we see right now, which is obviously very, very strong and the confidence to be able to make up some of that volume in Q2. So that's why I think we need to be really cautious as we're thinking about the full year. What gives us the confidence is the agility that the team has displayed in being able to respond to this and how dynamic it really is. 
So part of the reason we don't want to anchor in on production volumes and so on is just because that's going to change. It's going to change next week. It's going to change the week after. Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse. So it's really trying to operate in at this level of where we need to take go-to-market strategies, where we need to prioritize mix, where we need to accelerate or potentially shut down a plant in anticipation of some challenges that are coming up over the short to medium term. Then that's kind of what we're doing. You saw that going into plant downtime in Q1. 
So I wouldn't say that Q1 was immune from the semiconductor challenges. I think, certainly, the consumer has proven to be very robust. Used car values continue to go up, which I think is endemic of the inventory challenges that we see across the board and that everybody sees. So all of that is just -- is working in concert into what I would say is a very agile plan for us to meet our objectives. 
It's also why we're trying to steer this to the first half versus Q1 and Q2. So there isn't necessarily a readthrough in the short term because something that happens in March versus something that happens in April isn't really all that relevant to how we're thinking about managing through this. And that's why we have the confidence of looking at where first half expectations were despite the disparity between Q1 and Q2. We actually think that we're performing ahead of expectations that were outlined at the beginning of the year. We just want to be cautious about that in the back half, if that makes sense."

And there seems to be, clearly, this war against ICE waged by governments, by consumers, regulators, right, and then lately OEMs, waging their own war against ICE. And when I talk to car companies and management teams like you on the topic of potential write-downs or impairments, I ask this because many of these investments, of course, that you've made in ICE go a decade or more, 15, maybe even closer to 20 years in some instances. And so I -- maybe it's too soon, but I'd love to get your view on when, along with this journey away from ICE, would it be appropriate as you sit down with your auditors to think about curtailment of useful life and that impact, the financial impact, because it could really change your results, and I think it's pretty relevant. 
If I'm wrong, tell me how I'm wrong, because I'm scratching my head thinking how do you avoid at some point? Is it just you're making too much damn money selling ICE stuff right now, and it's just that the fit isn't right and we need to wait for things to get worse? Help me out there on the impairment potential, over time. I'm not asking -- it's not a 2021 issue, but as we look out."

For General Motors, I think this is a growth opportunity for us because there's a lot of EV interest on the coast. That's where we don't get what I would call our fair share. And frankly, I'm going after more than our fair share on the strength of our product portfolio. So that's point one. We see this as a growth opportunity not only in the U.S. in markets we are in, but in growing into other markets we're currently not participating in. 
I would also say, with the assets that we have right now, when you look at converting a plant from a plant that builds ICE vehicles to those that produce electric vehicles, there's a lot of reuse, body shop structures, or machinery and equipment, a paint shop, which is a 30- to 35-year asset. It doesn't care if it's paint -- what the propulsion system is in the vehicle that we're going to be painting. And so there's a lot of capital that can be reused as we go forward. 
I would also say, with every new internal combustion engine propelled vehicle that we put out, we're looking to make it better for the environment from a fuel economy emission CO2 perspective. And I also think you have to look at the fact that right now, battery costs are coming down, but look at what's in the marketplace right now. I think we're really one of the only people that have an all-electric vehicle that's as affordable as the Bolt EV. We've got to make sure, as we move to an all-electric future, that it truly is for everyone. 
So that's more than an advertising tagline. That's something that General Motors is very much committed to, making sure everybody -- because ESG has an S in the middle of it, which is making sure we're doing the right thing for everyone. So I think we're moving at a very quick speed to be able to provide EVs for everyone. I think it's going to be a growth opportunity for General Motors. And I think a lot of the assets that we currently have can be reused in an all-EV world."

But again, this is one of these technologies that you have to experience it just to understand how phenomenal that it is.

At the same time the team was doing that, we also made significant progress in our transformation from an electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle perspective and some of the new growth opportunities when you look at BrightDrop and OnStar Insurance.

We will work through that and move beyond it, and it's not impacting our transformation and growth strategies.
