I do want to add a fair well to Craig and thank him for many years of service to discover, dating all the way back to great support in our original spinoff from Morgan Stan. 
Our strong fourth quarter results were a Capstone to good performance in a very challenging year, proving the value and resilience of our digital banking business model. 
While the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic were expansive, our business stood out to these challenges, and we earned $799 million after-tax for the fourth quarter and over $1.1 billion for the full year. 
Our fourth quarter results underscore the capital generation of our model. While our revenues were down 4% year-over-year, our outstanding credit performance, combined with the actions we took to reduce our funding costs and control our expenses, enabled us to exit the year with a 30% ROE in the fourth quarter. 
Looking back on the full year, our operating results highlight the strength of our business and the execution of our team. We proactively adapted to the many ways in which pandemic has altered our operating environment, including changes in consumer spending patterns, repayment trends and borrowing habits. 
Discover has always provided best-in-class customer service, and this did not change with the pandemic. While other issuers face significant challenges with long hold times, there was no disruption to our outstanding service as we leveraged our digital capabilities and our 100% U.S.-based customer service. We kept average hold times under 5 minutes through the trough of the downturn, and they quickly return to normal levels of under 1 minute. Additionally, our operational flexibility allowed us to keep our employees safe with nearly all employees continuing to work from home since mid-March. 
Similarly, our history of conservative credit management and the resilience of our prime customer base position us well as we enter this period of economic stress. We also took quick actions to onset of the pandemic to mitigate credit risk by tightening new account underwriting criteria, reducing promotional rate offers and pulling back on credit line increases. And we added $2.4 billion to reserves as the macroeconomic outlook deteriorated. 
As expected, the tightening of our underwriting criteria, combined with elevated payment rates, impacted our loan growth, and our total loans decreased 6% year-over-year. However, we took substantial market share in private student lending and gained share in Car Atlantic. 
Our digital bank operating model, combined with disciplined expense management, has historically generated industry-leading efficiency. But in 2020, we took additional action to control costs and delivered on our commitment to cut $400 million from planned expenses despite absorbing several onetime items that have occurred during the year.  Excluding the onetime items, expenses were down nearly 2% year-over-year. 
We achieved this while still investing in analytics, automation and core technology capabilities to support long-term growth and efficiency improvement. For example, we've invested in new analytics to optimize acquisition marketing to our core customers and we enhanced customer engagement through more targeted offers and interactions. 
Our Payments business was also well positioned heading into last year's sudden economic decline. Our PULSE debit business had a strong year with volume up 10% from 2019, reflecting the impact of stimulus funds and higher transaction sizes as debit became a critical way of procuring goods during the pandemic. 
Our Discover proprietary network was down 2% for the year but exited the fourth quarter at plus 5%, in line with card sales volume. While Diners Club volume declined, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on global T&E spending, we signed 5 new international network partners as we continue to expand global acceptance. 
As we look into 2021, we believe there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the timing and shape of the economic recovery. And some of the impacts from last year's downturn have yet to be fully realized. For this reason, we anticipate deterioration in our credit performance in the back half of this year. Nonetheless, we see reasons for optimism. After bottoming in April, our card sales steadily rebounded throughout the year and returned to growth in the fourth quarter. We saw improvement across all categories, especially in grocery and retail, which now represent more than half of our sales mix. This favorable sales trend has also continued into the first half of January. 
In this environment, we will remain disciplined on expense management, but also committed to making investments for growth and efficiency and anticipate higher marketing expenses relative to 2020 levels. We also anticipate resuming a more normal pattern of capital return. 
Earlier this week, our Board of Directors approved a new $1.1 billion share repurchase plan, and we may begin buybacks as soon as the first quarter, subject to the federal reserves limitations. 
In conclusion, 2020 presented us with unparalleled challenges. But our business model has well positioned, and I couldn't be more pleased with how the team here at Discover responded. I am confident that the actions we took strengthened our business and will drive long-term value for our shareholders and customers. 
While there is still uncertainty around the pace of the recovery, I am optimistic that 2021 will be a better year. I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail."

Good morning, everyone. I'll walk through our fourth quarter results, starting on Slide 4. We earned $799 million in net income or $2.59 per share. These results included several onetime expenses totaling $137 million. Excluding these, E",1521,"Thank you, Roger. Good morning, everyone. I'll walk through our fourth quarter results, starting on Slide 4. We earned $799 million in net income or $2.59 per share. These results included several onetime expenses totaling $137 million. Excluding these, EPS would have been $2.94. 
There were a number of factors, both positive and negative, that influenced our performance during the year. Importantly, our results for 2020 reflect proactive management of our funding and operating costs and our conservative approach to credit management. These factors helped offset the revenue impacts of elevated payment trends and lower sales volumes. However, we're seeing some positive signs with a return to sales growth in the quarter and continued expansion of our net interest margin. 
In the fourth quarter, net interest income was down 2%, reflecting a 5% decline in average receivables and lower loan yields. This was mostly management of our deposit cost. 
Noninterest income was 14% lower, driven by higher rewards costs from strong engagement in the 5% category this quarter. A onetime write-off of certain real estate facilities and lower loan fee income. 
The provision for credit losses was $305 million lower than the prior year due to meaningful improvement in credit performance. There was no change to reserve levels in the current quarter, whereas the prior year included an $85 million reserve build. 
Operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year, driven by onetime items related to software write-offs, charges for penalties and restitution and cost of a voluntary early retirement program. Compensation expense also contributed to the increase. These were partially offset by lower marketing costs and decreased professional fees.  Excluding onetime items, expenses were down 4% from the prior year. 
Turning to loan growth on Slide 5. Total loans were down 6% from the prior year, driven by a 7% decrease in card receivables. Looking at our other lending products, in student loans, we had a strong peak origination season, increasing market share and leading to 7% loan growth. Personal loans were down 7%, as a result of actions we took early in the pandemic to minimize potential credit losses. 
Moving to Slide 6. Net interest margin continued to improve, up 34 basis points from the prior year and 44 basis points from the prior quarter to 10.63%. Compared to the third quarter, lower deposit pricing was the primary driver of the improvement in net interest margin. We cut our online savings rate another 10 basis points from the third quarter as we continue to actively manage funding costs lower. Online savings rates 12-month and 24-month CDs are all down to 50 basis points. 
Lower interest charge-offs and a favorable mix of promotional rate balances also contributed to the margin expansion from the prior quarter. These factors offset the impact of the high level of balance sheet liquidity that we are currently carrying. While this is depressing our net interest margin today, it should benefit margin as we deploy this liquidity into future loan growth. 
Average consumer deposits increased 18% from the prior year. We continue to see steady demand for our consumer deposit products, which were up $1 billion from the prior quarter. All the growth from the third quarter was from indeterminate maturity accounts, which allows us to immediately capture the benefit of deposit rate decreases. 
Turning to Slide 7. We continue to optimize our mix -- our funding mix, and our goal remains to have 70% to 80% of our funding from deposits. We also have an opportunity to benefit from higher rate funding maturities over the next couple of years. Both of these items are expected to benefit net interest margin in future quarters. 
Looking at Slide 8. As Roger noted, we delivered on our commitment to reduce planned expenses by at least $400 million during the year. And I'm pleased to say that we accomplished this goal despite several onetime expense items that occurred in 2020. 
Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter increased $94 million or 8% from the prior year, driven completely by $137 million in onetime expense items. Excluding these, operating expenses would have been down $43 million or 4% year-over-year. Yet, even as we remain disciplined on cost, we continue to invest in analytical capabilities that we expect will drive future growth and efficiency improvements. 
Looking at some of the individual line items. Employee compensation was up $57 million or 13%, driven by a onetime item related to a voluntary early retirement program as well as staffing increases in technology and higher average salaries and benefits. 
Marketing and business development expense was down $75 million or 32%. Most of the reduction was in brand marketing and card acquisition as we aligned marketing spend and tightened credit criteria in response to the changing economic environment. 
Professional fees decreased $22 million or 10%, mainly driven by lower third-party recovery fees related to courts operating at limited capacity. 
On Slide 9, you can see our credit metrics for the quarter. Once again, credit performance was very strong and total charge-offs below 2.4% and credit card net charge-offs near 2.6%. The card net charge-off rate was 78 basis points lower than the prior year, while the net charge-off dollars were down $180 million or 28%. Compared to the third quarter, net card charge-off rate declined 82 basis points. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 55 basis points lower than last year and increased 16 basis points from the prior quarter. 
Credit also remained strong in our private student loan portfolio, with net charge-offs down 31 basis points year-over-year. Excluding purchase loans, that 30-plus delinquency rate improved 40 basis points from the prior year and 9 basis points compared to the prior quarter. In our personal loan portfolio, net charge-offs were down 147 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 29 basis points year-over-year. 
To wrap up credit, this was another quarter of strong performance across all of our lending products, driven by the actions we've taken in underwriting, line management and collections, the resiliency of our prime customer base and the impact of government stimulus. 
We believe that losses will increase in the second half of 2021 and into 2022. However, the timing and magnitude of losses could be impacted by any additional government assistance or material shifts in the economic environment. 
Moving to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. We help flat to the prior quarter. While the macro environment has improved, the outlook remains uncertain. Similar to our past approach, we've modeled several different economic scenarios. The primary assumption is [Audio Gap] '21 unemployment rate of about 8% and and GDP growth of about 2.7%. We did not include any additional stimulus beyond what has already been provided to consumers. Our economic scenarios also considered the increasing number of COVID cases, the timing of the vaccine rollout and the recent increase in unemployment claims. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our common equity tier 1 ratio increased 90 basis points sequentially to 13.1%, remaining above our 10.5% internal target and well above regulatory minimum. We have continued to fund our quarterly dividend at $0.44 per share. 
Regarding share repurchases, as Roger indicated, earlier this week, we received authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $1.1 billion of common stock. And we intend to begin share buybacks in the first quarter, subject to the Federal reserve, regulatory limitations. 
Moving to Slide 12 and some perspectives on how to think about 2021. We anticipate modest positive loan growth for the year. We see opportunities for customer acquisitions, but the level of growth will be dependent on payment rate trends and the timing and pace of the broad economic recovery. 
With respect to our net interest margin, as I previously mentioned, we expect we will continue to see benefits to margin from lower deposit rates and maturity of higher rate funding. We also remain committed to disciplined expense management, and we'll continue to invest to drive profitable, long-term growth and efficiency improvements. This includes increased marketing investments for new customer acquisition as well as investments in advanced analytics and technology capabilities. 
In terms of credit performance, as I've already noted, we expect losses to increase in the second half of 2021 and remain elevated into 2022. 
Finally, our capital allocation strategy has not changed, and we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. 
In summary, we had a solid fourth quarter with strong credit performance across the portfolio; net interest margin expansion, driven by lower funding costs; flat reserves; and excluding onetime items, operating expenses were down year-over-year. I'm very pleased with our execution throughout 2020 and Discover's efforts to protect employees and provide uninterrupted best-in-class service to our customers. The quick actions we took at the onset of the pandemic, and our investment in core capabilities, protected and strengthened the Discover franchise in 2020. The challenges we face demonstrate the resiliency of Discover's digital banking business model. And while uncertainty remains, we are well positioned for growth as our economy continues to recover. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Maria, to open the line for Q&A."

And then I'll talk more specifically around marketing and new customer acquisition and growth. So in terms of expenses, business is committed to driving positive operating leverage over the midterm. Now opportunities in 2021 will dictate how much marketing dollars we ultimately end up spending for new customer acquisition. But in terms of the overall expense base, there will be incremental dollars for marketing, new customer acquisition and third-party recovery fees. As courts reopened, we expect that those fees will increase consistent with the level of recoveries that we hope to achieve on bankrupt accounts. 
So outside of those areas, we're targeting to keep expenses flat across the business. Now certain accounts may go higher, certainly may go lower, but the way you can think about it is growth initiatives, incremental spend, the balance of the income statement in terms of expenses will be flat to down. 
In terms of new account growth, what we're targeting is mid-single digits. Maybe if we're fortunate, we see some opportunities, upper single-digit account growth. And we hope that will translate into increased loan balances. We didn't give any specific guidance on loan balances because of the broad economy uncertainty there and frankly, repayment trends have been pretty remarkable and with it potential new round of stimulus that could further increase the prepayment trends. So that's how we're thinking about growth and expenses. So if there's a follow-up, we could take a quick follow-up. If not, we'll head on to the next question."

However, I think Moody's has been improving their unemployment assumptions and that rate is declining sort of in the second half of this year and into 2022.

So the resiliency of our customer base has been remarkably strong. So in terms of the modeled assumptions -- so in my script, I talked about 8% unemployment at the end of 2021. I realize that's higher than where we are today from a reported number. And we also assumed GDP growth of 2.7%. Now there are some folks forecasting an increase in GDP as well. So as we thought about the reserves and the positioning of the balance sheet, there's a couple of things that we took into account. So first is the overall unemployment numbers. The number is about 10.7 million people out of work. There's another 7.3 million people that aren't included in the unemployment number due to the fact that they haven't actively worked -- looked for work in the past 4 weeks. So to me, where we are from a life of loan loss reserving standpoint made perfect sense is conservative. We didn't feel like we had enough data points at this point, given the level of uncertainty to make a material change to the absolute level of reserves in the fourth quarter, given a life of loan reserving assumption. But I can say this, we're going to continue to look at our portfolio and the macro environment. We're going to look specifically at the trajectory of unemployment and the type of unemployment. So we're seeing unemployment levels transition from service workers to white collar workers who would more likely be representative of our customer base and the impact of stimulus. So today, we're well positioned, and we're going to continue to reassess it the first quarter, second quarter and into the second half of next year and make appropriate adjustments."

So ultimately, we didn't want to be out at the far edge of the buyback envelope. We felt that $1.1 billion was an appropriate return of capital given a level of uncertainty. And that will take a dent out of, what I'll say is, the excess capital that we have right now. But our earnings power will be really important, and that will give us an opportunity to reassess that in 2022 as well."

So a way to think about that is we ended the fourth quarter at the 10.63% that you just mentioned. My view is that we still have some opportunity on deposit pricing, especially if there's another round of stimulus because that will put a lot of liquidity in the market. And the competition for deposits will further abate. 
Now how much ultimately we have room -- we have there uncertain is 10, 20 or more bps to be determined. But in my view, at least 10 bps, very conservative view. The maturity profile, we included that information in the deck to allow folks to be able to model through some improvements that we'll see there. And then -- so frankly, some things that are pushing against net interest margin, especially in the second half of the year. If the credit losses do accelerate as we've indicated, that will put some dampening pressure on net interest margin. So broadly speaking, we do see further room for expansion there.

And so buyout, pay later is the most recent trend that's out there. We're looking at that very carefully and have yet to be able to see an impact on our revolving loan balances.

In terms of the broker CDs, we actually use that almost as a valve of sorts, right? So as our funding needs increase, we'll go more heavily into brokered CDs. As they decrease, we shrink it. So that's the way we've managed it traditionally. It's going to continue to be a liquidity channel for us, but a, what I'd say, less important channel over time in terms of total quantum of deposits."

Our strong fourth quarter results were the capstone to good performance in a very challenging year, proving the value and resilience of our digital banking business model.  
While the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic were expansive, our business stood up to these challenges, and we earned $799 million after-tax for the fourth quarter and over $1.1 billion for the full year.  
Our fourth quarter results underscore the capital generation of our model. While our revenues were down 4% year-over-year, our outstanding credit performance, combined with the actions we took to reduce our funding costs and control our expenses, enabled us to exit the year with a 30% ROE in the fourth quarter.  
Looking back on the full year, our operating results highlight the strength of our business and the execution of our team. We proactively adapted to the many ways in which the pandemic has altered our operating environment, including changes in consumer spending patterns, repayment trends and borrowing habits.  
Discover has always provided best-in-class customer service, and this did not change with the pandemic. While other issuers faced significant challenges with long hold times, there was no disruption to our outstanding service as we leveraged our digital capabilities and our 100% U.S.-based customer service. We kept average hold times under 5 minutes through the trough of the downturn, and they quickly returned to normal levels of under 1 minute. 
Additionally, our operational flexibility allowed us to keep our employees safe with nearly all employees continuing to work from home since mid-March.  
Similarly, our history of conservative credit management and the resilience of our prime customer base positioned us well as we entered this period of economic stress. We also took quick actions at the onset of the pandemic to mitigate credit risk by tightening new account underwriting criteria, reducing promotional rate offers and pulling back on credit line increases. And we added $2.4 billion to reserves as the macroeconomic outlook deteriorated.  
As expected, the tightening of our underwriting criteria, combined with elevated payment rates, impacted our loan growth, and our total loans decreased 6% year-over-year. However, we took substantial market share in private student lending and gained share in core Atlantic.  
Our digital bank operating model, combined with disciplined expense management, has historically generated industry-leading efficiency. But in 2020, we took additional action to control costs and delivered on our commitment to cut $400 million from planned expenses despite absorbing several onetime items that have occurred during the year.  Excluding the onetime items, expenses were down nearly 2% year-over-year.  
We achieved this while still investing in analytics, automation and core technology capabilities to support long-term growth and efficiency improvement. For example, we've invested in new analytics to optimize acquisition marketing to our core customers and we enhanced customer engagement through more targeted offers and interactions.  
Our Payments business was also well positioned heading into last year's sudden economic decline. Our PULSE debit business had a strong year with volume up 10% from 2019, reflecting the impact of stimulus funds and higher transaction sizes as debit became a critical way of procuring goods during the pandemic.  
Our Discover proprietary network was down 2% for the year but exited the fourth quarter at plus 5%, in line with card sales volume. While Diners Club volume declined, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on global T&E spending, we signed 5 new international network partners as we continue to expand global acceptance.  
As we look into 2021, we believe there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the timing and shape of the economic recovery. And some of the impacts from last year's downturn have yet to be fully realized. For this reason, we anticipate deterioration in our credit performance in the back half of this year. Nonetheless, we see reasons for optimism. After bottoming in April, our card sales steadily rebounded throughout the year and returned to growth in the fourth quarter. We saw improvement across all categories, especially in grocery and retail, which now represent more than half of our sales mix. This favorable sales trend has also continued into the first half of January.  
In this environment, we will remain disciplined on expense management, but also committed to making investments for growth and efficiency and anticipate higher marketing expenses relative to 2020 levels. We also anticipate resuming a more normal pattern of capital return.  
Earlier this week, our Board of Directors approved a new $1.1 billion share repurchase plan, and we may begin buybacks as soon as the first quarter, subject to the Federal Reserve's limitations.  
In conclusion, 2020 presented us with unparalleled challenges. But our business model has well positioned, and I couldn't be more pleased with how the team here at Discover responded. I am confident that the actions we took strengthened our business and will drive long-term value for our shareholders and customers.  
While there is still uncertainty around the pace of the recovery, I am optimistic that 2021 will be a better year. I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail."

Good morning, everyone. I'll walk through our fourth quarter results, starting on Slide 4. We earned $799 million in net income or $2.59 per share. These results included several onetime expenses totaling $137 million. Excluding these, E",1601,"Thank you, Roger. Good morning, everyone. I'll walk through our fourth quarter results, starting on Slide 4. We earned $799 million in net income or $2.59 per share. These results included several onetime expenses totaling $137 million. Excluding these, EPS would have been $2.94.  
There were a number of factors, both positive and negative, that influenced our performance during the year. Importantly, our results for 2020 reflect proactive management of our funding and operating costs and our conservative approach to credit management. These factors helped offset the revenue impacts of elevated payment trends and lower sales volumes. However, we're seeing some positive signs with a return to sales growth in the quarter and continued expansion of our net interest margin.  
In the fourth quarter, net interest income was down 2%, reflecting a 5% decline in average receivables and lower loan yields. This was mostly offset by decreased funding cost driven by lower market rate and management of our deposit cost.  
Noninterest income was 14% lower, driven by higher rewards cost from strong engagement in the 5% category this quarter. A onetime write-off of certain real estate facilities and lower loan fee income also contributed to the year-over-year decrease.
The provision for credit losses was $305 million lower than the prior year due to meaningful improvement in credit performance. There was no change to reserve levels in the current quarter, whereas the prior year included an $85 million reserve build.  
Operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year, driven by onetime items related to software write-offs, charges for penalties and restitution and cost of a voluntary early retirement program. Compensation expense also contributed to the increase. These were partially offset by lower marketing costs and decreased professional fees.  Excluding onetime items, expenses were down 4% from the prior year.
Turning to loan growth on Slide 5. Total loans were down 6% from the prior year, driven by a 7% decrease in card receivables. Lower card receivables were the result of 3 factors: first, payment rates continued to be elevated. While this has reduced loan balances, it has had a favorable impact to credit performance. Second, promotional balances have continued to decline due to actions we took early in the pandemic to tighten credit. And third, an increase in transactor activity.
Looking at our other lending products, in student loans, we had a strong peak origination season, increasing market share and leading to 7% loan growth. Personal loans were down 7%, as a result of actions we took early in the pandemic to minimize potential credit losses.  
Moving to Slide 6. Net interest margin continued to improve, up 34 basis points from the prior year and 44 basis points from the prior quarter to 10.63%. Compared to the third quarter, lower deposit pricing was the primary driver of the improvement in net interest margin. We cut our online savings rate another 10 basis points from the third quarter as we continue to actively manage funding costs lower. Online savings rates, 12-month and 24-month CDs are all down to 50 basis points.  
Lower interest charge-offs and a favorable mix of promotional rate balances also contributed to the margin expansion from the prior quarter. These factors offset the impact of the high level of balance sheet liquidity that we are currently carrying. While this is depressing our net interest margin today, it should benefit margin as we deploy this liquidity into future loan growth.  
Average consumer deposits increased 18% from the prior year. We continue to see steady demand for our consumer deposit products, which were up $1 billion from the prior quarter. All of the growth from the third quarter was from indeterminate maturity accounts, which allows us to immediately capture the benefit of deposit rate decreases.  
Turning to Slide 7. We continue to optimize our mix -- our funding mix, and our goal remains to have 70% to 80% of our funding from deposits. We also have an opportunity to benefit from higher rate funding maturities over the next couple of years. Both of these items are expected to benefit net interest margin in future quarters.  
Looking at Slide 8. As Roger noted, we delivered on our commitment to reduce planned expenses by at least $400 million during the year. And I'm pleased to say that we accomplished this goal despite several onetime expense items that occurred in 2020.  
Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter increased $94 million or 8% from the prior year, driven completely by $137 million in onetime expense items. Excluding these, operating expenses would have been down $43 million or 4% year-over-year. Yet, even as we remain disciplined on cost, we continue to invest in analytical capabilities that we expect will drive future growth and efficiency improvements.  
Looking at some of the individual line items. Employee compensation was up $57 million or 13%, driven by a onetime item related to a voluntary early retirement program as well as staffing increases in technology and higher average salaries and benefits.  
Marketing and business development expense was down $75 million or 32%. Most of the reduction was in brand marketing and card acquisition as we aligned marketing spend and tightened credit criteria in response to the changing economic environment.  
Professional fees decreased $22 million or 10%, mainly driven by lower third-party recovery fees related to courts operating at limited capacity.  
On Slide 9, you can see our credit metrics for the quarter. Once again, credit performance was very strong and total charge-offs below 2.4% and credit card net charge-offs near 2.6%. The card net charge-off rate was 78 basis points lower than the prior year, while the net charge-off dollars were down $180 million or 28%. Compared to the third quarter, net card charge-off rate declined 82 basis points. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 55 basis points lower than last year and increased 16 basis points from the prior quarter.  
Credit also remained strong in our private student loan portfolio, with net charge-offs down 31 basis points year-over-year. Excluding purchase loans, that 30-plus delinquency rate improved 40 basis points from the prior year and 9 basis points compared to the prior quarter. In our personal loan portfolio, net charge-offs were down 147 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 29 basis points year-over-year.  
To wrap up credit, this was another quarter of strong performance across all of our lending products, driven by the actions we've taken in underwriting, line management and collections, the resiliency of our prime customer base and the impact of government stimulus.  
We believe that losses will increase in the second half of 2021 and into 2022. However, the timing and magnitude of losses could be impacted by any additional government assistance or material shifts in the economic environment.  
Moving to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. We held allowance flat to the prior quarter. While the macro environment has improved, the outlook remains uncertain. Similar to our past approach, we've modeled several different economic scenarios. The primary assumptions in our economic battle were a year end 2021 unemployment rate of about 8% and GDP growth of about 2.7%. We did not include any additional stimulus beyond what has already been provided to consumers. Our economic scenarios also considered the increasing number of COVID cases, the timing of the vaccine rollout and the recent increase in unemployment claims.  
Turning to Slide 11. Our common equity tier 1 ratio increased 90 basis points sequentially to 13.1%, remaining above our 10.5% internal target and well above regulatory minimum. We have continued to fund our quarterly dividend at $0.44 per share.  
Regarding share repurchases, as Roger indicated, earlier this week, we received authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $1.1 billion of common stock. And we intend to begin share buybacks in the first quarter, subject to the Federal Reserve's regulatory limitations.  
Moving to Slide 12 and some perspectives on how to think about 2021. We anticipate modest positive loan growth for the year. We see opportunities for customer acquisitions, but the level of growth will be dependent on payment rate trends and the timing and pace of the broad economic recovery.  
With respect to our net interest margin, as I previously mentioned, we expect we will continue to see benefits to margin from lower deposit rates and maturity of higher rate funding. We also remain committed to disciplined expense management, and we'll continue to invest to drive profitable, long-term growth and efficiency improvements. This includes increased marketing investments for new customer acquisition as well as investments in advanced analytics and technology capabilities.  
In terms of credit performance, as I've already noted, we expect losses to increase in the second half of 2021 and remain elevated into 2022.  
Finally, our capital allocation strategy has not changed, and we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.  
In summary, we had a solid fourth quarter with strong credit performance across the portfolio; net interest margin expansion, driven by lower funding costs; flat reserves; and excluding onetime items, operating expenses were down year-over-year. I'm very pleased with our execution throughout 2020 and Discover's efforts to protect employees and provide uninterrupted best-in-class service to our customers. The quick actions we took at the onset of the pandemic, and our investment in core capabilities, protected and strengthened the Discover franchise in 2020. The challenges we face demonstrate the resiliency of Discover's digital banking business model. And while uncertainty remains, we are well positioned for growth as our economy continues to recover.  
With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Maria, to open the line for Q&A."

Now opportunities in 2021 will dictate how much marketing dollars we ultimately end up spending for new customer acquisition. But in terms of the overall expense base, there will be incremental dollars for marketing, new customer acquisition and third-party recovery fees. As courts reopen, we expect that those fees will increase consistent with the level of recoveries that we hope to achieve on bankrupt accounts. 
So outside of those areas, we're targeting to keep expenses flat across the business. Now certain accounts may go higher, certain may go lower, but the way you can think about it is growth initiatives, incremental spend, the balance of the income statement in terms of expenses will be flat to down. 
In terms of new account growth, what we're targeting is mid-single digits. Maybe if we're fortunate, we see some opportunities, upper single-digit account growth. And we hope that will translate into increased loan balances. We didn't give any specific guidance on loan balances because of the broad economy uncertainty there and frankly, repayment trends have been pretty remarkable and with it, potential new round of stimulus that could further increase the repayment trends. So that's how we're thinking about growth and expenses. So if there's a follow-up, we could take a quick follow-up. If not, we'll head on to the next question."

I understand sort of the reversion to the mean assumption given the underlying unemployment rate. However, I think Moody's has been improving their unemployment assumptions, and that rate is declining sort of in the second half of this year into 2022. I'm just curious sort of how to put sort of your assumption that the loss rates will get to the reserve levels -- those embedded in the reserve assumptions. And at what point do you reassess that? Is there something seeing inside your portfolio that's leading you to be more conservative?"

So the resiliency of our customer base has been remarkably strong. So in terms of the modeled assumptions -- so in my script, I talked about 8% unemployment at the end of 2021. I realize that's higher than where we are today from a reported number. And we also assumed GDP growth of 2.7%. 
Now there are some folks forecasting an increase in GDP as well. So as we thought about the reserves and the positioning of the balance sheet, there's a couple of things that we took into account. So first is the overall unemployment numbers. The number is about 10.7 million people out of work. There's another 7.3 million people that aren't included in the unemployment number due to the fact that they haven't actively worked -- looked for work in the past 4 weeks. So to me, where we are from a life of loan loss reserving standpoint made perfect sense is conservative. We didn't feel like we had enough data points at this point, given the level of uncertainty to make a material change to the absolute level of reserves in the fourth quarter, given a life of loan reserving assumption. But I can say this, we're going to continue to look at our portfolio and the macro environment. We're going to look specifically at the trajectory of unemployment and the type of unemployment. So we're seeing unemployment levels transition from service workers to white collar workers who would more likely be representative of our customer base and the impact of stimulus. So today, we're well positioned, and we're going to continue to reassess it first quarter, second quarter and into the second half of next year and make appropriate adjustments."

When we think about what you've said in terms of marketing and adding new accounts, that makes sense. There will presumably be a lag in loan growth as you add accounts. Historically, when you started to grow the portfolio, again, it's been led by wallet share gains and line limit increases. I'm curious when you think you might take that sort of brownout on line limit increases off?  And how we should think also about rewards rate as you think about wallet share going forward?"

But beyond that, we feel very good about where we're positioned and the competitiveness of our program. 
In terms of growth, it's always been a mix of new accounts and stimulating the existing portfolio. And so it will remain that going forward. In terms of what would get us to loosen credit, I think many of the indicators that John talked about, right? So getting better line of sight in the direction of white collar employment is probably the most critical one."

So ultimately, we didn't want to be out at the far edge of the buyback envelope. We felt that $1.1 billion was an appropriate return of capital given a level of uncertainty.

And the competition for deposits will further abate. 
Now how much ultimately we have room -- we have there, uncertain, is it 10, 20 or more bps, to be determined. But in my view, at least 10 bps, very conservative view. The maturity profile, we included that information in the deck to allow folks to be able to model through some improvements that we'll see there. And then -- so frankly, some things that are pushing against net interest margin, especially in the second half of the year is if the credit losses do accelerate as we've indicated, that will put some dampening pressure on net interest margin.

But with our low-cost direct-to-consumer digital model as well as the advantage we have from being exempt from the Durbin Interchange Caps because we own our proprietary network, we're uniquely positioned for a bank over $10 billion. And so it isn't maybe the primary focus right now, just given the excess level of fundings, but it is a critical initiative. And we feel good about our ability to compete both against traditional branch-based banks, but also against any of the new fintech players."

In terms of other products, we talked about student loans. For personal loans, we have modestly widened credit on that. That was the product we tightened the most, just given the volatile in the downturn. We've loosened up, I would say, marginally and feel good about what we're originating, positioned a little differently than most. We've always had a relatively narrow credit box for that, and those loans are sort of bigger ticket debt consolidation primarily.

Last April, if you told me to the year into the pandemic, we'd be reporting excellent credit performance, positive sales trends and solid earnings growth, I wouldn't have believed it. W",772,"Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. Last April, if you told me to the year into the pandemic, we'd be reporting excellent credit performance, positive sales trends and solid earnings growth, I wouldn't have believed it. 
While the pandemic is far from over and there may be twists and turns ahead, as a nation, we have made tremendous progress toward addressing the health crisis and reopening the economy. 
This quarter, we earned $1.6 billion after tax or $5.04 per share. I'm very pleased with these results, which reflect our robust business model; strong execution, including a disciplined approach to managing credit; improving economic trends; and the impact of federal support for U.S. consumers. 
Since the end of 2020, our view on economic conditions has improved. The rapid pace of the recovery has lessened our concern of job losses spreading to the white collar workforce, and there has also been substantial support for the U.S. consumer through stimulus in January and in March. 
Our current expectation is that credit losses in 2021 will be flat to down year-over-year. This improved economic view, combined with lower loan balances and continued strong credit performance, were the primary drivers of $879 million reserve release in the quarter. 
As discussed in previous quarters, the strong credit performance was accompanied by elevated payment rates that continue to put pressure on loan balances, which were down 7% year-over-year. 
Payment rates were over 350 basis points higher than last year and at their highest level since the year 2000. While the impact from stimulus payments should abate over the next few months, we expect payment rates will remain elevated for the rest of the year as households use savings to meet debt obligations and continue to benefit from payment relief programs, such as federal student loan and mortgage payment forbearance. 
Despite this pressure, we still expect modest loan growth this year, supported by several factors. First, there has been a significant increase in sales volume, up 11% from a year ago and up 15% from the first quarter of 2019. 
Improving trends in categories like retail and restaurants are positive signs for future growth. Additionally, based on our credit performance and our current outlook for macro conditions, we have begun to migrate our credit standards back to pre-pandemic levels. 
This is particularly true in card, where our value proposition centered on best-in-class customer service, valuable rewards and no fees continues to resonate strongly among consumers. We're also expanding credit standards and personal loans, but not quite back to 2019 norms. 
To offset the higher payment rate as well as leverage these credit actions, we intend to increase our marketing spending through the rest of this year. Outside of marketing, we expect that expenses will be relatively flat year-over-year as we remain committed to expense management. 
We're reinvesting some of the benefits from our strong credit performance and efficiency gains into technology and analytics to further improve our account acquisition, targeting, fraud detection and collections capabilities. 
The rapid pace of the economic recovery and strong credit performance may provide additional opportunities to lean further into growth. We intend to take advantage of these opportunities and may make additional marketing and nonmarketing investments that will create long-term value. 
On the payment side, we've continued strong performance in our PULSE business, with volumes up 23%, driven by stimulus payments in the first quarter and higher average spend per transaction. 
We also continue to expand our global acceptance through network partnerships, and this quarter, we signed new partners in Jordan and Malaysia. 
Our digital banking model generates high returns, and we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. This quarter, we restarted our share repurchase program with $119 million in buybacks in line with the regulatory restrictions still in place. 
Looking at our strong credit performance and robust earnings, we see an opportunity to revisit our capital return to shareholders in the second half of the year. As I look towards the future, I'm excited about Discover's prospects. 
Our products continue to bring value to our customers. We remain flexible as we support our employees and their families through the pandemic, and we are well positioned to continue driving long-term value for our shareholders. 
Before I turn it over to John, one last thing, you may not know it, but our CLO, Wanji Walcott, sits in on these calls and is a great part of the team.

I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on Slide 4. As Roger indicated, the results this period reflects many of the same dynamics we've seen over the past few quarters. 
The influence of stimulus resulted in elevated payment rates, which pressured loan growth. It also contributed to the strong asset quality and our significant reserve release in the quarter. 
Revenue, net of interest expense, decreased 3% from the prior year, mainly from lower net interest income. This was driven by a 7% decline in average receivables and lower market rates, partially offset by a reduction in funding costs as we continue to manage deposit pricing and optimize our funding mix. 
Noninterest income was 5% lower, primarily due to a $35 million net gain from the sale of an equity investment in the prior year. Consistent with our excellent credit quality, lower loan fee income reflects a decline in late fees, while net discount and interchange revenue was up 12% from the prior year, reflecting the increased sales volume. 
The provision for credit losses was $2 billion lower than the prior year, mainly due to an $879 million reserve release in the current quarter compared to a $1.1 billion reserve build in the prior year. 
Our improved economic outlook, lower loan balances and strong credit drove the release. Additionally, net charge-offs decreased 30% or $232 million in the prior year. Operating expenses decreased 7% year-over-year as we remain disciplined on expense management. 
Other than compensation, all other expenses were down from the prior year, led by marketing, which decreased 33% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we intend to accelerate marketing investments over the remainder of the year. We'll go into details on our spending outlook in a few moments. 
Moving to loan growth on Slide 5. Total loans were down 7% from the prior year, driven by a 9% decrease in card receivables. The reduction in card receivables was driven by 2 primary factors: first, the payment rate remained elevated, driven by the latest round of stimulus and improved household cash flows; second, promotional balances have continued digit decline, reflecting the actions we took at the onset of the pandemic to tighten credit. 
As a result, these balances were approximately 300 basis points lower than the prior year, although we expect new account growth will cause promotional balances to begin to stabilize. As the economy reopens further, we believe consumer spending and prudent expansion of our credit box should drive profitable loan growth going forward. 
Looking at our other lending products. Organic student loans increased 5% from the prior year and originations returned to prepandemic levels. We continue to gain market share through the mini peak season. 
Personal loans were down 9%, primarily due to actions which are early in the pandemic to minimize credit losses. As we've previously mentioned, we see opportunity to expand credit a bit given the strong performance of this portfolio. 
Moving to Slide 6. The net interest margin was 10.75%, up 54 basis points from the prior year and 12 basis points sequentially. Compared to the prior quarter, the improvement in net interest margin was driven by lower deposit pricing as we cut our online savings rates from 50 to 40 basis points during the quarter. 
We also continued to benefit from the maturity of higher rate CDs and a favorable shift in funding mix. Our funding from consumer deposits is now at 65%. 
Future deposit pricing actions will be dependent upon our funding needs and competitive pricing. Average consumer deposits were up 14% year-over-year and flat to the prior quarter. 
Consumer CDs were down 7% from the prior quarter, while savings and money markets increased 4%. Loan yield was flat to the prior year, seasonal revolve rate favorability and a lower mix of promotional rate balances were offset by the impact of reduced pricing on personal loans. 
Looking at Slide 7. Total noninterest income was $465 million, down $25 million or 5% year-over-year, driven by the onetime gain in the prior year that I previously mentioned. 
Excluding this, noninterest income was up 2%. Net discount and interchange revenue increased 12% as revenue from higher sales volume was partially offset by higher rewards costs. 
The decrease in loan fee income was driven by lower late fees, which moved in line with delinquency trends. 
Looking at Slide 8. Total operating expenses are down $78 million or 7% from the prior year. Marketing and business development decreased $77 million or 33% year-over-year. The reduction reflects actions we implemented in March of last year to align marketing spend with tightened credit criteria. 
However, we accelerated our marketing spend late in the first quarter and plan to continue this through the year. These investments will drive new account acquisition and loan growth. 
The year-over-year decrease in other expenses was mainly driven by lower fraud volume due to enhanced analytics around disputed transactions and decreased fraud in deposits. 
This improvement demonstrates that a small part of the benefit we expect from the investments we've made in analytics over the past few years. Partially offsetting the favorability was a $39 million increase in employment compensation that was driven by 2 factors: $22 million from a higher bonus accrual in the current year. The remaining increase was driven by higher average salaries reflecting the talent build in our technology and analytics team. 
Moving to Slide 9. We had another strong quarter of very strong credit performance. The total charge-offs were 2.5%, down 79 basis points year-over-year and up 10 basis points sequentially. The card net charge-off rate was 2.8%, 85 basis points lower than the prior year, with the net charge-off dollars down $209 million or 31%. 
Sequentially, the card net charge-off rate increased 17 basis points and net charge-off dollars were up $11 million. The increase in card net charge-offs from the prior quarter was driven by accounts that had been in Skip-a-Pay and did not gear. The program ended 6 months ago. And at this time, most of the accounts that were in Skip-a-Pay have returned to making payments. 
Looking forward, we expect minimal impact to charge-offs from this population. The card 30-plus delinquency rate was 1.85%, down 77 basis points from the prior year and 22 basis points lower sequentially. With the influence of the Skip-a-Pay group now largely complete, we think that delinquencies are the most clear indicator of our loss trajectory over the short term. 
Credit remained strong in private student loans. Net charge-offs were down 15 basis points year-over-year and 18 basis points compared to the prior quarter. The 30-plus delinquency rate improved 55 basis points from the prior year and 19 basis points sequentially. 
In personal loans, net charge-offs were down 79 basis points year-over-year with a 30-plus delinquency rate down 47 basis points from the prior year and 24 basis points from the prior quarter. 
The positive impact of additional stimulus, combined with an improved economic outlook, have shifted our expectation on the timing of losses. We had previously expected losses would increase in the second half of this year and remain elevated into 2022. That is no longer the case. 
Based on our current delinquency trends, we believe losses are likely to be flat to down this year with the possibility of some increase in 2022. That said, a material shift in the economic environment could alter the timing and magnitude of losses. 
Moving to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. This quarter, we released $879 million from the allowance. This reflected several factors including favorable changes to our macro assumptions, a moderate decrease in our loan balance, the continued decline in delinquencies and lower losses. 
Relative to our view in January, the economic outlook has continued to improve. As we've done in prior quarters, we've modeled several different scenarios and took a conservative but more optimistic view. 
Our assumptions on unemployment were a year-end 2021 rate of 6%. With a return to full employment in late 2023, we assumed GDP growth of about 4.6%. Our reserve assumptions did not contemplate any additional stimulus direct to consumers, but did anticipate broader economic benefits from infrastructure spending beginning in the second half of this year. 
The modest increase in reserves in our student loan portfolio was driven by loan growth coming out of the mini-peak season. 
Looking at Slide 11. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased 180 basis points sequentially to 14.9%, well above our internal target of 10.5%. We have continued to fund our quarterly dividend at $0.44 per share and repurchased $119 million of common stock during the quarter. 
Our Board of Directors previously authorized up to $1.1 billion of repurchases. We will likely accelerate our share repurchases in the second quarter, and we see the potential for capital returns to increase in the second half of the year. 
As I mentioned earlier, we continued to optimize our funding mix and consumer deposits now make up 65% of total funding. Our goal remains to have 70%, 80% of our fund from deposits, which we feel is achievable, though we expect some quarter-to-quarter variability in this figure. 
Moving to Slide 12. Our perspectives on 2021 have evolved from last quarter. We continue to anticipate modest positive loan growth for the year. We are investing in new account acquisition and have already seen strong sales growth through the first quarter. High payment rates will continue to pressure loan growth near term, but should become less of a headwind over the course of the year. Versus the first quarter level, we expect our NIM to remain in a relatively narrow range over the rest of the year. 
While we'll continue to benefit from improved funding cost and mix, we may experience modest yield pressure over the next few quarters from variability in the revolve rate. 
Our commitment to expense management has not changed, but as Roger mentioned, we believe there is an opportunity to drive long-term growth through increased marketing and further investments in data and analytics. 
Excluding marketing, expenses should be near flat from the prior year. Credit performance has remained stronger than originally anticipated, and we now expect credit losses to be flat to down compared to 2020. 
Lastly, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividend and buybacks. Given the level of reserve release and the strength of our fundamental performance, we plan to revisit our capital return levels for the second half of this year. 
In summary, we're pleased with our first quarter results. Our sales trend, credit expansion and marketing investments position us well for growth going forward. We released $879 million of reserves; NIM continued to improve, driven by lower funding costs; and expenses were down, but we'll invest in marketing and analytics that will drive revenue as well as operating and credit cost improvements over the longer term. 
As the economy reopens, I'm positive regarding the opportunities for growth. We have a strong value proposition that resonates with the consumers, and our digital banking model positions us well for strong returns going forward. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Maria, to open the lines for Q&A."

Clearly, one of the biggest differences versus 2019 is the payment rate. And that's partly driven by the cash payments to consumers, the savings rate, but also the relief they get, be it on their federal student loans or other payments they have to make. 
And so that's a real headwinds against loan growth. And as I mentioned on the call, it's actually at the highest level since the year 2000. In terms of marketing, we feel very good about the cost per accounts, about the projected returns we'll get on those, have widened our credit box back to the prepandemic. Although as you recall, we have been tightening for a couple of years, and I would say, continue to remain conservative in our overall credit approach. 
So I really think it's a headwind from payment rates that has kept us from being even more enthusiastic about loan growth."

You talked about reevaluating in the second half of the year. I guess, given the outlook for credit potential for further reserve releases, I think it's fair to say you guys are going to be building in capital in the near term. 
So how should we think about the time frame of getting back to that 10.5% CET1 level? And how does that -- how does CECL day 1 factor into that? And I guess, Roger, as a follow-up to that, just given all the capital sit around, does it at all change the way you think about acquisitions? And if so, what would be the priorities?"

I'll start it, and then I'll turn it over to Roger for the second piece of the question. So really, really strong performance. And the economy has strengthened beyond our expectations, as we said in our prepared remarks. 
So we came into the year somewhat optimistic, but also cautious given the amount of certainty. What we're seeing is kind of a broad-based improvement in the economy, our credit fundamentals have been extremely strong. As a result, we made a decision to -- an appropriate decision to release about $900 million of reserve, taking the -- obviously, the CET1 ratio well above our internal target of 10.5%. 
We're looking to come back to that 10.5% point. We're not going to do it overnight. We know the CECL transition is somewhere between 200 and 250 basis points on CET1, but that still leaves ample room for actions in terms of dividends, buybacks and targeted M&A when and if appropriate. 
So specifics around timing getting back to 10.5%, I would broadly say medium term, but we're certainly committed to that target. And we'll do a number of efforts, including revisiting our buyback levels in the second half of this year to get there. 
And the follow-up might be what do we expect the buyback levels to be incrementalize to? We're not going to give specifics, but I will give a little bit of history. 
If you go back to '17 and '18, our level of buybacks was about $2 billion. I'm not saying history is going to repeat, it will be subject to a bunch of conversations with our team internally and then obviously Board approval, but we'll continue to evaluate. 
So Roger, you want to?"

We're limited by the payout ratios in the CCAR process. But as said, we will return it over time and stay disciplined. So as we think about M&A opportunities on the banking side, not much out there that fits with our digital model. 
You're seeing acquisitions that are branch mergers, cost takeout, which doesn't fit. And then on the payment side, while valuations have come in, they're still really high. And so we lean a bit more towards partnerships, potentially smaller minority investments. So again, I think you can expect no change to our disciplined approach around returning capital to our shareholders."

So specific to rates, so if rates begin to increase, there's indications that a number of different things that are happening in the economy. So you would expect inflation to be increasing, a very, very low level of unemployment, probably near full employment for the economy and a robustness that might rival kind of the prepandemic levels on a sustained basis. 
And so you have to believe that there are a lot of different things that are going to happen. And as I said, also we'll take some actions to control inflation. 
Now we've seen this over a number of years now that the Fed and overall interest rate environment has been on a sustained basis very, very low. As we look forward to 2021 and 2022, my expectation is rates will remain low, and we'll enjoy the benefits of an economy that's continuing to grow. 
Beyond that, it gets different -- more difficult to call. In terms of total return levels, it will depend on a number of factors, rate is just one of those. Credit, obviously, would be an important item.

So in terms of the credit expansion, it's probably more heavily impacting new accounts, but also encompasses sort of our line increase and other criteria on the portfolio side as well. In terms of where I expect, I would say in all times, we give cards to consumers who are in good shape. 
But we do have particularly strong appeal to millennials and students, our secured card is performing well in the marketplace. But then also the traditional prime revolver segment that Discover has always targeted. 
It's a very competitive business. It always has been. So it's about differentiation. And there, a superior customer experience, a great rewards program, focus on value, those traditional things are what allow us to continue gaining share and booking new accounts."

So what you can expect here, and I'm trying to provide as much detail as I can, is that outside of the marketing investments we talked about, some investments in data and analytics, we're looking to keep all other costs back.

As we look forward, the absolute reserve level or reserve rate will depend on what we see in the macros, how the portfolio is performing and what we do in terms of account growth, loan balance. 
But overall, as we think about where the provision levels could be, I would use the day 1 CECL rate as a decent proxy. And subject to how the portfolio is performing, it could migrate up or down from there. 
What we did last year in the first quarter and the second quarter was react to an incredibly dynamic and changing macro environment. And we prudently put up an incremental $2 billion. So if the portfolio performs over time, we could get back to that CECL day 1 and perhaps a little bit lower with excellent portfolio management. Now timing, I'm not going to be specific at."

Last April, if you told me to the year into the pandemic we'd be reporting excellent credit performance, positive sales trends and solid earnings growth, I wouldn't have believed it. Wh",773,"Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. Last April, if you told me to the year into the pandemic we'd be reporting excellent credit performance, positive sales trends and solid earnings growth, I wouldn't have believed it. 
While the pandemic is far from over and there may be twists and turns ahead, as a nation, we have made tremendous progress toward addressing the health crisis and reopening the economy. 
This quarter, we earned $1.6 billion after tax or $5.04 per share. I'm very pleased with these results, which reflect our robust business model; strong execution, including a disciplined approach to managing credit; improving economic trends; and the impact of federal support for U.S. consumers. 
Since the end of 2020, our view on economic conditions has improved. The rapid pace of the recovery has lessened our concern of job losses spreading to the white collar workforce, and there has also been substantial support for the U.S. consumer through stimulus in January and in March. 
Our current expectation is that credit losses in 2021 will be flat to down year-over-year. This improved economic view, combined with lower loan balances and continued strong credit performance, were the primary drivers of $879 million reserve release in the quarter. 
As discussed in previous quarters, the strong credit performance was accompanied by elevated payment rates that continue to put pressure on loan balances, which were down 7% year-over-year. 
Payment rates were over 350 basis points higher than last year and at their highest level since the year 2000. While the impact from stimulus payments should abate over the next few months, we expect payment rates will remain elevated for the rest of the year as households use savings to meet debt obligations and continue to benefit from payment relief programs, such as federal student loan and mortgage payment forbearance. 
Despite this pressure, we still expect modest loan growth this year, supported by several factors. First, there has been a significant increase in sales volume, up 11% from a year ago and up 15% from the first quarter of 2019. 
Improving trends in categories like retail and restaurants are positive signs for future growth. Additionally, based on our credit performance and our current outlook for macro conditions, we have begun to migrate our credit standards back to pre-pandemic levels. 
This is particularly true in card, where our value proposition centered on best-in-class customer service, valuable rewards and no fees continues to resonate strongly among consumers. We're also expanding credit standards and personal loans, but not quite back to 2019 norms. 
To offset the higher payment rate as well as leverage these credit actions, we intend to increase our marketing spending through the rest of this year. Outside of marketing, we expect that expenses will be relatively flat year-over-year as we remain committed to expense management. 
We're reinvesting some of the benefits from our strong credit performance and efficiency gains into technology and analytics to further improve our account acquisition, targeting, fraud detection and collections capabilities. 
The rapid pace of the economic recovery and strong credit performance may provide additional opportunities to lean further into growth. We intend to take advantage of these opportunities and may make additional marketing and nonmarketing investments that will create long-term value. 
On the payment side, we have continued strong performance in our PULSE business, with volumes up 23%, driven by stimulus payments in the first quarter and higher average spend per transaction. 
We also continue to expand our global acceptance through network partnerships, and this quarter, we signed new partners in Jordan and Malaysia. 
Our digital banking model generates high returns, and we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. This quarter, we restarted our share repurchase program with $119 million in buybacks, in line with the regulatory restrictions still in place. 
Looking at our strong credit performance and robust earnings, we see an opportunity to revisit our capital return to shareholders in the second half of the year. As I look towards the future, I'm excited about Discover's prospects. 
Our products continue to bring value to our customers. We remain flexible as we support our employees and their families through the pandemic, and we are well positioned to continue driving long-term value for our shareholders. 
Before I turn it over to John, one last thing, you may not know it, but our CLO, Wanji Walcott, sits in on these calls and is a great part of the team. Today, it's her birthday, so I want to wish Wanji a very happy birthday. With that, I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail."

I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on Slide 4. As Roger indicated, the results this period reflects many of the same dynamics we've seen over the past few quarters. 
The influence of stimulus resulted in elevated payment rates, which pressured loan growth. It also contributed to the strong asset quality and our significant reserve release in the quarter. 
Revenue, net of interest expense, decreased 3% from the prior year, mainly from lower net interest income. This was driven by a 7% decline in average receivables and lower market rates, partially offset by a reduction in funding costs as we continued to manage deposit pricing and optimized our funding mix. 
Noninterest income was 5% lower, primarily due to a $35 million net gain from the sale of an equity investment in the prior year. Consistent with our excellent credit quality, lower loan fee income reflects a decline in late fees, while net discount and interchange revenue was up 12% from the prior year, reflecting the increased sales volume. 
The provision for credit losses was $2 billion lower than the prior year, mainly due to an $879 million reserve release in the current quarter compared to a $1.1 billion reserve build in the prior year. 
Our improved economic outlook, lower loan balances and strong credit drove the release. Additionally, net charge-offs decreased 30% or $232 million in the prior year. Operating expenses decreased 7% year-over-year as we remain disciplined on expense management. 
Other than compensation, all other expenses were down from the prior year, led by marketing, which decreased 33% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we intend to accelerate marketing investments over the remainder of the year. We'll go into details on our spending outlook in a few moments. 
Moving to loan growth on Slide 5. Total loans were down 7% from the prior year, driven by a 9% decrease in card receivables. The reduction in card receivables was driven by 2 primary factors: first, the payment rate remained elevated, driven by the latest round of stimulus and improved household cash flows; second, promotional balances have continued digit decline, reflecting the actions we took at the onset of the pandemic to tighten credit. 
As a result, these balances were approximately 300 basis points lower than the prior year, although we expect new account growth will cause promotional balances to begin to stabilize. As the economy reopens further, we believe consumer spending and prudent expansion of our credit box should drive profitable loan growth going forward. 
Looking at our other lending products. Organic student loans increased 5% from the prior year and originations returned to prepandemic levels. We continued to gain market share through the mini peak season. 
Personal loans were down 9%, primarily due to actions which are early in the pandemic to minimize credit losses. As we've previously mentioned, we see opportunity to expand credit a bit given the strong performance of this portfolio. 
Moving to Slide 6. The net interest margin was 10.75%, up 54 basis points from the prior year and 12 basis points sequentially. Compared to the prior quarter, the improvement in net interest margin was driven by lower deposit pricing as we cut our online savings rates from 50 to 40 basis points during the quarter. 
We also continued to benefit from the maturity of higher rate CDs and a favorable shift in funding mix. Our funding from consumer deposits is now at 65%. 
Future deposit pricing actions will be dependent upon our funding needs and competitive pricing. Average consumer deposits were up 14% year-over-year and flat to the prior quarter. 
Consumer CDs were down 7% from the prior quarter, while savings and money markets increased 4%. Loan yield was flat to the prior year, seasonal revolve rate favorability and a lower mix of promotional rate balances were offset by the impact of reduced pricing on personal loans. 
Looking at Slide 7. Total noninterest income was $465 million, down $25 million or 5% year-over-year, driven by the onetime gain in the prior year that I previously mentioned. 
Excluding this, noninterest income was up 2%. Net discount and interchange revenue increased 12% as revenue from higher sales volume was partially offset by higher rewards costs. 
The decrease in loan fee income was driven by lower late fees, which move in line with delinquency trends. 
Looking at Slide 8. Total operating expenses are down $78 million or 7% from the prior year. Marketing and business development decreased $77 million or 33% year-over-year. The reduction reflects actions we implemented in March of last year to align marketing spend with tightened credit criteria. 
However, we accelerated our marketing spend late in the first quarter and plan to continue this through the year. These investments will drive new account acquisition and loan growth. 
The year-over-year decrease in other expenses was mainly driven by lower fraud volume due to enhanced analytics around disputed transactions and decreased fraud in deposits. 
This improvement demonstrates a small part of the benefit we expect from the investments we've made in analytics over the past few years. Partially offsetting the favorability was a $39 million increase in employment compensation that was driven by 2 factors: $22 million from a higher bonus accrual in the current year. The remaining increase was driven by higher average salaries reflecting the talent build in our technology and analytics team. 
Moving to Slide 9. We had another strong quarter of very strong credit performance. The total charge-offs were 2.5%, down 79 basis points year-over-year and up 10 basis points sequentially. The card net charge-off rate was 2.8%, 85 basis points lower than the prior year, with the net charge-off dollars down $209 million or 31%. 
Sequentially, the card net charge-off rate increased 17 basis points and net charge-off dollars were up $11 million. The increase in card net charge-offs from the prior quarter was driven by accounts that had been in Skip-a-Pay and did not gear. The program ended 6 months ago. And at this time, most of the accounts that were in Skip-a-Pay have returned to making payments. 
Looking forward, we expect minimal impact to charge-offs from this population. The card 30-plus delinquency rate was 1.85%, down 77 basis points from the prior year and 22 basis points lower sequentially. With the influence of the Skip-a-Pay group now largely complete, we think that delinquencies are the most clear indicator of our loss trajectory over the short term. 
Credit remained strong in private student loans. Net charge-offs were down 15 basis points year-over-year and 18 basis points compared to the prior quarter. The 30-plus delinquency rate improved 55 basis points from the prior year and 19 basis points sequentially. 
In personal loans, net charge-offs were down 79 basis points year-over-year with a 30-plus delinquency rate down 47 basis points from the prior year and 24 basis points from the prior quarter. 
The positive impact of additional stimulus, combined with an improved economic outlook, have shifted our expectation on the timing of losses. We had previously expected losses would increase in the second half of this year and remain elevated into 2022. That is no longer the case. 
Based on our current delinquency trends, we believe losses are likely to be flat to down this year with the possibility of some increase in 2022. That said, a material shift in the economic environment could alter the timing and magnitude of losses. 
Moving to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. This quarter, we released $879 million from the allowance. This reflected several factors including favorable changes to our macro assumptions, a moderate decrease in our loan balance, the continued decline in delinquencies and lower losses. 
Relative to our view in January, the economic outlook has continued to improve. As we've done in prior quarters, we've modeled several different scenarios and took a conservative but more optimistic view. 
Our assumptions on unemployment were a year-end 2021 rate of 6%. With a return to full employment in late 2023, we assumed GDP growth of about 4.6%. Our reserve assumptions did not contemplate any additional stimulus directed to consumers, but did anticipate broader economic benefits from infrastructure spending beginning in the second half of this year. 
The modest increase in reserves in our student loan portfolio was driven by loan growth coming out of the mini-peak season. 
Looking at Slide 11. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased 180 basis points sequentially to 14.9%, well above our internal target of 10.5%. We have continued to fund our quarterly dividend at $0.44 per share and repurchased $119 million of common stock during the quarter. 
Our Board of Directors previously authorized up to $1.1 billion of repurchases. We will likely accelerate our share repurchases in the second quarter, and we see the potential for capital returns to increase in the second half of the year. 
As I mentioned earlier, we continued to optimize our funding mix and consumer deposits now make up 65% of total funding. Our goal remains to have 70%, 80% of our funding from deposits, which we feel is achievable, though we expect some quarter-to-quarter variability in this figure. 
Moving to Slide 12. Our perspectives on 2021 have evolved from last quarter. We continue to anticipate modest positive loan growth for the year. We are investing in new account acquisition and have already seen strong sales growth through the first quarter. High payment rates will continue to pressure loan growth in near term, but should become less of a headwind over the course of the year. Versus the first quarter level, we expect our NIM to remain in a relatively narrow range over the rest of the year. 
While we'll continue to benefit from improved funding cost and mix, we may experience modest yield pressure over the next few quarters from variability in the revolve rate. 
Our commitment to expense management has not changed, but as Roger mentioned, we believe there is an opportunity to drive long-term growth through increased marketing and further investments in data and analytics. 
Excluding marketing, expenses should be near flat from the prior year. Credit performance has remained stronger than originally anticipated, and we now expect credit losses to be flat to down compared to 2020. 
Lastly, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividend and buybacks. Given the level of reserve release and the strength of our fundamental performance, we plan to revisit our capital plan -- capital return levels for the second half of this year. 
In summary, we're pleased with our first quarter results. Our sales trend, credit expansion and marketing investments position us well for growth going forward. We released $879 million of reserves; NIM continued to improve, driven by lower funding costs; and expenses were down, but we'll invest in marketing analytics that will drive revenue as well as operating and credit cost improvements over the longer term. 
As the economy reopens, I'm positive regarding the opportunities for growth. We have a strong value proposition that resonates with the consumers, and our digital banking model positions us well for strong returns going forward. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Maria, to open the lines for Q&A."

Clearly, one of the biggest differences versus 2019 is the payment rate. And that's partly driven by the cash payments to consumers, the savings rate, but also the relief they get, be it on their federal student loans or other payments they have to make. 
And so that's a real headwind against loan growth. And as I mentioned on the call, it's actually at the highest level since the year 2000. In terms of marketing, we feel very good about the cost per accounts, about the projected returns we'll get on those, have widened our credit box back to the prepandemic. Although as you recall, we have been tightening for a couple of years, and I would say, continue to remain conservative in our overall credit approach. 
So I really think it's a headwind from payment rates that has kept us from being even more enthusiastic about loan growth."

I'll start it, and then I'll turn it over to Roger for the second piece of the question. So really, really strong performance. And the economy has strengthened beyond our expectations, as we said in our prepared remarks. 
So we came into the year somewhat optimistic, but also cautious given the amount of uncertainty. What we're seeing is kind of a broad-based improvement in the economy, our credit fundamentals have been extremely strong. As a result, we made a decision to -- an appropriate decision to release about $900 million of reserve, taking the -- obviously, the CET1 ratio well above our internal target of 10.5%. 
We're looking to come back to that 10.5% point. We're not going to do it overnight. We know the CECL transition is somewhere between 200 and 250 basis points on CET1, but that still leaves ample room for actions in terms of dividends, buybacks and targeted M&A when and if appropriate. 
So specifics around timing getting back to 10.5%, I would broadly say medium term, but we're certainly committed to that target. And we'll do a number of efforts, including revisiting our buyback levels in the second half of this year to get there. 
And the follow-up might be what do we expect the buyback levels to be incrementalized to? We're not going to give specifics, but I will give a little bit of history. 
If you go back to '17 and '18, our level of buybacks was about $2 billion. I'm not saying history is going to repeat, it will be subject to a bunch of conversations with our team internally and then obviously Board approval, but we'll continue to evaluate. 
So Roger, you want to?"

And so I would say would not let extra money burn a hole in our pocket. For those of you who've been with us for longer, you'll recall, we had significant excess capital post the financial crisis. 
We're limited by the payout ratios in the CCAR process. But as said, we will return it over time and stay disciplined. So as we think about M&A opportunities on the banking side, not much out there that fits with our digital model. 
You're seeing acquisitions that are branch mergers, cost takeout, which doesn't fit. And then on the payment side, while valuations have come in, they're still really high. And so we lean a bit more towards partnerships, potentially smaller minority investments. So again, I think you can expect no change to our disciplined approach around returning capital to our shareholders."

So specific to rates, so if rates begin to increase, there's indications that a number of different things that are happening in the economy. So you would expect inflation to be increasing, a very, very low level of unemployment, probably near full employment for the economy and a robustness that might rival kind of the prepandemic levels on a sustained basis. 
And so you have to believe that there are a lot of different things that are going to happen. And as I said, also we'll take some actions to control inflation. 
Now we've seen this over a number of years now that the Fed and overall interest rate environment has been on a sustained basis very, very low. As we look forward to 2021 and 2022, my expectation is rates will remain low, and we'll enjoy the benefits of an economy that's continuing to grow. 
Beyond that, it gets different -- more difficult to call. In terms of total return levels, it will depend on a number of factors, rate is just one of those. Credit, obviously, would be an important item. But certainly, longer term, we think that we're in a position to drive high returns for our shareholders, consistent with what we've done historically, and our hope is when we come back to that 10.5% target that, that will further enhance overall returns."

But overall, as we think about where the provision levels could be, I would use the Day 1 CECL rate as a decent proxy. And subject to how the portfolio is performing, it could migrate up or down from there. 
What we did last year in the first quarter and the second quarter was react to an incredibly dynamic and changing macro environment. And we prudently put up an incremental $2 billion.

I know that had trended very well last year, and that's an area you'd be making investments in. 
And then maybe I'll just ask my -- the related question I had on that. Last year, Discover's no annual fee, no cashback card was just really well suited for the backdrop. As we reopen and maybe travel rewards become more relevant for consumers, are you seeing any impact on your usage? Any early indicators from consumers who would maybe move your card to top of wallet last year and what you're seeing? So just, I guess, competitive intensity more broadly?"

And we think the lesson learned in the pandemic of the utility of cash awards, hopefully, will last. And then we feel very good about even the newer redemption offers we've added. 
So the ability to redeem at point-of-sale, with PayPal, with Amazon, we've just announced the ability to redeem for carbon offsets, which we think will be popular with millennials. So no real change to that. 
In terms of competitive intensity, we talked about it. They're just extraordinarily attractive cost per account last year as there was a significant pullback. I think we're now moving towards more normalized levels of competition. 
And my guess is, we'll see that increase. But our job is to grow the business in face of the competition that's there. And so while I missed the CPAs from last year, we feel good about the returns we'll generate from our marketing even in a more intense environment."

The portfolio performance itself is also obviously a key input. And we have a team of technical modelers that have run various scenarios, regression sort of scenarios to help make a determination on what overall life of loan losses could be, which is a key input. Because there's probably 12 to 15 different variables that go into that model that help do the projection.  
And then the other piece is your loan balance, right? And what you have on the balance sheet as of the measurement date in order to set reserves. So I would say all of those factors are important. And then finally, one other one is the recovery rate, which actually also does go into the model. So 4 important factors.

We had a very good quarter that highlighted the strength of our digital business model and solid execution on our strategic priorities against the backdrop of continued economic improveme",912,"Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. We had a very good quarter that highlighted the strength of our digital business model and solid execution on our strategic priorities against the backdrop of continued economic improvement. This quarter was characterized by 3 important events. First, our card receivables grew sequentially in May and June, causing our period-end receivables to be up quarter-over-quarter. This outcome, combined with the strength in consumer spending and our account acquisition, increased our confidence for moderate receivables growth this year and stronger growth in 2022. 
Second, we benefited from a gain in our Payment Services segment. This gain is an outgrowth of a long commercial relationship and underscores our payments ability to forge innovative and lasting partnerships. Lastly, we achieved a historic low in delinquencies, which resulted from consumers' strong liquidity position, our conservative stance on underwriting, and the proactive measures we took into the downturn to protect our credit quality. This outcome also supported our reserve release this quarter. 
Turning to the quarter's results. We earned $1.7 billion after tax or $5.55 per share. These results include a $729 million onetime gain. But even excluding this gain, our results were very strong at $3.73 per share. The drivers of the quarter's strong results reflect the combination of our solid execution and supportive macro conditions. Total sales were up 48% from a year ago, and 24% from the second quarter of 2019. 
Retail sales remained very strong, and there was significant improvement in T&E categories, which were hardest hit by the pandemic. Even travel returned to growth in June compared to [indiscernible]. And sales volumes are accelerating. The 24% growth I cited is an increase from 15% in the first quarter relative to the same period in 2019. 
We also see an attractive environment for account acquisition even in the face of heightened competition. We have removed nearly all of our pandemic credit tightening and have increased our marketing investment to align with these actions. These decisions supported new account growth of 26% over 2019 levels with strong growth among prime consumers as our differentiated brand and integrated networks support our strong value proposition, which centers on transparent and useful rewards, outstanding customer service and no annual fees. 
While the current operating environment is broadly constructive, there are also some challenges. As we have highlighted before, the counterpoint of sustained strong credit performance is high payment rates, which in the second quarter were over 500 basis points above 2019 levels. We may be seeing evidence that payment rates are plateauing, and while we expect some moderation later this year, we believe payment rates will remain above historical levels for some time. Even so, we expect to strengthen our sales figures and the contribution from new accounts to drive loan growth through the back half of this year and accelerate in 2022. 
As we have said in the past, we will invest when we see attractive opportunities and the actions we took this quarter with increased marketing expenses and investments in technology and analytics were an example of that approach. These investments are consistent with our commitment to long-term positive operating leverage and an improving efficiency ratio as they drive loan growth and enable a more efficient operating platform. 
In our Payments business, we benefited from a gain on our equity investment in Marqeta. This gain was the result of a relationship that began a decade ago, and we continue to see opportunities and innovative partnerships. I'm very excited about our investment in CECL that we [indiscernible] week, as we look to expand our partnership with a leading buy now, pay later provider. 
We also continue to grow our global acceptance presence and announced new partnerships in [ Baffin ] and Portugal, adding to the 2 network alliances that we announced earlier this year. Our Debit business continued to build on its recent strength. PULSE volume increased 19% year-over-year and was up 33% from 2019 levels. In addition to the influence of economic recovery, this performance reflects the greater relevance of debit to many consumers through the pandemic period. 
Volume at Diners has also recovered to some extent and was up 41% from the prior year's lows. However, volume is still below pre-pandemic levels and may remain so for a period of time. The strong fundamental performance of our digital banking model drove significant capital generation, which this quarter was also aided by our equity gain. We accelerated our share repurchases to $553 million of common stock, a level near the maximum permitted under the Federal Reserve's 4-quarter rolling net income test. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. And going forward, our approach will be governed by the stress capital buffer framework. 
On our call last quarter, we indicated that we hope to revisit our capital return for the second half of this year. And I'm very pleased that our Board of Directors authorized the new $2.4 billion share repurchase program that expires next March. We also increased our quarterly dividend from $0.44 to $0.50 per share. With the current strength of the U.S. economy, I'm increasingly optimistic about our growth opportunities this year and beyond. Our value proposition continues to resonate with consumers. Our Payment segment is expanding its partnerships and acceptance and our capital generative model positions us for strong returns over the long term. 
I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail."

Net interest income was up 5% as we continue to benefit from lower funding costs and reduced interest charge-offs, reflecting strong credit performance. This was partially offset by a 4% decline in average receivables from the prior year levels. 
Excluding onetime items, noninterest income increased 29%, driven by the higher -- by higher net debt count and interchange revenue due to strong sales volume. The provision for credit losses decreased $2 billion from the prior year, mainly due to a $321 million reserve release in the current quarter compared to a $1.3 billion reserve build in the prior year, an improvement in the economic [indiscernible] and ongoing credit strength were the primary drivers of the release. 
Net charge-offs decreased 41% or $311 million from the prior year. Operating expenses were up 13%, primarily reflecting additional investments in marketing, which was up 36% and high employee compensation, which was up 10%, a software write-off and a nonrecurring impairment at Diners Club also contributed to the increase. I'll provide more details on expense drivers and outlook later in the presentation. 
Moving to loan growth on Slide 5. The ending loans increased 2% sequentially and were down just 1% from the prior year. This was driven by card loans, which increased 2% from the prior quarter and were down 2% year-over-year. Lower year-over-year card receivables reflect 2 primary factors. First, the payment rate remains high as households continue to have a strong cash flow position due to several rounds of government stimulus. Second, promotional balances were approximately 250 basis points lower than the prior year quarter. 
While card receivables declined year-over-year, we considered a sequential increase to be an important data point reflecting continued momentum in account acquisition and very strong sales volume. The high payment rate remains a headwind to receivable growth, although we expect to see modest decreases in late 2021. 
Looking at our other lending products. Organic student loans increased 4% from the prior year. We are well positioned as we enter the peak origination season. Personal loans were down 6%, driven by credit tightening last year and high payment rates. We are encouraged by continued strong credit performance in the portfolio and have expanded credit for new originations.
Moving to Slide 6. Net interest margin was 10.68%, up 87 basis points from the prior year and down 7 basis points sequentially. Compared to the prior quarter, the net interest margin decrease was mainly driven by a nearly 200 basis points reduction in the car revolve rate. Loan yields decreased 17 basis points from the prior quarter, mainly due to the lower revolve rate. This decline reflects the impact of increased payments as well as seasonal trends. 
Yield on personal loans declined 7 basis points sequentially due to lower pricing. Student loan yield was up 4 basis points. Margin benefited from lower funding costs, primarily driven by maturities at higher rate CDs. We cut our online savings rate to 40 basis points in the first quarter and did not make any pricing adjustments during the second quarter. Average consumer deposits were up 6% year-over-year and declined 1% from the prior quarter. The entire sequential decline was from consumer CDs, which were down 9%, while savings and money market deposits increased 2% from the prior quarter. Consumer deposits are now 66% of total funding, up from 65% in the prior period. 
Looking at Slide 7. Excluding the equity investment gains, total noninterest income was up $123 million or 29% year-over-year. Net discount and interchange revenue increased $102 million or 43% as revenue from strong sales volume was partially offset by higher rewards costs. Loan fee income increased $20 million or 24%, mainly driven by higher cash advance fees with demand increasing as the economy reopens. 
Looking at Slide 8. Total operating expenses were up $145 million or 13% from the prior year. Employee compensation increased [ $36 ] million, primarily due to a higher bonus accrual in the current [indiscernible] versus 2020 when we reduced the accrual. Excluding this item, employee compensation was down from the prior year as we've managed headcount across the organization. Marketing expense increased $46 million from the prior year as we accelerated our growth investments. We still see significant opportunities for growth, and we plan to accelerate our marketing spend through the year to drive account acquisition and brand awareness. Information processing was up due to a $32 million software write-off. The increase in other expense reflects a $92 million charge on the remainder of the Diners intangible asset. Partially offsetting this was lower fraud expense, reflecting some of the benefits from our investments in data analytics.
Moving to Slide 9. We had another quarter of improved credit performance. Total net charge-offs were 2.1%, down 132 basis points year-over-year and 36 basis points sequentially. The net charge-off rate was 2.45%, 145 basis points lower than the prior year quarter and down 35 basis points sequentially. The net charge-off dollars were down $276 million versus last year's second quarter and $62 million sequentially. The card 30-plus delinquency rate was 1.43%, down 74 basis points from the prior year and 42 basis points [indiscernible] lower sequentially. Credit in our private student loans and personal loans also remained very strong through the quarter. 
Moving to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. This quarter, we released $321 million from the reserves due to 3 key factors: continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment, sustained strong credit performance with improving delinquency trends and lower losses. These were partially offset by a 2% sequential increase in loans. 
Our current economic assumptions include an unemployment rate of approximately 5.5% by year-end and GDP growth of 7%. Embedded within these assumptions are the expanded [ child care ] tax credits and the benefit from the infrastructure physical package beginning in late 2021. 
Looking at Slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 80 basis points sequentially to 15.7%, a level well above our internal target of 10.5%. As Roger noted, we are committed to returning capital. The recent Board approval increasing our buyback and dividend payouts reflect that. On funding, we continue to make progress towards our goal of having deposits in the 70% to 80% of our mix. 
Moving to Slide 12. Our perspective on 2021 continue to evolve as we see additional opportunities to drive profitable growth. We have increasing confidence in our outlook for modest loan growth in 2021 as strong sales and our new account growth should offset the higher payment rates. We expect NIM will remain in a relatively narrow range compared to the first quarter levels of 75%, with some quarterly variability similar to what we experienced this quarter. 
We anticipate a slight benefit from higher coupon deposit maturities and an optimized funding mix with yields affected by variability in the revolve rate. Our commitment to disciplined expense management has not changed, and we remain focused on generating positive operating leverage and an improving efficiency ratio. For this year, we now expect nonmarketing expenses to be up slightly over the prior year, reflecting the higher compensation accruals and recovery fees. The increase in the use expense categories is closely tied to the economic recovery. For example, the high level of consumer liquidity is supporting elevated recoveries. These recoveries have some costs associated with them, but are more than offset by lower credit losses. 
Regarding marketing expenses, we expect this will step up more significantly in the second half of 2021 as we further deploy resources into account acquisition and brand marketing. With the continued improvement in credit performance, our current expectation is that credit losses will be down this year compared to 2020. Naturally, a material change in the economic environment could shift the timing and magnitude of losses. Lastly, as evidenced by our dividend increase and new share repurchase authorization, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. 
In summary, we had another very strong quarter. We are well positioned for a positive top line trajectory given our sales trends and new account growth. Credit remains extraordinarily strong, and the economic outlook continues to improve. We maintained our discipline on operating expenses while investing [indiscernible] returning organic growth opportunities. And finally, we continue to deliver high returns, allowing for enhanced buybacks and dividends. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator to open the line for Q&A."

So if you looked at our trust data, you can see that in June, they came in at about 29%, and that's -- frankly, that's an all-time high, at least as far as back as 2005. So what we're seeing when we look at the portfolio -- or not the portfolio, the trends are similar, but the overall payment rates a bit lower. What we're seeing is a couple of factors. So one is a deceleration of the growth in payment rate. And second, we formed our expectation on the second half of the year based on all of the government programs that are out there and most -- the most significant ones are expiring or have expired by the end of the third quarter. 
So we expect that, coupled with the strong economic activity and lower savings rate that we're observing, to result in a moderate decrease in the payment rate certainly in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, it could be flat to maybe even up a mild bit. But overall, our sense is that we've approached the peak of this, and it's going to begin to tail off."

So the Marqeta gain was something that when we looked at the plan for the year, we didn't, frankly, envision that, that opportunity would turn out quite the way it did. So certainly a nice outcome. The spend that we're seeing isn't dictated based on that size of the Marqeta gain, but more about the broad economic opportunity that we're seeing right now to be able to drive positive growth. So frankly, we'll be spending at this level with or without the Marqueta gain. 
The kind of the lock-up, those points are disclosed in the S-1, so you can reference that and get real specificity on it. And then finally, in terms of the expenses and are they onetime in nature. So within the presentation itself, we highlighted kind of 3 items that were significant. So one was the bonus accrual unrelated to Marqeta again and more broadly a reflection of what's happening in the business and the outcomes we're seeing here in terms of generating positive returns. The other item there was the [indiscernible] intangible, which we took the opportunity based on what we see as a change in the cash flows in Diners to fully impair that and took a $92 million write-off. And then the third item was a $30 million software write-off. 
So all those are part of our normal, I'll say, hygiene factors. So the last 2 items were what I would consider relatively one-off, and I wouldn't include those in the kind of operating cash flows going forward. But as you're trying to get a sense for overall spend in 2021, we talked about accelerating marketing expense. So the way I would think about marketing specifically is that we anticipate it to return to 2019 levels, which would indicate a material acceleration in the second half of the year, which, again, is time tied to the fact that we're seeing good origination opportunities to drive growth and long-term profitability."

The planning in terms of capital overall is that we are committed to add 10.5%. As we look at the impacts of the CECL capital relief transition, that's about 200 basis points. And then in the first quarter of next year towards the end of this year as we review the outlook for 2022 with our Board, we'll make recommendations with a couple of points in mind. The overall economic opportunity, the SEB and where we are with that, and there's plenty of room there. And then finally approaching the 10.5."

So when we approach this quarter, certainly, the economic data was improving. The portfolio is performing extremely well. And the charge-off trajectory, we revised our guidance and now believe it will be below the prior year. So all of those are very, very positive from a reserving standpoint. We did put a bit of caution in the kind of reserve numbers as a result of the various government programs that are out there. So if you think about the eviction moratoriums, foreclosure moratoriums, various payment deferral programs and then the massive amount of government transfer payments that hit the economy, we felt like that those contributed to driving delinquencies and charge-offs below historical norms for our customer base. 
So under CECL, we reserve for life of loan. And accordingly, we were waiting for those programs to run their course and the cash flows to kind of feed through the economy and impact our customers. And then be able to make, call it, a deeper change to the reserve levels. So as I said earlier, most of those programs ran their course in the third quarter. We obviously have the child care tax -- there's a child tax credit. We don't expect that to be an impact. 
So in the fourth quarter, we should begin to see more data that would allow us to take a different look at reserves and then into 2022, certainly. Our expectation is that the credit environment is very positive from a growth standpoint and accordingly, we'll make reserves that kind of align with that."

So certainly, if you look at, frankly, the projected GDP, that's above normal levels for a strong U.S. economy, and that's as a result of, frankly, all of the activity and the transfer payments I talked about earlier. I think there's a natural, I'll say, transition from where we are today to something that approaches historical norms. The savings rate is still high, but it's falling. And so that's positive. And in terms of overall sales activity versus payment rates, we do expect the sales levels at some point to moderate partly because of year-over-year comps and partly because of what's happening on economic activity. 
But with that said, I would expect that payment rate, there's a bit of an inverse relationship. And what we're seeing from a growth standpoint is the sales activity, the new account acquisition, the payment rate is a bit of a headwind and then that revolve transactor rate aligning to payment rate.

We had a very good quarter that highlighted the strength of our digital business model and solid execution on our strategic priorities against the backdrop of continued economic improvement. 
This quarter was characterized by 3 important events: First, our card receivables grew sequentially in May and June, causing our period-end receivables to be up quarter-over-quarter. This outcome, combined with the strength in consumer spending and our account acquisition, increased our confidence for moderate receivables growth this year and stronger growth in 2022. 
Second, we benefited from a gain in our Payment Services segment. This gain is an outgrowth of a long commercial relationship and underscores our payments business' ability to forge innovative and lasting partnerships. 
Lastly, we achieved a historic low in delinquencies, which resulted from consumers' strong liquidity position, our conservative stance on underwriting, and the proactive measures we took into the downturn to protect our credit quality. This outcome also supported our reserve release this quarter. 
Turning to the quarter's results. We earned $1.7 billion after tax or $5.55 per share. These results include a $729 million onetime gain. But even excluding this gain, our results were very strong at $3.73 per share. The drivers of the quarter's strong results reflect the combination of our solid execution and supportive macro conditions. 
Total sales were up 48% from a year ago, and 24% from the second quarter of 2019. Retail sales remained very strong, and there was significant improvement in T&E categories, which were hardest hit by the pandemic. Even travel returned to growth in June compared to [indiscernible] levels. And sales volumes are accelerating. The 24% growth I cited is an increase from 15% in the first quarter relative to the same period in 2019. 
We also see an attractive environment for account acquisition even in the face of heightened competition. We have removed nearly all of our pandemic credit tightening and have increased our marketing investment to align with these actions. These decisions supported new account growth of 26% over 2019 levels with strong growth among prime consumers as our differentiated brand and integrated networks support our strong value proposition, which centers on transparent and useful rewards, outstanding customer service and no annual fees. 
While the current operating environment is broadly constructive, there are also some challenges. As we have highlighted before, the counterpoint of sustained strong credit performance is high payment rates, which in the second quarter were over 500 basis points above 2019 levels. We may be seeing evidence that payment rates are plateauing, and while we expect some moderation later this year, we believe payment rates will remain above historical levels for some time. Even so, we expect to strengthen our sales figures and the contribution from new accounts to drive loan growth through the back half of this year and accelerate in 2022. 
As we have said in the past, we will invest when we see attractive opportunities, and the actions we took this quarter with increased marketing expenses and investments in technology and analytics were an example of that approach. These investments are consistent with our commitment to long-term, positive operating leverage and an improving efficiency ratio as they drive loan growth and enable a more efficient operating platform.
In our payments business, we benefited from a gain on our equity investment in Marqeta. This gain was the result of a relationship that began a decade ago, and we continue to see opportunities and innovative partnerships. I'm very excited about our investment in Sezzle that was announced last week, as we look to expand our partnership with the leading buy now, pay later provider. We also continued to grow our global acceptance presence and announced new partnerships in Bahrain and Portugal, adding to the 2 network alliances that we announced earlier this year. 
Our debit business continued to build on its recent strength. PULSE volume increased 19% year-over-year and was up 33% from 2019 levels. In addition to the influence of economic recovery, this performance reflects the greater relevance of debit to many consumers through the pandemic period. Volume at Diners has also recovered to some extent and was up 41% from the prior year's lows. However, volume is still below prepandemic levels and may remain so for a period of time. 
The strong fundamental performance of our digital banking model drove significant capital generation, which this quarter was also aided by our equity gain. We accelerated our share repurchases to $553 million of common stock, a level near the maximum permitted under the Federal Reserve's 4-quarter rolling net income test. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. And going forward, our approach will be governed by the stress capital buffer framework. 
On our call last quarter, we indicated that we hope to revisit our capital return for the second half of this year. And I'm very pleased that our Board of Directors authorized the new $2.4 billion share repurchase program that expires next March. We also increased our quarterly dividend from $0.44 to $0.50 per share. 
With the current strength of the U.S. economy, I'm increasingly optimistic about our growth opportunities this year and beyond. Our value proposition continues to resonate with consumers. Our payment segment is expanding its partnerships and acceptance, and our capital generative model positions us for strong returns over the long term.
I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail."

I'll begin with our summary financial results on Slide 4. As Roger noted, our results this quarter highlighted the strength of our digital model, solid execution on our priorities and continued improvement i",1452,"Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with our summary financial results on Slide 4. 
As Roger noted, our results this quarter highlighted the strength of our digital model, solid execution on our priorities and continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment. Revenue, net of interest expense, increased 34% from the prior year. Excluding onetime items, revenue was up 9%. Net interest income was up 5% as we continue to benefit from lower funding costs and reduced interest charge-offs, reflecting strong credit performance. This was partially offset by a 4% decline in average receivables from the prior year levels.
Excluding onetime items, noninterest income increased 29%, driven by the higher -- by higher net debt count and interchange revenue due to strong sales volume. The provision for credit losses decreased $2 billion from the prior year, mainly due to a $321 million reserve release in the current quarter compared to a $1.3 billion reserve build in the prior year, an improvement in the economic [indiscernible] and ongoing credit strength were the primary drivers of the release. Net charge-offs decreased 41% or $311 million from the prior year. 
Operating expenses were up 13%, primarily reflecting additional investments in marketing, which was up 36%, and high employee compensation, which was up 10%. A software write-off and a nonrecurring impairment at Diners Club also contributed to the increase. I'll provide more details on expense drivers and outlook later in the presentation. 
Moving to loan growth on Slide 5. The ending loans increased 2% sequentially and were down just 1% from the prior year. This was driven by card loans, which increased 2% from the prior quarter and were down 2% year-over-year. Lower year-over-year card receivables reflect 2 primary factors: First, the payment rate remains high as households continue to have a strong cash flow position due to several rounds of government stimulus. Second, promotional balances were approximately 250 basis points lower than the prior year quarter.
While card receivables declined year-over-year, we considered the sequential increase to be an important data point reflecting continued momentum in account acquisition and very strong sales volume. The high payment rate remains a headwind to receivable growth, although we expect to see modest decreases in late 2021.
Looking at our other lending products. Organic student loans increased 4% from the prior year. We are well positioned as we enter the peak origination season. Personal loans were down 6%, driven by credit tightening last year and high payment rates. We are encouraged by continued strong credit performance in the portfolio and have expanded credit for new originations.
Moving to Slide 6. Net interest margin was 10.68%, up 87 basis points from the prior year and down 7 basis points sequentially. Compared to the prior quarter, the net interest margin decrease was mainly driven by a nearly 200 basis points reduction in the card revolve rate. Loan yields decreased 17 basis points from the prior quarter, mainly due to the lower revolve rate. This decline reflects the impact of increased payments as well as seasonal trends. Yield on personal loans declined 7 basis points sequentially due to lower pricing. Student loan yield was up 4 basis points. 
Margin benefited from lower funding costs, primarily driven by maturities at higher rate CDs. We cut our online savings rate to 40 basis points in the first quarter and did not make any pricing adjustments during the second quarter. Average consumer deposits were up 6% year-over-year and declined 1% from the prior quarter. The entire sequential decline was from consumer CDs, which were down 9%, while savings and money market deposits increased 2% from the prior quarter. Consumer deposits are now 66% of total funding, up from 65% in the prior period. 
Looking at Slide 7. Excluding the equity investment gains, total noninterest income was up $123 million or 29% year-over-year. Net discount and interchange revenue increased $102 million or 43%, as revenue from strong sales volume was partially offset by higher rewards costs. Loan fee income increased $20 million or 24%, mainly driven by higher cash advance fees with demand increasing as the economy reopens.
Looking at Slide 8. Total operating expenses were up $145 million or 13% from the prior year. Employee compensation increased $46 million, primarily due to a higher bonus accrual in the current [indiscernible] versus 2020 when we reduce the accrual. Excluding this item, employee compensation was down from the prior year as we've managed headcount across the organization. 
Marketing expense increased $46 million from the prior year as we accelerated our growth investments. We still see significant opportunities for growth, and we plan to accelerate our marketing spend through the year to drive account acquisition and brand awareness. 
Information processing was up due to a $32 million software write-off. The increase in other expense reflects a $92 million charge on the remainder of the Diners intangible asset. Partially offsetting this was lower fraud expense, reflecting some of the benefits from our investments in data analytics.
Moving to Slide 9. We had another quarter of improved credit performance. Total net charge-offs were 2.1%, down 132 basis points year-over-year and 36 basis points sequentially. Net charge-off rate was 2.45%, 145 basis points lower than the prior year quarter and down 35 basis points sequentially. The net charge-off dollars were down $276 million versus last year's second quarter and $62 million sequentially. The card 30-plus (sic) [ 30-day ] delinquency rate was 1.43%, down 74 basis points from the prior year and 42 basis points lower sequentially. Credit in our private student loans and personal loans also remained very strong through the quarter. 
Moving to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. This quarter, we released $321 million from the reserves due to 3 key factors: continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment, sustained strong credit performance, with improving delinquency trends and lower losses. These were partially offset by a 2% sequential increase in loans. 
Our current economic assumptions include an unemployment rate of approximately 5.5% by year-end and GDP growth of 7%. Embedded within these assumptions are the expanded child care tax credits and the benefit from the infrastructure fiscal package beginning in late 2021.
Looking at Slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 80 basis points sequentially to 15.7%, a level well above our internal target of 10.5%. As Roger noted, we are committed to returning capital. The recent Board approval increasing our buyback and dividend payouts reflect that. On funding, we continue to make progress towards our goal of having deposits to be 70% to 80% of our mix.
Moving to Slide 12. Our perspective on 2021 continue to evolve as we see additional opportunities to drive profitable growth. We have increasing confidence in our outlook for modest loan growth in 2021 as strong sales and our new account growth should offset the higher payment rates. We expect NIM will remain in a relatively narrow range compared to the first quarter levels of 75%, with some quarterly variability similar to what we experienced this quarter. We anticipate a slight benefit from higher coupon deposit maturities and an optimized funding mix with yields affected by variability in the revolve rate. 
Our commitment to disciplined expense management has not changed, and we remain focused on generating positive operating leverage and an improving efficiency ratio. For this year, we now expect nonmarketing expenses to be up slightly over the prior year, reflecting the higher compensation accruals and recovery fees. The increase in these expense categories is closely tied to the economic recovery. For example, the high level of consumer liquidity is supporting elevated recoveries. These recoveries have some costs associated with them, but are more than offset by lower credit losses. 
Regarding marketing expenses, we expect this will step up more significantly in the second half of 2021 as we further deploy resources into account acquisition and brand marketing. With the continued improvement in credit performance, our current expectation is that credit losses will be down this year compared to 2020. Naturally, a material change in the economic environment could shift the timing and magnitude of losses. Lastly, as evidenced by our dividend increase and new share repurchase authorization, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. 
In summary, we had another very strong quarter. We are well positioned for a positive top line trajectory given our sales trends and new account growth. Credit remains extraordinarily strong, and the economic outlook continues to improve. We maintained our discipline on operating expenses while investing [indiscernible] returning organic growth opportunities. And finally, we continue to deliver high returns, allowing for enhanced buybacks and dividends. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator to open the line for Q&A."

So if you looked at our trust data, you can see that in June, they came in at about 29%, and that's -- frankly, that's an all-time high, at least as far as back as 2005. So what we're seeing when we look at the portfolio, now the portfolio, the trends are similar, but the overall payment rates a bit lower. 
What we're seeing is a couple of factors. So one is a deceleration of the growth in payment rate. And second, we formed our expectation on the second half of the year based on all of the government programs that are out there. And most -- the most significant ones are expiring or have expired by the end of the third quarter. 
So we expect that, coupled with the strong economic activity and lower savings rate that we're observing, to result in a moderate decrease in the payment rate certainly in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, it could be flat to maybe even up a mild bit. But overall, our sense is that we've approached the peak of this, and it's going to begin to tail off."

So in terms of our buy now, pay later strategy, there are really 2 parts: The Sezzle investment is really being driven by the payment side. And that's similar to the investment we made in Marqeta a while back. Our set of network assets are very useful for many fintechs in terms of just an easier way to process payments and connect to merchants in a wide variety of forms. So I'd say that's the core of what we're doing with Sezzle. 
We also believe that potentially, over time, there may be opportunities on the banking side. So in terms of our providing lending, not necessarily with Sezzle, but in the buy now, pay later space more broadly. And again, leveraging what we can do with unsecured lending and our direct merchant relationships. But I'd say, we haven't announced anything on the lending side of buy now, pay later at this time."

So the Marqeta gain was something that when we looked at the plan for the year, we didn't, frankly, envision that, that opportunity would turn out quite the way it did. So certainly a nice outcome. The spend that we're seeing isn't dictated based on that size of the Marqeta gain, but more about the broad economic opportunity that we're seeing right now to be able to drive positive growth. So frankly, we'd be spending at this level with or without the Marqeta gain. 
The kind of the lock-up, those points are disclosed in the S-1, so you can reference that and get real specificity on it. And then finally, in terms of the expenses and are they onetime in nature. So within the presentation itself, we highlighted kind of 3 items that were significant. So one was the bonus accrual, unrelated to Marqeta again and more broadly a reflection of what's happening in the business and the outcomes we're seeing here in terms of generating positive returns. 
The other item there was the Diners intangible, which we took the opportunity based on what we see as a change in the cash flows in Diners to fully impair that and took a $92 million write-off. And then the third item was a $30 million software write-off. 
So all those are part of our normal, I'll say, hygiene factors. So the last 2 items were what I would consider relatively one-off, and I wouldn't include those in the kind of operating cash flows going forward. But as you're trying to get a sense for overall spend in 2021, we talked about accelerating marketing expense. So the way I would think about marketing specifically is that we anticipate it to return to 2019 levels, which would indicate a material acceleration in the second half of the year, which, again, is tied to the fact that we're seeing good origination opportunities to drive growth and long-term profitability."

So when we approached this quarter, certainly, the economic data was improving. The portfolio is performing extremely well. And the charge-off trajectory, we revised our guidance and now believe it will be below the prior year. So all of those are very, very positive from a reserving standpoint. 
We did put a bit of caution in the kind of reserve numbers as a result of the various government programs that are out there. So if you think about the eviction moratoriums, foreclosure moratoriums, various payment deferral programs and then the massive amount of government transfer payments that hit the economy, we felt like that those contributed to driving delinquencies and charge-offs below historical norms for our customer base. 
So under CECL, we reserve for life of loan. And accordingly, we were waiting for those programs to run their course and the cash flows to kind of feed through the economy and impact our customers, and then be able to make, call it, a deeper change to the reserve levels. So as I said earlier, most of those programs ran their course in the third quarter. We obviously have the child care tax -- or the child tax credit. We don't expect that to be an impact. 
So in the fourth quarter, we should begin to see more data that would allow us to take a different look at reserves and then into 2022, certainly. Our expectation is that the credit environment is very positive from a growth standpoint. And accordingly, we'll make reserves that kind of align with that."

The -- I think there's a natural, I'll say, transition from where we are today to something that approaches historical norms. The savings rate is still high, but it's falling. And so that's positive. And in terms of overall sales activity versus payment rates, we do expect the sales levels at some point to moderate partly because of year-over-year comps and partly because of what's happening on economic activity. 
But with that said, I would expect that payment rate, there's a bit of an inverse relationship. And what we're seeing from a growth standpoint is the sales activity, the new account acquisition, the payment rate as a bit of a headwind and then that revolve transactor rate aligning to payment rate.

We had another period of strong financial results in the third quarter with earnings of $1.1 billion after tax or $3.54 per share. In many respects, these results reflected the unique",532,"Thank you, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. We had another period of strong financial results in the third quarter with earnings of $1.1 billion after tax or $3.54 per share. In many respects, these results reflected the unique benefits of our integrated digital banking and payments model, which continues to be a source of significant competitive advantage by supporting our value proposition to consumers and merchants and differentiating our brand. 
These advantages enabled our continued investment in account acquisition, technology and analytics while generating substantial capital. In an environment characterized by new entrants and intensifying competition, we believe the strengths of our model position us to accelerate our growth. 
Underlying our results this quarter were 3 important advancements. The first was our return to year-over-year receivables growth, which is driven by our investment in acquisition and brand marketing and continued strong sales trends. Total sales were up 27% over 2019 levels with strong momentum across all categories. Even travel sales increased. And while they dropped a bit in August due to concerns related to the Delta variant, travel has steadily improved since then. 
We also continue to see attractive opportunities for account acquisition and increased our marketing investment to take advantage of this. While the competitive environment has intensified, new accounts are now up 17% over 2019, reflecting the strength of our value proposition. This value proposition remains anchored in our industry-leading onshore customer service model, no annual fees and useful in transparent rewards. 
While some of our peers had to reinvigorate their rewards offerings at substantial cost, our rewards costs were up only 6 basis points year-over-year and nearly all of this increase was driven by higher consumer spending as evidenced in our strong discount revenue. Given these dynamics, we will continue investing in new accounts as long as the environment supports profitable opportunities and a robust account growth and our expectations for modest improvement in payment rates supports our view of stronger receivables growth in 2022. 
The second key trend was credit, which remained exceptionally strong. Our disciplined approach to credit management and favorable economic trends contributed to a record low net charge-off rate and continued low delinquencies. The delinquency outlook affirmed our expectations that losses will be below last year's levels for the full year and supported additional reserve releases during the quarter. 
And third is the continued expansion of our payments business. Pulp saw a meaningful increase in debit volume with 9% growth year-over-year and a 26% increase over the third quarter of 2019, demonstrating both the impact of the recovery and an increase in debit use through the pandemic. Our diners business has also started to see some improvement from the global recovery with volume up 12% from the prior year. As the global economy recovers, we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our international reach. 
In summary, our value proposition continues to be attractive, and our integrated digital banking and payments model supports profitable long-term customer relationships and is highly capital generative. I continue to feel very good about our prospects for future growth. I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail."

Once again, our results this quarter reflect strong execution and the continued economic recovery. Looking at our financial summary results on Page 4, there are 3 key things I want to call out. First, our total revenue",1231,"Roger, and good morning, everyone. Once again, our results this quarter reflect strong execution and the continued economic recovery. 
Looking at our financial summary results on Page 4, there are 3 key things I want to call out. First, our total revenue net of interest expense is up 8% from the prior year, excluding a $167 million unrealized loss due to market adjustments on our equity investments. Including this, revenue was up 2% for the quarter. Second is a continuation of very strong credit performance. Net charge-offs were down $343 million from the prior year, which supported a $165 million reserve release this quarter. Lastly, we continue investing for growth with increased marketing spend. Higher operating expenses in other areas were largely related to the economic recovery. I'll go over the details of our quarterly results and our full year outlook on the following slides. 
Looking at loan growth on Slide 5. We saw the return to growth this quarter with ending loans up 1% over the prior year and up 3% sequentially. Card loans were the primary driver and were also up 1% year-over-year and 2% over the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase in card receivables was driven by strong sales volume and robust account acquisitions. 
Sales growth continued to accelerate and was up 27% over the third quarter of 2019. Year-to-date, new accounts were up 27% from the prior year and up 17% over 2019 levels. The contribution from these factors was mostly offset by the ongoing high payment rates as household savings and cash flows remain elevated. The payment rate was approximately 500 basis points over pre-pandemic levels. We anticipate that the payment rate will moderate a bit as most federal COVID support programs have ended and consumer savings rates have started to decrease. That said, we expect payment rates to remain above historical levels through 2022. 
Looking at our other lending products. Organic student loans increased 4% from the prior year with originations up 7% as most schools have returned to the normal in-person learning model. Personal loans decreased 4%, driven by high payment rates. Our underwriting criteria have returned to pre-pandemic levels, and we expect a return to growth in this product in future periods. 
Moving to Slide 6. Net interest margin was 10.8%, up 61 basis points from the prior year and 12 basis points from the prior quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, the increase in net interest margin was primarily driven by lower interest charge-offs and lower funding costs. This was partially offset by a higher mix of promo rate balances. 
Card loan yield was up 1 basis point sequentially as lower interest charge-offs were offset by the increased promotional balance mix. Yield on personal loans declined 15 basis points sequentially due to lower pricing. The margin continued to benefit from lower funding costs, primarily driven by maturities of higher rate CDs and an increased mix of lower rate savings and money market balances. 
Average consumer deposits were flat year-over-year and declined 1% from the prior quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decline was largely driven by consumer CDs. We also saw a slight decline in savings and money market deposits as consumers continue to spend excess levels of liquidity. 
We also continue to optimize our funding stack. Late in September, we executed our first ABS issuance since October 2019, consisting of $1.2 billion security with a 3-year fixed rate coupon of 58 basis points and a 5-year $600 million security with a fixed coupon of 103 basis points. These were our lowest ABS coupons ever and show good execution and timing by our treasury team. 
Looking at revenue on Slide 7. Total noninterest income increased $90 million or 20% over the prior year, excluding the unrealized loss on equity investments. Net discount and interchange revenue was up $61 million or 26%, driven by strong sales volume. This was partially offset by increased rewards costs due to high sales in the 5% category, which was restaurants in PayPal, both this year and last. We continue to benefit from strong sales through our partnership with PayPal and while restaurant sales were up 62% year-over-year as dining activity recovered. Loan fee income was up $21 million or 21%, primarily driven by lower late fee charge-offs and higher nonsufficient funds and cash advance fees. 
Looking at Slide 8. Total operating expenses were up $185 million or 18% from the prior year. The details reflect our focus on investing for future growth while managing our operating costs. Employee compensation increased $12 million, driven by a higher bonus accrual current year. Excluding bonuses, employee compensation was down 3% from the prior year from lower headcount. 
Marketing expense increased $70 million, supporting another quarter of strong new account growth. Other expense included a $50 million legal accrual. Professional fees were up $47 million, primarily due to higher recovery fees. Courts reopening, combined with strong credit and economic conditions, have driven an increase in recoveries and their associated fees. Year-to-date, recoveries were up 20% compared to the prior year. The benefits of these costs is reflected in lower credit losses. 
Moving to Slide 9. The trend of sustained strong credit performance continued. Total net charge-offs were a record low at 1.46%, down 154 basis points year-over-year and 66 basis points sequentially. Total net charge-off dollars decreased $343 million from the prior year and were down $131 million quarter-over-quarter. Credit performance was strong across all products as evidenced by the net charge-off rates on card, private student loans and personal loans. 
Moving to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. This quarter, we released $165 million from the reserves, and our reserve rate dropped 35 basis points to 7.7%. The reserve release reflects continued strong credit performance and a largely stable macroeconomic outlook. The impact of these was partially offset by a 2% increase in loans from the prior quarter. Our economic assumptions include an unemployment rate of approximately 5.5% by year-end and GDP growth of just over 6%. These assumptions were slightly less positive than those used in the second quarter but still reflect a strong economic outlook. 
Looking at Slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 15.5%, well above our 10.5% target. We repurchased $815 million of common stock and, as we had previously announced, increased our dividend payable by 14% to $0.50 per share. These actions reflect our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. On funding, we continue to make progress towards our goals of having deposits to be 70% to 80% of our funding mix. Deposits now make up 68% of total funding, up from 62% in the prior year. 
Wrapping up on Slide 12. Our outlook for 2021 has not changed and reflects continued strong execution against our financial and strategic objectives. In summary, we remain well positioned for profitable growth from improving loan trends. Credit performance trends remained favorable, reflecting positive macroeconomic conditions and our approach to underwriting and credit management. Investments for growth have supported a significant increase in new accounts while we've contained operating expenses. Lastly, our integrated digital banking and payments model is highly capital generative, allowing us to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders. We look forward to providing our outlook for 2022 on our conference call in January. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Ashley, to open the line for Q&A."

But as I look at the data we're seeing here in terms of revolve and the forecasted trends, my expectation is that in the fourth quarter, it will continue to step down. Some of that has to do with government support programs ending in September, and some of it has to do with the holiday season. 
And then as we look on the holiday season into 2022, I do expect that it will continue to step towards a normalized rate. But frankly, I don't think that will happen until 2023. So how do we think about the implications from that? Certainly, the payment rate is a bit of a headwind to growth. But what we've seen is really strong account acquisition and strong sales, which to date has helped offset some of that payment rate impact. So overall, we feel very, very comfortable that the balance of '21 and then '22 will have a bit of tailwind related to both payment rates declining and then strong execution from the new accounts and sales growth."

I think it will be a little bit under that -- a bit under that, largely not because of opportunities, but basically kind of some process-oriented stuff in terms of account targeting. So we feel like the money we'll spend in the fourth quarter will certainly generate positive new account growth. It will tick up from the third quarter certainly and provide us a good trajectory for 2022."

It will vary based on which issuers are refreshing their cards or have more of a desire than growth -- for growth than others. But I think our focus on a clear differentiated value proposition has resulted in continued strong generation of new accounts, and I'm excited about what I see. 
In terms of the new entrants, we see that less in the core credit card space, but I would say very, very aggresive competition around personal loans. And that's an area where we focus on the long term, remain disciplined in our underwriting and what we're willing to invest in new accounts and are used to seeing competitors come and go."

So you think about when Apple launched their wallet -- even PayPal, the vast majority of their volume is processed to existing payment networks. And debit processing is incredibly complex and, quite frankly, very low margin and very efficient as you look at how sort of the 3 major debit networks, us, Mastercard and Visa operate. 
And right now, given the interchange caps that a lot of banks have, the economics for them are relatively thin. So while we look at what the Fed might be proposing, what goes on in other markets, I don't see anything in the near or even medium term. It looks like it has the potential.

Part of your marketing spend coming in lower than expected or at least lower than consensus than we expected is a function of you doing something. I don't know if it's cloud or technology or what to get more efficient at account targeting and account acquisition. 
So on the one hand, you've got that running in a very positive direction. You talked about the payment rates being a little bit of a headwind to monetizing that, but at the same time, we've got credit normalizing. So is there an opportunity for you to pull levers on marketing to generate some more loan growth? Or is it more likely to come from the personal loan side or student loan side?

So the persistently high payment rate, I think, has driven sales activity across the industry. Now we benefited, I would say, slightly disproportionately in terms of driving incremental sales, partly due to the acquisition point you mentioned. So there's 2 dynamics. 
The third dynamic is credit normalizing. And my sense is that credit normalization will continue through '22 into '23. So today, where I said I'm positive on credit. So those factors in the aggregate, in addition to the point you mentioned in terms of account targeting, I think position us pretty well in '22 for positive loan growth. Not the specifics will come a little bit later in January when we give our view, but we're all positive on that front today."

So those segments all have different characteristics. 
Certainly, at the lower end, there are many customers who are either debit preferring or do not have access to significant amounts of credit. But I think you'll continue to see it evolve. You're starting to see some pressure from merchants who are unwilling to pay take rates above what they pay in card. So right now, we certainly see opportunity on the payment side, as I talked about earlier, leveraging our assets.

I think certainly, American Express will stay focused on that spend-based model. A lot of banks focus on those transactors because they are very profitable customers not so much in card, but in other segments of the business. The prime revolver space has historically been the most challenging in terms of what it requires from a value proposition and underwriting. For transactors, it's really about rolling out a risk rewards program. So we expect to see competition across the spectrum. But what impacts us most will be that in the prime revolver space."

We provide that detail because it's, frankly, the most transparent that people can take a look at to get deal with how we're thinking about the reserves. 
Now the other items that are important in terms of our thinking here in the third quarter was, first, the portfolio performance, and it's been super strong. Second was the ending of many of the government support programs related to COVID. So most of those ended in August and September. What we'd like to do is see some seasoning of the impacts of those into the fourth quarter and perhaps even in the first quarter next year. 
If what we expect is that the impact of that season will be very, very mild on the portfolio and the broad macros continue to look favorable, there's enough kind of points of reference that would lead us to begin to step the reserves back to day 1. But a lot of things need to happen. And we ended up where we were in the third quarter. We ran through multiple models, multiple scenarios. And we got comfortable with where we were to make sure the balance sheet was fairly stated. But we do see that the broad macros out into the future are positive.

So you get to kind of personal loans subject to the economic environment.

In terms of the personal loan space, it is very hard to get line of sight into the practices of these companies and there are many of them. We've seen them come and go over multiple cycles. In general, I would say they tend to have fewer manual or labor-intensive processes. So I'd be surprised if they did the extent of employment verification we do. And again, it might be appropriate if their average ticket is lower, they may have different return profiles. The one thing I would say, the vast majority lend to a much broader spectrum than we do.

We had another period of strong financial results in the third quarter with earnings of $1.1 billion after tax or $3.54 per share. In many respects, these results reflected the unique benefits of our integrated digital banking and payments model, which continues to be a source of significant competitive advantage by supporting our value proposition to consumers and merchants and differentiating our brand. 
These advantages enabled our continued investment in account acquisition, technology and analytics while generating substantial capital. In an environment characterized by new entrants and intensifying competition, we believe the strengths of our model position us to accelerate our growth. 
Underlying our results this quarter were 3 important advancements. The first was our return to year-over-year receivables growth, which is driven by our investment in acquisition and brand marketing and continued strong sales trends. Total sales were up 27% over 2019 levels with strong momentum across all categories. Even travel sales increased. And while they dropped a bit in August due to concerns related to the Delta variant, travel has steadily improved since then. 
We also continue to see attractive opportunities for account acquisition and increased our marketing investment to take advantage of this. While the competitive environment has intensified, new accounts are now up 17% over 2019, reflecting the strength of our value proposition. This value proposition remains anchored in our industry-leading onshore customer service model, no annual fees and useful in transparent rewards. 
While some of our peers had to reinvigorate their rewards offerings at substantial cost, our rewards costs were up only 6 basis points year-over-year and nearly all of this increase was driven by higher consumer spending as evidenced in our strong discount revenue. Given these dynamics, we will continue investing in new accounts as long as the environment supports profitable opportunities and a robust account growth and our expectations for modest improvement in payment rates supports our view of stronger receivables growth in 2022. 
The second key trend was credit, which remained exceptionally strong. Our disciplined approach to credit management and favorable economic trends contributed to a record low net charge-off rate and continued low delinquencies. The delinquency outlook affirmed our expectations that losses will be below last year's levels for the full year and supported additional reserve releases during the quarter. 
And third is the continued expansion of our payments business. PULSE saw a meaningful increase in debit volume with 9% growth year-over-year and a 26% increase over the third quarter of 2019, demonstrating both the impact of the recovery and an increase in debit use through the pandemic. Our diners business has also started to see some improvement from the global recovery with volume up 12% from the prior year. As the global economy recovers, we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our international reach. 
In summary, our value proposition continues to be attractive, and our integrated digital banking and payments model supports profitable long-term customer relationships and is highly capital generative. I continue to feel very good about our prospects for future growth. I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail."

First, our tot",1234,"Thank you Roger, and good morning, everyone. Once again, our results this quarter reflect strong execution and the continued economic recovery. 
Looking at our financial summary results on Page 4, there are 3 key things I want to call out. First, our total revenue net of interest expense is up 8% from the prior year, excluding a $167 million unrealized loss due to market adjustments on our equity investments. Including this, revenue was up 2% for the quarter. Second is a continuation of very strong credit performance. Net charge-offs were down $343 million from the prior year, which supported a $165 million reserve release this quarter. Lastly, we continue investing for growth with increased marketing spend. Higher operating expenses in other areas were largely related to the economic recovery. I'll go over the details of our quarterly results and our full year outlook on the following slides. 
Looking at loan growth on Slide 5. We saw the return to growth this quarter with ending loans up 1% over the prior year and up 2% sequentially.  Card loans were the primary driver and were also up 1% year-over-year and 2% over the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase in card receivables was driven by strong sales volume and robust account acquisitions. 
Sales growth continued to accelerate and was up 27% over the third quarter of 2019. Year-to-date, new accounts were up 27% from the prior year and up 17% over 2019 levels. The contribution from these factors was mostly offset by the ongoing high payment rates as household savings and cash flows remain elevated. The payment rate was approximately 500 basis points over pre-pandemic levels. We anticipate that the payment rate will moderate a bit as most federal COVID support programs have ended and consumer savings rates have started to decrease. That said, we expect payment rates to remain above historical levels through 2022. 
Looking at our other lending products. Organic student loans increased 4% from the prior year with originations up 7% as most schools have returned to the normal in-person learning model. Personal loans decreased 4%, driven by high payment rates. Our underwriting criteria have returned to pre-pandemic levels, and we expect a return to growth in this product in future periods. 
Moving to Slide 6. Net interest margin was 10.8%, up 61 basis points from the prior year and 12 basis points from the prior quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, the increase in net interest margin was primarily driven by lower interest charge-offs and lower funding costs. This was partially offset by a higher mix of promo rate balances. 
Card loan yield was up 1 basis point sequentially as lower interest charge-offs were offset by the increased promotional balance mix. Yield on personal loans declined 15 basis points sequentially due to lower pricing. The margin continued to benefit from lower funding costs, primarily driven by maturities of higher rate CDs and an increased mix of lower rate savings and money market balances. 
Average consumer deposits were flat year-over-year and declined 1% from the prior quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decline was largely driven by consumer CDs. We also saw a slight decline in savings and money market deposits as consumers continued to spend excess levels of liquidity. 
We also continue to optimize our funding stack. Late in September, we executed our first ABS issuance since October 2019, consisting of $1.2 billion security with a 3-year fixed rate coupon of 58 basis points and a 5-year $600 million security with a fixed coupon of 103 basis points. These were our lowest ABS coupons ever and show good execution and timing by our treasury team. 
Looking at revenue on Slide 7. Total noninterest income increased $90 million or 20% over the prior year, excluding the unrealized loss on equity investments. Net discount and interchange revenue was up $61 million or 26%, driven by strong sales volume. This was partially offset by increased rewards costs due to high sales in the 5% category, which were restaurants and PayPal, both this year and last. We continue to benefit from strong sales through our partnership with PayPal while restaurant sales were up 62% year-over-year as dining activity recovered. Loan fee income was up $21 million or 21%, primarily driven by lower late fee charge-offs and higher nonsufficient funds and cash advance fees.. 
Looking at Slide 8. Total operating expenses were up $185 million or 18% from the prior year. The details reflect our focus on investing for future growth while managing our operating costs. Employee compensation increased $12 million, driven by a higher bonus accrual in the current year. Excluding bonuses, employee compensation was down 3% from the prior year from lower headcount. 
Marketing expense increased $70 million, supporting another quarter of strong new account growth. Other expense included a $50 million legal accrual. Professional fees were up $47 million, primarily due to higher recovery fees. Courts reopening, combined with strong credit and economic conditions, have driven an increase in recoveries and their associated fees. Year-to-date, recoveries were up 20% compared to the prior year. The benefits of these costs is reflected in lower credit losses. 
Moving to Slide 9. The trend of sustained strong credit performance continued. Total net charge-offs were a record low at 1.46%, down 154 basis points year-over-year and 66 basis points sequentially. Total net charge-off dollars decreased $343 million from the prior year and were down $131 million quarter-over-quarter. Credit performance was strong across all products as evidenced by the net charge-off rates on card, private student loans and personal loans. 
Moving to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. This quarter, we released $165 million from the reserves, and our reserve rate dropped 35 basis points to 7.7%. The reserve release reflects continued strong credit performance and a largely stable macroeconomic outlook. The impact of these was partially offset by a 2% increase in loans from the prior quarter. Our economic assumptions include an unemployment rate of approximately 5.5% by year-end and GDP growth of just over 6%. These assumptions were slightly less positive than those used in the second quarter but still reflect a strong economic outlook. 
Looking at Slide 11. Our Common Equity Tier 1 for the period was 15.5%, well above our 10.5% target. We repurchased $815 million of common stock and, as we had previously announced, increased our dividend payable by 14% to $0.50 per share. These actions reflect our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. On funding, we continue to make progress towards our goals of having deposits to be 70% to 80% of our funding mix. Deposits now make up 68% of total funding, up from 62% in the prior year.
Wrapping up on Slide 12. Our outlook for 2021 has not changed and reflects continued strong execution against our financial and strategic objectives. In summary, we remain well positioned for profitable growth from improving loan trends. Credit performance trends remained favorable, reflecting positive macroeconomic conditions and our approach to underwriting and credit management. Investments for growth have supported a significant increase in new accounts while we've contained operating expenses. Lastly, our integrated digital banking and payments model is highly capital generative, allowing us to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders. We look forward to providing our outlook for 2022 on our conference call in January. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Ashley, to open the line for Q&A."

And what we did see in the month of September was that ticked down mildly. It did increase from July to August, which was, frankly, a bit of a surprise. But as I look at the data we're seeing here in terms of revolve and the forecasted trends, my expectation is that in the fourth quarter, it will continue to step down. Some of that has to do with government support programs ending in September, and some of it has to do with the holiday season. 
And then as we look on the holiday season into 2022, I do expect that it will continue to step towards a normalized rate. But frankly, I don't think that will happen until 2023. So how do we think about the implications from that? Certainly, the payment rate is a bit of a headwind to growth. But what we've seen is really strong account acquisition and strong sales, which to date has helped offset some of that payment rate impact. So overall, we feel very, very comfortable that the balance of '21 and then '22 will have a bit of tailwind related to both payment rates declining and then strong execution from the new accounts and sales growth."

And frankly, we've had a great quarter and a great year with that. The third quarter spend actually came in mildly lower than what we originally anticipated. And the guidance I had provided on the last call was that we would approximate the 2019 levels for marketing expense. I think it will be a little bit under that -- a bit under that, largely not because of opportunities, but basically kind of some process-oriented stuff in terms of account targeting. So we feel like the money we will spend in the fourth quarter will certainly generate positive new account growth. It will tick up from the third quarter certainly and provide us a good trajectory for 2022."

It will vary based on which issuers are refreshing their cards or have more of a desire for growth -- for growth than others. But I think our focus on a clear differentiated value proposition has resulted in continued strong generation of new accounts, and I'm excited about what I see. 
In terms of the new entrants, we see that less in the core credit card space, but I would say very, very aggressive competition around personal loans. And that's an area where we focus on the long term, remain disciplined in our underwriting and what we're willing to invest in new accounts and are used to seeing competitors come and go."

We'll continue to take a look at that space and see what we can generate profitably.

And debit processing is incredibly complex and, quite frankly, very low margin and very efficient as you look at how sort of the 3 major debit networks, us, Mastercard and Visa operate. 
And right now, given the interchange caps that a lot of banks have, the economics for them are relatively thin. So while we look at what the Fed might be proposing, what goes on in other markets, I don't see anything in the near or even medium term. It looks like it has the potential.

So is there an opportunity for you to pull levers on marketing to generate some more loan growth? Or is it more likely to come from the personal loan side or student loan side? As credit is normalizing, how should we think about how you're managing that?"

So let me just give a view in terms of what we're seeing as we closed out the third quarter. So as I mentioned, the payment rate is stepping down. And from August to September, we expect that to continue. That will help certainly drive loan growth. My sense is today that there's a relationship between payment rate and sales activity. So the persistently high payment rate, I think, has driven sales activity across the industry. Now we benefited, I would say, slightly disproportionately in terms of driving incremental sales, partly due to the acquisition point you mentioned. So there's 2 dynamics. 
The third dynamic is credit normalizing. And my sense is that credit normalization will continue through '22 into '23. So today, where I said I'm positive on credit. So those factors in the aggregate, in addition to the point you mentioned in terms of account targeting, I think position us pretty well in '22 for positive loan growth. Not the specifics will come a little bit later in January when we give our view, but we're all positive on that front today."

In terms of robust loan growth in 2022, let me just put it this way here because we're going to hold off until January on providing explicit details. But the new account originations have been important for growth. Sales activity has been important for growth. The payment rate, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, has been a headwind, not completely unanticipated. We did see it mildly higher than what we had modeled, but we're still on track for delivering the loan growth that we talked about for '21, '22, it will be informed by all those factors and share it, Bill with more -- in more detail in January."

So those segments all have different characteristics. 
Certainly, at the lower end, there are many customers who are either debit preferring or do not have access to significant amounts of credit. But I think you'll continue to see it evolve. You're starting to see some pressure from merchants who are unwilling to pay take rates above what they pay in card. So right now, we certainly see opportunity on the payment side, as I talked about earlier, leveraging our assets. Over time, we think there may be opportunity for us as an issuer and again, partially leveraging our unique model and our proprietary network.

And as John pointed out, for most of those, we see a very high return from the balance transfer itself given this funding environment as well as a good percent sticking, and that's something we model very carefully."

So when we modeled in the second quarter, frankly, the economy saw a higher level of GDP growth and employment returning to normalized levels sooner. And when we updated those, the GDP had come down, employment returning to normal",281,"Yes, happy to, Dominick. So when we modeled in the second quarter, frankly, the economy saw a higher level of GDP growth and employment returning to normalized levels sooner. And when we updated those, the GDP had come down, employment returning to normalized levels pushed a bit. So that was one of multiple inputs. We provide that detail because it's, frankly, the most transparent that people can take a look at to get deal with how we're thinking about the reserves. 
Now the other items that are important in terms of our thinking here in the third quarter was, first, the portfolio performance, and it's been super strong. Second was the ending of many of the government support programs related to COVID. So most of those ended in August and September. What we'd like to do is see some seasoning of the impacts of those into the fourth quarter and perhaps even in the first quarter next year. 
If what we expect is that the impact of that season will be very, very mild on the portfolio and the broad macros continue to look favorable, there is enough kind of points of reference that would lead us to begin to step the reserves back to day 1. But a lot of things need to happen. And we ended up where we were in the third quarter. We ran through multiple models, multiple scenarios. And we got comfortable with where we were to make sure the balance sheet was fairly stated. But we do see that the broad macros out into the future are positive. So we'll see how they sustain and make a call in the fourth quarter and in 2022."

That's a difficult thing to do in that it will be subject to the economic environment. So we know historically, right, if there's a period of tougher financial situation, the personal loans will be the ones that get the least priority in terms of payment. Credit cards tend to be high. The student loans given the long duration of those contracts, they don't seem to gyrate as much with the economic outputs plus there is so much of our portfolio is co-signed that it provides additional coverage there. 
So you get to kind of personal loans subject to the economic environment. And then the card, my sense is the card has been prioritized in terms of the payment hierarchy because of what has happened in terms of cash in the digital environment. It's really difficult  shop without a card these days. So I look for stability there."

A lot of new entrants in the marketplace today, you kind of talked about it. But I remember, 2/3 of your book is roughly from the existing Discover credit card file, but the other 1/3 historically coming from the other places out of market or out of your existing file. 
As far as the underwriting you're seeing from the new entrants, you kind of talked a little bit about it, but I was wondering if you could take a little bit more granular approach to it and talk about, are they making compromises relative to what you're willing to do on credit payment income, yield verification, all of the above? And second, just kind of going back to the bonus accruals. A lot of companies are stepping up bonuses as employee retention efforts. Is this something we should kind of view as transitory one time? Or might this transfer into a little bit higher compensation expense going into next year?"

In terms of the personal loan space, it is very hard to get line of sight into the practices of these companies and there are many of them. We've seen them come and go over multiple cycles. In general, I would say they tend to have fewer manual or labor-intensive processes. So I'd be surprised if they did the extent of employment verification we do. And again, it might be appropriate if their average ticket is lower, they may have different return profiles. The one thing I would say, the vast majority lend to a much broader spectrum than we do. And so we focus on the prime segment, again, primarily debt consolidation, but it is hard to generalize across the many different new entrants that may have different models."
