James is now working in the engine business and strategy, and I know he'll do a terrific job. So thanks to James. 
Before I go through the summary of our fourth quarter and full year results, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank our employees for the sacrifices they've made over the course of 2020. 
In the second quarter, we faced the most severe decline in quarterly sales in our history, followed by a rapid recovery in demand and supported by a supply chain that was severely impacted by the pandemic. Our employees have worked tirelessly to navigate the many challenges caused by COVID-19 across the globe in order to support our customers and operate with financial discipline. I can't thank them enough for their commitment, their agility and their resilience. 
Now I'll summarize our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2021. Mark will then take you through more details of both our fourth quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. 
As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $119 million pretax or $90 million after tax. In order to provide clarity on operational performance, I'm excluding any references to those charges from my comments. 
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $5.8 billion, an increase of 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, driven primarily by increased demand in Chinese truck and construction markets. EBITDA was $837 million or 14.4% compared to $682 million or 12.2% a year ago. EBITDA percent increased due to higher revenue, stronger joint venture income, and benefits from restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by higher product coverage costs. Fourth quarter EBITDA included $36 million of reorganization and facility closure costs associated with actions taken to improve future performance, primarily in our distribution business. 
For the full year, Cummins sales were $19.8 billion, down 16% year-over-year. Our EBITDA margins were $3.1 billion or 15.7% of sales compared to $3.7 billion or 15.8% of sales in 2019. In our Engine business, sales decreased by 20% in 2020. Lower demand in most of our major regions and markets was partially offset by record levels of demand in the on-highway and construction segments in China. EBITDA was 15.4% compared to 14.6% in 2019, as the benefits of higher joint venture income, restructuring and temporary salary reductions more than offset the impact of lower volumes. Sales for our distribution business decreased by 12% in 2020, driven by lower demand for engines and power generation equipment, in addition to lower utilization of our products across many of our regions, driving lower aftermarket demand. Full year EBITDA increased to 9.3% compared to 8.6% in 2019, driven by the realization of benefits of our transformation activities, especially in North America and other cost reduction actions. 
Full year revenues for the Components segment declined by 13% due to lower truck production in North America and Europe. This more than offset increases in revenue associated with new products designed to meet broad Stage 6 emissions regulations in India and record levels of truck demand in China. EBITDA was 16.0% compared to 16.2% in 2019. The decrease in EBITDA percent was primarily due to lower volumes, which more than offset the benefits of restructuring actions, temporary salary reductions and lower warranty expense. 
Power Systems sales decreased by 19% in 2020. Sales of our power generation equipment declined by 14%, as lower demand for standby power generation equipment in North America, India and Asia more than offset continued strong demand in data center markets, especially in China. Demand for engines and industrial applications declined by 26% due to lower demand in oil and gas and mining markets. EBITDA was 9.4% compared to 11.7% in 2019. The decrease in EBITDA was primarily driven by lower volumes, which more than offset the benefits of prior restructuring actions and temporary salary reductions. 
In our New Power business, revenues increased by 89% to $72 million, primarily driven by electrolyzer demand. Full year New Power EBITDA was a loss of $172 million, in line with our forecast, as we continued to invest in new products and technologies ahead of widespread market adoption. 
And before I move on to some of our key markets, I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on the progress we made in New Power in 2020. 
First, we delivered a 20-megawatt PEM electrolyzer system to generate green hydrogen in Becancour, Québec, making it the largest operation of its kind in the world. The Cummins electrolyzer system is installed on an air liquide hydrogen production facility and began commercial operation late last year. The Cummins PEM electrolyzer can produce over 3,000 tons of hydrogen annually using hydropower. In addition to the Becancour installation, we delivered 4 megawatts of electrolyzers to 9 additional customers in 2020. We provided fuel cell modules to ASCO, Norway's largest grocery wholesaler, that were integrated into 4 Scania trucks. The fuel cell electric truck pilot is the first of its kind, as ASCO aims to reduce its energy use by 20% and ultimately become a self-sufficient provider of clean energy using 100% renewable fuel. Cummins also supplied fuel cells for Farm, a leader in waste collection vehicles and sweepers in Europe, for their electric refuse truck program. Cummins is also the largest supplier of fuel cells for the rail industry. And we are using experience from rail applications in our design for other heavy-duty transportation applications to provide best-in-class solutions. 
In the battery electric market, we delivered 147 fully electric powertrains to Bluebird in 2020 for use in the school bus market and 19 powertrains to Gillig for use in the transit bus market. Our products are now powering over 250 school buses, which are actively in service today, in addition to transit buses operating in municipalities around North America. 
Finally, we formed the NPROXX joint venture in 2020 to provide customers with high-pressure tank and storage solutions in hydrogen and natural gas markets. 
We have a strong portfolio of distinctive platforms and are continuing to invest in key technology areas for the future. We are targeting our focus and investment at the markets where commercial opportunities exist today or will emerge in the near or medium term. The experience we are gaining in the field is providing us opportunities to continuously improve our products and leverage prior investments into new applications. In addition to the technical experience we are accumulating, our sales and service channel, customer relationships and global footprint will position us well when broader commercialization of fuel cell electric powertrains and battery electric powertrains take place. 
Now I will comment on some of our key markets in 2020, starting with North America, and then I'll comment on some of our largest international markets. 
Our revenues in North America decreased 21% in 2020, primarily due to lower demand across our segments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industrial production of heavy-duty trucks declined to 187,000 units, a decrease of 39% from 2019 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales declined to 63,000, a decrease of 36% from 2019. We began shipments of our X12 engine to freightliner for use in their Cascadia day and sleeper cab models in 2020, in addition to sales in various location applications. Our entry into the regional haul market with the low weight X12 engine will further support our leading market share in this segment. 
The market size for medium-duty trucks was 101,000 units in 2020, a decline of 28% from 2019 levels, while our unit sales were 78,000, a decline of 32% from 2019. We shipped 125,000 engines to Chrysler for use in their RAM pickups in 2020, a decline of 14% from 2019 levels. 
Engine sales to construction customers in North America decreased by 42%, as nonresidential construction spending declined and rental companies cut capital spending. Engine shipments to high horsepower markets in North America decreased by 11% from last year, with lower demand from oil and gas and mining segments, partially offset by increased shipments to marine and defense customers. 
Power generation revenues decreased by 13% year-over-year, driven by lower demand for standby applications, resulting from lower nonresidential construction spending. 
Our international revenues declined 7% in 2020, with weaker demand in most markets more than offsetting a record year in China. Full year revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $6.9 billion, up 25%. The increased revenue was driven by record demand in the truck, construction and data center markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was 1.8 million units, an increase of 35%, driven by increased incentives to scrap older trucks and the increase in government stimulus following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Our units sold, including joint ventures, were 286,000, an increase of 47%. 
The light-duty truck market in China increased 17% from 2019 levels to 2.2 million units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 189,000 units, an increase of 24%. Industry demand for excavators set another record of 328,000 units in 2020, an increase of 39% from 2019 levels. Our units sold were 53,000 units, an increase of 58%, as our domestic partners gained market share. 
In our power systems markets, demand for power generation equipment in China increased 8% compared to 2019, driven by growth in key markets such as data center, infrastructure and healthcare. Industrial engine sales declined 34% from 2019 levels, primarily driven by weakness in oil and gas and mining markets. 
Full year revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, down 26%. Industry truck production declined by 54% in 2020. Demand for construction equipment dropped 28%. And power generation revenue declined 40% in 2020. Our components business was the one major bright spot, with revenue up 17% as a result of new products designed to meet both the broad Stage 6 emissions regulations introduced in April, in addition to new customer wins. 
In Brazil, our revenues declined 11% by weak -- driven by weaker demand in most end markets. 
Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2021 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. 
We are forecasting total company revenues for 2021 to increase 8% to 12% compared to 2020, driven by an increase in heavy-duty and medium-duty truck production in North America, Europe and India, offset by China, where we expect demand to moderate after a record year in 2020, particularly in the second half of the year. We expect demand for construction equipment to increase in North America and Europe and decline in China from record levels experienced last year. We are forecasting higher demand in global mining, oil and gas and power generation markets, and expect aftermarket revenues to increase by 10% compared with 2020. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 245,000 to 265,000 units in 2021, a 30% to 40% increase year-over-year. In the medium-duty truck market, we expect the market size to be 120,000 to 130,000 units, a 20% to 30% increase from last year. 
This year, we will begin selling engines to Isuzu for use in the medium-duty truck markets. We have been working with Isuzu on multiple collaboration initiatives since 2019, including the delivery of next-generation low-emission products, and are excited to take our partnership to the next level. We have delivered some initial units which are being incorporated into vehicles in North America now and plan to begin serial production in the second quarter of 2021. In 2023, we expect to supply engines to Isuzu for truck applications in Japan and Southeast Asia. 
Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be up 5% compared to 2020. In China, we expect domestic -- we are projecting domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be down 20% in 2021. We currently project a 30% reduction in heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 5% to 10% reduction in demand for the light-duty truck market. We expect demand to be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, particularly in the first quarter, and primarily driven by prebuy ahead of the broad NS VI implementation in July and OEM efforts to increase inventory levels to mitigate supply chain constraints. Industry volumes of NS VI product will increase in 2021 as the new regulations are implemented more broadly across China from July onwards. We first launched engines to meet standards similar to NS VI in the United States 10 years ago and have leveraged our knowledge in powertrain technologies to develop a range of products for Chinese markets that we expect to be well received by end users. 
Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 20% from last year's record levels. We also expect demand in the first half of the year for excavators to be stronger than the second half, driven by infrastructure projects and a strong housing market, which is expected to decline in the second half of the year as the government stimulus tightens. 
In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 25% in 2020. We expect industry demand for trucks to increase 20% in 2021. The new emission standards in China and India will result in significantly more content for each common engine we sell. For example, we expect to increase sales of after-treatment systems by over $250 million in 2021. We project our major global high horsepower markets will improve in 2021. Sales of mining engines are expected to increase by 10% to 15% in 2021, with greater demand following a recovery in commodity prices. 
Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 55% in 2021, albeit off a very low base, primarily driven by increased fracking activity in North America. Demand in global power generation markets is expected to increase 5%, driven by continued growth in data center markets and strong RV market in North America. 
In New Power, we expect full year sales to be between $110 million and $130 million. We have a backlog of approximately 65 megawatts in electrolyzers, which we expect to be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. We will continue to deliver fuel cell systems for use in the European rail market. We also expect to provide modest volumes of fuel cells for truck applications in 2021 as some fleets try out the new technology. 
We are continually innovating across our broad portfolio of power solutions, from diesel and natural gas, to fuel cells, hybrid and fully electric options. We plan to provide our customers with the right technical solution for their application at the right time and to continue to be a leader in power for commercial and industrial equipment. 
While current indicators point to improving demand in a number of key regions and markets in 2021, significant uncertainty remains, requiring continued strong focus on managing costs and cash flow as our markets continue to recover around the world. We are still operating under a pandemic, with extreme safety measures in place and our suppliers and customers are doing the same. This is presenting challenges to global supply chains as our industry responds to rising demand across multiple end markets. 
Having effectively managed through an extremely challenging 2020, Cummins is in a strong position to keep investing in future growth and continuing to return cash to shareholders. 
In summary, we expect full year sales growth of 8% to 12% and EBITDA to be in the range of 15% to 15.5% of sales. The benefits of higher volumes and ongoing cost reduction activities will be partially offset by lower joint venture earnings, investment in new products and some additional costs with supply chain inefficiencies and the year-over-year impact of restoring full salaries following temporary salary reductions between April and September last year. 
Now let me turn it over to Mark, who will focus on our financial results and discuss them in more detail. Mark?"
265253,700213775,2191867,"Cummins Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Cummins Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2020 before moving to our outlook for 2021. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter last year, we -- 2019, we record",1862,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. 
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2020 before moving to our outlook for 2021. 
As a reminder, in the fourth quarter last year, we -- 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $119 million pretax or $90 million after tax. I'm going to exclude any references to those charges in my subsequent comments to provide clarity and consistency on the underlying operating performance. 
There were 4 key highlights this quarter: first, the pace at which customer demand for Cummins products rebounded and our employees' agility in responding to the higher customer orders; second, we delivered solid profitability, especially when we peel back the expenses associated with cost reduction activities, with some elevated costs tied to a tightness in global supply chain; third, we converted the sales into cash, delivering $1.1 billion of operating cash flow, our second consecutive quarter of delivering more than $1 billion in cash; and fourth, we increased cash returns to shareholders in the fourth quarter as visibility to improving demand increased. 
Now let me go into more details on the fourth quarter and full year performance. 
Fourth quarter revenues were $5.8 billion, an increase of 5% from a year ago and snapping a 5-quarter run of declining sales. While the origins and depths of each of the downturns in the past 20 years have varied, each one has yielded negative sales growth for Cummins of between 4 and 6 quarters. Sales in North America were flat, and international revenues increased 12%. Currency movements in aggregate had a minimal impact on revenues in the fourth quarter. EBITDA was 100 -- $837 million or 14.4% of sales compared to $682 million or 12.2% of sales a year ago. EBITDA dollars increased by $155 million, as the positive impact of higher sales, the benefits of restructuring and lower variable compensation expense more than offset higher product coverage costs and additional supply chain costs. Fourth quarter EBITDA included $36 million expenses associated with the reorganization activities and facility closures, primarily driven by transformation initiatives in our distribution business. [ About ] 60 -- $36 million was equally split between gross margin and our operating expenses. Gross margin of $1.4 billion or 23.3% of sales increased by $48 million, but decreased as a percent of sales by 20 basis points year-over-year. Higher product coverage expense and additional costs associated in meeting rising demand more than offset the positive impact of higher volumes and the benefits of restructuring, leading to a slight reduction in gross margin as a percent of sales. 
Combination of a sharp recovery in demand in nearly all of our end markets and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have led to tightness in global supply chains. We leveraged our global footprint to respond to the rapid increase in demand, but did incur additional freight and labor costs in doing so, which reduced fourth quarter margins by approximately 60 basis points. We anticipate that these elevated costs will continue through the first half of 2021 and have incorporated them into the midpoint of our guidance for this year. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $56 million or 9% due to the benefits of restructuring, reduced discretionary expenses and lower variable compensation. Research expenses decreased by $16 million or 6% from a year ago. 
Joint venture income increased by $36 million, primarily due to continued strong demand for trucks in China, which we converted into earnings growth, and higher profits in our India operations. Other income of $24 million increased by $4 million from a year ago. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $501 million or $3.36 per diluted share compared to $390 million or $2.56 from a year ago. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.7%. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $1.1 billion, $304 million higher than the fourth quarter last year. Higher earnings and lower working capital contributed to the strong cash generation. 
Now I'll move to the full year 2020 commentary. 
Revenues were $19.8 billion, a decrease of 16% or $3.8 billion from a year ago, the largest dollar decline in sales in company history. Sales in North America decreased 21% and international revenues decreased 7%. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues by 1%. EBITDA was $3.1 billion or 15.7% of sales for 2020 compared to $3.7 billion or 15.8% of sales a year ago. The benefits of restructuring, lower compensation expenses due to temporary salary reductions, lower variable pay and record joint venture performance in China were more than offset by the impact of lower volumes. The record performance in China is remarkable when considering the COVID related restrictions faced by our people and operations in the first quarter last year and throughout much of the remainder of last year. Net earnings were $1.8 billion or $12.01 per diluted share. This compares to $2.4 billion or $15.05 per diluted share a year ago. 
Importantly, our results in 2020 extended our track record of raising performance over successive cycles, with earnings per share 46% higher than we delivered in the prior downturn of 2016. 
Full year cash from operations was an inflow of $2.7 billion, our second highest year. The solid profitability and lower working capital in the second half of the year contributed to the strong cash generation. 
Capital expenditures in 2020 were $528 million, down $172 million from 2019, as we reprioritized and reduced our plans in response to the pandemic induced global economic contraction. 
We returned $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders or 52% of operating cash flow in the form of share repurchases and dividends in 2021. We repurchased 3.9 million shares throughout the year at an average price of $164. After pausing share repurchases at the end of the first quarter in the face of unprecedented uncertainty, we resumed repurchases in the fourth quarter. In doing so, we completed the ninth share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors and began repurchasing under our tenth program. In October, we raised our quarterly cash dividend by 3% as visibility to improving demand increased. 
Moving on to the operating segments. I will summarize our 2020 results and provide our current forecast for 2021. 
For the Engine segment, 2020 revenues decreased 20% from a year ago while EBITDA increased from 14.6% to 15.4% of sales. In 2021, we expect revenues to grow between 10% and 14%, with this increase primarily driven by higher truck production in North America and stronger aftermarket revenues also in North America. 2021 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 14% to 15% compared to 15.4% of sales in 2020. The benefits of higher volumes are expected to be more than offset by lower joint venture income, which I'll comment more a little later, and an increase in product coverage costs associated with new product launches. 
In the Distribution segment, revenues decreased 12% from a year ago to $7.1 billion. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 9.3% compared to 8.6% a year ago. We expect 2021 Distribution revenues to grow between 6% and 10% compared to 2020, with this increase primarily driven by stronger aftermarket activity in North America. EBITDA margins are expected to be between 9.6% and 10.6%, up from 9.3% in 2020, as we continue to realize the benefits of our North American transformation work and other improvement actions in international markets. 
Components segment revenue declined 13% in 2020, while EBITDA decreased from 16.2% of sales to 16%. This year, we expect revenues to increase 9% to 13%, primarily due to higher industry truck production in North America and incremental revenues from new products in China and India following the implementation of National Standard VI Stage VI emissions regulations. EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 14.4% to 15.4% of sales compared to 16% in 2020, primarily due to lower joint venture income in China and launch costs associated with some of our new NS VI products in China. 
In the Power Systems segment, revenues decreased 19% in 2020 and EBITDA declined from 11.7% to 9.4% of sales. In 2021, we expect revenues to increase between 7% and 11%, primarily due to higher demand for mining engines and power generation equipment. EBITDA is projected to be between 10.1% and 11.1% of sales, up from 9.4% in 2020, primarily due to the benefits of higher volumes. 
In the New Power segment, revenues increased $72 million in 2020 and our operating loss was $172 million. In 2021, we anticipate revenues between $110 million and $130 million. Net expense is projected to be between $190 million and 200 million -- $210 million, as we continue to make targeted investments in our technology portfolio, consistent with the projections we made at our Hydrogen Day. 
As Tom mentioned, we are projecting 2021 company revenues to be up between 8% and 12%; the company EBIT margins, expected to be in the range of 15% to 15.5% of sales compared to 15.7% in [ 2020 ]. The benefits of higher volumes are expected to be partially offset by weaker joint venture income and the impact of restoring compensation following temporary salary reductions in 2020. Weaker demand in China following a record year in 2020 and lower earnings in India following tax and other onetime benefits last year are the main drivers of the lower joint venture income. 
As Tom mentioned, our guidance for joint venture income assumes that truck demand in China will decline sharply in the second half of 2021 following the country-wide adoption of National Standard VI emissions regulations. 
At this time, we have limited visibility to industry demand beyond the fourth -- first quarter, and we'll continue to provide updates in this important market as the year progresses. 
We are predicting our effective tax rate to be approximately 22.5% in 2021, excluding discrete items. We expect our 2021 capital investments will be in the range of $725 million to $775 million. 
As we've discussed in prior years, our base case is to return 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. And in years when we expect our cash flow to exceed the needs of our core business, we'll return more. In 2021, we currently plan to return 75% of operating cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
To summarize, we delivered strong results in 2020 in the face of unprecedented challenges, extending our track record of raising performance cycle-over-cycle. The solid financial performance was only made possible by our employees who work tirelessly to support our customers, manage through customer shipments amid significant fluctuations in demand. They manage all of this while adjusting the way they work and maintaining financial discipline throughout. 
As we enter 2021, we are well positioned to capitalize on strengthening markets to deliver another strong year. We will continue to invest in the products and technologies that will fuel profitable growth in the future and return capital to shareholders, while maintaining the flexibility to ensure that we can weather any volatility that may lay ahead.

First, the commentary on China. Just wondering, I think you said you only -- just wondering if you could clarify how much visibility you have into that market or what the OEs are telling you about production relative to your forecast of down 25% to 30%, given I think January was up about 60%. So I'm just trying to figure out how conservative that forecast could be or what you expect first half versus second half.

It just seems like the number of trucks and excavators being produced, it just seems like a lot for us relative to the economy's ability to absorb it. Again, that's just from history and experience, and we'll see. I mean last year was just an enormous production build. And as Mark said, OEMs are cautious about the same thing, but nobody has a firm grasp on it. And then there's the emissions change in the middle, which also seems like a good impact thing. So we're using our experience and history here to make this call. We did the same thing in 2020 and got it wrong. It ended up being strong all year. So we'll see. But the first half is likely to be good. And then we'll know a lot more as we get through the end of the second quarter about how the second half is going to go.

The Hydrogen Forward alliance is really just trying to make sure that those of us that are investing in the industry are making it clear to policymakers and other potential participants what the opportunity is with hydrogen. Because I do think, if you just check in with people's imagination about what a low-carbon future can look like, I think everybody from government, regulators, to my kids, understand what battery cars might mean and all that, and they get it. I think the role that hydrogen is going to play in larger energy use, more energy dense demand, it's just not as clear. And I think we need to be more proactive in helping people understand what it can mean to our entire energy system, and of course, what it can mean to equipment that we might supply. So we decided that since a lot of us have been investing a lot of time and energy in that and see the opportunity, we better start telling people about it. So that, of course, includes Biden administration and regulators, but it also includes general public, and I think a bunch of industry participants or people who could be participants, understanding what investments might make sense. That's the goal of that initiative. And I agree with exactly what you said that Europe has moved much faster to understand the role that hydrogen can play both in energy storage, cleaning up high carbon industries, steel-making and others, as well as potentially in transportation like trucks and trains. And I think the U.S. really does lag there. And part of it is, what I said, is just the understanding of regulators and others is not as good. But part of it is also because we kind of went into a different phase, I guess, over the last 5 -- 4, 5 years where we weren't really doing much for energy planning. I see that changing. We've already had several conversations with members of the Biden administration or transition people about trying to put together a more comprehensive energy strategy that -- for a low-carbon future. So I'm optimistic that not only will we have a more comprehensive plan, but that hydrogen will play a role in it. And we're trying, of course, to impact that. We do believe that for the kind of commercial and industrial applications that we are involved with anyway, with hydrogen-based technologies, can have a big role, so -- which is why we're investing in it."

There's a lot to play for in that, but that's what we're -- that's our strategy. That's what we're aiming for. 
And the challenge now on the BEV or battery electric vehicle or even fuel cell technologies is that the -- they're not in the money in trucks. So when you try to put a truck into production or into operation, you're going to be out of the money to start. And so they're mostly regulatory driven or some others subsidy driven, which means that it's not really a straight technology and performance kind of discussion. And so right now, market share is bouncing all over the place and -- because there's a lot of different players that can offer a system. That system is unlikely to be competitive long run. And even the systems we offer are not -- do not return if you compare them to a diesel system today. So market share is really, really difficult to say right now because the basis of competition, it's not technology and performance and cost. It's a whole bunch of other things. But that said, we are intending to win as many partners and as many products as we can, so we can get, A, practice and learning on the technology, and B, help customers understand how they might be able to turn these technologies into winners over time. So we are competing, don't get me wrong, but it's just the basis that competition is not the normal performance cost trade-off we're used to with diesel."

But when you said 60 bps, I think, Mark, you mentioned it was 60 bps of a drag expected for the next 2 quarters, 150 to 250, call it 200. That's like a full 100 basis points of drag.

How much do you expect that to be from China? Because China was about $215 million last year. I'm just curious how much of the total $125 million do you think is from the JVs in China declining."

When we get back to the bigger margin, you're exactly right. Yes, we -- the piece that's missing, which I've been trying to telegraph to everybody, is the $165 million in salary reductions last year. Normally, we expect to deliver a 20%-plus incremental margins. You're absolutely right. What was abnormal about the actions we took in 2020 was that salary reduction, which was $165 million. That's really that in the -- our incentive comp will be, if we hit our target slightly higher this year. When you add those, they take those 2 items alone, take about 100 basis points off the margin.

Before I go through the summary of our fourth quarter and full year results, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank our employees for the sacrifices they've made over the course of 2020. 
In the second quarter, we faced the most severe decline in quarterly sales in our history, followed by a rapid recovery in demand and supported by a supply chain that was severely impacted by the pandemic. Our employees have worked tirelessly to navigate the many challenges caused by COVID-19 across the globe in order to support our customers and operate with financial discipline. I can't thank them enough for their commitment, their agility and their resilience. 
Now I'll summarize our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2021. Mark will then take you through more details of both our fourth quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. 
As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $119 million pretax or $90 million after tax. In order to provide clarity on operational performance, I'm excluding any references to those charges from my comments. 
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $5.8 billion, an increase of 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, driven primarily by increased demand in Chinese truck and construction markets. EBITDA was $837 million or 14.4% compared to $682 million or 12.2% a year ago. EBITDA percent increased due to higher revenue, stronger joint venture income, and benefits from restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by higher product coverage costs. Fourth quarter EBITDA included $36 million of reorganization and facility closure costs associated with actions taken to improve future performance, primarily in our distribution business. 
For the full year, Cummins sales were $19.8 billion, down 16% year-over-year. Our EBITDA margins were $3.1 billion or 15.7% of sales compared to $3.7 billion or 15.8% of sales in 2019. In our Engine business, sales decreased by 20% in 2020. Lower demand in most of our major regions and markets was partially offset by record levels of demand in the on-highway and construction segments in China. EBITDA was 15.4% compared to 14.6% in 2019, as the benefits of higher joint venture income, restructuring and temporary salary reductions more than offset the impact of lower volumes. 
Sales for our distribution business decreased by 12% in 2020, driven by lower demand for engines and power generation equipment, in addition to lower utilization of our products across many of our regions, driving lower aftermarket demand. Full year EBITDA increased to 9.3% compared to 8.6% in 2019, driven by the realization of benefits of our transformation activities, especially in North America and other cost reduction actions. 
Full year revenues for the Components segment declined by 13% due to lower truck production in North America and Europe. This more than offset increases in revenue associated with new products designed to meet Bharat Stage VI emissions regulations in India and record levels of truck demand in China. EBITDA was 16.0% compared to 16.2% in 2019. The decrease in EBITDA percent was primarily due to lower volumes, which more than offset the benefits of restructuring actions, temporary salary reductions and lower warranty expense. 
Power Systems sales decreased by 19% in 2020. Sales of our power generation equipment declined by [ 14% ], as lower demand for standby power generation equipment in North America, India and Asia more than offset continued strong demand in data center markets, especially in China. Demand for engines and industrial applications declined by [ 26% ] due to lower demand in oil and gas and mining markets. EBITDA was 9.4% compared to 11.7% in 2019. The decrease in EBITDA was primarily driven by lower volumes, which more than offset the benefits of prior restructuring actions and temporary salary reductions. 
In our New Power business, revenues increased by 89% to $72 million, primarily driven by electrolyzer demand. Full year New Power EBITDA was a loss of $172 million, in line with our forecast, as we continued to invest in new products and technologies ahead of widespread market adoption. 
And before I move on to some of our key markets, I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on the progress we made in New Power in 2020. 
First, we delivered a 20-megawatt PEM electrolyzer system to generate green hydrogen in Bécancour, Québec, making it the largest operation of its kind in the world. The Cummins electrolyzer system is installed on an Air Liquide hydrogen production facility and began commercial operation late last year. The Cummins PEM electrolyzer can produce over 3,000 tons of hydrogen annually using hydropower. In addition to the Bécancour installation, we delivered 4 megawatts of electrolyzers to 9 additional customers in 2020. We provided fuel cell modules to ASKO, Norway's largest grocery wholesaler, that were integrated into 4 Scania trucks. 
The fuel cell electric truck pilot is the first of its kind, as ASKO aims to reduce its energy use by 20% and ultimately become a self-sufficient provider of clean energy using 100% renewable fuel. Cummins also supplied fuel cells for FAUN, a leader in waste collection vehicles and sweepers in Europe, for their electric refuse truck program. Cummins is also the largest supplier of fuel cells for the rail industry. And we are using experience from rail applications in our design for other heavy-duty transportation applications to provide best-in-class solutions. 
In the battery electric market, we delivered 147 fully electric powertrains to BlueBird in 2020 for use in the school bus market and 19 powertrains to GILLIG for use in the transit bus market. Our products are now powering over 250 school buses, which are actively in service today, in addition to transit buses operating in municipalities around North America. 
Finally, we formed the NPROXX joint venture in 2020 to provide customers with high-pressure tank and storage solutions in hydrogen and natural gas markets. 
We have a strong portfolio of distinctive platforms and are continuing to invest in key technology areas for the future. We are targeting our focus and investment at the markets where commercial opportunities exist today or will emerge in the near or medium term. The experience we are gaining in the field is providing us opportunities to continuously improve our products and leverage prior investments into new applications. In addition to the technical experience we are accumulating, our sales and service channel, customer relationships and global footprint will position us well when broader commercialization of fuel cell electric powertrains and battery electric powertrains take place. 
Now I will comment on some of our key markets in 2020, starting with North America, and then I'll comment on some of our largest international markets. 
Our revenues in North America decreased 21% in 2020, primarily due to lower demand across our segments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industrial production of heavy-duty trucks declined to 187,000 units, a decrease of 39% from 2019 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales declined to 63,000, a decrease of 36% from 2019. We began shipments of our X12 engine to Freightliner for use in their Cascadia day and sleeper cab models in 2020, in addition to sales in various location applications. Our entry into the regional haul market with the low weight X12 engine will further support our leading market share in this segment. 
The market size for medium-duty trucks was 101,000 units in 2020, a decline of 28% from 2019 levels, while our unit sales were 78,000, a decline of 32% from 2019. We shipped 125,000 engines to Chrysler for use in their RAM pickups in 2020, a decline of 14% from 2019 levels. 
Engine sales to construction customers in North America decreased by 42%, as nonresidential construction spending declined and rental companies cut capital spending. Engine shipments to high horsepower markets in North America decreased by 11% from last year, with lower demand from oil and gas and mining segments, partially offset by increased shipments to marine and defense customers. 
Power generation revenues decreased by 13% year-over-year, driven by lower demand for standby applications, resulting from lower nonresidential construction spending. 
Our international revenues declined 7% in 2020, with weaker demand in most markets more than offsetting a record year in China. Full year revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $6.9 billion, up 25%. The increased revenue was driven by record demand in the truck, construction and data center markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was 1.8 million units, an increase of 35%, driven by increased incentives to scrap older trucks and the increase in government stimulus following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Our units sold, including joint ventures, were 286,000, an increase of 47%. 
The light-duty truck market in China increased 17% from 2019 levels to 2.2 million units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 189,000 units, an increase of 24%. Industry demand for excavators set another record of 328,000 units in 2020, an increase of 39% from 2019 levels. Our units sold were 53,000 units, an increase of 58%, as our domestic partners gained market share. 
In our power systems markets, demand for power generation equipment in China increased 8% compared to 2019, driven by growth in key markets such as data center, infrastructure and healthcare. Industrial engine sales declined 34% from 2019 levels, primarily driven by weakness in oil and gas and mining markets. 
Full year revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, down 26%. Industry truck production declined by 54% in 2020. Demand for construction equipment dropped 28%. And power generation revenue declined 40% in 2020. Our components business was the one major bright spot, with revenue up 17% as a result of new products designed to meet both the Bharat Stage VI emissions regulations introduced in April, in addition to new customer wins. 
In Brazil, our revenues declined 11% by weak -- driven by weaker demand in most end markets. 
Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2021 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. 
We are forecasting total company revenues for 2021 to increase 8% to 12% compared to 2020, driven by an increase in heavy-duty and medium-duty truck production in North America, Europe and India, offset by China, where we expect demand to moderate after a record year in 2020, particular in the second half of the year. We expect demand for construction equipment to increase in North America and Europe and decline in China from record levels experienced last year. We are forecasting higher demand in global mining, oil and gas and power generation markets, and expect aftermarket revenues to increase by 10% compared with 2020. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 245,000 to 265,000 units in 2021, a 30% to 40% increase year-over-year. In the medium-duty truck market, we expect the market size to be 120,000 to 130,000 units, a 20% to 30% increase from last year. 
This year, we will begin selling engines to Isuzu for use in the medium-duty truck markets. We have been working with Isuzu on multiple collaboration initiatives since 2019, including the delivery of next-generation low-emission products, and are excited to take our partnership to the next level. We have delivered some initial units which are being incorporated into vehicles in North America now and plan to begin serial production in the second quarter of 2021. In 2023, we expect to supply engines to Isuzu for truck applications in Japan and Southeast Asia. 
Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be up 5% compared to 2020. In China, we expect domestic -- we are projecting domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be down 20% in 2021. We currently project a 30% reduction in heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 5% to 10% reduction in demand for the light-duty truck market. We expect demand to be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, particularly in the first quarter, and primarily driven by prebuy ahead of the [ broad ] NS VI implementation in July and OEM efforts to increase inventory levels to mitigate supply chain constraints. Industry volumes of NS VI product will increase in 2021 as the new regulations are implemented more broadly across China from July onwards. We first launched engines to meet standards similar to NS VI in the United States 10 years ago and have leveraged our knowledge in powertrain technologies to develop a range of products for Chinese markets that we expect to be well received by end users. 
Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 20% from last year's record levels. We also expect demand the first half of the year for excavators to be stronger than the second half, driven by infrastructure projects and a strong housing market, which is expected to decline in the second half of the year as the government stimulus tightens. 
In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 25% in 2020. We expect industry demand for trucks to increase 20% in 2021. The new emission standards in China and India will result in significantly more content for each Cummins engine we sell. For example, we expect to increase sales of after-treatment systems by over $250 million in 2021. We project our major global high horsepower markets will improve in 2021. Sales of mining engines are expected to increase by 10% to 15% in 2021, with greater demand following a recovery in commodity prices. 
Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 55% in 2021, albeit off a very low base, primarily driven by increased fracking activity in North America. Demand in global power generation markets is expected to increase 5%, driven by continued growth in data center markets and strong RV market in North America. 
In New Power, we expect full year sales to be between $110 million and $130 million. We have a backlog of approximately 65 megawatts in electrolyzers, which we expect to be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. We will continue to deliver fuel cell systems for use in the European rail market. We also expect to provide modest volumes of fuel cells for truck applications in 2021 as some fleets try out the new technology. 
We are continually innovating across our broad portfolio of power solutions, from diesel and natural gas, to fuel cells, hybrid and fully electric options. We plan to provide our customers with the right technical solution for their application at the right time and to continue to be a leader in power for commercial and industrial equipment. 
While current indicators point to improving demand in a number of key regions and markets in 2021, significant uncertainty remains, requiring continued strong focus on managing costs and cash flow as our markets continue to recover around the world. We are still operating under a pandemic, with extreme safety measures in place and our suppliers and customers are doing the same. This is presenting challenges to global supply chains as our industry responds to rising demand across multiple end markets. 
Having effectively managed through an extremely challenging 2020, Cummins is in a strong position to keep investing in future growth and continuing to return cash to shareholders. 
In summary, we expect full year sales growth of 8% to 12% and EBITDA to be in the range of 15% to 15.5% of sales. The benefits of higher volumes and ongoing cost reduction activities will be partially offset by lower joint venture earnings, investment in new products and some additional costs with supply chain inefficiencies and the year-over-year impact of restoring full salaries following temporary salary reductions between April and September last year. 
Now let me turn it over to Mark, who will focus on our financial results and discuss them in more detail. Mark?"

As a reminder, in the fourth quarter last year, we -- 2019, we record",1866,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. 
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2020 before moving to our outlook for 2021. 
As a reminder, in the fourth quarter last year, we -- 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $119 million pretax or $90 million after tax. I'm going to exclude any references to those charges in my subsequent comments to provide clarity and consistency on the underlying operating performance. 
There were 4 key highlights this quarter: first, the pace at which customer demand for Cummins products rebounded and our employees' agility in responding to the higher customer orders; second, we delivered solid profitability, especially when we peel back the expenses associated with cost reduction activities, with some elevated costs tied to a tightness in global supply chain; third, we converted the sales into cash, delivering $1.1 billion of operating cash flow, our second consecutive quarter of delivering more than $1 billion in cash; and fourth, we increased cash returns to shareholders in the fourth quarter as visibility to improving demand increased. 
Now let me go into more details on the fourth quarter and full year performance. 
Fourth quarter revenues were $5.8 billion, an increase of 5% from a year ago and snapping a 5-quarter run of declining sales. While the origins and depths of each of the downturns in the past 20 years have varied, each one has yielded negative sales growth for Cummins of between 4 and 6 quarters. Sales in North America were flat, and international revenues increased 12%. Currency movements in aggregate had a minimal impact on revenues in the fourth quarter. EBITDA was 100 -- $837 million or 14.4% of sales compared to $682 million or 12.2% of sales a year ago. EBITDA dollars increased by $155 million, as the positive impact of higher sales, the benefits of restructuring and lower variable compensation expense more than offset higher product coverage costs and additional supply chain costs. 
Fourth quarter EBITDA included $36 million expenses associated with the reorganization activities and facility closures, primarily driven by transformation initiatives in our distribution business. [ That ] 60 -- $36 million was equally split between gross margin and our operating expenses. Gross margin of $1.4 billion or 23.3% of sales increased by $48 million, but decreased as a percent of sales by 20 basis points year-over-year. Higher product coverage expense and additional costs associated in meeting rising demand more than offset the positive impact of higher volumes and the benefits of restructuring, leading to a slight reduction in gross margin as a percent of sales. 
Combination of a sharp recovery in demand in nearly all of our end markets and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have led to tightness in global supply chains. We leveraged our global footprint to respond to the rapid increase in demand, but did incur additional freight and labor costs in doing so, which reduced fourth quarter margins by approximately 60 basis points. We anticipate that these elevated costs will continue through the first half of 2021 and have incorporated them into the midpoint of our guidance for this year. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $56 million or 9% due to the benefits of restructuring, reduced discretionary expenses and lower variable compensation. Research expenses decreased by $16 million or 6% from a year ago. 
Joint venture income increased by $36 million, primarily due to continued strong demand for trucks in China, which we converted into earnings growth, and higher profits in our India operations. Other income of $24 million increased by $4 million from a year ago. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $501 million or $3.36 per diluted share compared to $390 million or $2.56 from a year ago. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.7%. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $1.1 billion, $304 million higher than the fourth quarter last year. Higher earnings and lower working capital contributed to the strong cash generation. 
Now I'll move to the full year 2020 commentary. 
Revenues were $19.8 billion, a decrease of 16% or $3.8 billion from a year ago, the largest dollar decline in sales in company history. Sales in North America decreased 21% and international revenues decreased 7%. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues by 1%. EBITDA was $3.1 billion or 15.7% of sales for 2020 compared to $3.7 billion or 15.8% of sales a year ago. The benefits of restructuring, lower compensation expenses due to temporary salary reductions, lower variable pay and record joint venture performance in China were more than offset by the impact of lower volumes. The record performance in China is remarkable when considering the COVID related restrictions faced by our people and operations in the first quarter last year and throughout much of the remainder of last year. Net earnings were $1.8 billion or $12.01 per diluted share. This compares to $2.4 billion or $15.05 per diluted share a year ago. 
Importantly, our results in 2020 extended our track record of raising performance over successive cycles, with earnings per share 46% higher than we delivered in the prior downturn of 2016. 
Full year cash from operations was an inflow of $2.7 billion, our second highest year. The solid profitability and lower working capital in the second half of the year contributed to the strong cash generation. 
Capital expenditures in 2020 were $528 million, down $172 million from 2019, as we reprioritized and reduced our plans in response to the pandemic induced global economic contraction. 
We returned $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders or 52% of operating cash flow in the form of share repurchases and dividends in 2021. We repurchased 3.9 million shares throughout the year at an average price of $164. After pausing share repurchases at the end of the first quarter in the face of unprecedented uncertainty, we resumed repurchases in the fourth quarter. In doing so, we completed the ninth share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors and began repurchasing under our tenth program. In October, we raised our quarterly cash dividend by 3% as visibility to improving demand increased. 
Moving on to the operating segments. I will summarize our 2020 results and provide our current forecast for 2021. 
For the Engine segment, 2020 revenues decreased 20% from a year ago while EBITDA increased from 14.6% to 15.4% of sales. In 2021, we expect revenues to grow between 10% and 14%, with this increase primarily driven by higher truck production in North America and stronger aftermarket revenues also in North America. 2021 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 14% to 15% compared to 15.4% of sales in 2020. The benefits of higher volumes are expected to be more than offset by lower joint venture income, which I'll comment more a little later, and an increase in product coverage costs associated with new product launches. 
In the Distribution segment, revenues decreased 12% from a year ago to $7.1 billion. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 9.3% compared to 8.6% a year ago. We expect 2021 Distribution revenues to grow between 6% and 10% compared to 2020, with this increase primarily driven by stronger aftermarket activity in North America. EBITDA margins are expected to be between 9.6% and 10.6%, up from 9.3% in 2020, as we continue to realize the benefits of our North American transformation work and other improvement actions in international markets. 
Components segment revenue declined 13% in 2020, while EBITDA decreased from 16.2% of sales to 16%. This year, we expect revenues to increase 9% to 13%, primarily due to higher industry truck production in North America and incremental revenues from new products in China and India following the implementation of National Standard VI and Bharat Stage VI emissions regulations. EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 14.4% to 15.4% of sales compared to 16% in 2020, primarily due to lower joint venture income in China and launch costs associated with some of our new NS VI products in China. 
In the Power Systems segment, revenues decreased 19% in 2020 and EBITDA declined from 11.7% to 9.4% of sales. In 2021, we expect revenues to increase between 7% and 11%, primarily due to higher demand for mining engines and power generation equipment. EBITDA is projected to be between 10.1% and 11.1% of sales, up from 9.4% in 2020, primarily due to the benefits of higher volumes. 
In the New Power segment, revenues increased $72 million in 2020 and our operating loss was $172 million. In 2021, we anticipate revenues between $110 million and $130 million. Net expense is projected to be between $190 million and 200 million -- $210 million, as we continue to make targeted investments in our technology portfolio, consistent with the projections we made at our Hydrogen Day. 
As Tom mentioned, we are projecting 2021 company revenues to be up between 8% and 12%; the company [ EBIT ] margins, expected to be in the range of 15% to 15.5% of sales compared to 15.7% [Audio Gap]. The benefits of higher volumes are expected to be partially offset by weaker joint venture income and the impact of restoring compensation following temporary salary reductions in 2020. Weaker demand in China following a record year in 2020 and lower earnings in India following tax and other onetime benefits last year are the main drivers of the lower joint venture income. 
As Tom mentioned, our guidance for joint venture income assumes that truck demand in China will decline sharply in the second half of 2021 following the country-wide adoption of National Standard VI emissions regulations. 
At this time, we have limited visibility to industry demand beyond the fourth -- first quarter, and we'll continue to provide updates in this important market as the year progresses. 
We are predicting --  projecting our effective tax rate to be approximately 22.5% in 2021, excluding discrete items. We expect our 2021 capital investments will be in the range of $725 million to $775 million. 
As we've discussed in prior years, our base case is to return 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. And in years when we expect our cash flow to exceed the needs of our core business, we'll return more. In 2021, we currently plan to return 75% of operating cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
To summarize, we delivered strong results in 2020 in the face of unprecedented challenges, extending our track record of raising performance cycle-over-cycle. The solid financial performance was only made possible by our employees who work tirelessly to support our customers, manage through customer shutdowns amid significant fluctuations in demand. They managed all of this while adjusting the way they work and maintaining financial discipline throughout. 
As we enter 2021, we are well positioned to capitalize on strengthening markets to deliver another strong year. We will continue to invest in the products and technologies that will fuel profitable growth in the future and return capital to shareholders, while maintaining the flexibility to ensure that we can weather any volatility that may lay ahead.

It just seems like the number of trucks and excavators being produced, it just seems like a lot for us relative to the economy's ability to absorb it. Again, that's just from history and experience, and we'll see. I mean last year was just an enormous production build. And as Mark said, OEMs are cautious about the same thing, but nobody has a firm grasp on it. And then there's the emissions change in the middle, which also seems like a good impact thing. So we're using our experience and history here to make this call. We did the same thing in 2020 and got it wrong. It ended up being strong all year. So we'll see. But the first half is likely to be good. And then we'll know a lot more as we get through the end of the second quarter about how the second half is going to go.

We are working with all of our suppliers. The supply base is generally tight, not just semiconductors, which has gotten a lot of press. But many of our components are on longer lead times, our suppliers, and we are struggling with absenteeism due to COVID. And we are working very closely with our customers to remain connected and to continue to supply them as best we can. We are working through all of these issues on a daily basis.

The Hydrogen Forward alliance is really just trying to make sure that those of us that are investing in the industry are making it clear to policymakers and other potential participants what the opportunity is with hydrogen. Because I do think, if you just check in with people's imagination about what a low-carbon future can look like, I think everybody from government, regulators, to my kids, understand what battery cars might mean and all that, and they get it. I think the role that hydrogen is going to play in larger energy use, more energy dense demand, it's just not as clear. And I think we need to be more proactive in helping people understand what it can mean to our entire energy system, and of course, what it can mean to equipment that we might supply. 
So we decided that since a lot of us have been investing a lot of time and energy in that and see the opportunity, we better start telling people about it. So that, of course, includes Biden administration and regulators, but it also includes general public, and I think a bunch of industry participants or people who could be participants, understanding what investments might make sense. That's the goal of that initiative. And I agree with exactly what you said that Europe has moved much faster to understand the role that hydrogen can play both in energy storage, cleaning up high carbon industries, steel making and others, as well as potentially in transportation like trucks and trains. And I think the U.S. really does lag there. And part of it is, what I said, is just the understanding of regulators and others is not as good. 
But part of it is also because we kind of went into a different phase, I guess, over the last 5 -- 4 or 5 years where we weren't really doing much for energy planning. I see that changing. We've already had several conversations with members of the Biden administration or transition people about trying to put together a more comprehensive energy strategy that -- for a low-carbon future. So I'm optimistic that not only will we have a more comprehensive plan, but that hydrogen will play a role in it. And we're trying, of course, to impact that. We do believe that for the kind of commercial industrial applications that we are involved with anyway, that hydrogen-based technologies, can have a big role, so -- which is why we're investing in it."

And of course, we're all interested in this question because I think you know, our strategy as a supplier to the industry is to maintain leadership irrespective of technology. And we're investing in the key technologies that we",362,"Yes. It's a great question. And of course, we're all interested in this question because I think you know, our strategy as a supplier to the industry is to maintain leadership irrespective of technology. And we're investing in the key technologies that we think take us from diesel today through hybrid through other fuels, all the way up to low and 0 carbon -- tailpipe carbon technologies. And our intent is to invest in the technologies and with the customers that we think are going to win. So we end up -- we're leading today, and we end up leading then, in those new technologies. There's a lot to play for in that, but that's what we're -- that's our strategy. That's what we're aiming for. 
And the challenge now on the BEV or battery electric vehicle or even fuel cell technologies is that the -- they're not in the money in trucks. So when you try to put a truck into production or into operation, you're going to be out of the money at the start. And so they're mostly regulatory driven or some others subsidy driven, which means that it's not really a straight technology and performance kind of discussion. And so right now, market share is bouncing all over the place and -- because there's a lot of different players that can offer a system. That system is unlikely to be competitive long run. And even the systems we offer are not -- do not return if you compare them to a diesel system today. 
So market share is really, really difficult to say right now because the basis of competition, is not technology and performance and cost. It's a whole bunch of other things. But that said, we are intending to win as many partners and as many products as we can, so we can get, A, practice and learning on the technology, and B, help customers understand how they might be able to turn these technologies into winners over time. So we are competing, don't get me wrong, but it's just the basis of competition is not the normal performance cost trade-off we're used to with diesel."

My question is on the margins. First, the incremental margins. All in, they're implied only 11%. Obviously, the lower JV income is the big drag. But even if you exclude the JV income from both years, the implied incrementals are only 17%. So that's about $150 million to $250 million of higher cost than you would normally expect, right? Meaning, instead of 17% incremental as you would think 25% to 30%. But when you said 60 bps, I think, Mark, you mentioned it was 60 bps of a drag expected for the next 2 quarters, 150 to 250, call it 200 midpoint. That's like a full 100 basis points of drag. So can you help us understand how do we bridge that? Can you talk about some costs that you already know can be quantified? 
And then I have a quick question on the JV income related to margins. China, how big of the decline do you expect from the total company JV income going down about $125 million year-over-year? How much do you expect that to be from China? Because China was about $215 million last year. I'm just curious how much of the total $125 million do you think is from the JVs in China declining."

Normally, we expect to deliver a 20%-plus incremental margins. You're absolutely right. What was abnormal about the actions we took in 2020 was that salary reduction, which was $165 million. That's really that and the -- our incentive comp will be, if we hit our target slightly higher this year.

Before I go through the summary of our fourth quarter and full year results, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank our employees for the sacrifices they've made over the course of 2020. In the second quarter, we faced the most severe decline in quarterly sales in our history, followed by a rapid recovery in demand and supported by a supply chain that was severely impacted by the pandemic. Our employees have worked tirelessly to navigate the many challenges caused by COVID-19 across the globe in order to support our customers and operate with financial discipline. I can't thank them enough for their commitment, their agility and their resilience. 
Now I'll summarize our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2021. Mark will then take you through more details of both our fourth quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $119 million pretax or $90 million after tax. In order to provide clarity on operational performance, I'm excluding any references to those charges from my comments. 
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $5.8 billion, an increase of 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 driven primarily by increased demand in Chinese truck and construction markets. EBITDA was $837 million or 14.4% compared to $682 million or 12.2% a year ago. EBITDA percent increased due to higher revenue, stronger joint venture income and benefits from restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2019 partially offset by higher product coverage costs. Fourth quarter EBITDA included $36 million of reorganization and facility closure costs associated with actions taken to improve future performance primarily in our distribution business. 
For the full year, Cummins sales were $19.8 billion, down 16% year-over-year. Our EBITDA margins were $3.1 billion or 15.7% of sales compared to $3.7 billion or 15.8% of sales in 2019. In our Engine business, sales decreased by 20% in 2020. Lower demand in most of our major regions and markets was partially offset by record levels of demand in the on-highway and construction segment in China. EBITDA was 15.4% compared to 14.6% in 2019 as the benefits of higher joint venture income, restructuring and temporary salary reductions more than offset the impact of lower volumes. 
Sales for our distribution business decreased by 12% in 2020 driven by lower demand for engines and power generation equipment in addition to lower utilization of our products across many of our regions, driving lower aftermarket demand. Full year EBITDA increased to 9.3% compared to 8.6% in 2019 driven by the realization of benefits of our transformation activities, especially in North America and other cost reduction actions. 
Full year revenues for the Components segment declined by 13% due to lower truck production in North America and Europe. This more than offset increases in revenue associated with new products designed to meet Bharat Stage VI emissions regulations in India and record levels of truck demand in China. EBITDA was 16.0% compared to 16.2% in 2019. The decrease in EBITDA percent was primarily due to lower volumes, which more than offset the benefits of restructuring actions, temporary salary reductions and lower warranty expense. 
Power Systems sales decreased by 19% in 2020. Sales of our power generation equipment declined by 14% as lower demand for standby power generation equipment in North America, India and Asia more than offset continued strong demand in data center markets, especially in China. Demand for engines and industrial applications declined by 26% due to lower demand in oil and gas and mining markets. EBITDA was 9.4% compared to 11.7% in 2019. The decrease in EBITDA was primarily driven by lower volumes, which more than offset the benefits of prior restructuring actions and temporary salary reductions. 
In our New Power business, revenues increased by 89% to $72 million primarily driven by electrolyzer demand. Full year New Power EBITDA was a loss of $172 million, in line with our forecast, as we continued to invest in new products and technologies ahead of widespread market adoption. 
And before I move on to some of our key markets, I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on the progress we made in New Power in 2020. First, we delivered a 20-megawatt PEM electrolyzer system to generate green hydrogen in Becancour, Quebec, making it the largest operation of its kind in the world. The Cummins electrolyzer system is installed on an Air Liquide hydrogen production facility and began commercial operation late last year. The Cummins PEM electrolyzer can produce over 3,000 tons of hydrogen annually using hydropower. In addition to the Becancour installation, we delivered 4 megawatts of electrolyzers to 9 additional customers in 2020. 
We provided fuel cell modules to ASKO, Norway's largest grocery wholesaler, that were integrated into 4 Scania trucks. The fuel cell electric truck pilot is the first of its kind as ASKO aims to reduce its energy use by 20% and ultimately become a self-sufficient provider of clean energy using 100% renewable fuel. Cummins also supplied fuel cells for FAUN, a leader in waste collection vehicles and sweepers in Europe for their electric refuse truck program. Cummins is also the largest supplier of fuel cells for the rail industry. And we are using experience from rail applications in our design for other heavy-duty transportation applications to provide best-in-class solutions. 
In the battery electric market, we delivered 147 fully electric powertrains to BlueBird in 2020 for use in the school bus market and 19 powertrains to GILLIG for use in the transit bus market. Our products are now powering over 250 school buses, which are actively in service today in addition to transit buses operating in municipalities around North America. Finally, we formed the NPROXX joint venture in 2020 to provide customers with high-pressure tank and storage solutions in hydrogen and natural gas markets. 
We have a strong portfolio of distinctive platforms and are continuing to invest in key technology areas for the future. We are targeting our focus and investment at the markets where commercial opportunities exist today or will emerge in the near or medium term. The experience we are gaining in the field is providing us opportunities to continuously improve our products and leverage prior investments into new applications. In addition to the technical experience we are accumulating, our sales and service channel, customer relationships and global footprint will position us well when broader commercialization of fuel cell electric powertrains and battery electric powertrains take place. 
Now I will comment on some of our key markets in 2020, starting with North America, and then I'll comment on some of our largest international markets. Our revenues in North America decreased 21% in 2020 primarily due to lower demand across our segments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industrial production of heavy-duty trucks declined to 187,000 units, a decrease of 39% from 2019 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales declined to 63,000, a decrease of 36% from 2019. We began shipments of our X12 engine to Freightliner for use in their Cascadia day and sleeper cab models in 2020. 
In addition to sales in various location -- applications, our entry into the regional haul market with the low weight X12 engine will further support our leading market share in this segment. The market size for medium-duty trucks was 101,000 units in 2020, a decline of 28% from 2019 levels, while our unit sales were 78,000, a decline of 32% from 2019. We shipped 125,000 engines to Chrysler for use in their RAM pickups in 2020, a decline of 14% from 2019 levels. 
Engine sales to construction customers in North America decreased by 42% as nonresidential construction spending decline and rental companies cut capital spending. Engine shipments to high horsepower markets in North America decreased by 11% from last year, with lower demand from oil and gas and mining segments partially offset by increased shipments to marine and defense customers. Power generation revenues decreased by 13% year-over-year driven by lower demand for standby applications resulting from lower nonresidential construction spending. 
Our international revenues declined 7% in 2020, with weaker demand in most markets more than offsetting a record year in China. Full year revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $6.9 billion, up 25%. The increased revenue was driven by record demand in the truck, construction and data center markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was 1.8 million units, an increase of 35% driven by increased incentives to scrap older trucks and the increase in government stimulus following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Our units sold, including joint ventures, were 286,000, an increase of 47%. 
The light-duty truck market in China increased 17% from 2019 levels to 2.2 million units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 189,000 units, an increase of 24%. Industry demand for excavators set another record of 328,000 units in 2020, an increase of 39% from 2019 levels. Our units sold were 53,000 units, an increase of 58% as our domestic partners gained market share. 
In our Power Systems markets, demand for power generation equipment in China increased 8% compared to 2019 driven by growth in key markets such as data center, infrastructure and health care. Industrial engine sales declined 34% from 2019 levels primarily driven by weakness in oil and gas and mining markets. 
Full year revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, down 26%. Industry truck production declined by 54% in 2020. Demand for construction equipment dropped 28%. And power generation revenue declined 40% in 2020. Our components business was the one major bright spot, with revenue up 17% as a result of new products designed to meet both the Bharat Stage VI emissions regulations introduced in April in addition to new customer wins. In Brazil, our revenues declined 11% by weak -- driven by weaker demand in most end markets. 
Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2021 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2021 to increase 8% to 12% compared to 2020 driven by an increase in heavy-duty and medium-duty truck production in North America, Europe and India, offset by China, where we expect demand to moderate after a record year in 2020 particular in the second half of the year. We expect demand for construction equipment to increase in North America and Europe and decline in China from record levels experienced last year. We are forecasting higher demand in global mining, oil and gas and power generation markets and expect aftermarket revenues to increase by 10% compared with 2020. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 245,000 to 265,000 units in 2021, a 30% to 40% increase year-over-year. In the medium-duty truck market, we expect the market size to be 120,000 to 130,000 units, a 20% to 30% increase from last year. 
This year, we will begin selling engines to Isuzu for use in the medium-duty truck markets. We have been working with Isuzu on multiple collaboration initiatives since 2019, including the delivery of next-generation low-emission products and are excited to take our partnership to the next level. We have delivered some initial units which are being incorporated into vehicles in North America now and plan to begin serial production in the second quarter of 2021. 
In 2023, we expect to supply engines to Isuzu for truck applications in Japan and Southeast Asia. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be up 5% compared to 2020. In China, we expect domestic -- we are projecting domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be down 20% in 2021. We currently project a 30% reduction in heavy- and medium-duty truck demand and a 5% to 10% reduction in demand for the light-duty truck market. We expect demand to be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, particularly in the first quarter, and primarily driven by prebuy ahead of the broad NS VI implementation in July and OEM efforts to increase inventory levels to mitigate supply chain constraints. 
Industry volumes of NS VI product will increase in 2021 as the new regulations are implemented more broadly across China from July onwards. We first launched engines to meet standards similar to NS VI in the United States 10 years ago and have leveraged our knowledge in powertrain technologies to develop a range of products for Chinese markets that we expect to be well received by end users. Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 20% from last year's record levels. We also expect demand the first half of the year for excavators to be stronger than the second half driven by infrastructure projects and a strong housing market, which is expected to decline in the second half of the year as the government stimulus tightens. 
In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 25% in 2020. We expect industry demand for trucks to increase 20% in 2021. The new emission standards in China and India will result in significantly more content for each Cummins engine we sell. For example, we expect to increase sales of after-treatment systems by over $250 million in 2021. We project our major global high horsepower markets will improve in 2021. Sales of mining engines are expected to increase by 10% to 15% in 2021 with greater demand following a recovery in commodity prices. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 55% in 2021, albeit off a very low base primarily driven by increased fracking activity in North America. Demand in global power generation markets is expected to increase 5% driven by continued growth in data center markets and strong RV market in North America. 
In New Power, we expect full year sales to be between $110 million and $130 million. We have a backlog of approximately 65 megawatts in electrolyzers, which we expect to be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. We will continue to deliver fuel cell systems for use in the European rail market. We also expect to provide modest volumes of fuel cells for truck applications in 2021 as some fleets try out the new technology. 
We are continually innovating across our broad portfolio of power solutions from diesel and natural gas to fuel cells, hybrid and fully electric options. We plan to provide our customers with the right technical solution for their application at the right time and to continue to be a leader in power for commercial and industrial equipment. While current indicators point to improving demand in a number of key regions and markets in 2021, significant uncertainty remains, requiring continued strong focus on managing costs and cash flow as our markets continue to recover around the world. We are still operating under a pandemic with extreme safety measures in place and our suppliers and customers are doing the same. This is presenting challenges to global supply chains as our industry responds to rising demand across multiple end markets. 
Having effectively managed through an extremely challenging 2020, Cummins is in a strong position to keep investing in future growth and continuing to return cash to shareholders. In summary, we expect full year sales growth of 8% to 12% and EBITDA to be in the range of 15% to 15.5% of sales. The benefits of higher volumes and ongoing cost reduction activities will be partially offset by lower joint venture earnings, investment in new products and some additional costs with supply chain inefficiencies and the year-over-year impact of restoring full salaries following temporary salary reductions between April and September last year. 
Now let me turn it over to Mark, who will focus on our financial results and discuss them in more detail. Mark?"

As a reminder, in the fourth quarter last year, we -- 2019, we recorded r",1870,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2020 before moving to our outlook for 2021. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter last year, we -- 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $119 million pretax or $90 million after tax. I'm going to exclude any references to those charges in my subsequent comments to provide clarity and consistency on the underlying operating performance. 
There were 4 key highlights this quarter. First, the pace at which customer demand for Cummins products rebounded and our employees' agility in responding to the higher customer orders. Second, we delivered solid profitability, especially when we peel back the expenses associated with cost reduction activities and some elevated costs tied to a tightness in global supply chain. Third, we converted the sales into cash, delivering $1.1 billion of operating cash flow, our second consecutive quarter delivering more than $1 billion in cash. And fourth, we increased cash returns to shareholders in the fourth quarter as visibility to improving demand increased. 
Now let me go into more details on the fourth quarter and full year performance. Fourth quarter revenues were $5.8 billion, an increase of 5% from a year ago and snapping a 5-quarter run of declining sales. While the origins and depths of each of the downturns in the past 20 years have varied, each one has yielded negative sales growth for Cummins of between 4 and 6 quarters. Sales in North America were flat and international revenues increased 12%. Currency movements in aggregate had a minimal impact on revenues in the fourth quarter. EBITDA was 100 -- $837 million or 14.4% of sales compared to $682 million or 12.2% of sales a year ago. EBITDA dollars increased by $155 million with the positive impact of higher sales, the benefits of restructuring and lower variable compensation expense more than offset higher product coverage costs and additional supply chain costs. 
Fourth quarter EBITDA included $36 million of expenses associated with the reorganization activities and facility closures primarily driven by transformation initiatives in our distribution business. That 60 -- $36 million was equally split between gross margin and our operating expenses. Gross margin of $1.4 billion or 23.3% of sales increased by $48 million, but decreased as a percent of sales by 20 basis points year-over-year. Higher product coverage expense and additional costs associated in meeting rising demand more than offset the positive impact of higher volumes and the benefits of restructuring, leading to a slight reduction in gross margin as a percent of sales. 
Combination of a sharp recovery in demand in nearly all of our end markets and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have led to tightness in global supply chains. We leveraged our global footprint to respond to the rapid increase in demand, but did incur additional freight and labor costs in doing so, which reduced fourth quarter margins by approximately 60 basis points. We anticipate that these elevated costs will continue through the first half of 2021 and have incorporated them into the midpoint of our guidance for this year. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $56 million or 9% due to the benefits of restructuring, reduced discretionary expenses and lower variable compensation. Research expenses decreased by $16 million or 6% from a year ago. Joint venture income increased by $36 million primarily due to continued strong demand for trucks in China, which we converted into earnings growth and higher profits in our India operations. Other income of $24 million increased by $4 million from a year ago. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $501 million or $3.36 per diluted share compared to $390 million or $2.56 from a year ago. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.7%. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $1.1 billion, $304 million higher than the fourth quarter last year. Higher earnings and lower working capital contributed to the strong cash generation. 
Now I'll move to the full year 2020 commentary. Revenues were $19.8 billion, a decrease of 16% or $3.8 billion from a year ago, the largest dollar decline in sales in company history. Sales in North America decreased 21% and international revenues decreased 7%. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues by 1%. EBITDA was $3.1 billion or 15.7% of sales for 2020 compared to $3.7 billion or 15.8% of sales a year ago. The benefits of restructuring, lower compensation expenses due to temporary salary reductions, lower variable pay and record joint venture performance in China were more than offset by the impact of lower volumes. The record performance in China is remarkable when considering the COVID related restrictions faced by our people in operations in the first quarter last year and throughout much of the remainder of last year. 
Net earnings were $1.8 billion or $12.01 per diluted share. This compares to $2.4 billion or $15.05 per diluted share a year ago. Importantly, our results in 2020 extended our track record of raising performance over successive cycles with earnings per share 46% higher than we delivered in the prior downturn of 2016. Full year cash from operations was an inflow of $2.7 billion, our second highest year. The solid profitability and lower working capital in the second half of the year contributed to the strong cash generation. 
Capital expenditures in 2020 were $528 million, down $172 million from 2019 as we reprioritized and reduced our plans in response to the pandemic induced global economic contraction. We returned $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders or 52% of operating cash flow in the form of share repurchases and dividends in 2021. We repurchased 3.9 million shares throughout the year at an average price of $164. After pausing share repurchases at the end of the first quarter in the face of unprecedented uncertainty, we resumed repurchases in the fourth quarter. In doing so, we completed the ninth share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors and began repurchasing under our tenth program. In October, we raised our quarterly cash dividend by 3% as visibility to improving demand increased. 
Moving on to the operating segments. I will summarize our 2020 results and provide our current forecast for 2021. For the Engine segment, 2020 revenues decreased 20% from a year ago while EBITDA increased from 14.6% to 15.4% of sales. In 2021, we expect revenues to grow between 10% and 14%, with this increase primarily driven by higher truck production in North America and stronger aftermarket revenues also in North America. 2021 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 14% to 15% compared to 15.4% of sales in 2020. The benefits of higher volumes are expected to be more than offset by lower joint venture income, which I'll comment more a little later, and an increase in product coverage costs associated with new product launches. 
In the Distribution segment, revenues decreased 12% from a year ago to $7.1 billion. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 9.3% compared to 8.6% a year ago. We expect 2021 Distribution revenues to grow between 6% and 10% compared to 2020, with this increase primarily driven by stronger aftermarket activity in North America. EBITDA margins are expected to be between 9.6% and 10.6%, up from 9.3% in 2020, as we continue to realize the benefits of our North American transformation work and other improvement actions in international markets. 
Components segment revenue declined 13% in 2020, while EBITDA decreased from 16.2% of sales to 16%. This year, we expect revenues to increase 9% to 13% primarily due to higher industry truck production in North America and incremental revenues from new products in China or in India following the implementation of National Standard VI and Bharat Stage VI emissions regulation. EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 14.4% to 15.4% of sales compared to 16% in 2020 primarily due to lower joint venture income in China and launch costs associated with some of our new NS VI products in China. In the Power Systems segment, revenues decreased 19% in 2020 and EBITDA declined from 11.7% to 9.4% of sales. In 2021, we expect revenues to increase between 7% and 11% primarily due to higher demand for mining engines and power generation equipment. 
EBITDA is projected to be between 10.1% and 11.1% of sales, up from 9.4% in 2020 primarily due to the benefits of higher volumes. In the New Power segment, revenues increased $72 million in 2020 and our operating loss was $172 million. In 2021, we anticipate revenues between $110 million and $130 million. Net expense is projected to be between $190 million and $200 million -- $210 million as we continue to make targeted investments in our technology portfolio consistent with the projections we made at our Hydrogen Day. 
As Tom mentioned, we are projecting 2021 company revenues to be up between 8% and 12%. The company EBIT (sic) [ EBITDA ] margins expected to be in the range of 15% to 15.5% of sales compared to 15.7% [ in 2020 ]. The benefits of higher volumes are expected to be partially offset by weaker joint venture income and the impact of restoring compensation following temporary salary reductions in 2020. Weaker demand in China following a record year in 2020 and lower earnings in India following tax and other onetime benefits last year are the main drivers of the lower joint venture income. 
As Tom mentioned, our guidance for joint venture income assumes that truck demand in China will decline sharply in the second half of 2021 following the country-wide adoption of National Standard VI emissions regulations. At this time, we have limited visibility to industry demand beyond the fourth -- first quarter, and we'll continue to provide updates in this important market as the year progresses. 
We are predict -- projecting our effective tax rate to be approximately 22.5% in 2021, excluding discrete items. We expect our 2021 capital investments will be in the range of $725 million to $775 million. As we've discussed in prior years, our base case is to return 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. And in years when we expect our cash flow to exceed the needs of our core business, we'll return more. In 2021, we currently plan to return 75% of operating cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
To summarize, we delivered strong results in 2020 in the face of unprecedented challenges, extending our track record of raising performance cycle-over-cycle. The solid financial performance was only made possible by our employees who work tirelessly to support our customers, manage through customer shutdowns and amid significant fluctuations in demand. They managed all of this while adjusting the way they work and maintaining financial discipline throughout. 
As we enter 2021, we are well positioned to capitalize on strengthening markets to deliver another strong year. We will continue to invest in the products and technologies that will fuel profitable growth in the future and return capital to shareholders, while maintaining the flexibility to ensure that we can weather any volatility that may lay ahead. Thank you for your interest today. 
Now let me turn it back to Jack."

It just seems like the number of trucks and excavators being produced, it just seems like a lot for us relative to the economy's ability to absorb it. Again, that's just from history and experience, and we'll see. I mean last year was just an enormous production build. And as Mark said, OEMs are cautious about the same thing, but nobody has a firm grasp on it. And then there's the emissions change in the middle, which also seems like a good impact thing. So we're using our experience and history here to make this call. We did the same thing in 2020 and got it wrong. It ended up being strong all year. So we'll see. But the first half is likely to be good. And then we'll know a lot more as we get through the end of the second quarter about how the second half is going to go.

We are working with all of our suppliers. The supply base is generally tight, not just semiconductors, which has gotten a lot of press. But many of our components are on longer lead times, our suppliers, and we are struggling with absenteeism due to COVID.

The Hydrogen Forward alliance is really just trying to make sure that those of us that are investing in the industry are making it clear to policymakers and other potential participants what the opportunity is with hydrogen. Because I do think, if you just check in with people's imagination about what a low-carbon future can look like, I think everybody from government, regulators to my kids understand what battery cars might mean and all that, and they get it. I think the role that hydrogen is going to play in larger energy use, more energy dense demand, it's just not as clear. And I think we need to be more proactive in helping people understand what it can mean to our entire energy system, and of course, what it can mean to equipment that we might supply. 
So we decided that since a lot of us have been investing a lot of time and energy in that and see the opportunity, we better start telling people about it. So that, of course, includes Biden administration and regulators, but it also includes general public. And I think a bunch of industry participants or people who could be participants, understanding what investments might make sense. That's the goal of that initiative. And I agree with exactly what you said that Europe has moved much faster to understand the role that hydrogen can play both in energy storage, cleaning up a high carbon industries, steel making and others as well as potentially in transportation like trucks and trains. And I think the U.S. really does lag there. And part of it is, what I said, is just the understanding of regulators and others is not as good. 
But part of it is also because we kind of went into a different phase, I guess, over the last 5 -- 4 or 5 years where we weren't really doing much for energy planning. I see that changing. We've already had several conversations with members of the Biden administration or transition people about trying to put together a more comprehensive energy strategy that -- for a low-carbon future. So I'm optimistic that not only will we have a more comprehensive plan, but that hydrogen will play a role in it. And we're trying, of course, to impact that. We do believe that for the kind of commercial industrial applications that we are involved with anyway, that hydrogen-based technologies, can have a big role, so -- which is why we're investing in it."

So can you just kind of highlight for us where the investment is going? And I guess, at the end of that, are you kind of looking for R&D to get back to the 2019 level? Are we looking for a step-up in R&D here?"

As we talked about, maybe it was last year -- beginning of last year, we expected R&D to -- over time, to increase some over what we were experiencing when we really just had one technology to invest in. So as a percent of sales, we expect to continue to drive up R&D to some degree because we just -- now we're investing both for a low carbon future and the existing products at the same time. And so there are significant investments for both low emissions diesel products across the world. Those are in components and in engines. 
We've now got new regulations in California to meet, plus we've got all those New Power technologies. So we have a lot to invest in. So you should expect R&D costs to come back to normal after 2020. And in fact, to continue to grow as a percent of sales. Although, again, some are shown in the new power business, some in the engine business. So they're mixed around. But as a total matter, we are investing more in R&D."

And I've been thinking that the year it has -- that they need to make decisions was the year I'm in for the last several years. It's a complicated conversation for all involved, both because there's a lot of strategic choices for the customer about where they want to invest and where they don't. There's employees and facilities and other decisions to make. So it's a complicated set of decisions. We are talking to a number of customers and do expect some of them to choose to invest in other technologies other than diesel in the coming years. 
And so -- and we think we're positioned well. We'll see. But we think we're positioned well to win some of that business, but we are continuing those conversations. And again, I'm -- I expect some more to come this year, but than I expected more last year, too. So we'll just see where it goes. And -- but we are having conversations with lots of people.

And of course, we're all interested in this question because I think you know, our strategy as a supplier to the industry is to maintain leadership irrespective of technology. And we're investing in the key technologies that we think take us from diesel today through hybrid, through other fuels, all the way up to low and 0 carbon -- tailpipe carbon technologies. And our intent is to invest in the technologies and with the customers that we think are going to win. So we end up -- we're leading today, and we end up leading then, in those new technologies. There's a lot to play for in that, but that's what we're -- that's our strategy. That's what we're aiming for. 
And the challenge now on the BEV, or battery electric vehicle, or even fuel cell technologies is that the -- they're not in the money in trucks. So when you try to put a truck into production or into operation, you're going to be out of the money at the start. And so they're mostly regulatory driven or some other subsidy driven, which means that it's not really a straight technology and performance kind of discussion. And so right now, market share is bouncing all over the place and -- because there's a lot of different players that can offer a system. That system is unlikely to be competitive long run. And even the systems we offer are not -- do not return if you compare them to a diesel system today. 
So market share is really, really difficult to say right now because the basis of competition is not technology and performance and cost. It's a whole bunch of other things. But that said, we are intending to win as many partners and as many products as we can, so we can get, a, practice and learning on the technology; and b, help customers understand how they might be able to turn these technologies into winners over time. So we are competing, don't get me wrong, but it's just the basis of competition is not the normal performance cost trade-off we're used to with diesel."

But even if you exclude the JV income from both years, the implied incrementals are only 17%. So that's about $150 million to $250 million of higher cost than you would normally expect, right? Meaning, instead of 17% incremental as you would think 25% to 30%. But when you said 60 bps, I think, Mark, you mentioned it was 60 bps of a drag expected for the next 2 quarters, 150 to 250, call it 200 midpoint. That's like a full 100 basis points of drag. So can you help us understand how do we bridge that? Can you talk about some costs that you already know can be quantified? 
And then I have a quick question on the JV income related to margins. China, how big of the decline do you expect from the total company JV income going down about $125 million year-over-year? How much do you expect that to be from China? Because China was about $215 million last year. I'm just curious how much of the total $125 million do you think is from the JVs in China declining."

Before I go through the summary of our fourth quarter and full year results, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank our employees for the sacrifices they've made over the course of 2020. In the second quarter, we faced the most severe decline in quarterly sales in our history, followed by a rapid recovery in demand and supported by a supply chain that was severely impacted by the pandemic. Our employees have worked tirelessly to navigate the many challenges caused by COVID-19 across the globe in order to support our customers and operate with financial discipline. I can't thank them enough for their commitment, their agility and their resilience. 
Now I'll summarize our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2021. Mark will then take you through more details of both our fourth quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $119 million pretax or $90 million after tax. In order to provide clarity on operational performance, I'm excluding any references to those charges from my comments. 
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $5.8 billion, an increase of 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 driven primarily by increased demand in Chinese truck and construction markets. EBITDA was $837 million or 14.4% compared to $682 million or 12.2% a year ago. EBITDA percent increased due to higher revenue, stronger joint venture income and benefits from restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2019 partially offset by higher product coverage costs. Fourth quarter EBITDA included $36 million of reorganization and facility closure costs associated with actions taken to improve future performance primarily in our distribution business. 
For the full year, Cummins sales were $19.8 billion, down 16% year-over-year. Our EBITDA margins were $3.1 billion or 15.7% of sales compared to $3.7 billion or 15.8% of sales in 2019. In our Engine business, sales decreased by 20% in 2020. Lower demand in most of our major regions and markets was partially offset by record levels of demand in the on-highway and construction segment in China. EBITDA was 15.4% compared to 14.6% in 2019 as the benefits of higher joint venture income, restructuring and temporary salary reductions more than offset the impact of lower volumes. 
Sales for our distribution business decreased by 12% in 2020 driven by lower demand for engines and power generation equipment in addition to lower utilization of our products across many of our regions, driving lower aftermarket demand. Full year EBITDA increased to 9.3% compared to 8.6% in 2019 driven by the realization of benefits of our transformation activities, especially in North America and other cost reduction actions. 
Full year revenues for the Components segment declined by 13% due to lower truck production in North America and Europe. This more than offset increases in revenue associated with new products designed to meet Bharat Stage VI emissions regulations in India and record levels of truck demand in China. EBITDA was 16.0% compared to 16.2% in 2019. The decrease in EBITDA percent was primarily due to lower volumes, which more than offset the benefits of restructuring actions, temporary salary reductions and lower warranty expense. 
Power Systems sales decreased by 19% in 2020. Sales of our power generation equipment declined by 14% as lower demand for standby power generation equipment in North America, India and Asia more than offset continued strong demand in data center markets, especially in China. Demand for engines and industrial applications declined by 26% due to lower demand in oil and gas and mining markets. EBITDA was 9.4% compared to 11.7% in 2019. The decrease in EBITDA was primarily driven by lower volumes, which more than offset the benefits of prior restructuring actions and temporary salary reductions. 
In our New Power business, revenues increased by 89% to $72 million primarily driven by electrolyzer demand. Full year New Power EBITDA was a loss of $172 million, in line with our forecast, as we continued to invest in new products and technologies ahead of widespread market adoption. 
And before I move on to some of our key markets, I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on the progress we made in New Power in 2020. First, we delivered a 20-megawatt PEM electrolyzer system to generate green hydrogen in Becancour, Quebec, making it the largest operation of its kind in the world. The Cummins electrolyzer system is installed on an Air Liquide hydrogen production facility and began commercial operation late last year. The Cummins PEM electrolyzer can produce over 3,000 tons of hydrogen annually using hydropower. In addition to the Becancour installation, we delivered 4 megawatts of electrolyzers to 9 additional customers in 2020. 
We provided fuel cell modules to ASKO, Norway's largest grocery wholesaler, that were integrated into 4 Scania trucks. The fuel cell electric truck pilot is the first of its kind as ASKO aims to reduce its energy use by 20% and ultimately become a self-sufficient provider of clean energy using 100% renewable fuel. Cummins also supplied fuel cells for FAUN, a leader in waste collection vehicles and sweepers in Europe for their electric refuse truck program. Cummins is also the largest supplier of fuel cells for the rail industry. And we are using experience from rail applications in our design for other heavy-duty transportation applications to provide best-in-class solutions. 
In the battery electric market, we delivered 147 fully electric powertrains to BlueBird in 2020 for use in the school bus market and 19 powertrains to GILLIG for use in the transit bus market. Our products are now powering over 250 school buses, which are actively in service today in addition to transit buses operating in municipalities around North America. Finally, we formed the NPROXX joint venture in 2020 to provide customers with high-pressure tank and storage solutions in hydrogen and natural gas markets. 
We have a strong portfolio of distinctive platforms and are continuing to invest in key technology areas for the future. We are targeting our focus and investment at the markets where commercial opportunities exist today or will emerge in the near or medium term. The experience we are gaining in the field is providing us opportunities to continuously improve our products and leverage prior investments into new applications. In addition to the technical experience we are accumulating, our sales and service channel, customer relationships and global footprint will position us well when broader commercialization of fuel cell electric powertrains and battery electric powertrains take place. 
Now I will comment on some of our key markets in 2020, starting with North America, and then I'll comment on some of our largest international markets. Our revenues in North America decreased 21% in 2020 primarily due to lower demand across our segments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industrial production of heavy-duty trucks declined to 187,000 units, a decrease of 39% from 2019 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales declined to 63,000, a decrease of 36% from 2019. We began shipments of our X12 engine to Freightliner for use in their Cascadia day and sleeper cab models in 2020. 
In addition to sales in various location -- applications, our entry into the regional haul market with the low weight X12 engine will further support our leading market share in this segment. The market size for medium-duty trucks was 101,000 units in 2020, a decline of 28% from 2019 levels, while our unit sales were 78,000, a decline of 32% from 2019. We shipped 125,000 engines to Chrysler for use in their RAM pickups in 2020, a decline of 14% from 2019 levels. 
Engine sales to construction customers in North America decreased by 42% as nonresidential construction spending decline and rental companies cut capital spending. Engine shipments to high horsepower markets in North America decreased by 11% from last year, with lower demand from oil and gas and mining segments partially offset by increased shipments to marine and defense customers. Power generation revenues decreased by 13% year-over-year driven by lower demand for standby applications resulting from lower nonresidential construction spending. 
Our international revenues declined 7% in 2020, with weaker demand in most markets more than offsetting a record year in China. Full year revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $6.9 billion, up 25%. The increased revenue was driven by record demand in the truck, construction and data center markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was 1.8 million units, an increase of 35% driven by increased incentives to scrap older trucks and the increase in government stimulus following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Our units sold, including joint ventures, were 286,000, an increase of 47%. 
The light-duty truck market in China increased 17% from 2019 levels to 2.2 million units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 189,000 units, an increase of 24%. Industry demand for excavators set another record of 328,000 units in 2020, an increase of 39% from 2019 levels. Our units sold were 53,000 units, an increase of 58% as our domestic partners gained market share. 
In our Power Systems markets, demand for power generation equipment in China increased 8% compared to 2019 driven by growth in key markets such as data center, infrastructure and health care. Industrial engine sales declined 34% from 2019 levels primarily driven by weakness in oil and gas and mining markets. 
Full year revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, down 26%. Industry truck production declined by 54% in 2020. Demand for construction equipment dropped 28%. And power generation revenue declined 40% in 2020. Our components business was the one major bright spot, with revenue up 17% as a result of new products designed to meet both the Bharat Stage VI emissions regulations introduced in April in addition to new customer wins. In Brazil, our revenues declined 11% by weak -- driven by weaker demand in most end markets. 
Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2021 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2021 to increase 8% to 12% compared to 2020 driven by an increase in heavy-duty and medium-duty truck production in North America, Europe and India, offset by China, where we expect demand to moderate after a record year in 2020 particular in the second half of the year. We expect demand for construction equipment to increase in North America and Europe and decline in China from record levels experienced last year. We are forecasting higher demand in global mining, oil and gas and power generation markets and expect aftermarket revenues to increase by 10% compared with 2020. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 245,000 to 265,000 units in 2021, a 30% to 40% increase year-over-year. In the medium-duty truck market, we expect the market size to be 120,000 to 130,000 units, a 20% to 30% increase from last year. 
This year, we will begin selling engines to Isuzu for use in the medium-duty truck markets. We have been working with Isuzu on multiple collaboration initiatives since 2019, including the delivery of next-generation low-emission products and are excited to take our partnership to the next level. We have delivered some initial units which are being incorporated into vehicles in North America now and plan to begin serial production in the second quarter of 2021. 
In 2023, we expect to supply engines to Isuzu for truck applications in Japan and Southeast Asia. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be up 5% compared to 2020. In China, we expect domestic -- we are projecting domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be down 20% in 2021. We currently project a 30% reduction in heavy- and medium-duty truck demand and a 5% to 10% reduction in demand for the light-duty truck market. We expect demand to be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, particularly in the first quarter, and primarily driven by prebuy ahead of the broad NS VI implementation in July and OEM efforts to increase inventory levels to mitigate supply chain constraints. 
Industry volumes of NS VI product will increase in 2021 as the new regulations are implemented more broadly across China from July onwards. We first launched engines to meet standards similar to NS VI in the United States 10 years ago and have leveraged our knowledge in powertrain technologies to develop a range of products for Chinese markets that we expect to be well received by end users. Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 20% from last year's record levels. We also expect demand the first half of the year for excavators to be stronger than the second half driven by infrastructure projects and a strong housing market, which is expected to decline in the second half of the year as the government stimulus tightens. 
In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 25% in 2020. We expect industry demand for trucks to increase 20% in 2021. The new emission standards in China and India will result in significantly more content for each Cummins engine we sell. For example, we expect to increase sales of after-treatment systems by over $250 million in 2021. We project our major global high horsepower markets will improve in 2021. Sales of mining engines are expected to increase by 10% to 15% in 2021 with greater demand following a recovery in commodity prices. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 55% in 2021, albeit off a very low base primarily driven by increased fracking activity in North America. Demand in global power generation markets is expected to increase 5% driven by continued growth in data center markets and strong RV market in North America. 
In New Power, we expect full year sales to be between $110 million and $130 million. We have a backlog of approximately 65 megawatts in electrolyzers, which we expect to be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. We will continue to deliver fuel cell systems for use in the European rail market. We also expect to provide modest volumes of fuel cells for truck applications in 2021 as some fleets try out the new technology. 
We are continually innovating across our broad portfolio of power solutions from diesel and natural gas to fuel cells, hybrid and fully electric options. We plan to provide our customers with the right technical solution for their application at the right time and to continue to be a leader in power for commercial and industrial equipment. While current indicators point to improving demand in a number of key regions and markets in 2021, significant uncertainty remains, requiring continued strong focus on managing costs and cash flow as our markets continue to recover around the world. We are still operating under a pandemic with extreme safety measures in place and our suppliers and customers are doing the same. This is presenting challenges to global supply chains as our industry responds to rising demand across multiple end markets. 
Having effectively managed through an extremely challenging 2020, Cummins is in a strong position to keep investing in future growth and continuing to return cash to shareholders. In summary, we expect full year sales growth of 8% to 12% and EBITDA to be in the range of 15% to 15.5% of sales. The benefits of higher volumes and ongoing cost reduction activities will be partially offset by lower joint venture earnings, investment in new products and some additional costs with supply chain inefficiencies and the year-over-year impact of restoring full salaries following temporary salary reductions between April and September last year. 
Now let me turn it over to Mark, who will focus on our financial results and discuss them in more detail. Mark?"
265253,700213775,2238541,"Cummins Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Cummins Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone.

As a reminder, in the fourth quarter last year, we -- 2019, we recorded r",1870,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2020 before moving to our outlook for 2021. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter last year, we -- 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $119 million pretax or $90 million after tax. I'm going to exclude any references to those charges in my subsequent comments to provide clarity and consistency on the underlying operating performance. 
There were 4 key highlights this quarter. First, the pace at which customer demand for Cummins products rebounded and our employees' agility in responding to the higher customer orders. Second, we delivered solid profitability, especially when we peel back the expenses associated with cost reduction activities and some elevated costs tied to a tightness in global supply chain. Third, we converted the sales into cash, delivering $1.1 billion of operating cash flow, our second consecutive quarter delivering more than $1 billion in cash. And fourth, we increased cash returns to shareholders in the fourth quarter as visibility to improving demand increased. 
Now let me go into more details on the fourth quarter and full year performance. Fourth quarter revenues were $5.8 billion, an increase of 5% from a year ago and snapping a 5-quarter run of declining sales. While the origins and depths of each of the downturns in the past 20 years have varied, each one has yielded negative sales growth for Cummins of between 4 and 6 quarters. Sales in North America were flat and international revenues increased 12%. Currency movements in aggregate had a minimal impact on revenues in the fourth quarter. EBITDA was 100 -- $837 million or 14.4% of sales compared to $682 million or 12.2% of sales a year ago. EBITDA dollars increased by $155 million with the positive impact of higher sales, the benefits of restructuring and lower variable compensation expense more than offset higher product coverage costs and additional supply chain costs. 
Fourth quarter EBITDA included $36 million of expenses associated with the reorganization activities and facility closures primarily driven by transformation initiatives in our distribution business. That 60 -- $36 million was equally split between gross margin and our operating expenses. Gross margin of $1.4 billion or 23.3% of sales increased by $48 million, but decreased as a percent of sales by 20 basis points year-over-year. Higher product coverage expense and additional costs associated in meeting rising demand more than offset the positive impact of higher volumes and the benefits of restructuring, leading to a slight reduction in gross margin as a percent of sales. 
Combination of a sharp recovery in demand in nearly all of our end markets and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have led to tightness in global supply chains. We leveraged our global footprint to respond to the rapid increase in demand, but did incur additional freight and labor costs in doing so, which reduced fourth quarter margins by approximately 60 basis points. We anticipate that these elevated costs will continue through the first half of 2021 and have incorporated them into the midpoint of our guidance for this year. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $56 million or 9% due to the benefits of restructuring, reduced discretionary expenses and lower variable compensation. Research expenses decreased by $16 million or 6% from a year ago. Joint venture income increased by $36 million primarily due to continued strong demand for trucks in China, which we converted into earnings growth and higher profits in our India operations. Other income of $24 million increased by $4 million from a year ago. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $501 million or $3.36 per diluted share compared to $390 million or $2.56 from a year ago. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.7%. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $1.1 billion, $304 million higher than the fourth quarter last year. Higher earnings and lower working capital contributed to the strong cash generation. 
Now I'll move to the full year 2020 commentary. Revenues were $19.8 billion, a decrease of 16% or $3.8 billion from a year ago, the largest dollar decline in sales in company history. Sales in North America decreased 21% and international revenues decreased 7%. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues by 1%. EBITDA was $3.1 billion or 15.7% of sales for 2020 compared to $3.7 billion or 15.8% of sales a year ago. The benefits of restructuring, lower compensation expenses due to temporary salary reductions, lower variable pay and record joint venture performance in China were more than offset by the impact of lower volumes. The record performance in China is remarkable when considering the COVID related restrictions faced by our people in operations in the first quarter last year and throughout much of the remainder of last year. 
Net earnings were $1.8 billion or $12.01 per diluted share. This compares to $2.4 billion or $15.05 per diluted share a year ago. Importantly, our results in 2020 extended our track record of raising performance over successive cycles with earnings per share 46% higher than we delivered in the prior downturn of 2016. Full year cash from operations was an inflow of $2.7 billion, our second highest year. The solid profitability and lower working capital in the second half of the year contributed to the strong cash generation. 
Capital expenditures in 2020 were $528 million, down $172 million from 2019 as we reprioritized and reduced our plans in response to the pandemic induced global economic contraction. We returned $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders or 52% of operating cash flow in the form of share repurchases and dividends in 2021. We repurchased 3.9 million shares throughout the year at an average price of $164. After pausing share repurchases at the end of the first quarter in the face of unprecedented uncertainty, we resumed repurchases in the fourth quarter. In doing so, we completed the ninth share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors and began repurchasing under our tenth program. In October, we raised our quarterly cash dividend by 3% as visibility to improving demand increased. 
Moving on to the operating segments. I will summarize our 2020 results and provide our current forecast for 2021. For the Engine segment, 2020 revenues decreased 20% from a year ago while EBITDA increased from 14.6% to 15.4% of sales. In 2021, we expect revenues to grow between 10% and 14%, with this increase primarily driven by higher truck production in North America and stronger aftermarket revenues also in North America. 2021 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 14% to 15% compared to 15.4% of sales in 2020. The benefits of higher volumes are expected to be more than offset by lower joint venture income, which I'll comment more a little later, and an increase in product coverage costs associated with new product launches. 
In the Distribution segment, revenues decreased 12% from a year ago to $7.1 billion. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 9.3% compared to 8.6% a year ago. We expect 2021 Distribution revenues to grow between 6% and 10% compared to 2020, with this increase primarily driven by stronger aftermarket activity in North America. EBITDA margins are expected to be between 9.6% and 10.6%, up from 9.3% in 2020, as we continue to realize the benefits of our North American transformation work and other improvement actions in international markets. 
Components segment revenue declined 13% in 2020, while EBITDA decreased from 16.2% of sales to 16%. This year, we expect revenues to increase 9% to 13% primarily due to higher industry truck production in North America and incremental revenues from new products in China or in India following the implementation of National Standard VI and Bharat Stage VI emissions regulation. EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 14.4% to 15.4% of sales compared to 16% in 2020 primarily due to lower joint venture income in China and launch costs associated with some of our new NS VI products in China. In the Power Systems segment, revenues decreased 19% in 2020 and EBITDA declined from 11.7% to 9.4% of sales. In 2021, we expect revenues to increase between 7% and 11% primarily due to higher demand for mining engines and power generation equipment. 
EBITDA is projected to be between 10.1% and 11.1% of sales, up from 9.4% in 2020 primarily due to the benefits of higher volumes. In the New Power segment, revenues increased $72 million in 2020 and our operating loss was $172 million. In 2021, we anticipate revenues between $110 million and $130 million. Net expense is projected to be between $190 million and $200 million -- $210 million as we continue to make targeted investments in our technology portfolio consistent with the projections we made at our Hydrogen Day. 
As Tom mentioned, we are projecting 2021 company revenues to be up between 8% and 12%. The company EBIT (sic) [ EBITDA ] margins expected to be in the range of 15% to 15.5% of sales compared to 15.7% [ in 2020 ]. The benefits of higher volumes are expected to be partially offset by weaker joint venture income and the impact of restoring compensation following temporary salary reductions in 2020. Weaker demand in China following a record year in 2020 and lower earnings in India following tax and other onetime benefits last year are the main drivers of the lower joint venture income. 
As Tom mentioned, our guidance for joint venture income assumes that truck demand in China will decline sharply in the second half of 2021 following the country-wide adoption of National Standard VI emissions regulations. At this time, we have limited visibility to industry demand beyond the fourth -- first quarter, and we'll continue to provide updates in this important market as the year progresses. 
We are predict -- projecting our effective tax rate to be approximately 22.5% in 2021, excluding discrete items. We expect our 2021 capital investments will be in the range of $725 million to $775 million. As we've discussed in prior years, our base case is to return 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. And in years when we expect our cash flow to exceed the needs of our core business, we'll return more. In 2021, we currently plan to return 75% of operating cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
To summarize, we delivered strong results in 2020 in the face of unprecedented challenges, extending our track record of raising performance cycle-over-cycle. The solid financial performance was only made possible by our employees who work tirelessly to support our customers, manage through customer shutdowns and amid significant fluctuations in demand. They managed all of this while adjusting the way they work and maintaining financial discipline throughout. 
As we enter 2021, we are well positioned to capitalize on strengthening markets to deliver another strong year. We will continue to invest in the products and technologies that will fuel profitable growth in the future and return capital to shareholders, while maintaining the flexibility to ensure that we can weather any volatility that may lay ahead. Thank you for your interest today. 
Now let me turn it back to Jack."

It just seems like the number of trucks and excavators being produced, it just seems like a lot for us relative to the economy's ability to absorb it. Again, that's just from history and experience, and we'll see. I mean last year was just an enormous production build. And as Mark said, OEMs are cautious about the same thing, but nobody has a firm grasp on it. And then there's the emissions change in the middle, which also seems like a good impact thing. So we're using our experience and history here to make this call. We did the same thing in 2020 and got it wrong. It ended up being strong all year. So we'll see. But the first half is likely to be good. And then we'll know a lot more as we get through the end of the second quarter about how the second half is going to go.

We are working with all of our suppliers. The supply base is generally tight, not just semiconductors, which has gotten a lot of press. But many of our components are on longer lead times, our suppliers, and we are struggling with absenteeism due to COVID. And we are working very closely with our customers to remain connected and to continue to supply them as best we can. We are working through all of these issues on a daily basis.

The Hydrogen Forward alliance is really just trying to make sure that those of us that are investing in the industry are making it clear to policymakers and other potential participants what the opportunity",425,"Thanks for that, Ann, I appreciate the question. The Hydrogen Forward alliance is really just trying to make sure that those of us that are investing in the industry are making it clear to policymakers and other potential participants what the opportunity is with hydrogen. Because I do think, if you just check in with people's imagination about what a low-carbon future can look like, I think everybody from government, regulators to my kids understand what battery cars might mean and all that, and they get it. I think the role that hydrogen is going to play in larger energy use, more energy dense demand, it's just not as clear. And I think we need to be more proactive in helping people understand what it can mean to our entire energy system, and of course, what it can mean to equipment that we might supply. 
So we decided that since a lot of us have been investing a lot of time and energy in that and see the opportunity, we better start telling people about it. So that, of course, includes Biden administration and regulators, but it also includes general public. And I think a bunch of industry participants or people who could be participants, understanding what investments might make sense. That's the goal of that initiative. And I agree with exactly what you said that Europe has moved much faster to understand the role that hydrogen can play both in energy storage, cleaning up a high carbon industries, steel making and others as well as potentially in transportation like trucks and trains. And I think the U.S. really does lag there. And part of it is, what I said, is just the understanding of regulators and others is not as good. 
But part of it is also because we kind of went into a different phase, I guess, over the last 5 -- 4 or 5 years where we weren't really doing much for energy planning. I see that changing. We've already had several conversations with members of the Biden administration or transition people about trying to put together a more comprehensive energy strategy that -- for a low-carbon future. So I'm optimistic that not only will we have a more comprehensive plan, but that hydrogen will play a role in it. And we're trying, of course, to impact that. We do believe that for the kind of commercial industrial applications that we are involved with anyway, that hydrogen-based technologies, can have a big role, so -- which is why we're investing in it."

And so there are significant investments for both low emissions diesel products across the world. Those are in components and in engines. 
We've now got new regulations in California to meet, plus we've got all those New Power technologies. So we have a lot to invest in. So you should expect R&D costs to come back to normal after 2020.

And of course, we're all interested in this question because I think you know, our strategy as a supplier to the industry is to maintain leadership irrespective of technology. And we're investing in the key technologies that we think take us from diesel today through hybrid, through other fuels, all the way up to low and 0 carbon -- tailpipe carbon technologies. And our intent is to invest in the technologies and with the customers that we think are going to win. So we end up -- we're leading today, and we end up leading then, in those new technologies. There's a lot to play for in that, but that's what we're -- that's our strategy. That's what we're aiming for. 
And the challenge now on the BEV, or battery electric vehicle, or even fuel cell technologies is that the -- they're not in the money in trucks. So when you try to put a truck into production or into operation, you're going to be out of the money at the start. And so they're mostly regulatory driven or some other subsidy driven, which means that it's not really a straight technology and performance kind of discussion. And so right now, market share is bouncing all over the place and -- because there's a lot of different players that can offer a system. That system is unlikely to be competitive long run. And even the systems we offer are not -- do not return if you compare them to a diesel system today. 
So market share is really, really difficult to say right now because the basis of competition is not technology and performance and cost. It's a whole bunch of other things. But that said, we are intending to win as many partners and as many products as we can, so we can get, a, practice and learning on the technology; and b, help customers understand how they might be able to turn these technologies into winners over time. So we are competing, don't get me wrong, but it's just the basis of competition is not the normal performance cost trade-off we're used to with diesel."

But even if you exclude the JV income from both years, the implied incrementals are only 17%. So that's about $150 million to $250 million of higher cost than you would normally expect, right?

But when you said 60 bps, I think, Mark, you mentioned it was 60 bps of a drag expected for the next 2 quarters, 150 to 250, call it 200 midpoint. That's like a full 100 basis points of drag. So can you help us understand how do we bridge that? Can you talk about some costs that you already know can be quantified? 
And then I have a quick question on the JV income related to margins. China, how big of the decline do you expect from the total company JV income going down about $125 million year-over-year? How much do you expect that to be from China? Because China was about $215 million last year. I'm just curious how much of the total $125 million do you think is from the JVs in China declining."

James is now working in the engine business and strategy, and I know he'll do a terrific job. So thanks to James. 
Before I go through the summary of our fourth quarter and full year results, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank our employees for the sacrifices they've made over the course of 2020. In the second quarter, we faced the most severe decline in quarterly sales in our history, followed by a rapid recovery in demand and supported by a supply chain that was severely impacted by the pandemic. Our employees have worked tirelessly to navigate the many challenges caused by COVID-19 across the globe in order to support our customers and operate with financial discipline. I can't thank them enough for their commitment, their agility and their resilience. 
Now I'll summarize our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2021. Mark will then take you through more details of both our fourth quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $119 million pretax or $90 million after tax. In order to provide clarity on operational performance, I'm excluding any references to those charges from my comments. 
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $5.8 billion, an increase of 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 driven primarily by increased demand in Chinese truck and construction markets. EBITDA was $837 million or 14.4% compared to $682 million or 12.2% a year ago. EBITDA percent increased due to higher revenue, stronger joint venture income and benefits from restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2019 partially offset by higher product coverage costs. Fourth quarter EBITDA included $36 million of reorganization and facility closure costs associated with actions taken to improve future performance primarily in our distribution business. 
For the full year, Cummins sales were $19.8 billion, down 16% year-over-year. Our EBITDA margins were $3.1 billion or 15.7% of sales compared to $3.7 billion or 15.8% of sales in 2019. In our Engine business, sales decreased by 20% in 2020. Lower demand in most of our major regions and markets was partially offset by record levels of demand in the on-highway and construction segment in China. EBITDA was 15.4% compared to 14.6% in 2019 as the benefits of higher joint venture income, restructuring and temporary salary reductions more than offset the impact of lower volumes. 
Sales for our distribution business decreased by 12% in 2020 driven by lower demand for engines and power generation equipment in addition to lower utilization of our products across many of our regions, driving lower aftermarket demand. Full year EBITDA increased to 9.3% compared to 8.6% in 2019 driven by the realization of benefits of our transformation activities, especially in North America and other cost reduction actions. 
Full year revenues for the Components segment declined by 13% due to lower truck production in North America and Europe. This more than offset increases in revenue associated with new products designed to meet Bharat Stage VI emissions regulations in India and record levels of truck demand in China. EBITDA was 16.0% compared to 16.2% in 2019. The decrease in EBITDA percent was primarily due to lower volumes, which more than offset the benefits of restructuring actions, temporary salary reductions and lower warranty expense. 
Power Systems sales decreased by 19% in 2020. Sales of our power generation equipment declined by 14% as lower demand for standby power generation equipment in North America, India and Asia more than offset continued strong demand in data center markets, especially in China. Demand for engines and industrial applications declined by 26% due to lower demand in oil and gas and mining markets. EBITDA was 9.4% compared to 11.7% in 2019. The decrease in EBITDA was primarily driven by lower volumes, which more than offset the benefits of prior restructuring actions and temporary salary reductions. 
In our New Power business, revenues increased by 89% to $72 million primarily driven by electrolyzer demand. Full year New Power EBITDA was a loss of $172 million, in line with our forecast, as we continued to invest in new products and technologies ahead of widespread market adoption. 
And before I move on to some of our key markets, I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on the progress we made in New Power in 2020. First, we delivered a 20-megawatt PEM electrolyzer system to generate green hydrogen in Becancour, Quebec, making it the largest operation of its kind in the world. The Cummins electrolyzer system is installed on an Air Liquide hydrogen production facility and began commercial operation late last year. The Cummins PEM electrolyzer can produce over 3,000 tons of hydrogen annually using hydropower. In addition to the Becancour installation, we delivered 4 megawatts of electrolyzers to 9 additional customers in 2020. 
We provided fuel cell modules to ASKO, Norway's largest grocery wholesaler, that were integrated into 4 Scania trucks. The fuel cell electric truck pilot is the first of its kind as ASKO aims to reduce its energy use by 20% and ultimately become a self-sufficient provider of clean energy using 100% renewable fuel. Cummins also supplied fuel cells for FAUN, a leader in waste collection vehicles and sweepers in Europe for their electric refuse truck program. Cummins is also the largest supplier of fuel cells for the rail industry. And we are using experience from rail applications in our design for other heavy-duty transportation applications to provide best-in-class solutions. 
In the battery electric market, we delivered 147 fully electric powertrains to BlueBird in 2020 for use in the school bus market and 19 powertrains to GILLIG for use in the transit bus market. Our products are now powering over 250 school buses, which are actively in service today in addition to transit buses operating in municipalities around North America. Finally, we formed the NPROXX joint venture in 2020 to provide customers with high-pressure tank and storage solutions in hydrogen and natural gas markets. 
We have a strong portfolio of distinctive platforms and are continuing to invest in key technology areas for the future. We are targeting our focus and investment at the markets where commercial opportunities exist today or will emerge in the near or medium term. The experience we are gaining in the field is providing us opportunities to continuously improve our products and leverage prior investments into new applications. In addition to the technical experience we are accumulating, our sales and service channel, customer relationships and global footprint will position us well when broader commercialization of fuel cell electric powertrains and battery electric powertrains take place. 
Now I will comment on some of our key markets in 2020, starting with North America, and then I'll comment on some of our largest international markets. Our revenues in North America decreased 21% in 2020 primarily due to lower demand across our segments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industrial production of heavy-duty trucks declined to 187,000 units, a decrease of 39% from 2019 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales declined to 63,000, a decrease of 36% from 2019. We began shipments of our X12 engine to Freightliner for use in their Cascadia day and sleeper cab models in 2020. 
In addition to sales in various location -- applications, our entry into the regional haul market with the low weight X12 engine will further support our leading market share in this segment. The market size for medium-duty trucks was 101,000 units in 2020, a decline of 28% from 2019 levels, while our unit sales were 78,000, a decline of 32% from 2019. We shipped 125,000 engines to Chrysler for use in their RAM pickups in 2020, a decline of 14% from 2019 levels. 
Engine sales to construction customers in North America decreased by 42% as nonresidential construction spending decline and rental companies cut capital spending. Engine shipments to high horsepower markets in North America decreased by 11% from last year, with lower demand from oil and gas and mining segments partially offset by increased shipments to marine and defense customers. Power generation revenues decreased by 13% year-over-year driven by lower demand for standby applications resulting from lower nonresidential construction spending. 
Our international revenues declined 7% in 2020, with weaker demand in most markets more than offsetting a record year in China. Full year revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $6.9 billion, up 25%. The increased revenue was driven by record demand in the truck, construction and data center markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was 1.8 million units, an increase of 35% driven by increased incentives to scrap older trucks and the increase in government stimulus following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Our units sold, including joint ventures, were 286,000, an increase of 47%. 
The light-duty truck market in China increased 17% from 2019 levels to 2.2 million units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 189,000 units, an increase of 24%. Industry demand for excavators set another record of 328,000 units in 2020, an increase of 39% from 2019 levels. Our units sold were 53,000 units, an increase of 58% as our domestic partners gained market share. 
In our Power Systems markets, demand for power generation equipment in China increased 8% compared to 2019 driven by growth in key markets such as data center, infrastructure and health care. Industrial engine sales declined 34% from 2019 levels primarily driven by weakness in oil and gas and mining markets. 
Full year revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, down 26%. Industry truck production declined by 54% in 2020. Demand for construction equipment dropped 28%. And power generation revenue declined 40% in 2020. Our components business was the one major bright spot, with revenue up 17% as a result of new products designed to meet both the Bharat Stage VI emissions regulations introduced in April in addition to new customer wins. In Brazil, our revenues declined 11% by weak -- driven by weaker demand in most end markets. 
Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2021 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2021 to increase 8% to 12% compared to 2020 driven by an increase in heavy-duty and medium-duty truck production in North America, Europe and India, offset by China, where we expect demand to moderate after a record year in 2020 particular in the second half of the year. We expect demand for construction equipment to increase in North America and Europe and decline in China from record levels experienced last year. We are forecasting higher demand in global mining, oil and gas and power generation markets and expect aftermarket revenues to increase by 10% compared with 2020. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 245,000 to 265,000 units in 2021, a 30% to 40% increase year-over-year. In the medium-duty truck market, we expect the market size to be 120,000 to 130,000 units, a 20% to 30% increase from last year. 
This year, we will begin selling engines to Isuzu for use in the medium-duty truck markets. We have been working with Isuzu on multiple collaboration initiatives since 2019, including the delivery of next-generation low-emission products and are excited to take our partnership to the next level. We have delivered some initial units which are being incorporated into vehicles in North America now and plan to begin serial production in the second quarter of 2021. 
In 2023, we expect to supply engines to Isuzu for truck applications in Japan and Southeast Asia. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be up 5% compared to 2020. In China, we expect domestic -- we are projecting domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be down 20% in 2021. We currently project a 30% reduction in heavy- and medium-duty truck demand and a 5% to 10% reduction in demand for the light-duty truck market. We expect demand to be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, particularly in the first quarter, and primarily driven by prebuy ahead of the broad NS VI implementation in July and OEM efforts to increase inventory levels to mitigate supply chain constraints. 
Industry volumes of NS VI product will increase in 2021 as the new regulations are implemented more broadly across China from July onwards. We first launched engines to meet standards similar to NS VI in the United States 10 years ago and have leveraged our knowledge in powertrain technologies to develop a range of products for Chinese markets that we expect to be well received by end users. Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 20% from last year's record levels. We also expect demand the first half of the year for excavators to be stronger than the second half driven by infrastructure projects and a strong housing market, which is expected to decline in the second half of the year as the government stimulus tightens. 
In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 25% in 2020. We expect industry demand for trucks to increase 20% in 2021. The new emission standards in China and India will result in significantly more content for each Cummins engine we sell. For example, we expect to increase sales of after-treatment systems by over $250 million in 2021. We project our major global high horsepower markets will improve in 2021. Sales of mining engines are expected to increase by 10% to 15% in 2021 with greater demand following a recovery in commodity prices. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 55% in 2021, albeit off a very low base primarily driven by increased fracking activity in North America. Demand in global power generation markets is expected to increase 5% driven by continued growth in data center markets and strong RV market in North America. 
In New Power, we expect full year sales to be between $110 million and $130 million. We have a backlog of approximately 65 megawatts in electrolyzers, which we expect to be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. We will continue to deliver fuel cell systems for use in the European rail market. We also expect to provide modest volumes of fuel cells for truck applications in 2021 as some fleets try out the new technology. 
We are continually innovating across our broad portfolio of power solutions from diesel and natural gas to fuel cells, hybrid and fully electric options. We plan to provide our customers with the right technical solution for their application at the right time and to continue to be a leader in power for commercial and industrial equipment. While current indicators point to improving demand in a number of key regions and markets in 2021, significant uncertainty remains, requiring continued strong focus on managing costs and cash flow as our markets continue to recover around the world. We are still operating under a pandemic with extreme safety measures in place and our suppliers and customers are doing the same. This is presenting challenges to global supply chains as our industry responds to rising demand across multiple end markets. 
Having effectively managed through an extremely challenging 2020, Cummins is in a strong position to keep investing in future growth and continuing to return cash to shareholders. In summary, we expect full year sales growth of 8% to 12% and EBITDA to be in the range of 15% to 15.5% of sales. The benefits of higher volumes and ongoing cost reduction activities will be partially offset by lower joint venture earnings, investment in new products and some additional costs with supply chain inefficiencies and the year-over-year impact of restoring full salaries following temporary salary reductions between April and September last year. 
Now let me turn it over to Mark, who will focus on our financial results and discuss them in more detail. Mark?"
265253,700213775,2238542,"Cummins Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Cummins Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone.

I'll start with a quick summary of our financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2020 before moving to our outlook for 2021. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter last year, we -- 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $119 million pretax or $90 million after tax. I'm going to exclude any references to those charges in my subsequent comments to provide clarity and consistency on the underlying operating performance. 
There were 4 key highlights this quarter. First, the pace at which customer demand for Cummins products rebounded and our employees' agility in responding to the higher customer orders. Second, we delivered solid profitability, especially when we peel back the expenses associated with cost reduction activities and some elevated costs tied to a tightness in global supply chain. Third, we converted the sales into cash, delivering $1.1 billion of operating cash flow, our second consecutive quarter delivering more than $1 billion in cash. And fourth, we increased cash returns to shareholders in the fourth quarter as visibility to improving demand increased. 
Now let me go into more details on the fourth quarter and full year performance. Fourth quarter revenues were $5.8 billion, an increase of 5% from a year ago and snapping a 5-quarter run of declining sales. While the origins and depths of each of the downturns in the past 20 years have varied, each one has yielded negative sales growth for Cummins of between 4 and 6 quarters. Sales in North America were flat and international revenues increased 12%. Currency movements in aggregate had a minimal impact on revenues in the fourth quarter. EBITDA was 100 -- $837 million or 14.4% of sales compared to $682 million or 12.2% of sales a year ago. EBITDA dollars increased by $155 million with the positive impact of higher sales, the benefits of restructuring and lower variable compensation expense more than offset higher product coverage costs and additional supply chain costs. 
Fourth quarter EBITDA included $36 million of expenses associated with the reorganization activities and facility closures primarily driven by transformation initiatives in our distribution business. That 60 -- $36 million was equally split between gross margin and our operating expenses. Gross margin of $1.4 billion or 23.3% of sales increased by $48 million, but decreased as a percent of sales by 20 basis points year-over-year. Higher product coverage expense and additional costs associated in meeting rising demand more than offset the positive impact of higher volumes and the benefits of restructuring, leading to a slight reduction in gross margin as a percent of sales. 
Combination of a sharp recovery in demand in nearly all of our end markets and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have led to tightness in global supply chains. We leveraged our global footprint to respond to the rapid increase in demand, but did incur additional freight and labor costs in doing so, which reduced fourth quarter margins by approximately 60 basis points. We anticipate that these elevated costs will continue through the first half of 2021 and have incorporated them into the midpoint of our guidance for this year. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $56 million or 9% due to the benefits of restructuring, reduced discretionary expenses and lower variable compensation. Research expenses decreased by $16 million or 6% from a year ago. Joint venture income increased by $36 million primarily due to continued strong demand for trucks in China, which we converted into earnings growth and higher profits in our India operations. Other income of $24 million increased by $4 million from a year ago. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $501 million or $3.36 per diluted share compared to $390 million or $2.56 from a year ago. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.7%. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $1.1 billion, $304 million higher than the fourth quarter last year. Higher earnings and lower working capital contributed to the strong cash generation. 
Now I'll move to the full year 2020 commentary. Revenues were $19.8 billion, a decrease of 16% or $3.8 billion from a year ago, the largest dollar decline in sales in company history. Sales in North America decreased 21% and international revenues decreased 7%. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues by 1%. EBITDA was $3.1 billion or 15.7% of sales for 2020 compared to $3.7 billion or 15.8% of sales a year ago. The benefits of restructuring, lower compensation expenses due to temporary salary reductions, lower variable pay and record joint venture performance in China were more than offset by the impact of lower volumes. The record performance in China is remarkable when considering the COVID related restrictions faced by our people in operations in the first quarter last year and throughout much of the remainder of last year. 
Net earnings were $1.8 billion or $12.01 per diluted share. This compares to $2.4 billion or $15.05 per diluted share a year ago. Importantly, our results in 2020 extended our track record of raising performance over successive cycles with earnings per share 46% higher than we delivered in the prior downturn of 2016. Full year cash from operations was an inflow of $2.7 billion, our second highest year. The solid profitability and lower working capital in the second half of the year contributed to the strong cash generation. 
Capital expenditures in 2020 were $528 million, down $172 million from 2019 as we reprioritized and reduced our plans in response to the pandemic induced global economic contraction. We returned $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders or 52% of operating cash flow in the form of share repurchases and dividends in 2021. We repurchased 3.9 million shares throughout the year at an average price of $164. After pausing share repurchases at the end of the first quarter in the face of unprecedented uncertainty, we resumed repurchases in the fourth quarter. In doing so, we completed the ninth share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors and began repurchasing under our tenth program. In October, we raised our quarterly cash dividend by 3% as visibility to improving demand increased. 
Moving on to the operating segments. I will summarize our 2020 results and provide our current forecast for 2021. For the Engine segment, 2020 revenues decreased 20% from a year ago while EBITDA increased from 14.6% to 15.4% of sales. In 2021, we expect revenues to grow between 10% and 14%, with this increase primarily driven by higher truck production in North America and stronger aftermarket revenues also in North America. 2021 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 14% to 15% compared to 15.4% of sales in 2020. The benefits of higher volumes are expected to be more than offset by lower joint venture income, which I'll comment more a little later, and an increase in product coverage costs associated with new product launches. 
In the Distribution segment, revenues decreased 12% from a year ago to $7.1 billion. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 9.3% compared to 8.6% a year ago. We expect 2021 Distribution revenues to grow between 6% and 10% compared to 2020, with this increase primarily driven by stronger aftermarket activity in North America. EBITDA margins are expected to be between 9.6% and 10.6%, up from 9.3% in 2020, as we continue to realize the benefits of our North American transformation work and other improvement actions in international markets. 
Components segment revenue declined 13% in 2020, while EBITDA decreased from 16.2% of sales to 16%. This year, we expect revenues to increase 9% to 13% primarily due to higher industry truck production in North America and incremental revenues from new products in China or in India following the implementation of National Standard VI and Bharat Stage VI emissions regulation. EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 14.4% to 15.4% of sales compared to 16% in 2020 primarily due to lower joint venture income in China and launch costs associated with some of our new NS VI products in China. In the Power Systems segment, revenues decreased 19% in 2020 and EBITDA declined from 11.7% to 9.4% of sales. In 2021, we expect revenues to increase between 7% and 11% primarily due to higher demand for mining engines and power generation equipment. 
EBITDA is projected to be between 10.1% and 11.1% of sales, up from 9.4% in 2020 primarily due to the benefits of higher volumes. In the New Power segment, revenues increased $72 million in 2020 and our operating loss was $172 million. In 2021, we anticipate revenues between $110 million and $130 million. Net expense is projected to be between $190 million and $200 million -- $210 million as we continue to make targeted investments in our technology portfolio consistent with the projections we made at our Hydrogen Day. 
As Tom mentioned, we are projecting 2021 company revenues to be up between 8% and 12%. The company EBIT (sic) [ EBITDA ] margins expected to be in the range of 15% to 15.5% of sales compared to 15.7% [ in 2020 ]. The benefits of higher volumes are expected to be partially offset by weaker joint venture income and the impact of restoring compensation following temporary salary reductions in 2020. Weaker demand in China following a record year in 2020 and lower earnings in India following tax and other onetime benefits last year are the main drivers of the lower joint venture income. 
As Tom mentioned, our guidance for joint venture income assumes that truck demand in China will decline sharply in the second half of 2021 following the country-wide adoption of National Standard VI emissions regulations. At this time, we have limited visibility to industry demand beyond the fourth -- first quarter, and we'll continue to provide updates in this important market as the year progresses. 
We are predict -- projecting our effective tax rate to be approximately 22.5% in 2021, excluding discrete items. We expect our 2021 capital investments will be in the range of $725 million to $775 million. As we've discussed in prior years, our base case is to return 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. And in years when we expect our cash flow to exceed the needs of our core business, we'll return more. In 2021, we currently plan to return 75% of operating cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
To summarize, we delivered strong results in 2020 in the face of unprecedented challenges, extending our track record of raising performance cycle-over-cycle. The solid financial performance was only made possible by our employees who work tirelessly to support our customers, manage through customer shutdowns and amid significant fluctuations in demand. They managed all of this while adjusting the way they work and maintaining financial discipline throughout. 
As we enter 2021, we are well positioned to capitalize on strengthening markets to deliver another strong year. We will continue to invest in the products and technologies that will fuel profitable growth in the future and return capital to shareholders, while maintaining the flexibility to ensure that we can weather any volatility that may lay ahead. Thank you for your interest today.

So I'm just trying to figure out how conservative that forecast could be or what you expect first half versus second half.

It just seems like the number of trucks and excavators being produced, it just seems like a lot for us relative to the economy's ability to absorb it. Again, that's just from history and experience, and we'll see. I mean last year was just an enormous production build. And as Mark said, OEMs are cautious about the same thing, but nobody has a firm grasp on it. And then there's the emissions change in the middle, which also seems like a good impact thing. So we're using our experience and history here to make this call. We did the same thing in 2020 and got it wrong. It ended up being strong all year. So we'll see.

Mark mentioned, we did have elevated freight costs in the fourth quarter of last year. And as he said, we expect those to continue through the first half. 
We are working with all of our suppliers. The supply base is generally tight, not just semiconductors, which has gotten a lot of press. But many of our components are on longer lead times, our suppliers, and we are struggling with absenteeism due to COVID. And we are working very closely with our customers to remain connected and to continue to supply them as best we can. We are working through all of these issues on a daily basis.

The Hydrogen Forward alliance is really just trying to make sure that those of us that are investing in the industry are making it clear to policymakers and other potential participants what the opportunity is with hydrogen. Because I do think, if you just check in with people's imagination about what a low-carbon future can look like, I think everybody from government, regulators to my kids understand what battery cars might mean and all that, and they get it. I think the role that hydrogen is going to play in larger energy use, more energy dense demand, it's just not as clear. And I think we need to be more proactive in helping people understand what it can mean to our entire energy system, and of course, what it can mean to equipment that we might supply. 
So we decided that since a lot of us have been investing a lot of time and energy in that and see the opportunity, we better start telling people about it. So that, of course, includes Biden administration and regulators, but it also includes general public. And I think a bunch of industry participants or people who could be participants, understanding what investments might make sense. That's the goal of that initiative. And I agree with exactly what you said that Europe has moved much faster to understand the role that hydrogen can play both in energy storage, cleaning up a high carbon industries, steel making and others as well as potentially in transportation like trucks and trains. And I think the U.S. really does lag there. And part of it is, what I said, is just the understanding of regulators and others is not as good. 
But part of it is also because we kind of went into a different phase, I guess, over the last 5 -- 4 or 5 years where we weren't really doing much for energy planning. I see that changing. We've already had several conversations with members of the Biden administration or transition people about trying to put together a more comprehensive energy strategy that -- for a low-carbon future. So I'm optimistic that not only will we have a more comprehensive plan, but that hydrogen will play a role in it. And we're trying, of course, to impact that. We do believe that for the kind of commercial industrial applications that we are involved with anyway, that hydrogen-based technologies, can have a big role, so -- which is why we're investing in it."

There's a lot to play for in that, but that's what we're -- that's our strategy. That's what we're aiming for. 
And the challenge now on the BEV, or battery electric vehicle, or even fuel cell technologies is that the -- they're not in the money in trucks. So when you try to put a truck into production or into operation, you're going to be out of the money at the start. And so they're mostly regulatory driven or some other subsidy driven, which means that it's not really a straight technology and performance kind of discussion. And so right now, market share is bouncing all over the place and -- because there's a lot of different players that can offer a system. That system is unlikely to be competitive long run. And even the systems we offer are not -- do not return if you compare them to a diesel system today. 
So market share is really, really difficult to say right now because the basis of competition is not technology and performance and cost. It's a whole bunch of other things. But that said, we are intending to win as many partners and as many products as we can, so we can get, a, practice and learning on the technology; and b, help customers understand how they might be able to turn these technologies into winners over time. So we are competing, don't get me wrong, but it's just the basis of competition is not the normal performance cost trade-off we're used to with diesel."

I'll start with a summary of our first quarter financial results. And then I'll talk about our sales and end market trends by region and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2021.

And then I'll talk about our sales and end market trends by region and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2021. Mark will then take you through more details about our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year.
Demand accelerated in the first quarter as the global economy continued to improve, driving strong sales growth across most businesses and regions and resulting in solid profitability. The strength and breadth of the rebound in demand has surpassed our original expectations, and we've raised our full year outlook. We were particularly encouraged by the significant growth of our components business in the first quarter, which is now clearly capturing the benefits of the increasing content we are able to offer our customers and partners as they move towards more complex and stringent emissions regulations in China and India. This business is also benefiting from its global leadership position as truck markets recover.
While the strong demand across our end markets generated strong revenues, the pace of recovery has placed a strain on global supply chains, leading to increased costs and significant challenges in fulfilling all of our customers' orders. The shortage of key components such as semiconductor chips has been the primary challenge with adverse weather conditions, labor shortages in some regions and bottlenecks in global logistics, further adding to order backlogs. The ability to supply is our key focus now. and we are doing everything we can to mitigate the impact. I want to thank our global employees, especially those in our supply chain and manufacturing operations, and our committed suppliers for their extraordinary efforts to manage through these challenges and supply our customers. 
We are optimistic that the situation will improve in the second half of the year. However, we expect demand to remain strong, making it difficult for the supply chain to catch up, unless the industry extends the order cycle.
Before moving to our first quarter financial performance, I wanted to take a moment to highlight a few important strategic partnerships that we announced during the first quarter. These new and expanded partnerships are consistent with our strategy to deepen our relationships with key customers in existing segments while continuing to invest in new and alternative power solutions.
As the leading independent global power solutions provider, Cummins is committed to ensuring our customers have the right solution anywhere and everywhere our customers operate by offering them a broad range of power solutions from advanced diesel, near-zero natural gas, fully electric, hydrogen and other technologies.
In February, we announced a global strategic partnership for medium-duty engine systems with Daimler Truck & Bus. As part of the partnership, Cummins will invest in the further development and global production of medium-duty engines and components for Daimler Trucks and Buses. The partnership builds on our strong existing relationship with Daimler's North American brands. In North America, Daimler will replace their vertically integrated engines with Cummins engines ahead of CARB regulations in 2024 and EPA regulations in 2027. In addition, Cummins engines will be used in Daimler medium-duty chassis in Europe, Brazil and India, coinciding with next-generation emissions regulations in those regions. In the future, global medium-duty engine systems for Daimler Trucks and Buses all over the world will be provided by Cummins.
We also announced a global medium-duty partnership and advanced engineering collaboration with Isuzu, building upon the Isuzu/Cummins Power partnership formed in 2019. Isuzu trucks powered by Cummins B6.7 diesel platform engines will be introduced in North America first in 2021 and in Japan, Southeast Asia and other regions at later dates.
Finally, in March, we announced a medium-duty engine offering with Hino, where Cummins 6.7 and L9 engines will be available on Hino trucks in North America by the end of this year.
In addition to the above announcements, we continue to investigate areas in which we can strategically collaborate with global OEMs across a number of regions, technologies and power solutions. We believe these collaborations will not only allow us to significantly grow our core engine and components businesses, but will also further strengthen the important relationships we have with a number of OEMs and end users. These relationships, coupled with our application expertise and broad sales and service channel, will position us well to manage the transition from internal combustion engines to lower carbon hybrids and eventually to zero-emissions products in the future.
Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the first quarter of '21. And we'll cover some of our key markets, starting with North America, before moving on to our largest international markets.
Revenues for the first quarter of 2021 were $6.1 billion, an increase of 22% compared to the first quarter of 2020. EBITDA was $980 million or 16.1%, compared to $846 million or 16.9% a year ago. EBITDA dollars increased as a result of stronger sales and record joint venture income, partially offset by significantly higher premium freight and other costs associated with supply chain disruptions as well as higher variable compensation expense. Our profitability, especially in the Engine business, was impacted more than expected by supply chain disruptions due to the extraordinary measures we had to take to meet customer commitments.
Our first quarter revenues in North America grew 7% to $3.3 billion, driven by higher industry build rates of heavy-duty trucks and light-duty pickups. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the first quarter was 60,000 units, an increase of 15% from 2020 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 23,000, an increase of 25% from 2020. 
Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 32,000 units in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 2% from 2020, while our unit sales were 27,000 units, an increase of 5% from 2020. We shipped 42,000 engines to -- for use in their RAM pickups in the first quarter of '21, an increase of 49% from the 2020 level. Revenues for power generation grew by 10% due to higher demand in recreational vehicle and data center markets.
Our international revenues increased by 45% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to a year ago. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $2.1 billion, an increase of 95% due to the higher sales in on-highway and construction markets. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 587,000 units, an increase of 95%, driven by increased NS B V prebuy ahead of a broader NS VI implementation in July of this year and an effort to secure inventory amid supply chain concerns. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were 91,000 or an increase of 146%. The light-duty market in China increased 73% from 2020 levels to 581,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 45,000 units, an increase of 63%.
Industry demand for excavators set another quarterly record of 127,000 units in the first quarter, an increase of 84% from last year. Our units sold were 21,800 units, an increase of 107% as our customers continued to gain market share. Demand for power generation equipment in China increased 41% in the first quarter, driven by growth in data center markets and higher demand for standby power.
First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $577 million, an increase of 82% from the first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased 63%, while our shipments increased 88%, driven by better penetration with our JV partner as the heavy-duty commercial vehicle segment recovered from a year ago. Demand for power generation and construction equipment rebounded strongly in the first quarter as economic activity continued to improve. 
In Brazil, our revenues increased 31%, driven by increased demand in most end markets.
Now let me provide our outlook for 2021, including some comments on our individual regions and end markets. We have raised our forecast for total company revenues for 2021 to be up 20% to 24% compared to our prior guidance of up 10% at the midpoint. This guidance reflects a stronger outlook in most markets and regions. We've raised our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America to 264,000 units, up 45% compared to 2020 and above our prior guidance of 255,000 units. Despite the supply chain constraints our industry is experiencing, demand has continued to outpace our expectations from the beginning of the year. In the medium-duty truck market, we are increasing our forecast for industry production to 140,000 units, up 35% year-over-year and above our prior guidance of 125,000 units. We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be up 15% compared to 2020, an increase of 10% from our expectations 3 months ago.
In China, we continue to expect domestic on-highway demand to decline from record levels a year ago despite the strong start to the year. However, we are increasing our outlook for medium- and heavy-duty truck market demand to 1.5 million units, compared to our expectations of 1.3 million units at the beginning of the year. This would still represent a 15% decline from 2020. In the light-duty truck market, we continue to expect a 7% reduction in demand, in line with our previous guidance. We now expect industry sales of excavators to decline 10% from the record levels achieved in 2020. This compares to our prior guidance of down 20%.
In India, we continue to project broad recovery versus 2020. We anticipate industry demand for trucks to be up 90% compared to levels experienced in 2020 and. And our other businesses are showing promising growth due to continued infrastructure investment. We do anticipate lower demand in all end markets in the second quarter due to new lockdowns as a result of an increase in COVID-19 cases and are monitoring the events in the ground closely. Given the rapid increase in COVID cases in India, we are very concerned about the health and safety of our employees and those of our suppliers and partners.  We are continuing to operate all of our manufacturing facilities, but with robust safety measures in place.
In Brazil, we continue to forecast truck production to increase 25% in 2021. We now expect demand for mining engines to increase 45% in 2021, up from our expectation of 15% 3 months ago. And that's due to continued strength in commodity prices.
Demand for power generation equipment increased 18% in the first quarter, and we continue to see strong order activity in most geographies and segments. We are now expecting global power generation revenues to increase 15% compared to our previous forecast of about 5%, primarily driven by data center and recreational vehicle markets.
In summary, we are increasing our revenue outlook for the year with year-over-year growth expected in most major regions, except China. Demand in China remained very strong in the first quarter, but we do anticipate a weaker second half of the year, driven in part by the transition to the new National Standard VI emissions regulations for trucks beginning in July. We are increasing our EBITDA guidance range from 15.5% to 16%, compared to 15% to 15.5% at the beginning of the year, due to stronger volumes and improved outlook for JV income, which we expect to more than offset significantly higher supply chain costs.
During the quarter, we returned $615 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders for the year. 
We continue to take necessary precautions at all of our facilities to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. And our focus remains on the health and safety of our employees. We are optimistic that continued vaccination distribution globally will reduce the impact of the virus in the second half of the year, but there is still a risk of an increase in cases somewhere in the world that could result in lower customer demand, additional facility shutdowns or additional supply chain constraints in the future. Having managed through an extremely challenging 2020 and a dramatic ramp-up in the first quarter of 2021, Cummins is in a strong position. We have secured some important new business wins in our Engine and Components businesses. And at the same time, we continue to invest in future growth. bringing new technologies to customers and generating strong return for shareholders.
Thank you for your time today. And now let me turn it over to Mark."

There are 4 key takeaways from our first quarter results. First, we saw continued recovery in demand in most major end markets and regions, resulting in record revenues for the first quarter and a much stronger full year outlook. Second, the elevated level of demand across our markets have strained global supply chains in our industry, resulting in higher premium freight costs and other associated inefficiencies higher than we anticipated at the start of the year. The strength of demand, order backlogs and lack of inventory in the pipeline indicate that some level of elevated costs are likely to continue in the coming quarters.
Despite the cost headwinds associated with the tight supply chain, we delivered solid profitability and cash flows in the first quarter and have raised significantly our outlook for the full year. And finally, we returned $615 million to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year. 
Now let me go into more details on the first quarter. First quarter revenues were $6.1 billion, an increase of 22% from a year ago. Sales in North America grew 7%. And international revenues rose 45%. Currency movements positively impacted revenues by around 1%. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, were $980 million or 16.1% of sales for the quarter, compared to $846 million or 16.9% of sales a year ago. EBITDA dollars increased due to the benefits of higher volumes and stronger earnings from joint ventures in China. EBITDA percent declined primarily due to a weaker gross margin percent. Gross margin of $1.5 billion or 24.4% of sales increased by $192 million but declined as a percent of sales by 140 basis points. First quarter gross margins included approximately $105 million of additional freight, labor and logistics costs associated with disruptions across our supply chain. We expect elevated costs to continue at least through the second quarter and have incorporated additional costs into our full year guidance.
Partially offsetting these supply chain efficiencies was a $44 million positive change in estimate and our product coverage expense, reflecting lower costs across several products, primarily in our Components and Power Systems businesses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $28 million and our research expenses increased by $22 million. And both increased primarily due to higher variable compensation expense. In 2020, our variable compensation plan work is designed, flexing down due to the weaker outlook associated with the impact of the global pandemic. And in 2021, variable compensation expenses are expected to be higher for the company and all individual segments, consistent with our forecast for improved full year profitability this year.
Joint venture income was a record $166 million in the first quarter, up from $129 million a year ago. Continued strong demand for trucks and construction equipment in China led to the strong performance. And as a reminder, joint venture income in the first quarter last year included a $37 million benefit related to changes in tax law in India and income of $18 million from a technical fee also in India that did not repeat this year. Adjusting for these onetime items in 2020 underscores just how strong the earnings growth was in the first quarter from our joint ventures.
Other income decreased by $46 million from a year ago, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses of $32 million on the investments that underpin our nonqualified benefit plans, and this compares to a $17 million mark-to-market gain in the first quarter last year. The mark-to-market losses were recorded within eliminations and not allocated to our operating segments.
Net earnings for the quarter were $603 million or $4.07 per diluted share, compared to $511 million or $3.41 a year ago. The increase is primarily due to stronger after-tax earnings and a lower share count as a result of the share repurchase activity. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 22%. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $339 million, compared to $379 million a year ago. Stronger earnings were more than offset by an increase in working capital associated with our revenue growth this year.
I'll now comment on segment performance and our revised guidance for 2021. For the Engine segment, first quarter revenues increased by 14% from a year ago, driven by growth in demand for trucks in the U.S. and construction equipment in China. EBITDA decreased from 16.9% to 14.4% of sales. The Engine business bore the brunt of the premium freight costs and other associated efficiencies arising from supply chain disruptions. We now expect full year revenues to be up 23% to 27%, an increase from our prior guidance of up 12%, primarily driven by stronger demand in North American truck and global construction markets.
We have increased our forecast for EBITDA margins to be in the range of 14.5% to 15% as we anticipate stronger volumes and higher than previously expected joint venture income will more than offset the additional supply chain costs.
In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 1% from a year ago in the first quarter. The EBITDA was flat as a percent of sales at 8.7% of the benefits of our North American transformation work and improvements in some of our international businesses, somewhat offset by weaker part sales resulting from supply chain challenges. Underlying demand for parts remains strong. We have maintained our 2021 outlook for Distribution revenues to be up 6% to 10%. And we now expect EBITDA to be 9% at the midpoint of our guidance. The lower prior year guidance of 10.1%  due to a reduced outlook of parts and stronger demand for power generation equipment and other engine sales. 
Components revenues increased 43% in the first quarter, driven by stronger demand for trucks in North America, China, India and Europe. EBITDA increased from 18.6% of sales to 19.6% due to the benefit from stronger sales and lower product coverage costs. 2021, we now expect components revenues to increase 30% to 34%, up from our prior guidance [indiscernible] 11%. And we've raised our forecast for EBITDA margins to 17% at the midpoint, up from 14.9%.
In Power Systems, revenues increased 16% in the first quarter, driven by stronger global demand for power generation and mining equipment. EBITDA increased from 8.7% to 12.3% of sales, primarily due to the benefits of higher volumes and lower product coverage costs. We now expect Power Systems revenues to be up 18% at the midpoint compared to our prior year guidance of 9%. EBITDA margins are projected to be in the range of 11% to 11.5% of sales, up from our prior guidance of 10.6%, due primarily due to the stronger sales outlook and lower cost of quality.
In the New Power segment, revenues increased to $35 million, up 250% due to stronger sales of battery electric systems, fuel cells and electrolyzers. The EBITDA losses for the quarter were $51 million, in line with our expectations as we continue to invest in new products and scale up ahead of widespread adoption of the new technologies. For the full year, we're maintaining our New Power revenue outlook at $110 million to $130 million, and we also expect net expense to be in the range of $200 million at the midpoint of our guidance.
The net impact of the changes to individual segment projections is that we forecast total company revenues to be up 20% to 24% in 2021, up from our prior guidance of 10%. We're raising our forecast for company EBITDA margins to be between 15.5% and 16%, compared to our previous guidance of 15% to 15.5%. This increase is primarily driven by the stronger sales outlook, which we anticipate will drive incremental earnings that more than offset the increased supply chain costs. We now expect earnings from joint ventures to be down 5% this year compared to our prior forecast of down 25% to 30%. Continued strength in China truck and construction markets, especially in the first half of the year, is the primary reason for the increase in our forecast. We currently project that the first quarter will mark the high point for joint venture earnings this year, with results expected to ease in subsequent quarters and particularly the second half of the year, post adoption of the new National Standard VI On-Highway Emissions Regulations in China in July. We're projecting our effective tax rate to be 20%, 25% this year -- 22.5%, excluding any discrete items.
Expenditures were $87 million in the quarter, up from $75 million a year ago. We expect that our 2021 capital investments will be in the range of $725 million to $775 million, unchanged from prior year guidance. As Tom mentioned, we returned $615 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase, in line with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow this year.
To summarize, we delivered strong results in the first quarter, have increased both our sales and profitability outlook for the year. Supply chain tightness, along with the ongoing impact of COVID-19 will continue to present challenges in the coming weeks and months. I want to thank all of our employees for their commitment to support our customers through these challenges and deliver strong full year financial results. We will continue to prioritize investing in the products and technologies that will drive profitable growth and return capital to shareholders while improving the day-to-day performance of the company.
Thank you for your interest today, and let me turn it back now to Jack."

We are seeing a rising outlook for most end markets that are going to benefit the Components business, which has a leadership position in global markets. So it's not just China. You're right, China has definitely helped that business where we have consolidated operations that's benefited our results. That's primarily in the first half of the year. The impact of that strength in China is expected to ease in subsequent quarters in the second half of the year. I'll come back and talk about the overall joint venture income for the company rather than just Components in a moment. So yes, that's stronger volume, the Components business is doing a good job of converting that to additional profitability.
And then the second thing is the Components business did benefit from lower quality costs and a positive change in estimate in our product coverage or warranty expense in the first quarter, which boosted the results a little bit, which is why the full year margin is a little bit below the first quarter level of performance. 
India, yes, India was an important contributor. We had consolidated revenues of around about $600 million in China and India combined for the Components business in the first quarter. So kind of an annualized $2.5 billion business. We expect that could drop from that rate in the second half of the year by as much as 40%, depending on the impact of demand.
On the other hand, supply chain permitting, we're expecting, obviously, the North America demand to continue to improve.
If I now circle back up to the total company picture, really, the story is the same on China that we expect a significant dropoff in the second half of the year. We don't have great visibility into that. That's an assumption right now. Q1 remains stronger than we'd anticipated 3 months ago. But there is -- there are some signs of concern. There's elevated inventory levels. Obviously, the price of trucks goes up with the introduction of the new emissions regulations. So we baked in kind of a 40% to 50% dropoff in the earnings run rate quarterly in the second half of the year from where we are today. So hopefully, that wraps up a big picture on China."

And those techno",319,"Thanks, Jerry. Here's what I would say is, broadly speaking, as we've said in previous calls, we are talking now to every OEM about their technology requirements going from today all the way through the eventual transition to zero carbon. And those technologies include diesel and more advanced versions of diesel, natural gas, hybrid, electric and fuel cell. And as I've also said before, for many of them, the diesel side looks less viable from an investment point of view just because their volumes are relatively smaller than ours and most ranges -- but certainly in midrange. So that's, I think, why you're seeing the announcements you're seeing.
In addition, though, We are offering them the other technologies, including transition technologies, to help them figure out how to get from where they are now to a place that's a viable zero carbon solution down the road.
I would say that all those conversations are all going on, but it's difficult now for OEMs to understand what the timing of those transitions will look like and exactly what their technology approach wants to be, just as it is for most market watchers. It's hard because the viability of those technologies in terms of cost depends on either carbon tax or regulations or something else coming into play because still diesel is quite a bit cheaper than those other solutions today. And of course, it's providing improved fuel economy with every generation. So yes, those conversations, as you suggest, are going on. But I would just say that, for the most part, we're doing work with folks. But what exactly their plans are going to be and what role we're going to play in those future technologies is still being talked about. Whereas the diesel stuff is moving now because they have to make investment choices today. Do I invest in the new platform? Or do I have someone else invest?"

As you guessed, the volume discussion that I mentioned earlier about trying to invest for limited volume, it's much more dramatic in medium-duty. The relative volume of our customers versus ours is dramatically different in midrange. It's not -- it is different in heavy-duty, too. We clearly have a larger position, but it's not as big a difference. So those conversations are likely to take longer. And it's not as easy a call for an OEM on heavy-duty as it is on medium-duty.

And our view is that we are well positioned to provide people with solutions today, solutions that are kind of transition kind of solutions, natural gas and hybrid and then final solutions.

We'll need other investments by governments and other things to get that done. So in the meantime, these interim solutions are going to play a significant role.

So we're seeing growing demand for the NS V product ahead of the transition that happens in July. And that prebuy as well as challenges in the supply chain is driving our OEMs to build as much as possible at this point.
One other dynamic that we think is going to impact going in the second half of the year is that some regions have extended the period with which NS V product can be registered. So as we go into Q3, we're going to see inventory of NS V product starting to reduce. And then we're really watching to see how quickly customers start to buy that NS V product given it will come at a higher price with the added content.

And again, their life mostly depends on how the zero carbon solutions come down in cost and durability, reliability and how the infrastructure gets built up, and we'll need both. So I think that's why I said that these transition solutions that are going in place, well, may be in there for a while and they may be in there for a shorter period, depending on which country, which application, which region you're in because those 2 things -- both the infrastructure and the cost depend on application and, of course, country and how much infrastructure being built. But the hybrid programs are real. They are getting launched. It's happening now.
And with regard to engine size, I think, initially, what we'll see with hybrids is there'll be relatively mild hybrid, the first step. And those won't make a big difference on engine. How big the engine is won't be impacted very much by the size of the battery. But you are right that as you add larger batteries, then you need less engine to carry the same load.

And just to call it out directly, the big problem is semiconductors. There is a lot of supply chain challenges. There's everything, weather in Texas and now new challenges with India. You name it, and we have a shortage on it. But semiconductors is the biggie. That's the one that's really hard to deal with. And in this quarter, we ended up buying chips on the market, through the aftermarket and bringing them back into production. We rescheduled and rescheduled and rescheduled to meet our customers' demand.
Our customers, after a pretty tough first half of last year, are finally seeing demand go up and really want to ship trucks to their customers. And we really want to help them do that. So frankly, we took it on the chin. We basically brought in everything we could as fast as we could and shipped it out to them and didn't raise prices or didn't do any of those things. We just shipped them. And we took it, took it hard this quarter. And that's just the honest truth. And it's because we felt a commitment to those customers to get them the product best we could while the going was good. And so we're not really changing any of that other than hopefully, as Jennifer said, we're going to get these costs better under control as we don't have to reschedule so much. We understand where our chips still aren't enough, but we understand where they're coming from more now, and we understand how many we have really. And we'll be able to level some, schedule some and reduce premium freight. It's still awful, but it will be less awful in Q2 and less awful again in Q3 as we get more set up. But it was a rough quarter, and I feel good about what we did for customers, and it was hard to get there."

It will take longer to finish to the extent that the truck demand can't be fully supplied, which would not be a bad thing per se, if it extended further.

I'll start with a summary of our first quarter financial results, and then I'll talk about our sales and end market trends by region and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2021. Mark will then take you through more details about our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year.
Demand accelerated in the first quarter as the global economy continued to improve, driving strong sales growth across most businesses and regions and resulting in solid profitability. The strength and breadth of the rebound in demand has surpassed our original expectations, and we've raised our full year outlook. We were particularly encouraged by the significant growth of our Components business in the first quarter, which is now clearly capturing the benefits of the increasing content we are able to offer our customers and partners as they move towards more complex and stringent emissions regulations in China and India. This business is also benefiting from its global leadership position as truck markets recover.
While the strong demand across our end markets generated strong revenues, the pace of recovery has placed a strain on global supply chains, leading to increased costs and significant challenges in fulfilling all of our customers' orders. The shortage of key components such as semiconductor chips has been the primary challenge with adverse weather conditions, labor shortages in some regions and bottlenecks in global logistics, further adding to order backlogs.
The ability to supply is our key focus now, and we are doing everything we can to mitigate the impact. I want to thank our global employees, especially those in our supply chain and manufacturing operations, and our committed suppliers for their extraordinary efforts to manage through these challenges and supply our customers. We are optimistic that the situation will improve in the second half of the year. However, we expect demand to remain strong, making it difficult for the supply chain to catch up, unless the industry extends the order cycle.
Before moving to our first quarter financial performance, I wanted to take a moment to highlight a few important strategic partnerships that we announced during the first quarter. These new and expanded partnerships are consistent with our strategy to deepen our relationships with key customers in existing segments while continuing to invest in new and alternative power solutions.
As the leading independent global power solutions provider, Cummins is committed to ensuring our customers have the right solution anywhere and everywhere our customers operate by offering them a broad range of power solutions from advanced diesel, near-zero natural gas, fully electric, hydrogen and other technologies.
In February, we announced a global strategic partnership for medium-duty engine systems with Daimler Truck and Bus. As part of the partnership, Cummins will invest in the further development and global production of medium-duty engines and components for Daimler Trucks and Buses. The partnership builds on our strong existing relationship with Daimler's North American brands. In North America, Daimler will replace their vertically integrated engines with Cummins engines ahead of CARB regulations in 2024 and EPA regulations in 2027. In addition, Cummins engines will be used in Daimler medium-duty chassis in Europe, Brazil and India, coinciding with next-generation emissions regulations in those regions. In the future, global medium-duty engine systems for Daimler Trucks and Buses all over the world will be provided by Cummins.
We also announced a global medium-duty partnership and advanced engineering collaboration with Isuzu, building upon the Isuzu/Cummins power partnership formed in 2019. Isuzu trucks powered by Cummins B6.7 diesel platform engines will be introduced in North America first in 2021 and in Japan, Southeast Asia and other regions at later dates.
Finally, in March, we announced a medium-duty engine offering with Hino, where Cummins 6.7 and L9 engines will be available on Hino trucks in North America by the end of this year.
In addition to the above announcements, we continue to investigate areas in which we can strategically collaborate with global OEMs across a number of regions, technologies and power solutions. We believe these collaborations will not only allow us to significantly grow our core Engine and Components businesses, but will also further strengthen the important relationships we have with a number of OEMs and end users. These relationships, coupled with our application expertise and broad sales and service channel, will position us well to manage the transition from internal combustion engines to lower carbon hybrids and eventually to zero-emissions products in the future.
Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the first quarter of '21. And we'll cover some of our key markets, starting with North America, before moving on to our largest international markets.
Revenues for the first quarter of 2021 were $6.1 billion, an increase of 22% compared to the first quarter of 2020. EBITDA was $980 million or 16.1%, compared to $846 million or 16.9% a year ago. EBITDA dollars increased as a result of stronger sales and record joint venture income, partially offset by significantly higher premium freight and other costs associated with supply chain disruptions as well as higher variable compensation expense. Our profitability, especially in the Engine business, was impacted more than expected by supply chain disruptions due to the extraordinary measures we had to take to meet customer commitments.
Our first quarter revenues in North America grew 7% to $3.3 billion, driven by higher industry build rates of heavy-duty trucks and light-duty pickups. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the first quarter was 60,000 units, an increase of 15% from 2020 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 23,000, an increase of 25% from 2020.
Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 32,000 units in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 2% from 2020, while our unit sales were 27,000 units, an increase of 5% from 2020. We shipped 42,000 engines to [indiscernible] for use in their Ram pickups in the first quarter of '21, an increase of 49% from the 2020 level. Revenues for power generation grew by 10% due to higher demand in recreational vehicle and data center markets.
Our international revenues increased by 45% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to a year ago. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $2.1 billion, an increase of 95% due to the higher sales in on-highway and construction markets. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 587,000 units, an increase of 95%, driven by increased NS V prebuy ahead of a broader NS VI implementation in July of this year and an effort to secure inventory amid supply chain concerns. Our sales in units, including joint ventures, were 91,000 or an increase of 146%. The light-duty market in China increased 73% from 2020 levels to 581,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 45,000 units, an increase of 63%.
Industry demand for excavators set another quarterly record of 127,000 units in the first quarter, an increase of 84% from last year. Our units sold were 21,800 units, an increase of 107% as our customers continued to gain market share. Demand for power generation equipment in China increased 41% in the first quarter, driven by growth in data center markets and higher demand for standby power.
First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $577 million, an increase of 82% from the first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased 63%, while our shipments increased 88%, driven by better penetration with our JV partner as the heavy-duty commercial vehicle segment recovered from a year ago. Demand for power generation and construction equipment rebounded strongly in the first quarter as economic activity continued to improve. In Brazil, our revenues increased 31%, driven by increased demand in most end markets.
Now let me provide our outlook for 2021, including some comments on our individual regions and end markets. We have raised our forecast for total company revenues for 2021 to be up 20% to 24% compared to our prior guidance of up 10% at the midpoint. This guidance reflects a stronger outlook in most markets and regions. We've raised our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America to 264,000 units, up 45% compared to 2020 and above our prior guidance of 255,000 units.
Despite the supply chain constraints our industry is experiencing, demand has continued to outpace our expectations from the beginning of the year. In the medium-duty truck market, we are increasing our forecast for industry production to 140,000 units, up 35% year-over-year and above our prior guidance of 125,000 units. We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be up 15% compared to 2020, an increase of 10% from our expectations 3 months ago.
In China, we continue to expect domestic on-highway demand to decline from record levels a year ago despite the strong start to the year. However, we are increasing our outlook for medium- and heavy-duty truck market demand to 1.5 million units, compared to our expectations of 1.3 million units at the beginning of the year. This would still represent a 15% decline from 2020. In the light-duty truck market, we continue to expect a 7% reduction in demand, in line with our previous guidance. We now expect industry sales of excavators to decline 10% from the record levels achieved in 2020. This compares to our prior guidance of down 20%.
In India, we continue to project broad recovery versus 2020. We anticipate industry demand for trucks to be up 90% compared to levels experienced in 2020, and our other businesses are showing promising growth due to continued infrastructure investment. We do anticipate lower demand in all end markets in the second quarter due to new lockdowns as a result of an increase in COVID-19 cases and are monitoring the events in the ground closely. Given the rapid increase in COVID cases in India, we are very concerned about the health and safety of our employees and those of our suppliers and partners. We are continuing to operate all of our manufacturing facilities, but with robust safety measures in place.
In Brazil, we continue to forecast truck production to increase 25% in 2021. We now expect demand for mining engines to increase 45% in 2021, up from our expectation of 15% 3 months ago. And that's due to continued strength in commodity prices.
Demand for power generation equipment increased 18% in the first quarter, and we continue to see strong order activity in most geographies and segments. We are now expecting global power generation revenues to increase 15% compared to our previous forecast of about 5%, primarily driven by data center and recreational vehicle markets.
In summary, we are increasing our revenue outlook for the year with year-over-year growth expected in most major regions, except China. Demand in China remained very strong in the first quarter, but we do anticipate a weaker second half of the year, driven in part by the transition to the new National Standard VI emissions regulations for trucks beginning in July. We are increasing our EBITDA guidance range from 15.5% to 16%, compared to 15% to 15.5% at the beginning of the year, due to stronger volumes and improved outlook for JV income, which we expect to more than offset significantly higher supply chain costs.
During the quarter, we returned $615 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders for the year.
We continue to take necessary precautions at all of our facilities to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and our focus remains on the health and safety of our employees. We are optimistic that continued vaccination distribution globally will reduce the impact of the virus in the second half of the year, but there is still a risk of an increase in cases somewhere in the world that could result in lower customer demand, additional facility shutdowns or additional supply chain constraints in the future.
Having managed through an extremely challenging 2020 and a dramatic ramp-up in the first quarter of 2021, Cummins is in a strong position. We have secured some important new business wins in our Engine and Components businesses. And at the same time, we continue to invest in future growth, bringing new technologies to customers and generating strong return for shareholders.
Thank you for your time today. And now let me turn it over to Mark."

There are 4 key takeaways from our first quarter results. First, we saw continued recovery in demand in most major end markets and regions, resulting in record revenues for the first quarter and a much stronger full year outlook. Second, the elevated level of demand across our markets have strained global supply chains in our industry, resulting in higher premium freight costs and other associated inefficiencies higher than we anticipated at the start of the year. The strength of demand, order backlogs and lack of inventory in the pipeline indicate that some level of elevated costs are likely to continue in the coming quarters.
Despite the cost headwinds associated with the tight supply chain, we delivered solid profitability and cash flows in the first quarter and have raised significantly our outlook for the full year. And finally, we returned $615 million to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year.
Now let me go into more details on the first quarter. First quarter revenues were $6.1 billion, an increase of 22% from a year ago. Sales in North America grew 7%, and international revenues rose 45%. Currency movements positively impacted revenues by around 1%. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, were $980 million or 16.1% of sales for the quarter, compared to $846 million or 16.9% of sales a year ago. EBITDA dollars increased due to the benefits of higher volumes and stronger earnings from joint ventures in China. EBITDA percent declined primarily due to a weaker gross margin percent.
Gross margin of $1.5 billion or 24.4% of sales increased by $192 million but declined as a percent of sales by 140 basis points. First quarter gross margins included approximately $105 million of additional freight, labor and logistics costs associated with disruptions across our supply chain. We expect elevated costs to continue at least through the second quarter and have incorporated additional costs into our full year guidance. Partially offsetting these supply chain efficiencies was a $44 million positive change in estimate and our product coverage expense, reflecting lower costs across several products, primarily in our Components and Power Systems businesses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $28 million and our research expenses increased by $22 million, and both increased primarily due to higher variable compensation expense. In 2020, our variable compensation plan work is designed, flexing down due to the weaker outlook associated with the impact of the global pandemic. And in 2021, variable compensation expenses are expected to be higher for the company and all individual segments, consistent with our forecast for improved full year profitability this year.
Joint venture income was a record $166 million in the first quarter, up from $129 million a year ago. Continued strong demand for trucks and construction equipment in China led to the strong performance. And as a reminder, joint venture income in the first quarter last year included a $37 million benefit related to changes in tax law in India and income of $18 million from a technical fee also in India that did not repeat this year. Adjusting for these onetime items in 2020 underscores just how strong the earnings growth was in the first quarter from our joint ventures.
Other income decreased by $46 million from a year ago, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses of $32 million on the investments that underpin our nonqualified benefit plans, and this compares to a $17 million mark-to-market gain in the first quarter last year. The mark-to-market losses were recorded within eliminations and not allocated to our operating segments.
Net earnings for the quarter were $603 million or $4.07 per diluted share, compared to $511 million or $3.41 a year ago. The increase is primarily due to stronger after-tax earnings and a lower share count as a result of the share repurchase activity. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 22%.
Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $339 million, compared to $379 million a year ago. Stronger earnings were more than offset by an increase in working capital associated with our revenue growth this year.
I'll now comment on segment performance and our revised guidance for 2021. For the Engine segment, first quarter revenues increased by 14% from a year ago, driven by growth in demand for trucks in the U.S. and construction equipment in China. EBITDA decreased from 16.9% to 14.4% of sales. The Engine business bore the brunt of the premium freight costs and other associated efficiencies arising from supply chain disruptions. We now expect full year revenues to be up 23% to 27%, an increase from our prior guidance of up 12%, primarily driven by stronger demand in North American truck and global construction markets.
We have increased our forecast for EBITDA margins to be in the range of 14.5% to 15% as we anticipate stronger volumes, and higher than previously expected joint venture income will more than offset the additional supply chain costs.
In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 1% from a year ago in the first quarter. The EBITDA was flat as a percent of sales at 8.7% of the benefits of our North American transformation work and improvements in some of our international businesses, somewhat offset by weaker part sales resulting from supply chain challenges. Underlying demand for parts remains strong. We have maintained our 2021 outlook for Distribution revenues to be up 6% to 10%. And we now expect EBITDA to be 9% at the midpoint of our guidance. The lower -- our prior year guidance of 10.1%  due to a reduced outlook of parts and stronger demand for power generation equipment and other engine sales. 
Components revenues increased 43% in the first quarter, driven by stronger demand for trucks in North America, China, India and Europe. EBITDA increased from 18.6% of sales to 19.6% due to the benefit from stronger sales and lower product coverage costs. 2021, we now expect components revenues to increase 30% to 34%, up from our prior guidance of up 11%. And we've raised our forecast for EBITDA margins to 17% at the midpoint, up from 14.9%.
In Power Systems, revenues increased 16% in the first quarter, driven by stronger global demand for power generation and mining equipment. EBITDA increased from 8.7% to 12.3% of sales, primarily due to the benefits of higher volumes and lower product coverage costs. We now expect Power Systems revenues to be up 18% at the midpoint compared to our prior year guidance of 9%. EBITDA margins are projected to be in the range of 11% to 11.5% of sales, up from our prior guidance of 10.6%, due primarily due to the stronger sales outlook and lower cost of quality.
In the New Power segment, revenues increased to $35 million, up 250% due to stronger sales of battery electric systems, fuel cells and electrolyzers. The EBITDA losses for the quarter were $51 million, in line with our expectations as we continue to invest in new products and scale up ahead of widespread adoption of the new technologies.
For the full year, we're maintaining our New Power revenue outlook at $110 million to $130 million, and we also expect net expense to be in the range of $200 million at the midpoint of our guidance.
The net impact of the changes to individual segment projections is that we forecast total company revenues to be up 20% to 24% in 2021, up from our prior guidance of up 10%. We're raising our forecast for company EBITDA margins to be between 15.5% and and 16%, compared to our previous guidance of 15% to 15.5%. This increase is primarily driven by the stronger sales outlook, which we anticipate will drive incremental earnings that more than offset the increased supply chain costs.
We now expect earnings from joint ventures to be down 5% this year compared to our prior forecast of down 25% to 30%. Continued strength in China truck and construction markets, especially in the first half of the year, is the primary reason for the increase in our forecast. We currently project that the first quarter will mark the high point for joint venture earnings this year, with results expected to ease in subsequent quarters and particularly the second half of the year, post adoption of the new National Standard VI on-highway emissions regulations in China in July. We're projecting our effective tax rate to be 20%, 25% this year -- 22.5%, excluding any discrete items.
Capital expenditures were $87 million in the quarter, up from $75 million a year ago. We expect that our 2021 capital investments will be in the range of $725 million to $775 million, unchanged from prior year guidance. As Tom mentioned, we returned $615 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase, in line with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow this year.
To summarize, we delivered strong results in the first quarter, have increased both our sales and profitability outlook for the year. Supply chain tightness, along with the ongoing impact of COVID-19 will continue to present challenges in the coming weeks and months. I want to thank all of our employees for their commitment to support our customers through these challenges and deliver strong full year financial results. We will continue to prioritize investing in the products and technologies that will drive profitable growth and return capital to shareholders while improving the day-to-day performance of the company. 
Thank you for your interest today, and let me turn it back now to Jack."

So we are seeing a rising outlook for most end markets that are going to benefit the Components business, which has a leadership position in global markets. So it's not just China. You're right, China has definitely helped that business where we have consolidated operations that's benefited our results. That's primarily in the first half of the year. The impact of that strength in China is expected to ease in subsequent quarters in the second half of the year.
I'll come back and talk about the overall joint venture income for the company rather than just Components in a moment. So yes, that's stronger volume, the Components business is doing a good job of converting that to additional profitability. And then the second thing is the Components business did benefit from lower quality costs and a positive change in estimate in our product coverage or warranty expense in the first quarter, which boosted the results a little bit, which is why the full year margin is a little bit below the first quarter level of performance.
India, yes, India was an important contributor. We had consolidated revenues of around about $600 million in China and India combined for the Components business in the first quarter. So kind of an annualized $2.5 billion business. We expect that could drop from that rate in the second half of the year by as much as 40%, depending on the impact of demand. On the other hand, supply chain permitting, we're expecting, obviously, the North America demand to continue to improve.
If I now circle back up to the total company picture, really, the story is the same on China that we expect a significant dropoff in the second half of the year. We don't have great visibility into that. That's an assumption right now. Q1 remains stronger than we'd anticipated 3 months ago.
But there is -- there are some signs of concern. There's elevated inventory levels. Obviously, the price of trucks goes up with the introduction of the new emissions regulations. So we baked in kind of a 40% to 50% dropoff in the earnings run rate quarterly in the second half of the year from where we are today. So hopefully, that wraps up a big picture on China."

And those t",321,"Yes. Thanks, Jerry. Here's what I would say is, broadly speaking, as we've said in previous calls, we are talking now to every OEM about their technology requirements going from today all the way through the eventual transition to zero carbon. And those technologies include diesel and more advanced versions of diesel, natural gas, hybrid, electric and fuel cell. And as I've also said before, for many of them, the diesel side looks less viable from an investment point of view just because their volumes are relatively smaller than ours and most ranges -- but certainly in midrange. So that's, I think, why you're seeing the announcements you're seeing.
In addition, though, We are offering them the other technologies, including transition technologies, to help them figure out how to get from where they are now to a place that's a viable zero carbon solution down the road.
I would say that all those conversations are all going on, but it's difficult now for OEMs to understand what the timing of those transitions will look like and exactly what their technology approach wants to be, just as it is for for most market watchers. It's hard because the viability of those technologies in terms of cost depends on either carbon tax or regulations or something else coming into play because still, diesel is quite a bit cheaper than those other solutions today. And of course, it's providing improved fuel economy with every generation.
So yes, those conversations, as you suggest, are going on. But I would just say that, for the most part, we're doing work with folks. But what exactly their plans are going to be and what role we're going to play in those future technologies is still being talked about. Whereas the diesel stuff is moving now because they have to make investment choices today. Do I invest in the new platform? Or do I have someone else invest?"

The relative volume of our customers versus ours is dramatically different in midrange. It's not -- it is different in heavy-duty, too. We clearly have a larger position, but it's not as big a difference.
So those conversations are likely to take longer. And it's not as easy a call for an OEM on heavy-duty as it is on medium-duty. That said, they still have a platform investment to make and as do we.

And we also are offering natural gas products in other parts of the world. So we think it's a bridge solution. And we'll plan to continue to offer products to meet our customers' needs as a bridge between diesel engines and future zero carbon."

But eventual is the hard part, that again, the cost and the infrastructure requirements of electric fleets and/or fuel cell or hydrogen fleets are significant. And so we believe working with OEMs that we'll be able to get those costs and those infrastructure in place, but we'll need infrastructure. We'll need other investments by governments and other things to get that done.
So in the meantime, these interim solutions are going to play a significant role. And how long interim is isn't clear, and it could be extended. So our view is that natural gas and hybrid and some of these other technologies that we have will really help our customers get through those periods, which, again, could be -- we could sell across our range of 1 billion engines in those ranges before -- transition could be 1 billion engines. I mean it's a lot of engines over the years, right, with -- across the entire industry across multiyear. So it's really -- it's important to be thoughtful about those transition technologies just like it is the final solutions."

So the market for the year is a little bit higher than we had originally forecasted, and we really think that is strong demand in the first half of the year. So we're seeing growing demand for the NS V product ahead of the transition that happens in July. And that prebuy as well as the challenges in the supply chain is driving our OEMs to build as much as possible at this point.
One other dynamic that we think is going to impact going in the second half of the year is that some regions have extended the period with which NS V product can be registered. So as we go into Q3, we're going to see inventory of NS V product starting to reduce. And then we're really watching to see how quickly customers start to buy that NS VI product given it will come at a higher price with the added content. And so that is really the dynamic strength in the first half of the year, and then we're anticipating the drop in the second half of the year.
2020 was a record year. We've been saying we think it'll come back in line. It, of course, has continued to stay strong. So it's been a bit unpredictable, but we do think we'll see a falloff in the second half of the year."

Certainly, second half of the year, we're expecting a big dropoff, but wouldn't like a comment yet on 2022.
And then as to your comment about the incremental margins, and certainly, the longer these inefficiencies persist, eventually, that is clearly a headwind for this year. We've called it out. We expect they're going to improve in the second half of the year. We do expect that there's going to be improvement going into next year on that particular line item. There are a lot of moving parts and incremental margins. But yes, that line item alone, sitting here today, we'd hope and expect to be better next year than it is this year.

They have launch dates, and they will be launched this -- in these next several years. We will have hybrids on the road. We will be selling them through our key strategic OEMs. So hybrids are on the move, as you suggested. And again, their life mostly depends on how the zero carbon solutions come down in cost and durability, reliability and how the infrastructure gets built up, and we'll need both.
So I think that's why I said that these transition solutions that are going in place, well, may be in there for a while and they may be in there for a shorter period, depending on which country, which application, which region you're in because those 2 things -- both the infrastructure and the cost depend on application and, of course, country and how much infrastructure being built. But the hybrid programs are real. They are getting launched. It's happening now.
And with regard to engine size, I think, initially, what we'll see with hybrids is there'll be relatively mild hybrid, the first step. And those won't make a big difference on engine. How big the engine is won't be impacted very much by the size of the battery. But you are right that as you add larger batteries, then you need less engine to carry the same load. But I think that's -- those are probably generation 2 solutions rather than generation 1."

And just to call it out directly, the big problem is semiconductors. There is a lot of supply chain challenges. There's everything, weather in Texas and now new challenges with India. You name it, and we have a shortage on it. But semiconductors is the biggie. That's the one that's really hard to deal with. And in this quarter, we ended up buying chips on the market, through the aftermarket and bringing them back into production. We rescheduled and rescheduled and rescheduled to meet our customers' demand.
Our customers, after a pretty tough first half of last year, are finally seeing demand go up and really want to ship trucks to their customers. And we really want to help them do that. So frankly, we took it on the chin. We basically brought in everything we could as fast as we could and shipped it out to them and didn't raise prices or didn't do any of those things. We just shipped them. And we took it, took it hard this quarter. And that's just the honest truth. And it's because we felt a commitment to those customers to get them the product best we could while the going was good.
And so we're not really changing any of that other than hopefully, as Jennifer said, we're going to get these costs better under control as we don't have to reschedule so much. We understand where our chips still aren't enough, but we understand where they're coming from more now, and we understand how many we have really. And we'll be able to level some, schedule some and reduce premium freight. It's still awful, but it will be less awful in Q2 and less awful again in Q3 as we get more set up.

I'll start with a summary of our first quarter financial results, and then I'll talk about our sales and end market trends by region and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2021. Mark will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year.
Demand accelerated in the first quarter as the global economy continued to improve, driving strong sales growth across most businesses and regions and resulting in solid profitability. The strength and breadth of the rebound in demand has surpassed our original expectations, and we've raised our full year outlook. We were particularly encouraged by the significant growth of our Components business in the first quarter, which is now clearly capturing the benefits of the increasing content we are able to offer our customers and partners as they move towards more complex and stringent emissions regulations in China and India. This business is also benefiting from its global leadership position as truck markets recover.
While the strong demand across our end markets generated strong revenues, the pace of recovery has placed a strain on global supply chains, leading to increased costs and significant challenges in fulfilling all of our customers' orders. The shortage of key components such as semiconductor chips has been the primary challenge with adverse weather conditions, labor shortages in some regions and bottlenecks in global logistics, further adding to order backlogs.
The ability to supply is our key focus now, and we are doing everything we can to mitigate the impact. I want to thank our global employees, especially those in our supply chain and manufacturing operations, and our committed suppliers for their extraordinary efforts to manage through these challenges and supply our customers. We are optimistic that the situation will improve in the second half of the year. However, we expect demand to remain strong, making it difficult for the supply chain to catch up, unless the industry extends the order cycle.
Before moving to our first quarter financial performance, I wanted to take a moment to highlight a few important strategic partnerships that we announced during the first quarter. These new and expanded partnerships are consistent with our strategy to deepen our relationships with key customers in existing segments while continuing to invest in new and alternative power solutions.
As the leading independent global power solutions provider, Cummins is committed to ensuring our customers have the right solution anywhere and everywhere our customers operate by offering them a broad range of power solutions from advanced diesel, near-zero natural gas, fully electric, hydrogen and other technologies.
In February, we announced a global strategic partnership for medium-duty engine systems with Daimler Truck and Bus. As part of the partnership, Cummins will invest in the further development and global production of medium-duty engines and components for Daimler Trucks and Buses. The partnership builds on our strong existing relationship with Daimler's North American brands. In North America, Daimler will replace their vertically integrated engines with Cummins engines ahead of CARB regulations in 2024 and EPA regulations in 2027. In addition, Cummins engines will be used in Daimler medium-duty chassis in Europe, Brazil and India, coinciding with next-generation emissions regulations in those regions. In the future, global medium-duty engine systems for Daimler Trucks and Buses all over the world will be provided by Cummins.
We also announced a global medium-duty partnership and advanced engineering collaboration with Isuzu, building upon the Isuzu/Cummins power partnership formed in 2019. Isuzu trucks powered by Cummins B6.7 diesel platform engines will be introduced in North America first in 2021 and in Japan, Southeast Asia and other regions at later dates.
Finally, in March, we announced a medium-duty engine offering with Hino, where Cummins 6.7 and L9 engines will be available on Hino trucks in North America by the end of this year.
In addition to the above announcements, we continue to investigate areas in which we can strategically collaborate with global OEMs across a number of regions, technologies and power solutions. We believe these collaborations will not only allow us to significantly grow our core Engine and Components businesses, but will also further strengthen the important relationships we have with a number of OEMs and end users. These relationships, coupled with our application expertise and broad sales and service channel, will position us well to manage the transition from internal combustion engines to lower carbon hybrids and eventually to zero-emissions products in the future.
Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the first quarter of '21. And we'll cover some of our key markets, starting with North America, before moving on to our largest international markets.
Revenues for the first quarter of 2021 were $6.1 billion, an increase of 22% compared to the first quarter of 2020. EBITDA was $980 million or 16.1%, compared to $846 million or 16.9% a year ago. EBITDA dollars increased as a result of stronger sales and record joint venture income, partially offset by significantly higher premium freight and other costs associated with supply chain disruptions as well as higher variable compensation expense. Our profitability, especially in the Engine business, was impacted more than expected by supply chain disruptions due to the extraordinary measures we had to take to meet customer commitments.
Our first quarter revenues in North America grew 7% to $3.3 billion, driven by higher industry build rates of heavy-duty trucks and light-duty pickups. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the first quarter was 60,000 units, an increase of 15% from 2020 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 23,000, an increase of 25% from 2020.
Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 32,000 units in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 2% from 2020, while our unit sales were 27,000 units, an increase of 5% from 2020. We shipped 42,000 engines to Stellantis for use in their Ram pickups in the first quarter of '21, an increase of 49% from the 2020 level. Revenues for power generation grew by 10% due to higher demand in recreational vehicle and data center markets.
Our international revenues increased by 45% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to a year ago. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $2.1 billion, an increase of 95% due to the higher sales in on-highway and construction markets. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 587,000 units, an increase of 95%, driven by increased NS V prebuy ahead of a broader NS VI implementation in July of this year and an effort to secure inventory amid supply chain concerns. Our sales in units, including joint ventures, were 91,000 or an increase of 146%. The light-duty market in China increased 73% from 2020 levels to 581,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 45,000 units, an increase of 63%.
Industry demand for excavators set another quarterly record of 127,000 units in the first quarter, an increase of 84% from last year. Our units sold were 21,800 units, an increase of 107% as our customers continued to gain market share. Demand for power generation equipment in China increased 41% in the first quarter, driven by growth in data center markets and higher demand for standby power.
First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $577 million, an increase of 82% from the first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased 63%, while our shipments increased 88%, driven by better penetration with our JV partner as the heavy-duty commercial vehicle segment recovered from a year ago. Demand for power generation and construction equipment rebounded strongly in the first quarter as economic activity continued to improve. In Brazil, our revenues increased 31%, driven by increased demand in most end markets.
Now let me provide our outlook for 2021, including some comments on our individual regions and end markets. We have raised our forecast for total company revenues for 2021 to be up 20% to 24% compared to our prior guidance of up 10% at the midpoint. This guidance reflects a stronger outlook in most markets and regions. We've raised our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America to 264,000 units, up 45% compared to 2020 and above our prior guidance of 255,000 units.
Despite the supply chain constraints our industry is experiencing, demand has continued to outpace our expectations from the beginning of the year. In the medium-duty truck market, we are increasing our forecast for industry production to 140,000 units, up 35% year-over-year and above our prior guidance of 125,000 units. We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be up 15% compared to 2020, an increase of 10% from our expectations 3 months ago.
In China, we continue to expect domestic on-highway demand to decline from record levels a year ago despite the strong start to the year. However, we are increasing our outlook for medium- and heavy-duty truck market demand to 1.5 million units, compared to our expectations of 1.3 million units at the beginning of the year. This would still represent a 15% decline from 2020. In the light-duty truck market, we continue to expect a 7% reduction in demand, in line with our previous guidance. We now expect industry sales of excavators to decline 10% from the record levels achieved in 2020. This compares to our prior guidance of down 20%.
In India, we continue to project broad recovery versus 2020. We anticipate industry demand for trucks to be up 90% compared to levels experienced in 2020, and our other businesses are showing promising growth due to continued infrastructure investment. We do anticipate lower demand in all end markets in the second quarter due to new lockdowns as a result of an increase in COVID-19 cases and are monitoring the events in the ground closely. Given the rapid increase in COVID cases in India, we are very concerned about the health and safety of our employees and those of our suppliers and partners. We are continuing to operate all of our manufacturing facilities, but with robust safety measures in place.
In Brazil, we continue to forecast truck production to increase 25% in 2021. We now expect demand for mining engines to increase 45% in 2021, up from our expectation of 15% 3 months ago. And that's due to continued strength in commodity prices.
Demand for power generation equipment increased 18% in the first quarter, and we continue to see strong order activity in most geographies and segments. We are now expecting global power generation revenues to increase 15% compared to our previous forecast of about 5%, primarily driven by data center and recreational vehicle markets.
In summary, we are increasing our revenue outlook for the year with year-over-year growth expected in most major regions, except China. Demand in China remained very strong in the first quarter, but we do anticipate a weaker second half of the year, driven in part by the transition to the new National Standard VI emissions regulations for trucks beginning in July. We are increasing our EBITDA guidance range from 15.5% to 16%, compared to 15% to 15.5% at the beginning of the year, due to stronger volumes and improved outlook for JV income, which we expect to more than offset significantly higher supply chain costs.
During the quarter, we returned $615 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders for the year.
We continue to take necessary precautions at all of our facilities to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and our focus remains on the health and safety of our employees. We are optimistic that continued vaccination distribution globally will reduce the impact of the virus in the second half of the year, but there is still a risk of an increase in cases somewhere in the world that could result in lower customer demand, additional facility shutdowns or additional supply chain constraints in the future.
Having managed through an extremely challenging 2020 and a dramatic ramp-up in the first quarter of 2021, Cummins is in a strong position. We have secured some important new business wins in our Engine and Components businesses. And at the same time, we continue to invest in future growth, bringing new technologies to customers and generating strong return for shareholders.
Thank you for your time today. And now let me turn it over to Mark."
265253,710473374,2294654,"Cummins Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Cummins Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone.

There are 4 key takeaways from our first quarter results. First, we saw continued recovery in demand in most major end markets and regions, resulting in record revenues for the first quarter and a much stronger full year outlook. Second, the elevated level of demand across our markets have strained global supply chains in our industry, resulting in higher premium freight costs and other associated inefficiencies higher than we anticipated at the start of the year. The strength of demand, order backlogs and lack of inventory in the pipeline indicate that some level of elevated costs are likely to continue in the coming quarters.
Despite the cost headwinds associated with the tight supply chain, we delivered solid profitability and cash flows in the first quarter and have raised significantly our outlook for the full year. And finally, we returned $615 million to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year.
Now let me go into more details on the first quarter. First quarter revenues were $6.1 billion, an increase of 22% from a year ago. Sales in North America grew 7%, and international revenues rose 45%. Currency movements positively impacted revenues by around 1%. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, were $980 million or 16.1% of sales for the quarter, compared to $846 million or 16.9% of sales a year ago. EBITDA dollars increased due to the benefits of higher volumes and stronger earnings from joint ventures in China. EBITDA percent declined primarily due to a weaker gross margin percent.
Gross margin of $1.5 billion or 24.4% of sales increased by $192 million but declined as a percent of sales by 140 basis points. First quarter gross margins included approximately $105 million of additional freight, labor and logistics costs associated with disruptions across our supply chain. We expect elevated costs to continue at least through the second quarter and have incorporated additional costs into our full year guidance. Partially offsetting these supply chain efficiencies was a $44 million positive change in estimate and our product coverage expense, reflecting lower costs across several products, primarily in our Components and Power Systems businesses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $28 million and our research expenses increased by $22 million, and both increased primarily due to higher variable compensation expense. In 2020, our variable compensation plan work is designed, flexing down due to the weaker outlook associated with the impact of the global pandemic. And in 2021, variable compensation expenses are expected to be higher for the company and all individual segments, consistent with our forecast for improved full year profitability this year.
Joint venture income was a record $166 million in the first quarter, up from $129 million a year ago. Continued strong demand for trucks and construction equipment in China led to the strong performance. And as a reminder, joint venture income in the first quarter last year included a $37 million benefit related to changes in tax law in India and income of $18 million from a technical fee also in India that did not repeat this year. Adjusting for these onetime items in 2020 underscores just how strong the earnings growth was in the first quarter from our joint ventures.
Other income decreased by $46 million from a year ago, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses of $32 million on the investments that underpin our nonqualified benefit plans, and this compares to a $17 million mark-to-market gain in the first quarter last year. The mark-to-market losses were recorded within eliminations and not allocated to our operating segments.
Net earnings for the quarter were $603 million or $4.07 per diluted share, compared to $511 million or $3.41 a year ago. The increase is primarily due to stronger after-tax earnings and a lower share count as a result of the share repurchase activity. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 22%.
Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $339 million, compared to $379 million a year ago. Stronger earnings were more than offset by an increase in working capital associated with our revenue growth this year.
I'll now comment on segment performance and our revised guidance for 2021. For the Engine segment, first quarter revenues increased by 14% from a year ago, driven by growth in demand for trucks in the U.S. and construction equipment in China. EBITDA decreased from 16.9% to 14.4% of sales. The Engine business bore the brunt of the premium freight costs and other associated efficiencies arising from supply chain disruptions. We now expect full year revenues to be up 23% to 27%, an increase from our prior guidance of up 12%, primarily driven by stronger demand in North American truck and global construction markets.
We have increased our forecast for EBITDA margins to be in the range of 14.5% to 15% as we anticipate stronger volumes, and higher than previously expected joint venture income will more than offset the additional supply chain costs.
In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 1% from a year ago in the first quarter. The EBITDA was flat as a percent of sales at 8.7% of the benefits of our North American transformation work and improvements in some of our international businesses, somewhat offset by weaker part sales resulting from supply chain challenges. Underlying demand for parts remains strong. We have maintained our 2021 outlook for Distribution revenues to be up 6% to 10%. And we now expect EBITDA to be 9% at the midpoint of our guidance, below our prior year guidance of 10.1%  due to a reduced outlook of parts and stronger demand for power generation equipment and other engine sales. 
Components revenues increased 43% in the first quarter, driven by stronger demand for trucks in North America, China, India and Europe. EBITDA increased from 18.6% of sales to 19.6% due to the benefit from stronger sales and lower product coverage costs. 2021, we now expect components revenues to increase 30% to 34%, up from our prior guidance of up 11%. And we've raised our forecast for EBITDA margins to 17% at the midpoint, up from 14.9%.
In Power Systems, revenues increased 16% in the first quarter, driven by stronger global demand for power generation and mining equipment. EBITDA increased from 8.7% to 12.3% of sales, primarily due to the benefits of higher volumes and lower product coverage costs. We now expect Power Systems revenues to be up 18% at the midpoint compared to our prior year guidance of 9%. EBITDA margins are projected to be in the range of 11% to 11.5% of sales, up from our prior guidance of 10.6%, due primarily due to the stronger sales outlook and lower cost of quality.
In the New Power segment, revenues increased to $35 million, up 250% due to stronger sales of battery electric systems, fuel cells and electrolyzers. The EBITDA losses for the quarter were $51 million, in line with our expectations as we continue to invest in new products and scale up ahead of widespread adoption of the new technologies.
For the full year, we're maintaining our New Power revenue outlook at $110 million to $130 million, and we also expect net expense to be in the range of $200 million at the midpoint of our guidance.
The net impact of the changes to individual segment projections is that we forecast total company revenues to be up 20% to 24% in 2021, up from our prior guidance of up 10%. We're raising our forecast for company EBITDA margins to be between 15.5% and 16%, compared to our previous guidance of 15% to 15.5%. This increase is primarily driven by the stronger sales outlook, which we anticipate will drive incremental earnings that more than offset the increased supply chain costs.
We now expect earnings from joint ventures to be down 5% this year compared to our prior forecast of down 25% to 30%. Continued strength in China truck and construction markets, especially in the first half of the year, is the primary reason for the increase in our forecast. We currently project that the first quarter will mark the high point for joint venture earnings this year, with results expected to ease in subsequent quarters and particularly the second half of the year, post adoption of the new National Standard VI on-highway emissions regulations in China in July. We're projecting our effective tax rate to be 20%, 25% this year -- 22.5%, excluding any discrete items.
Capital expenditures were $87 million in the quarter, up from $75 million a year ago. We expect that our 2021 capital investments will be in the range of $725 million to $775 million, unchanged from prior year guidance. As Tom mentioned, we returned $615 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase, in line with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow this year.
To summarize, we delivered strong results in the first quarter, have increased both our sales and profitability outlook for the year. Supply chain tightness, along with the ongoing impact of COVID-19 will continue to present challenges in the coming weeks and months. I want to thank all of our employees for their commitment to support our customers through these challenges and deliver strong full year financial results. We will continue to prioritize investing in the products and technologies that will drive profitable growth and return capital to shareholders while improving the day-to-day performance of the company. 
Thank you for your interest today, and let me turn it back now to Jack."

So we are seeing a rising outlook for most end markets that are going to benefit the Components business, which has a leadership position in global markets. So it's not just China.

So we are seeing a rising outlook for most end markets that are going to benefit the Components business, which has a leadership position in global markets. So it's not just China. You're right, China has definitely helped that business where we have consolidated operations that's benefited our results. That's primarily in the first half of the year. The impact of that strength in China is expected to ease in subsequent quarters in the second half of the year.
I'll come back and talk about the overall joint venture income for the company rather than just Components in a moment. So yes, that's stronger volume, the Components business is doing a good job of converting that to additional profitability. And then the second thing is the Components business did benefit from lower quality costs and a positive change in estimate in our product coverage or warranty expense in the first quarter, which boosted the results a little bit, which is why the full year margin is a little bit below the first quarter level of performance.
India, yes, India was an important contributor. We had consolidated revenues of around about $600 million in China and India combined for the Components business in the first quarter. So kind of an annualized $2.5 billion business. We expect that could drop from that rate in the second half of the year by as much as 40%, depending on the impact of demand. On the other hand, supply chain permitting, we're expecting, obviously, the North America demand to continue to improve.
If I now circle back up to the total company picture, really, the story is the same on China that we expect a significant dropoff in the second half of the year. We don't have great visibility into that. That's an assumption right now. Q1 remains stronger than we'd anticipated 3 months ago.
But there is -- there are some signs of concern. There's elevated inventory levels. Obviously, the price of trucks goes up with the introduction of the new emissions regulations. So we baked in kind of a 40% to 50% dropoff in the earnings run rate quarterly in the second half of the year from where we are today. So hopefully, that wraps up the big picture on China."

Here's what I would say is, broadly speaking, as we've said in previous calls, we are talking now to every OEM about their technology requirements going from today all the way through the eventual transition to zero carbon. And those technologies include diesel and more advanced versions of diesel, natural gas, hybrid, electric and fuel cell. And as I've also said before, for many of them, the diesel side looks less viable from an investment point of view just because their volumes are relatively smaller than ours and most ranges -- but certainly in midrange. So that's, I think, why you're seeing the announcements you're seeing.
In addition, though, we are offering them the other technologies, including transition technologies, to help them figure out how to get from where they are now to a place that's a viable zero carbon solution down the road.
I would say that all those conversations are all going on, but it's difficult now for OEMs to understand what the timing of those transitions will look like and exactly what their technology approach wants to be, just as it is for most market watchers. It's hard because the viability of those technologies in terms of cost depends on either carbon tax or regulations or something else coming into play because still, diesel is quite a bit cheaper than those other solutions today. And of course, it's providing improved fuel economy with every generation.
So yes, those conversations, as you suggest, are going on. But I would just say that, for the most part, we're doing work with folks. But what exactly their plans are going to be and what role we're going to play in those future technologies is still being talked about. Whereas the diesel stuff is moving now because they have to make investment choices today. Do I invest in the new platform? Or do I have someone else invest?"

The relative volume of our customers versus ours is dramatically different in midrange. It's not -- it is different in heavy-duty, too. We clearly have a larger position, but it's not as big a difference.
So those conversations are likely to take longer. And it's not as easy a call for an OEM on heavy-duty as it is on medium-duty. That said, they still have platform investments to make and as do we.

I probably don't need to identify myself. I'm the only female on the call. Of course, our strategy with our partners has been to offer engines where that's what they would like us to supply. And when we don't supply engines, we often supply components to them from our Components business.
So when we look at these new partnerships on the Engine side, in some cases, we have the Components business already. For some of our other components, though, it will provide incremental growth opportunity for us. And then, of course, we also extend those partnership conversations on components where they continue to do their own engine. So we do see good growth opportunity as a result of these deeper partnerships on both the Engine and Component side."

Here's what I think is that, not surprisingly, some of the new companies that are starting up that are pure plays and in low-carbon technologies, having trouble, demonstrating a business model that works now. That's not surprising because the volume is really low. I mean it's -- people know the transitions are coming at some point, but they're not viable without regs or some other kind of carbon tax or something that moves the needle. So they're struggling to show a business model. That shouldn't surprise anyone. That's how it is.
And our view is that we are well positioned to provide people with solutions today, solutions that are kind of transition kind of solutions, natural gas and hybrid and then final solutions. And so we hope that proves to be the best answer, and we think investors do well to find companies like us who can take the whole -- make the whole lap.
But again, I think the timing of how that's going to work and what's going to -- whether supply chain is changing people's mind or it's just the business models that don't look viable, I'm not sure. But I noticed the same thing you do, that there is volatility both in the capital flows and the values of these companies and also in their perception of success. And I'm sure they'll have a brighter day as well as they have a cloudy day today. We just think we have the most robust solution at Cummins."

And so we believe working with OEMs that we'll be able to get those costs and those infrastructure in place, but we'll need infrastructure. We'll need other investments by governments and other things to get that done.
So in the meantime, these interim solutions are going to play a significant role. And how long interim is isn't clear, and it could be extended. So our view is that natural gas and hybrid and some of these other technologies that we have will really help our customers get through those periods, which, again, could be -- we could sell across our range of 1 billion engines in those ranges before -- transition could be 1 billion engines.

So the market for the year is a little bit higher than we had originally forecasted, and we really think that is strong demand in the first half of the year. So we're seeing growing demand for the NS V product ahead of the transition that happens in July. And that prebuy as well as the challenges in the supply chain is driving our OEMs to build as much as possible at this point.
One other dynamic that we think is going to impact going in the second half of the year is that some regions have extended the period with which NS V product can be registered. So as we go into Q3, we're going to see inventory of NS V product starting to reduce. And then we're really watching to see how quickly customers start to buy that NS VI product given it will come at a higher price with the added content. And so that is really the dynamic strength in the first half of the year, and then we're anticipating the drop in the second half of the year.

They have launch dates, and they will be launched this -- in these next several years. We will have hybrids on the road. We will be selling them through our key strategic OEMs. So hybrids are on the move, as you suggested. And again, their life mostly depends on how the zero carbon solutions come down in cost and durability, reliability and how the infrastructure gets built up, and we'll need both.
So I think that's why I said that these transition solutions that are going in place, well, may be in there for a while and they may be in there for a shorter period, depending on which country, which application, which region you're in because those 2 things -- both the infrastructure and the cost depend on application and, of course, country and how much infrastructure being built. But the hybrid programs are real. They are getting launched. It's happening now.
And with regard to engine size, I think, initially, what we'll see with hybrids is there'll be relatively mild hybrid, the first step. And those won't make a big difference on engine. How big the engine is won't be impacted very much by the size of the battery. But you are right that as you add larger batteries, then you need less engine to carry the same load.

You name it, and we have a shortage on it. But semiconductors is the biggie. That's the one that's really hard to deal with. And in this quarter, we ended up buying chips on the market, through the aftermarket and bringing them back into production. We rescheduled and rescheduled and rescheduled to meet our customers' demand.
Our customers, after a pretty tough first half of last year, are finally seeing demand go up and really want to ship trucks to their customers. And we really want to help them do that. So frankly, we took it on the chin. We basically brought in everything we could as fast as we could and shipped it out to them and didn't raise prices or didn't do any of those things. We just shipped them. And we took it, took it hard this quarter. And that's just the honest truth. And it's because we felt a commitment to those customers to get them the product best we could while the going was good.
And so we're not really changing any of that other than hopefully, as Jennifer said, we're going to get these costs better under control as we don't have to reschedule so much.

I'll start with a summary our second quarter financial results and our market trends by region and then finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2021. Mark will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. Demand remained strong in the second quarter as the global economy continued to improve, driving strong sales growth across most businesses and regions and resulting in solid profitability. We are encouraged by economic trends across a number of our key end markets, which point to strong demand for the remainder of this year and extending into 2022. 
In North America, freight activity continues to grow, leading to elevated spot and contract rates and driving fleet profitability and a rising backlog of truck orders. Leading indicators for nonresidential construction continue to improve. And the fiscal support for investment in capital projects is robust, led by North America and Europe. Iron ore, copper and thermal coal prices also remain high, supporting positive outlook for mining. Cummins is well positioned to benefit as these markets gain momentum due to our leading global position across a number of end markets, and we continue to see demand for our products outpace our competition. 
Before getting into our results, I want to take a moment to highlight a number of partnerships and strategic milestones in the evolution of our next-generation technologies. In May, we formed a partnership with Iberdrola, a leading global producer of renewable power to accelerate the global growth of business opportunities in the electrolyzer market and especially in Europe with a focus on the Iberian Peninsula. The alliance will help position Cummins as a leading supplier of electrolyzer system for large-scale projects in Europe. As part of our alliance, Cummins will be the electrolyzer supplier for a 230-megawatt project for a leading fertilizer producer that will serve as a benchmark for large PEM scale electrolysis globally. We signed a joint venture with Sinopec [indiscernible] in June, which will accelerate the affordability and availability of green hydrogen in China through development of hydrogen-generation projects and increasing manufacturing capacity of electrolyzers and other key products in the green hydrogen supply chain. As one of the largest hydrogen suppliers in China, Sinopec's annual hydrogen production reaches 3.5 million tonnes, accounting for 14% of total China's total hydrogen production. China's embrace of green hydrogen is great for the planet. And Cummins and Sinopec joining together to realize the potential of green hydrogen is a huge leap forward for scaling our innovative PEM electrolyzer systems. 
We recently announced a strategic collaboration with Chevron to develop commercially viable business opportunities in hydrogen and other alternative energy sources. The MOU provides the framework for Chevron and Cummins to initially collaborate on 4 main objectives: first, advancing public policy that promotes hydrogen as a decarbonizing solution for transportation and industry; building market demand for commercial vehicles and industrial applications powered by hydrogen; developing infrastructure to support the use of hydrogen for industry and fuel cell vehicles; and fourth, exploring opportunities to leverage Cummins' electrolyzer and fuel cell technologies at one or more of Chevron's domestic refineries. The partnership with Chevron allows us to scale low carbon fuel delivery and build hydrogen corridors for use by fuel cell vehicles. In addition, we can work with Chevron to decarbonize parts of their operations using our green hydrogen technology. 
Finally, last week, Cummins announced the signing of an MOU with Air Products to work together to begin the transition of Air Products' heavy-duty tractor fleet to zero emissions vehicles in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Cummins will provide hydrogen fuel cell electric powertrains integrated into selective -- selected OEM partners' heavy-duty trucks for use by Air Products. The project will take a phased approach to transition Air Products fleet to hydrogen fuel cell electric powertrains, starting with 5 demonstration units to be delivered in Europe and North America by the end of next year. 
Following successful demonstration, the project includes ramp-ups, which -- with a total of 2,000 trucks to be delivered by the middle of the decade. This represents among the largest orders for fuel cell vehicles to date, and we will be working with a partner that has deep expertise in the generation, transportation and use of hydrogen. 
We've now deployed more than 2,000 fuel cells and 600 electrolyzers around the world as we continue the development of our hydrogen business. In addition to accelerating our revenue momentum via these important strategic ownerships, we are also building out our electrolyzer capacity, targeting the regions which we expect to be at the forefront of green hydrogen production and commercial adoption. Site selection search within the Guadalajara area of Castilla, La Mancha in Spain is currently underway for approximately $60 million PEM electrolyzer manufacturing plant that will house system assembly and testing for approximately 500 megawatts per year of electrolyzer reduction and will be scalable to more than 1 gigawatt per year. Cummins NZ, the JV we signed in conjunction with Sinopec, will be located in Foshan, Guangdong province in China. The JV will initially invest $47 million to locate a manufacturing plant to produce PEM electrolyzers. The plant will open with a manufacturing capacity of 500 megawatts of electrolyzers per year, but will also be scalable to more than 1 gigawatt per year. These investments, in addition to our build-outs underway at our current facilities in Belgium and Canada, will position us to have nearly 2 gigawatts of capacity by the middle of the decade with the flexibility to scale up as demand accelerates. 
In the battery electric space, we continue to produce and sell fully electric powertrains in first-mover markets such as transit, school bus and yard spotters. Cummins is collaborating with PepsiCo's Frito-Lay on a electric demonstration truck for a pickup and delivery application that has been running daily routes since last November. This truck will be showcased at the upcoming North American Council for freight efficiencies electric truck demonstration. We are well positioned with our deep market expertise in electric powertrain technology and are continuously evaluating how we can adapt and improve to meet customer demand and market trends as the technology matures. This includes next-generation battery electric systems to balance the durability needs of our customers while focusing on delivering products at a compelling price point. We are also continuing to explore new partnerships to enhance our capabilities, improve our cost position and drive more volume and scale into the business. 
In addition to these important milestones for our New Power business, we are investing in our Engine and Components businesses to develop advanced diesel and alternative fuel products, which will be critical to meeting customer and regulatory requirements in the coming years. We announced the signing of an LOI to acquire a 50% equity interest in Momentum Fuel Technologies. The joint venture between Rush Enterprises and Cummins will produce Cummins-branded natural gas fuel delivery systems for the commercial vehicle market in North America, combining the strength of Momentum Fuel Technologies compressed natural gas fuel delivery systems Cummins powertrain expertise and the engineering and support infrastructure of both companies. We have seen increasing interest over last year and expect natural gas powertrains to become an increasingly popular choice for end users due to both a compelling total cost of ownership as well as the environmental benefit of such powertrains, especially when utilizing renewable natural gas sources. 
We also began testing of a hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine for heavy-duty truck applications, building on Cummins' existing technology leadership in gases fuel applications and powertrain leadership to create a new power solution to help customers meet the energy environmental needs of the future. The hydrogen engine program can potentially expand the technology options available to achieve a more sustainable transport sector complementing our capabilities in hydrogen fuel cell, battery electric and renewable gas powertrains. 
We are committed to bringing customers the right solution at the right time. Doing so requires us to maintain a broad portfolio of power solutions to meet our diverse customers' needs and to minimize total carbon emissions throughout the energy transition. 
Now I'll comment on the overall company performance for the second quarter of 2021 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our logos international markets. Revenues for the second quarter of 2021 were $6.1 billion, an increase of 59% compared to the second quarter of 2020. EBITDA was $974 million or 15.9% compared to $549 million or 14.3% a year ago. EBITDA increased as a result of stronger global demand and higher joint venture income, partly offset by significantly higher premium freight and other costs associated with supply chain disruptions in addition to higher compensation costs. Our global markets experienced an unprecedented shock from the impact of COVID-19 during the second quarter of last year. And while we have been encouraged by the ongoing recovery across all of our global markets, our industry continues to experience significant constraints across the supply chain, leading to an extended period of inefficiencies and higher costs. Despite these supply chain impacts, though, we are continuing to deliver strong financial performance while supporting our customers. The ability to supply our customers remains our key focus now. And while we are optimistic that the supply chain constraints will ease with time, they are likely to persist through the end of the year. 
Our second quarter revenues in North America grew 74% to $3.5 billion, driven by higher industry build rates across all on-highway markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the second quarter was 67,000 units, an increase of 180% from 2020 levels. While our heavy-duty unit sales were $23,000, an increase of 217% from 2020. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 29,000 units in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 94% from 2020 levels. While our unit sales were 22,000 units, an increase of 85% from 2020. We shipped 42,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the Ram pickups in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 272% from 2020 levels. Revenues for Power Generation grew by 48% due to higher demand in recreational vehicle, standby power and data center markets. 
Our international revenues increased by 42% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to a year ago. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $2.1 billion, an increase of 8% due to higher sales in power generation and mining markets. We also experienced a higher penetration rate with our joint venture partners in the heavy and medium-duty on-highway markets as they prepare for broader implementation of NS VI in July of this year. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 566,000 units, a decrease of 4%, but still well above replacement, driven by continued prebuy of NS V trucks, ahead of the broader implementation of the new NS VI standards in July of this year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were 85,000 units, a decrease of 5% versus the second quarter of 2020. 
The light-duty market in China decreased 8% from 2020 levels to 614,000 units. While our units sold, including joint ventures, were 38,000, a decrease of 28%, driven by supply chain constraints, particularly in these lighter displacement vehicles. Industry demand for excavators in the second quarter was 97,000 units, a decrease of 5% from very high 2020 levels. Our units sold were 16,800 units, a decrease of 7%. 
The demand for power generation equipment in China increased 47% in the second quarter, driven by growth in data center markets and other standby power markets. We continue to hold a leading market position in the data center segment, driven by strong end-user relationships and a compelling product offering in that space. 
Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $392 million, an increase of 219% from the second quarter of 2020 despite experiencing a terrible second wave of COVID-19 during this period. Industry truck production increased by 468% while our shipments increased 535% as our joint venture partner continued to gain share. Demand for power generation and construction equipment rebounded strongly in the second quarter compared to a very low base a year ago. We remain encouraged by the continued economic recovery, driven by anticipated government infrastructure spending. In Brazil, our revenues increased 175%, driven by increased demand in most end markets. 
Now let me quickly cover our outlook for 2021. Based on our current forecast, we are maintaining full year 2021 revenue guidance of up 20% to 24% versus last year. EBITDA is still expected to be in the range of 15.5% to 16%. And the company expects to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders in 2021 in the form of dividend and share repurchases. And summing up the quarter, strong demand across many of our key markets drove continued sales growth in the second quarter and resulted in solid profitability. We have secured important new partnerships in our New Power segment. At the same time, we continue to invest in bringing new technologies to customers, outgrowing our end markets and providing strong cash returns to our shareholders. 
Before passing it over to Mark, I want to take a moment to highlight an important announcement we included in our earnings press release this morning regarding our expiration of our strategic alternatives for the Filtration business. Cummins Filtration is a premier filtration platform and a technology leader specializing in filtration products used in heavy-, medium-duty and light-duty trucks, industrial equipment and power generation systems. The business generated revenues of approximately $1.2 billion in 2020 and remains well positioned for continued growth, sustained margin performance and strong free cash flow generation. Cummins Filtration has a strong global footprint with leading positions in North America, India and China and a significant presence in other key markets supported by long-standing local partnerships. We are exploring a range of options to unlock significant shareholder value, including the separation of Filtration into a stand-alone company with a dedicated management team who are well positioned to drive the business forward and diversify its business, leveraging strong technology portfolio and footprint. The execution of this exploration process is dependent upon business and market conditions, of course, along with a number of other factors and considerations. And any costs associated with the evaluation of these alternatives for the Filtration business has been excluded from our financial outlook. We plan to share a lot more about this and other elements of our strategy during our Analyst Day on February 23. Our purpose in delaying this event from November this year until spring is to be able to hold it in person, and we will provide more details as we get closer to the February 23 date. 
Thank you for your time today, and let me turn it over to Mark."
265253,1673167786,2360706,"Cummins Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Cummins Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. There are 4 key takeaways from our second quarter operating results. First, underlying demand remains strong, outpacing supply and increasing backlogs in some of our largest markets. Number two, global supply ch",1511,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. There are 4 key takeaways from our second quarter operating results. First, underlying demand remains strong, outpacing supply and increasing backlogs in some of our largest markets. Number two, global supply chains remain constrained due to the elevated levels of demand and complications arising from COVID, resulting in higher premium freight costs and other associated inefficiencies than we anticipated 3 months ago. We delivered solid profitability and cash flows in the first half of the year despite the continued cost headwinds associated with tight supply chain. And for the full year, we are maintaining our revenue and profitability guidance. And fourthly, we returned $860 million to shareholders in the quarter through cash dividends and share repurchases and $1.48 billion for the first half of the year, consistent with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year. 
Now let me go into more details on the second quarter. Second quarter revenues were $6.1 billion, an increase of 59% from a year ago when the impact of COVID-19 was at its most severe. Sales in North America grew 74% and international revenues rose 42%. Currency positively impacted revenues by 3%, driven primarily by a weaker U.S. dollar. 
EBITDA was $974 million or 15.9% of sales for the quarter compared to $549 million or 14.3% of sales a year ago. EBITDA increased primarily due to the benefits of higher volumes and stronger earnings from our joint ventures in China and India, partially offset by higher product coverage costs and higher compensation expenses primarily variable compensation. 
Gross margin of $1.5 billion or 24.2% of sales increased by $588 million or 110 basis points, primarily driven by the higher volumes. Global supply chain tightness continued in the second quarter and resulted in approximately $100 million of additional freight, labor and logistics costs. We expect these costs to remain elevated in the second half of the year with demand projected to remain strong, supply tight and some increase in logistics and transportation costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $130 million or 28% due to higher compensation expenses. And research expenses increased by $87 million or 46% from a year ago. As a reminder, due to the significant uncertainty at the onset of COVID-19, we implemented temporary salary reductions in April of last year that lasted through the end of September last year. Salary reductions resulted in approximately $75 million of pretax savings for the company in the second quarter of 2020 across gross margin, selling, admin and research expenses. 
In addition, our variable compensation plan worked as designed, flexing down in the face of weaker economic conditions last year and flexing up with stronger financial performance this year. All operating segments experienced higher compensation costs than a year ago for these 2 primary reasons. 
Joint venture income was $137 million in the second quarter, up from $115 million a year ago. Strong demand for trucks and construction equipment in China as well as a broad recovery in other international markets led to the improved profitability versus a year ago. Other income increased by $30 million from a year ago due to a number of positive items, including a onetime $18 million gain on the sale of some land in India, which benefited our Distribution segment. Net earnings for the quarter were $600 million or $4.10 per diluted share compared to $276 million or $1.86 from a year ago, primarily due to stronger after-tax earnings driven by stronger volumes. The gain on the sale of land in India contributed $0.05 of earnings per share this quarter. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.4%. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $616 million compared to an outflow of $22 million a year ago. Stronger earnings and dividends received from joint ventures more than offset increases in working capital. 
I'll now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2021, which is unchanged from 3 months ago. For the Engine segment, second quarter revenues increased by 75%, driven by increased demand for trucks in the U.S. and construction equipment in U.S. and Europe. EBITDA increased from 10.5% to 16.1% of sales, primarily driven by higher volumes and lower product coverage expense, which more than offset higher costs and inefficiencies associated with global supply chain challenges. And although supply chain costs in this segment remain elevated from a year ago, they did improve a little from first quarter levels. We expect full year revenues to be up 23% to 27% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 14.5% to 15% for the Engine segment. 
In Distribution, revenues increased 20% from a year ago. And EBITDA increased as a percent of sales from 10% to 10.5%, primarily due to stronger performance in North America. We have maintained our outlook for segment revenue growth to be up 6% to 10% and EBITDA margins to be 9% at the midpoint of our guidance. 
In the Components business, revenues increased 73% in the second quarter, driven primarily by stronger demand for trucks in North America. EBITDA increased from 12.3% of sales to 15.1% due to the benefits of stronger volumes, partially offset by higher product coverage costs. For the full year 2021, we expect Components revenue to increase 30% to 34% and EBITDA to be 17% at the midpoint. 
In the Power Systems segment, revenues increased 47% in the second quarter, driven by stronger global demand for power generation and mining equipment. EBITDA increased from 11.7% to 12.2% of sales, primarily due to the benefits of higher volumes and lower product coverage expenses. We are maintaining our Power Systems guidance of revenues up 16% to 20% and EBITDA margin in the range of 11% to 11.5% of sales. 
In the New Power segment, revenues increased to $24 million, up 140% due to stronger sales of battery electric systems and fuel cells. EBITDA losses for the quarter were $60 million, in line with our expectations as we continue to invest in new products and scale up ahead of widespread adoption of the new technologies. Full year, we currently project New Power revenues of $110 million to $130 million and EBITDA losses to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. Total company guidance remains unchanged, with revenues to grow between 20% and 24% and EBITDA margin to be between 15.5% and 16% for the full year. EBITDA [indiscernible] for the first half of the year was 16%. Some of the key factors expected to influence second half profitability are the piece of improvement in truck production in North America, the rate of decline in demand in China and the performance of the global supply chain. We now expect earnings from joint ventures to be up 10% in 2021 compared to our prior year guidance of down 5%. Stronger-than-expected demand in China truck and construction markets, especially in the second quarter, is the primary reason for the increase in our forecast. So joint venture earnings are expected to ease in the second half of the year with industry truck sales expected to decline following the broader adoption of the new National Standard VI on highway emissions regulations in China in July. And we also anticipate a softening of demand for construction equipment coming off all-time high levels in the first half of the year. 
Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5%, excluding discrete items, down from our prior guidance of 22.5%. Due to the mix of geographic earnings, CapEx -- capital expenditures were $125 million in the quarter, up from $77 million a year ago. And we expect our full year capital expenditures to be at the high end of our range of $725 million to $775 million for the full year. 
We returned $869 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter, bringing our total cash returns to $1.48 billion for the first half -- excuse me for my dry throat. To summarize, we delivered strong results in the second quarter despite continued supply chain constraints and elevated costs. Demand currently exceeds supply in a number of important markets, pointing to strong demand for our products into 2022. 
I want to thank our global employees for their ongoing commitment to meet the needs of our customers while delivering solid financial performance. We continue to extend our leadership position through advancing the technologies that power the profitability of our customers today and will continue to do so for some time to come. This sets the company up to further increase the earnings power of our core business while we continue to invest in a range of new technologies and develop new partnerships that position the company for additional growth. Our strong balance sheet focused on improving performance cycle-over-cycle and consistent cash flow generation means that we can sustain important investments for the future through periods of economic uncertainty and distribute excess cash to shareholders.

I guess, Tom, a couple of more strategic questions. Just on the Filtration business, can you remind us where the margins of this business are and just your thoughts on timing and what this business could achieve as a stand-alone public company versus being part of Cummins? Or is it more likely that this asset would be interesting to someone else? 
And then I guess my second question, I appreciate a lot of the color that you spent on New Power systems and some of the relationships that have emerged. I'm just wondering, as you're thinking about business today, a lot of the growth obviously has been organic. Is there an inorganic opportunity here within New Power systems over the next sort of 12 to 18 months that could potentially perhaps accelerate where this business would go longer term in terms of earning a profit, et cetera, or in technology?"

The the answer is that the profitability of Filtration is pretty much in line with the Components business. The segment and the business are very similar. And the strategic logic is simple. It's a great business, by the way, very profitable, great cash flow, a terrific leadership team. And we've done a lot of improvement in that business over the last few years, which has really improved its financial performance as well as its operating performance. And so we're -- we feel like it's operating on all cylinders, really, just for an engine analogy there. But the challenge is that looking forward, the opportunities to grow shareholder value look primarily to us in diversification. The number of technology innovations for the truck business or for our end markets look like they're limited in front of us. Whereas the opportunities to take that technology platform and global footprint to other filtration segments look significant. And when we think about using our shareholders' capital to invest in those other segments, the logic isn't as clear. 
What is clear, though, that the company has come to a size and performance level now where we think it can stand on its own or it could be part of a big -- another bigger company that plans more diversification and other end markets. We are looking at all those options. We're exploring everything from a sale to a spin to a -- to some other kind of strategic option. What we want to do most of all, though, is realize value for common shareholders. We know that when we're the best owner and can make the most of the assets, we're going to do that. And when we're no longer the best owner, then we need to confront that, too. And that's what we're trying to do here is just create value for shareholders and be direct about it. Again, it's -- the business is doing great. The management team is outstanding. We're really proud of the achievements of that business. We just think it can operate separately from us more effectively going forward. 
Then with regard to New Power, and thanks for your comments on the strategic milestones, we have achieved a lot already. And we are exploring organic/inorganic partnership options all the time. It is such a fast-moving area. There's so much development to do in infrastructure. Just the product technology, the availability of fuel, there's so much to do to decarbonize the automotive industry, no less all the other commercial industrial industries that we're in, that there's no lack of potential partnerships and opportunities. We are, though, scanning always for inorganic options, too. As you know, some of the some of the valuations were elevated to a point where they were really just almost silly. But that said, that isn't always true now. And we are always scanning for acquisitions that we think can position us strategically more -- better position us from a scale point of view. You heard me mention that in our battery electric section that there is a scale advantage to be gained both in hydrogen and electric. If we can get enough volume on some of those products, we can drive down costs significantly, that depends in part on whether the technology is viable in the application or not. And that's why we're doing so much focus on what are the first-mover markets and where can we actually get scale. And then if we can do that and then an acquisition can help, we'll do it."

But what I can say is that, as I mentioned in my announcement, that the project that we've got planned with with IBERDROLA in Spain for the fertilizer will be the largest of its kind. And so we are seeing significant ramp-up already, especially in Europe. That's where, in Europe, there's the combination of low-cost renewable power, combined with European money supporting projects that decarbonize industrial uses of hydrogen is really driving -- is the primary driver of demand. And we see some of that now beginning to form in China, same idea, decarbonizing industrial uses of hydrogen. So there's already big consumers of hydrogen. They already -- people already buy a lot, but it's produced using natural gas through SMR. And this supply chain, the screen, hydrogen supply chain takes renewable power through a PEM electrolyzer like ours and then turns it -- makes the hydrogen low carbon or zero carbon. And that's kind of the biggest drive for electrolyzers today."

These are vehicles which will be built for purpose to have fuel cell electric vehicle powertrains. As you guessed, the big development area there is to have electric infrastructure in the truck already. And then when you -- then you can put the fuel cell in and take advantage of the electric powertrain or the electric infrastructure in the truck. And that's still under development. Most of the trucks that we put out now, the electric infrastructure is either a prototype version or is -- has not been fully productionized yet. And I'd say our early versions will still be that. But truck makers are electrifying vehicles at a reasonably rapid rate, at least for -- in relatively small volumes. So we expect those platforms to improve over time. And we will be forming partnerships with OEMs to deliver those trucks. And my view is that the reason you haven't seen more partnerships already is just isn't very much demand. So -- and everyone is trying to figure out what to do with their scarce engineering resources. So I use them on developing advanced diesel, natural gas, renewable natural gas, electric, fuel cell electric. And since I can't do all at once, which ones do I do first, second and third? So we believe that truck makers will be ready to work with us on fuel cell vehicles when there's demand. So that's why we're excited about an end-user like Air Products, high-quality company, knows hydrogen really well, wants to make their fleet fuel cells. So I think that's going to increase truck makers' interest in trying to figure out how to fulfill this order."

David, Jennifer here. I'll comment a little bit about what we're seeing right now. As you heard from Mark and Tom, and it's happening across the industry, supply chain and really ramping up to keep up with the demand we see in this aftermarket has has paced our ability to supply it. Just -- our teams have done a phenomenal job working closely with customers suppliers and to minimize that impact to deliver the results that we did in the second quarter. We see that [indiscernible] in many places quarter-over-quarter, so improving through the back half of the year and into '22. Microprocessors, like others in our industry and other industries continues to be the biggest constraint. Our demands are relatively small in the broader picture of microprocessor supply. And we had expected to see some improvement in June. With COVID in Malaysia, that's delayed slightly. But that, we think, will ease in the second half of the year. So we're -- see an improvement in the second half end markets as we see the supply chains ease. From a price perspective, right now, we're anticipating our price to cost to be 30 basis points favorable for this year. And that is down from 40 to 50 basis points positive in our prior guidance really because of those increased costs that we're seeing in materials, logistics and premium freight. And we are working to mitigate that with some of our contractual things on the material side, hedging and also looking at pricing and surcharges where possible and first [indiscernible] aftermarket. So we won't comment more on '22 at this point, but we do expect to see some improvements both in cost coming down and getting some more recovery into the second half of the year."

I think like a lot of companies, the continued outbreaks of COVID around the world and now the delta variant just keep throwing more curveballs into the system because you see labor shortages. We see other things. And so some of these costs, as Jen mentioned, we'd expected it to go from 100 in the first quarter to 30 in the second quarter and then be gone. And so now we're about talking almost hundred -- almost $300 million for the year. So that just -- I want to be clear. That's a big hit to what we really generally expected. The thing, I guess, I wanted to highlight is that our company continues to earn good margins despite that by finding other ways to do it. We've been able to price in the aftermarket, and we still have a big opportunity going forward in that. We're -- as Jen said, we'll be able to add material cost adjustments to our -- contractually as we move forward, roll forward in the quarter. And just the sheer effort by our teams to get products out at the least cost as we can, I think -- and in fact, so therefore, we get revenue up, which includes -- which improves our incremental margins in the plant. And so I guess we're kind of running up and down escalator, if you will, and doing a decent job of it. And so as those things start to get better and even in the markets where we're still seeing disruptions, our supply base gets better at operating under the same lousy conditions if they stay they stay stable. Even stable lousy is better than changing all the time. So all of them are doing better, and so we are seeing improvement.

So I do think it's entirely possible. We'll see government responses to try to keep business moving during this time. And to your point, that might might offset some of what we see as sort of structural issues like the changing of the emission standards and the price increases of trucks. 
We don't -- the signals aren't evident to us yet, but that doesn't mean it won't happen. And we've been talking about this all year. Like we called this wrong before. We've said China is going to fall off a lot and then it hasn't. And we said the reverse. China is going to grow a lot, and then it fell off some. So what we think is that generally speaking, with these emissions change, prices are going to go up. People bought a lot of trucks last year -- second half of last year, first half of this year. So we see diminishing demand -- and not just trucks, also excavators. We see diminishing demand as the most likely expectation, and we are beginning to see signs of that.

But to your point, those are all being driven by costs coming down, infrastructure being built, all of which takes a long time. The electrolyzer demand is the thing that's right in front of us. So if we can get the projects locked down, all the the European money subsidies in place, as you heard from my remarks, we are building the capacity to produce these units. What that means with regard to the quarters of 2022, we have some work yet to do to do that. I'd like to tell you, yes, but I think we need to do the work, and we need to see some of these projects locked down before we say to ourselves, it's exactly this quarter and that quarter. So give us some time to work that, but I understand the question well, and we'll definitely give you visibility to that as we get it."

That is definitely a longer conversation about each technology area where we're leading and where we're not, which would be significant disputed by other competitors in the industry, I'm sure, Rob. Let me say it this way. I think that we have a position in the market, which has been built over a long time, where we understand the applications as well or better than anybody in the industry. We understand the technical ways in which the applications demand power from the powertrain. That gives us a significant advantage in developing whatever powertrain ends up winning because we understand what it actually has to do. 
Second thing I'd say is that we've invested significantly in both hydrogen fuel cells and battery electric fuel powertrains, meaning that we have as much experience technology investment as anybody in the industry, not in straight battery cells or that kind of thing, but in the application of those units to commercial vehicles. So we're not behind anybody who is in commercial industrial in markets. So I believe that we have -- we are well positioned. But I also think the industry is moving quickly. As I said in my remarks, where the strategic advantage will be gained will depend not only on the product development, but on where the infrastructure is, where -- what the cost of electricity is versus the cost of hydrogen, a whole bunch of other factors that require us and other industry participants to be pretty nimble about how you think about what products are going to win and how advantage is going to be created. So that's why I think it's important for us to say we like these investments, we feel like we're at the forefront of all of them, but we also need to keep thinking about where the puck is moving to and make sure we're we're thinking about how to get advantage. That's a little bit why you heard my comments on investing in low-carbon engine technologies. Because right now, we can produce hybrid diesel engines and hybrid and gas natural engines at significantly lower cost than either BEV or fuel cell powertrains that are significant improvements in both carbon and criteria pollutants. That's worth a lot to either, depending on whether you're an EPA or a regulator or you're a customer, I know how to use those. They're a lot cheaper. I understand how to fuel them and operate them. And meanwhile, they still significantly their positive impact on the environment. So that's why I think we're trying to make sure that we stay at the forefront of all these and not just plop down in one big pile on one place because I think that's not a winning strategy in this market."

Should we just expect maybe there's a big announcement and we all kind of guess as to how long the tail end of diesel is? Or are there -- are you willing to do that? Or is there a risk sharing?

And that's not because we have some -- we sit around and hope for the preservation of diesel. It's because the diesel market is so complicated. There's so many applications, 100 years of applications. And it's not like the cars where there's just one application. There's hundreds and -- or thousands. And each one of them has unique demands and scale is very difficult to achieve in some of these. And so we see the demand for diesel lasting a long time. And that's why this investment in both helping customers that are trying to move out of diesel as well as trying to think through how do we invest in those technologies to decarbonize through renewable natural gas or hydrogen, ICE engines or hybrids or other things is a good investment because it allows these applications to move down the carbon curve, have less carbon out, lower criteria pollutants in an engineering way that's going to drive -- and cost way that's going to drive utilization and people are going to actually use it and not just delay purchases. So we think both for regulators and for customers, that's a good investment. And that curve is likely to last a long time. And the answer about how long is, unfortunately, for people that want a simple answer, it depends on how -- it's complicated. It will last a really long time if you mean all of them. If you mean like the one truck application that the largest volume, that might happen sooner than the last unusual kind of truck that's a very small volume. But the accumulation of all those curves of all those applications means diesel is around a long time. And so -- and these new applications, the lower carbon ones are going to be introduced starting now and all the way through the 2030s."

I'll start with a summary of our second quarter financial results and our market trends by region and then finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2021. Mark will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. Demand remained strong in the second quarter as the global economy continued to improve, driving strong sales growth across most businesses and regions and resulting in solid profitability. We are encouraged by economic trends across a number of our key end markets, which point to strong demand for the remainder of this year and extending into 2022. 
In North America, freight activity continues to grow, leading to elevated spot and contract rates and driving fleet profitability and a rising backlog of truck orders. Leading indicators for nonresidential construction continue to improve. And the fiscal support for investment in capital projects is robust, led by North America and Europe. Iron ore, copper and thermal coal prices also remain high, supporting a positive outlook for mining. Cummins is well positioned to benefit as these markets gain momentum due to our leading global position across a number of end markets, and we continue to see demand for our products outpace our competition. 
Before getting into our results, I want to take a moment to highlight a number of partnerships and strategic milestones in the evolution of our next-generation technologies. In May, we formed a partnership with Iberdrola, a leading global producer of renewable power to accelerate the global growth of business opportunities in the electrolyzer market and especially in Europe with a focus on the Iberian Peninsula. The alliance will help position Cummins as a leading supplier of electrolyzer systems for large-scale projects in Europe. As part of our alliance, Cummins will be the electrolyzer supplier for a 230-megawatt project for a leading fertilizer producer that will serve as a benchmark for large PEM scale electrolysis globally. 
We signed a joint venture with Sinopec Enze Fund in June, which will accelerate the affordability and availability of green hydrogen in China through development of hydrogen-generation projects and increasing manufacturing capacity of electrolyzers and other key products in the green hydrogen supply chain. As one of the largest hydrogen suppliers in China, Sinopec's annual hydrogen production reaches 3.5 million tonnes, accounting for 14% of total -- China's total hydrogen production. China's embrace of green hydrogen is great for the planet. And Cummins and Sinopec joining together to realize the potential of green hydrogen is a huge leap forward for scaling our innovative PEM electrolyzer systems. 
We recently announced a strategic collaboration with Chevron to develop commercially viable business opportunities in hydrogen and other alternative energy sources. The MOU provides the framework for Chevron and Cummins to initially collaborate on 4 main objectives: first, advancing public policy that promotes hydrogen as a decarbonizing solution for transportation and industry; building market demand for commercial vehicles and industrial applications powered by hydrogen; developing infrastructure to support the use of hydrogen for industry and fuel cell vehicles; and fourth, exploring opportunities to leverage Cummins' electrolyzer and fuel cell technologies at one or more of Chevron's domestic refineries.
The partnership with Chevron allows us to scale low-carbon fuel delivery and build hydrogen corridors for use by fuel cell vehicles. In addition, we can work with Chevron to decarbonize parts of their operations using our green hydrogen technology. Finally, last week, Cummins announced the signing of an MOU with Air Products to work together to begin the transition of Air Products' heavy-duty tractor fleet to zero emissions vehicles in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Cummins will provide hydrogen fuel cell electric powertrains integrated into selective -- selected OEM partners' heavy-duty trucks for use by Air Products. The project will take a phased approach to transition Air Products' fleet to hydrogen fuel cell electric powertrains, starting with 5 demonstration units to be delivered in Europe and North America by the end of next year.  
Following successful demonstration, the project includes ramp-ups, which were -- was a total of 2,000 trucks to be delivered by the middle of the decade. This represents among the largest orders for fuel cell vehicles to date, and we will be working with a partner that has deep expertise in the generation, transportation and use of hydrogen.  
We've now deployed more than 2,000 fuel cells and 600 electrolyzers around the world as we continue the development of our hydrogen business. In addition to accelerating our revenue momentum via these important strategic ownerships, we are also building out our electrolyzer capacity, targeting the regions which we expect to be at the forefront of green hydrogen production and commercial adoption. 
Site selection search within the Guadalajara area of Castilla-La Mancha in Spain is currently underway for Cummins' new approximately $60 million PEM electrolyzer manufacturing plant that will house system assembly and testing for approximately 500 megawatts per year of electrolyzer reduction and will be scalable to more than 1 gigawatt per year. Cummins NZ, the JV we signed in conjunction with Sinopec, will be located in Foshan, Guangdong province in China. The JV will initially invest $47 million to locate a manufacturing plant to produce PEM electrolyzers. 
The plant will open with a manufacturing capacity of 500 megawatts of electrolyzers per year but will also be scalable to more than 1 gigawatt per year. These investments, in addition to our build-outs underway at our current facilities in Belgium and Canada, will position us to have nearly 2 gigawatts of capacity by the middle of the decade with the flexibility to scale up as demand accelerates.  
In the battery electric space, we continue to produce and sell fully electric powertrains in first-mover markets such as transit, school bus and yard spotters. Cummins is collaborating with PepsiCo's Frito-Lay on a battery electric demonstration truck for a pickup and delivery application that has been running daily routes since last November. This truck will be showcased at the upcoming North American Council for freight efficiencies electric truck demonstration. 
We are well positioned with our deep market expertise in electric powertrain technology and are continuously evaluating how we can adapt and improve to meet customer demand and market trends as the technology matures. This includes next-generation battery electric systems to balance the durability needs of our customers while focusing on delivering products at a compelling price point. We are also continuing to explore new partnerships to enhance our capabilities, improve our cost position and drive more volume and scale into the business.  
In addition to these important milestones for our New Power business, we are investing in our Engine and Components businesses to develop advanced diesel and alternative fuel products, which will be critical to meeting customer and regulatory requirements in the coming years. We announced the signing of an LOI to acquire a 50% equity interest in Momentum Fuel Technologies.  The joint venture between Rush Enterprises and Cummins will produce Cummins-branded natural gas fuel delivery systems for the commercial vehicle market in North America, combining the strength of Momentum Fuel Technologies' compressed natural gas fuel delivery systems, Cummins' powertrain expertise and the engineering and support infrastructure of both companies. 
We have seen increasing interest over last year and expect natural gas powertrains to become an increasingly popular choice for end users due to both a compelling total cost of ownership as well as the environmental benefit of such powertrains, especially when utilizing renewable natural gas sources.  
We also began testing of a hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine for heavy-duty truck applications, building on Cummins' existing technology leadership in gaseous fuel applications and powertrain leadership to create a new power solution to help customers meet the energy environmental needs of the future. The hydrogen engine program can potentially expand the technology options available to achieve a more sustainable transport sector, complementing our capabilities in hydrogen fuel cell, battery electric and renewable gas powertrains.  
We are committed to bringing customers the right solution at the right time. Doing so requires us to maintain a broad portfolio of power solutions to meet our diverse customers' needs and to minimize total carbon emissions throughout the energy transition.  
Now I'll comment on the overall company performance for the second quarter of 2021 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Revenues for the second quarter of 2021 were $6.1 billion, an increase of 59% compared to the second quarter of 2020. EBITDA was $974 million or 15.9% compared to $549 million or 14.3% a year ago. EBITDA increased as a result of stronger global demand and higher joint venture income, partly offset by significantly higher premium freight and other costs associated with supply chain disruptions in addition to higher compensation costs. 
Our global markets experienced an unprecedented shock from the impact of COVID-19 during the second quarter of last year. And while we have been encouraged by the ongoing recovery across all of our global markets, our industry continues to experience significant constraints across the supply chain, leading to an extended period of inefficiencies and higher costs. Despite these supply chain impacts though, we are continuing to deliver strong financial performance while supporting our customers. The ability to supply our customers remains our key focus now. And while we are optimistic that the supply chain constraints will ease with time, they are likely to persist through the end of the year.  
Our second quarter revenues in North America grew 74% to $3.5 billion, driven by high -- higher industry build rates across all on-highway markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the second quarter was 67,000 units, an increase of 180% from 2020 levels. While our heavy-duty unit sales were 23,000, an increase of 217% from 2020. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 29,000 units in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 94% from 2020 levels while  our unit sales were 22,000 units, an increase of 85% from 2020. We shipped 42,000 engines to Stellantis for use in their Ram pickups in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 272% from 2020 levels. Revenues for power generation grew by 48% due to higher demand in recreational vehicle, standby power and data center markets.  
Our international revenues increased by 42% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to a year ago. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $2.1 billion, an increase of 8% due to higher sales in power generation and mining markets. We also experienced a higher penetration rate with our joint venture partners in the heavy and medium-duty on-highway markets as they prepare for broader implementation of NS VI in July of this year. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 566,000 units, a decrease of 4% but still well above replacement, driven by continued prebuy of NS V trucks, ahead of the broader implementation of the new NS VI standards in July of this year. Our sales in units, including joint ventures, were 85,000 units, a decrease of 5% versus the second quarter of 2020.  
The light-duty market in China decreased 8% from 2020 levels to 614,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 38,000, a decrease of 28%, driven by supply chain constraints, particularly in these lighter displacement vehicles. Industry demand for excavators in the second quarter was 97,000 units, a decrease of 5% from very high 2020 levels. Our units sold were 16,800 units, a decrease of 7%.  
The demand for power generation equipment in China increased 47% in the second quarter, driven by growth in data center markets and other standby power markets. We continue to hold a leading market position in the data center segment, driven by strong end-user relationships and a compelling product offering in that space.  
Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $392 million, an increase of 219% from the second quarter of 2020 despite experiencing a terrible second wave of COVID-19 during this period. Industry truck production increased by 468% while our shipments increased 535% as our joint venture partner continued to gain share. Demand for power generation and construction equipment rebounded strongly in the second quarter compared to a very low base a year ago. We remain encouraged by the continued economic recovery, driven by anticipated government infrastructure spending.  
In Brazil, our revenues increased 175%, driven by increased demand in most end markets.  
Now let me quickly cover our outlook for 2021. Based on our current forecast, we are maintaining full year 2021 revenue guidance of up 20% to 24% versus last year. EBITDA is still expected to be in the range of 15.5% to 16%. And the company expects to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders in 2021 in the form of dividend and share repurchases. And summing up the quarter, strong demand across many of our key markets drove continued sales growth in the second quarter and resulted in solid profitability. We have secured important new partnerships in our New Power segment. At the same time, we continue to invest in bringing new technologies to customers, outgrowing our end markets and providing strong cash returns to our shareholders.  
Before passing it over to Mark, I want to take a moment to highlight an important announcement we included in our earnings press release this morning regarding our exploration of our strategic alternatives for the Filtration business. Cummins Filtration is a premier filtration platform and a technology leader specializing in filtration products used in heavy-, medium-duty and light-duty trucks, industrial equipment and power generation systems. The business generated revenues of approximately $1.2 billion in 2020 and remains well positioned for continued growth, sustained margin performance and strong free cash flow generation. 
Cummins Filtration has a strong global footprint with leading positions in North America, India and China and a significant presence in other key markets supported by long-standing local partnerships. We are exploring a range of options to unlock significant shareholder value, including the separation of Filtration into a stand-alone company with a dedicated management team, who are well positioned to drive the business forward and diversify its business, leveraging its strong technology portfolio and footprint. The execution of this exploration process is dependent upon business and market conditions, of course, along with a number of other factors and considerations. 
And any costs associated with the evaluation of these alternatives for the Filtration business has been excluded from our financial outlook. We plan to share a lot more about this and other elements of our strategy during our Analyst Day on February 23. Our purpose in delaying this event from November this year until spring is to be able to hold it in person, and we will provide more details as we get closer to the February 23 date.  
Thank you for your time today, and let me turn it over to Mark."

First, underlying demand remains strong, outpacing supply and increasing backlogs in some of our largest markets. Number two, global supply chains remain constrained due to the elevated levels of demand and complications arising from COVID, resulting in higher premium freight costs and other associated inefficiencies than we anticipated 3 months ago. 
We delivered solid profitability and cash flows in the first half of the year despite the continued cost headwinds associated with tight supply chain. And for the full year, we are maintaining our revenue and profitability guidance. And fourthly, we returned $860 million to shareholders in the quarter through cash dividends and share repurchases and $1.48 billion for the first half of the year, consistent with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year.  
Now let me go into more details on the second quarter. Second quarter revenues were $6.1 billion, an increase of 59% from a year ago when the impact of COVID-19 was at its most severe. Sales in North America grew 74% and international revenues rose 42%. Currency positively impacted revenues by 3%, driven primarily by a weaker U.S. dollar.  
EBITDA was $974 million or 15.9% of sales for the quarter compared to $549 million or 14.3% of sales a year ago. EBITDA increased primarily due to the benefits of higher volumes and stronger earnings from our joint ventures in China and India, partially offset by higher product coverage costs and higher compensation expenses, primarily variable compensation.  
Gross margin of $1.5 billion or 24.2% of sales increased by $588 million or 110 basis points, primarily driven by the higher volumes. Global supply chain tightness continued in the second quarter and resulted in approximately $100 million of additional freight, labor and logistics costs. We expect these costs to remain elevated in the second half of the year with demand projected to remain strong, supply tight and some increase in logistics and transportation costs.  
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $130 million or 28% due to higher compensation expenses. And research expenses increased by $87 million or 46% from a year ago. As a reminder, due to the significant uncertainty at the onset of COVID-19, we implemented temporary salary reductions in April of last year that lasted through the end of September last year. Salary reductions resulted in approximately $75 million of pretax savings for the company in the second quarter of 2020 across gross margin, selling, admin and research expenses.  
In addition, our variable compensation plan worked as designed, flexing down in the face of weaker economic conditions last year and flexing up with stronger financial performance this year. All operating segments experienced higher compensation costs than a year ago for these 2 primary reasons.  
Joint venture income was $137 million in the second quarter, up from $115 million a year ago. Strong demand for trucks and construction equipment in China as well as a broad recovery in other international markets led to the improved profitability versus a year ago. Other income increased by $30 million from a year ago due to a number of positive items, including a onetime $18 million gain on the sale of some land in India, which benefited our Distribution segment. Net earnings for the quarter were $600 million or $4.10 per diluted share compared to $276 million or $1.86 from a year ago, primarily due to stronger after-tax earnings driven by stronger volumes. The gain on the sale of land in India contributed $0.05 of earnings per share this quarter. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.4%.  
Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $616 million compared to an outflow of $22 million a year ago. Stronger earnings and dividends received from joint ventures more than offset increases in working capital.  
I'll now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2021, which is unchanged from 3 months ago. For the Engine segment, second quarter revenues increased by 75%, driven by increased demand for trucks in the U.S. and construction equipment in U.S. and Europe. EBITDA increased from 10.5% to 16.1% of sales, primarily driven by higher volumes and lower product coverage expense, which more than offset higher costs and inefficiencies associated with global supply chain challenges. And although supply chain costs in this segment remain elevated from a year ago, they did improve a little from first quarter levels.  
We expect full year revenues to be up 23% to 27% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 14.5% to 15% for the Engine segment.  
In Distribution, revenues increased 20% from a year ago. And EBITDA increased as a percent of sales from 10% to 10.5%, primarily due to stronger performance in North America. We have maintained our outlook for segment revenue growth to be up 6% to 10% and EBITDA margins to be 9% at the midpoint of our guidance.  
In the Components business, revenues increased 73% in the second quarter, driven primarily by stronger demand for trucks in North America. EBITDA increased from 12.3% of sales to 15.1% due to the benefits of stronger volumes, partially offset by higher product coverage costs. For the full year 2021, we expect Components revenue to increase 30% to 34% and EBITDA to be 17% at the midpoint.  
In the Power Systems segment, revenues increased 47% in the second quarter, driven by stronger global demand for power generation and mining equipment. EBITDA increased from 11.7% to 12.2% of sales, primarily due to the benefits of higher volumes and lower product coverage expenses. We are maintaining our Power Systems guidance of revenues up 16% to 20% and EBITDA margin in the range of 11% to 11.5% of sales.  
In the New Power segment, revenues increased to $24 million, up 140% due to stronger sales of battery electric systems and fuel cells. EBITDA losses for the quarter were $60 million, in line with our expectations as we continue to invest in new products and scale up ahead of widespread adoption of the new technologies. For full year, we currently project New Power revenues of $110 million to $130 million and EBITDA losses to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. 
Total company guidance remains unchanged, with revenues to grow between 20% and 24% and EBITDA margin to be between 15.5% and 16% for the full year. EBITDA percent for the first half of the year was 16%. Some of the key factors expected to influence second half profitability are the pace of improvement in truck production in North America, the rate of decline in demand in China and the performance of the global supply chain. We now expect earnings from joint ventures to be up 10% in 2021 compared to our prior year guidance of down 5%. Stronger-than-expected demand in China truck and construction markets, especially in the second quarter, is the primary reason for the increase in our forecast. 
Joint venture earnings are expected to ease in the second half of the year with industry truck sales expected to decline following the broader adoption of the new National Standard VI on highway emissions regulations in China in July. And we also anticipate a softening of demand for construction equipment coming off all-time high levels in the first half of the year. 
Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5%, excluding discrete items, down from our prior guidance of 22.5%. Due to the mix of geographic earnings, CapEx -- capital expenditures were $125 million in the quarter, up from $77 million a year ago. And we expect our full year capital expenditures to be at the high end of our range of $725 million to $775 million for the full year. 
We returned $869 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter, bringing our total cash returns to $1.48 billion for the first half. Excuse me for my dry throat. To summarize, we delivered strong results in the second quarter despite continued supply chain constraints and elevated costs. Demand currently exceeds supply in a number of important markets, pointing to strong demand for our products into 2022. 
I want to thank our global employees for their ongoing commitment to meet the needs of our customers while delivering solid financial performance. We continue to extend our leadership position through advancing the technologies that power the profitability of our customers today and will continue to do so for some time to come. This sets the company up to further increase the earnings power of our core business while we continue to invest in a range of new technologies and develop new partnerships that position the company for additional growth. 
Our strong balance sheet focused on improving performance cycle-over-cycle and consistent cash flow generation means that we can sustain important investments for the future through periods of economic uncertainty and distribute excess cash to shareholders. 
Thank you for your interest. Now I'll turn it back over to Jack."

I guess, Tom, a couple of more strategic questions. Just on the Filtration business, can you remind us where the margins of this business are and just your thoughts on timing and what this business could achieve as a stand-alone public company versus being part of Cummins? Or is it more likely that this asset would be interesting to someone else? 
And then I guess my second question, I appreciate a lot of the color that you spent on New Power systems and some of the relationships that have emerged. I'm just wondering, as you're thinking about this business today, a lot of the growth obviously has been organic. Is there an inorganic opportunity here within New Power systems over the next sort of 12 to 18 months that could potentially perhaps accelerate where this business would go longer term in terms of earning a profit, et cetera, or in technology?"

So let me start with your Filtration question first. The answer is that the profitability of Filtration is pretty much in line with the Components business. The segment and the business are very similar. And the strategic logic is simple. I",596,"Thanks, Jamie. So let me start with your Filtration question first. The answer is that the profitability of Filtration is pretty much in line with the Components business. The segment and the business are very similar. And the strategic logic is simple. It's a great business, by the way, very profitable, great cash flow, a terrific leadership team. And we've done a lot of improvement in that business over the last few years, which has really improved its financial performance as well as its operating performance. 
And so we're -- we feel like it's operating on all cylinders, really, just for an engine analogy there. But the challenge is that looking forward, the opportunities to grow shareholder value look primarily to us in diversification. The number of technology innovations for the truck business or for our end markets look like they're limited in front of us. Whereas the opportunities to take that technology platform and global footprint to other filtration segments look significant. And when we think about using our shareholders' capital to invest in those other segments, the logic isn't as clear. 
What is clear, though, that the company has come to a size and performance level now where we think it can stand on its own or it could be part of a big -- another bigger company that plans more diversification in other end markets. We are looking at all those options. We're exploring everything from a sale to a spin to a -- to some other kind of strategic option. What we want to do most of all, though, is realize value for common shareholders. We know that when we're the best owner and can make the most of the assets, we're going to do that. 
And when we're no longer the best owner, then we need to confront that, too. And that's what we're trying to do here is just create value for shareholders and be direct about it. Again, it's -- the business is doing great. The management team is outstanding. We're really proud of the achievements of that business. We just think it can operate separately from us more effectively going forward. 
Then with regard to New Power, and thanks for your comments on the strategic milestones, we have achieved a lot already. And we are exploring organic/inorganic partnership options all the time. It is such a fast-moving area. There's so much development to do in infrastructure. Just the product technology, the availability of fuel, there's so much to do to decarbonize the automotive industry, no less all the other commercial industrial industries that we're in, that there's no lack of potential partnerships and opportunities. 
We are, though, scanning always for inorganic options, too. As you know, some of the valuations were elevated to a point where they were really just almost silly. But that said, that isn't always true now. And we are always scanning for acquisitions that we think can position us strategically more -- better position us from a scale point of view. And you heard me mention that in our battery electric section that there is a scale advantage to be gained both in hydrogen and electric. If we can get enough volume on some of those products, we can drive down costs significantly. That depends in part on whether the technology is viable in the application or not. And that's why we're doing so much focus on what are the first-mover markets and where can we actually get scale. And then if we can do that and an acquisition can help, we'll do it."

But we have not been doing that, so I can't really answer your question on bookings for the quarter. But what I can say is that, as I mentioned in my announcement, that the project that we've got planned with Iberdrola in Spain for the fertilizer will be the largest of its kind. And so we are seeing significant ramp-up already, especially in Europe. That's where, in Europe, there's the combination of low-cost renewable power, combined with European money supporting projects that decarbonize industrial uses of hydrogen, is really driving -- is the primary driver of demand. And we see some of that now beginning to form in China, same idea, decarbonizing industrial uses of hydrogen. 
So there's already big consumers of hydrogen. They already -- people already buy a lot, but it's produced using natural gas through SMR. And this supply chain, this green hydrogen supply chain takes renewable power through a PEM electrolyzer like ours and then turns it -- makes the hydrogen low carbon or zero carbon. And that's kind of the biggest drive for electrolyzers today."

These are vehicles which will be built for purpose to have fuel cell electric vehicle powertrains. As you guessed, the big development area there is to have electric infrastructure in the truck already. And then when you -- then you can put the fuel cell in and take advantage of the electric powertrain or the electric infrastructure in the truck. 
And that's still under development. Most of the trucks that we put out now, the electric infrastructure is either a prototype version or is -- has not been fully productionized yet. And I'd say our early versions will still be that. But truck makers are electrifying vehicles at a reasonably rapid rate, at least for -- in relatively small volumes. So we expect those platforms to improve over time. And we will be forming partnerships with OEMs to deliver those trucks. And my view is that the reason you haven't seen more partnerships already is there just isn't very much demand. So -- and everyone is trying to figure out what to do with their scarce engineering resources. 
Do I use them on developing advanced diesel, natural gas, renewable natural gas, electric, fuel cell electric? And since I can't do all at once, which ones do I do first, second and third? So we believe that truck makers will be ready to work with us on fuel cell vehicles when there's demand. So that's why we're excited about an end-user like Air Products, high-quality company, knows hydrogen really well, wants to make their fleet fuel cells. So I think that's going to increase truck makers' interest in trying to figure out how to fulfill this order."

David, Jennifer here. I'll comment a little bit about what we're seeing right now. As you heard from Mark and Tom, and it's happening across the industry supply chain and really ramping up to keep up with the demand we see in this for the aftermarket has paced our ability to supply it. Just -- our teams have done a phenomenal job working closely with customers and suppliers and to minimize that impact to deliver the results that we did in the second quarter. 
We see that easing in many places quarter-over-quarter, so improving through the back half of the year and into '22. Microprocessors, like others in our industry and other industries, continues to be the biggest constraint. Our demands are relatively small in the broader picture of microprocessor supply. And we had expected to see some improvement in June. With COVID in Malaysia, that's delayed slightly. But that, we think, will ease in the second half of the year. So we're -- see an improvement in the second half end markets as we see the supply chains ease. 
From a price perspective, right now, we're anticipating our price to cost to be 30 basis points favorable for this year. And that is down from 40 to 50 basis points positive in our prior guidance really because of those increased costs that we're seeing in materials, logistics and premium freight. And we are working to mitigate that with some of our contractual things on the material side, hedging and also looking at pricing and surcharges where possible in [ first goods ] and aftermarket. So we won't comment more on '22 at this point, but we do expect to see some improvements both in cost coming down and getting some more recovery into the second half of the year."

I think like a lot of companies, the continued outbreaks of COVID around the world and now the delta variant just keep throwing more curveballs into the system because we see labor shortages, we see other things. And so some of these costs, as Jen mentioned, we'd expected it to go from $100 million in the first quarter to $30 million in the second quarter and then be gone. And so now we're about talking almost hundred -- almost $300 million for the year. So that just -- I want to be clear. That's a big hit to what we really generally expected. 
The thing, I guess, I wanted to highlight is that our company continues to earn good margins despite that by finding other ways to do it. We've been able to price in the aftermarket, and we still have a big opportunity going forward in that. We're -- as Jen said, we'll be able to add material cost adjustments to our -- contractually as we move forward, roll forward in the quarter. And just the sheer effort by our teams to get products out at the least cost as we can, I think -- and in fact, so therefore, we get revenue up, which includes -- which improves our incremental margins in the plant. 
And so I guess we're kind of running up and down the escalator, if you will, and doing a decent job of it. And so as those things start to get better and even in the markets where we're still seeing disruptions, our supply base gets better at operating under the same lousy conditions if they stay stable. Even stable lousy is better than changing all the time. So all of them are doing better, and so we are seeing improvement. It's just wherever the new flare up is, is where we're seeing the cost being driven."

So I do think it's entirely possible. We'll see government responses to try to keep business moving during this time. And to your point, that might offset some of what we see as sort of structural issues like the changing of the emission standards and the price increases of trucks. 
We don't -- the signals aren't evident to us yet, but that doesn't mean it won't happen. And we've been talking about this all year. Like we called this wrong before. We've said China is going to fall off a lot and then it hasn't. And we said the reverse. China is going to grow a lot, and then it fell off some. So what we think is that generally speaking, with this emissions change, prices are going to go up. 
People bought a lot of trucks last year -- second half of last year, first half of this year. So we see diminishing demand -- and not just trucks, also excavators. We see diminishing demand as the most likely expectation, and we are beginning to see signs of that. And so even if the policy started to change now, I think we'd still see some demand drops in at least the third quarter and the fourth quarter until those things start to take effect."

But it seems like you've got a lot in the hopper there already and just wondering like how much visibility you even have on that target at this point?"

The CEO of an old engine company says, we don't have the orders in hand yet because I think of orders as actual orders. But to your point, though, we project that the sum of these partnerships and where we see this decarbonizing of industries using hydrogen already will take our demand significantly over our estimate we gave at the Hydrogen Day. 
Again, the orders are in hand. They depend on European money and all these things, all of which has been promised, but it's not all done, right? So -- and the same thing in China. There's projected policy investments that will encourage green hydrogen, but the orders aren't there yet. So that's why when you ask like, do you have orders in hand? The engine guy says, no. But if you ask me as the CEO of New Power, I'd say, I feel really good about it and I think we're going to exceed our target significantly."

That is definitely a longer conversation about each technology area where we're leading and where we're not, which would be significantly  disputed by other competitors in the industry, I'm sure, Rob. Let's just -- let me say it this way. I think that we have a position in the market, which has been built over a long time, where we understand the applications as well or better than anybody in the industry. We understand the technical ways in which the applications demand power from the powertrain. That gives us a significant advantage in developing whatever powertrain ends up winning because we understand what it actually has to do. 
Second thing I'd say is that we've invested significantly in both hydrogen fuel cells and battery electric fuel powertrains, meaning that we have as much experience, technology, investment as anybody in the industry, not in straight battery cells or that kind of thing but in the application of those units to commercial vehicles. So we're not behind anybody who is in commercial industrial end markets. So I believe that we have -- we are well positioned. But I also think the industry is moving quickly. 
As I said in my remarks, where the strategic advantage will be gained will depend not only on the product development, but on where the infrastructure is, where -- what the cost of electricity is versus the cost of hydrogen, a whole bunch of other factors that require us and other industry participants to be pretty nimble about how you think about what products are going to win and how advantage is going to be created. So that's why I think it's important for us to say, we like these investments, we feel like we're at the forefront of all of them. But we also need to keep thinking about where the puck is moving to and make sure we're thinking about how to get advantage. 
That's a little bit why you heard my comments on investing in low-carbon engine technologies. Because right now, we can produce hybrid diesel engines and hybrid and natural gas engines at significantly lower cost than either BEV or fuel cell powertrains that are significant improvements in both carbon and criteria pollutants. That's worth a lot to either, depending on whether you're an EPA or a regulator or you're a customer, I know how to use those. They're a lot cheaper. I understand how to fuel them and operate them. And meanwhile, they still significantly -- their positive impact on the environment. So that's why I think we're trying to make sure that we stay at the forefront of all these and not just plop down a bet in one big pile on one place because I think that's not a winning strategy in this market."

But on the flip side, you guys have the opportunity to provide your expertise and scale in the last stages of diesel engines. And you've done it a little bit, I guess, in medium-duty already. 
How do we, on our side of the fence, think about what happens? You see some of the mandates coming forward in time on auto. That's a whole lot easier to do than on truck, I understand. Should we just expect maybe there's a big announcement and we all kind of guess as to how long the tail end of diesel is? Or are there -- are you willing to do that? Or is there a risk sharing? Or I don't know if you're willing to sort of characterize how those investments may go. And I will stop there."

And that's not because we have some -- we sit around and hope for the preservation of diesel. It's because the diesel market is so complicated. There's so many applications, 100 years of applications. And it's not like the cars where there's just one application. There's hundreds and -- or thousands. And each one of them has unique demands and scale is very difficult to achieve in some of these. And so we see the demand for diesel lasting a long time. 
And that's why this investment in both helping customers that are trying to move out of diesel as well as trying to think through how do we invest in those technologies to decarbonize through renewable natural gas or hydrogen, ICE engines or hybrids or other things, is a good investment because it allows these applications to move down the carbon curve, have less carbon out, lower criteria pollutants in an engineering way that's going to drive -- and cost way that's going to drive utilization. And people are going to actually use it and not just delay purchases. So we think both for regulators and for customers, that's a good investment. And that curve is likely to last a long time. 
And the answer about how long is, unfortunately, for people that want a simple answer, it depends on how -- it's complicated. It will last a really long time if you mean all of them. If you mean like the one truck application at the largest volume, that might happen sooner than the last unusual kind of truck that's a very small volume. But the accumulation of all those curves of all those applications means diesel is around a long time. And so -- and these new applications, the lower carbon ones are going to be introduced starting now and all the way through the 2030s."

I'll start with a summary of our third quarter financial results and our market trends by region and finish with a discussion of our outlook for the rest of 2021. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. 
Demand remained strong in the third quarter as the global economy continued to improve, driving strong sales growth across most businesses and regions outside of China. In China, industry-wide sales of trucks and construction equipment has slowed sharply, but in line with our expectations. 
We remain encouraged by the economic trends in our markets, which point to strong end-user demand extending into 2022. We also continue to see orders for our products outpace our competition as a result of their strong performance in the field. 
Unfortunately, supply chain constraints continue to significantly impact our ability to produce and ship products, driving up costs and limiting sales growth in the short run. These supply chain constraints are impacting our OEM customers in much the same way. 
Before getting further into our results, I want to take a moment to highlight a couple of strategic milestones in the evolution of our next-generation products and technologies. 
In October, we announced that we will bring a 15-liter natural gas engine for heavy-duty trucks to the North American market. This engine was launched earlier this year in China and has been well received in the market, demonstrating excellent performance and reliability thus far. 
The 15-liter natural gas engine is an important part of our path to 0 emission strategy by offering a significant reduction in both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases in a product that's available today and utilizes existing infrastructure. 
Equally exciting is that this engine is designed to accept a range of gaseous and renewable fuels, including hydrogen in the future. In fact, all of Cummins' engine platforms are being designed with the same fuel flexibility. 
At the same time, we are working with Chevron and others in the energy industry to increase the availability of renewable natural gas and other renewable fuels to ensure infrastructure is in place to meet our customers' needs. 
We also signed a letter of intent to establish a joint venture between Rush Enterprises and Cummins, which will produce Cummins-branded natural gas fuel delivery systems for the commercial vehicle market in North America, combining the strengths of Momentum Fuel Technologies' compressed natural gas fuel delivery systems and Cummins' powertrain expertise, along with the engineering and support infrastructure of both companies. These are important steps in expanding our portfolio of power solutions options to help customers meet their business goals and operational objectives while also meeting increasingly stringent emission standards and achieving our customers' sustainability goals. 
Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the third quarter of 2021 and cover some of our key markets. 
Revenues for the third quarter of 2021 were $6 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the third quarter of 2020. 
EBITDA was $862 million or 14.4% compared to $876 million or 17.1% a year ago. Higher freight and logistics expenses, rising material costs and other manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the ongoing supply chain challenges in our industry more than offset the benefits of global volume increases compared to the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, EBITDA in the third quarter of last year was helped by temporary salary reductions, which lowered our cost by approximately $90 million. 
Our third quarter revenues in North America grew 13% to $3.4 billion, driven by higher engine and component shipments across the heavy and medium-duty on-highway markets. 
Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the third quarter was 55,000 units, an increase of 10% from 2020 levels. Cummins sold 22,000 heavy-duty engines in the same period, up 30% from 2020 levels. 
Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 26,000 units in the third quarter, a decrease of 5% from 2020 levels. While our unit sales -- our Cummins unit sales were $23,000, an increase of 25% in 2020.  
We shipped 43,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the RAM pickups in the third quarter of this year, a decrease of 2% from the 2020 levels, but still a very strong quarter. 
Revenues for power generation grew by 2% due to higher demand in recreational vehicle, standby power and data center markets. 
Our international revenues increased by 22% in the third quarter of 2021 and compared to a year ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 11% due to lower demand in the medium- and heavy-duty truck markets. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 217,000 units, a decrease of 53% as the industry works through the National Standard V truck inventory on hand and lower demand for newer, higher-cost National Standard VI units. 
Our unit sales and units including joint ventures, were 40,000, a decrease of 49% versus the third quarter last year. 
Our light-duty engine sales were 33,000, a decrease of 40% driven by supply chain constraints and weaker market demand. 
Industry demand for excavators in China in the third quarter were 56,000 units, a decrease of 15% from 2020 levels. Our units at Cummins sold were 88,600 units, a decrease of 20%. 
Power generation sales in China increased 52% in the third quarter compared to a year ago based on strong demand in data centers and other backup power applications. We continue to hold a market-leading position in the data center segment in China, driven by strong end-user relationships and a compelling product offering. 
Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $520 million, an increase of 76% from the third quarter of 2020. Industry truck production increased by 120%, while our shipments increased 135% as our joint venture partner continued to gain share. 
Demand for power generation and construction equipment also rebounded strongly in the third quarter compared to a very low base a year ago. 
In our Power Systems markets, industrial engine revenue increased 33% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, driven by mining and oil and gas. 
In Brazil, our revenues increased 26%, driven by increased demand across all end markets. 
Now let me quickly cover our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Based on our current forecast, we expect our revenue to be at the lower end of our guidance or up approximately 20% versus 2020. 
EBITDA is now expected to be approximately 15%, below our previous guidance of 15.5% to 16% of sales. Our expected EBITDA margins are lower because of the persistence of the supply chain constraints and disruptions, which are now exacerbated by escalating material and freight prices. 
We've lowered our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America to 228,000 units, up 25% compared to 2020, but below our prior guidance of 264,000 units. This is again due to the supply chain constraints impacting our customers rather than a lack of end-user demand. 
In the medium-duty truck market, we are decreasing our forecast for industry production to 118,000 units, up 15% year-over-year, but below our prior guidance of 134,000 units. 
We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be up 25% compared to 2020, an increase of 7.5% from our expectations 3 months ago. 
In China, we continue to expect domestic on-highway demand to decline from record levels a year ago. 
Our 2021 outlook for medium- and heavy-duty truck market demand is 1.65 million units. And our 2021 outlook for light-duty truck market is 2 million units, both unchanged from our previous guidance. 
We continue to expect industry sales of activators to be flat with the record levels achieved in 2020 and unchanged from our previous guidance. 
In India, we anticipate industry demand for trucks to be up 75% compared to levels experienced in 2020. And our other businesses are showing promising growth due to continued infrastructure investment. This is also unchanged from previous guidance. 
We now expect demand for mining engines to increase 60% in 2021, up from our expectation of 45% 3 months ago based on continued strength in commodity prices. 
We continue to expect global power generation revenue to increase 15%, primarily driven by the data center and recreational vehicle markets. 
Summing up the quarter, strong demand across many of our markets drove continued sales growth in the third quarter. Despite this strong demand, supply chain constraints continue to significantly impact both our operations and those of our customers, resulting in higher material and logistics costs as well as capping revenue growth. We are working collaboratively with our customers and suppliers to navigate these challenges and position the company for better performance in 2022. 
Customers are recognizing the strong performance of our products, resulting in our sales growing faster than industry demand in a number of important markets. We continue to invest in bringing new technology to our customers, outgrowing our end markets and providing strong cash returns to our shareholders. The company expects to return over 75% of our operating cash flow to shareholders in 2021 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
Thank you for your time today. And now let me turn it over to Mark."

There are 4 key takeaways from our third quarter results. End customer demand remained strong in the third quarter, driving sales growth, strong sales growth across most end markets and businesses outside of C",1369,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. There are 4 key takeaways from our third quarter results. 
End customer demand remained strong in the third quarter, driving sales growth, strong sales growth across most end markets and businesses outside of China, where truck and construction demand has weakened in line with our expectations. Global supply chains remain constrained, impacting our industry's ability to meet strong customer demand and resulting in higher freight, labor and logistics expenses and rising material costs. As a result of the continued supply challenges and associated costs, we are lowering our full year sales and profitability outlook even though underlying demand remains very strong. Finally, we'll return $345 million to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases in the quarter and a total of $1.83 billion for the first 9 months of the year, consistent with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year. 
Now let me go into more details on the third quarter. Revenues were $6 billion, an increase of 17% from a year ago. Sales in North America grew 13% and international revenues rose 22%. 
EBITDA was $862 million or 14.4% of sales for the quarter compared to $876 million or 17.1% of sales a year ago. As a reminder, EBITDA in Q3 last year was boosted by $90 million of temporary salary reductions and a $44 million VAT recovery in Brazil. 
Along with the strong demand, the key feature of our performance in Q3 is that our gross margin continues to be challenged by the supply chain constraints and elevated costs. Gross margin of $1.4 billion or 23.7% of sales increased by $65 million but declined as a percent of sales by 270 basis points. 
Global supply chain constraints continued to impact the industry's ability to meet elevated end customer demand and have resulted in higher costs. We incurred approximately $90 million of additional freight, labor and logistics costs in the third quarter in addition to rising material costs, partially offset by increased pricing in the aftermarket. 
SG&A expenses increased by $38 million or 7%. And research expenses increased by $42 million or 19% from a year ago, primarily due to higher compensation expenses. As a reminder, due to the significant uncertainty at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented temporary salary reductions in April of 2020 through the end of September last year. The salary reductions resulted in approximately $90 million of pretax savings for the company last year and impacted gross margin and our operating expenses and impacted the comparisons of the results of all of our operating segments. 
Joint venture income was $94 million in the third quarter, down slightly from $98 million a year ago, due primarily to weaker demand for both trucks and construction equipment in China. 
Other income of $32 million increased by $11 million year-over-year. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $534 million or $3.69 per diluted share compared to $501 million or $3.36 per share from a year ago, primarily due to a lower tax rate and a reduced share count. 
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.9%. Our income tax expense included favorable discrete items of $11 million or $0.08 per diluted share. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $569 million compared to $1.2 billion a year ago. An increase in working capital led to the lower operating cash flow for this quarter. 
Now let me comment on segment performance and our latest guidance for the full year 2021. 
The Engine segment third quarter revenues increased 22% from a year ago, driven by increased demand for trucks in the U.S. and construction equipment in the U.S. and Europe. EBITDA decreased from 18.1% to 15.2%, primarily driven by higher supply chain costs, lower joint venture income and higher compensation expense, partially offset by the benefits of stronger volumes and lower warranty expense. For the full year, we've reduced our revenue guidance to be up 24% at the midpoint, down 1% for the full year. We now expect EBITDA margins to be between 14.2% and 14.7%, a little below our prior year guidance of 14.5% to 15%, primarily due to the weaker sales and ongoing supply chain challenges. 
In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 14% from a year ago. EBITDA increased in dollars but decreased as a percent of sales from 10.6% to 9.8% primarily due to some of the supply chain challenges and, again, the higher compensation costs. We have maintained our 2021 outlook for Distribution segment revenues to be up 8% and increased EBITDA margins to 9.3% of sales, at the midpoint of our guidance. 
Components segment revenues increased 16% in the third quarter, driven primarily by stronger demand for trucks in North America. EBITDA decreased from 16.9% to 14.1%, primarily due to higher supply chain costs and higher warranty expenses compared to very low cost of quality in the year ago quarter. For the full year, we now expect Components revenue to increase 28%, lower than our prior guidance of up 32%, primarily driven by a weaker outlook in North America and slightly lower outlook for China truck. We have also lowered our forecast EBITDA margins for the segment to be at 15.5% of sales at the midpoint, down from our prior guidance of 17% as the segment has been more hardly -- has been hit harder by the supply chain challenges and the slowdown in truck production in North America and China. 
In the Power Systems segment, revenues increased 19% in the third quarter, driven by stronger demand for power generation and mining equipment. EBITDA increased by $33 million and expanded from 10.3% to 11.5% of sales, primarily due to the benefits of higher volumes and lower product coverage expense, partially offset by elevated supply chain costs. For the full year, we're increasing our Power Systems revenue guidance to be up 22% from our prior guide of 18% growth, driven primarily by a stronger outlook in the mining segment. We're also increasing our EBITDA margin forecast to be 11.5% of sales at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 11.25%. 
In the New Power segment, revenues increased $23 million, up 28%, due to stronger sales of battery electric systems. EBITDA losses for the quarter were $58 million as we continue to invest in new products and scale up ahead of widespread adoption of the new technologies that we're developing. For the full year, we now project New Power revenues of $120 million at the midpoint and EBITDA losses to be in the range of $200 million. 
We expect total company revenues now to grow approximately 20%, at the low end of our prior guidance. We're also lowering our EBITDA margin guidance to be approximately 15% for the full year, down from our prior guidance of 15.5% to 16%. The  slower pace of improvement in North American truck production and continued elevated costs associated with the global supply chain challenges are the primary drivers of the lower outlook. 
We expect joint venture earnings to be up 10% for this year, in line with our prior expectations. 
We're forecasting our full year effective tax rate to be 21.5%, excluding discrete items. 
Capital expenditures were $150 million in the quarter, up from $116 million a year ago. And we continue to expect full year capital spend of between $725 million and $775 million. 
To summarize, we faced incredibly strong demand in many of our core markets but continue to face global supply chain challenges which have impacted our cost base more so than we'd expected in the second half of the year. However, this end customer demand remains strong, outpacing supply in many important markets and setting us up for a strong 2022, assuming the global economy remains strong. 
I want to thank all of our employees for their tireless work this year to ensure that we meet the needs of our customers while continuing to deliver solid financial results. We continue to prioritize improving our performance cycle over cycle, investing in the technologies that will power profitable growth and returning excess capital to shareholders. 
Thank you for your interest today, and now let me turn it back over to Jack."

And I'd also say the freight side of things just seems like it's not quite getting better yet. And when you look at where containers are and what ports look like. 
So there's no question that, as Mark said, internally, we are working as much as we can to address our cost side and efficiencies. He talked about going out and negotiate, getting price increases. And as you know, on the material cost side, those come automatically, but we'll have to negotiate for the rest.

Jamie, yes, as you heard from Mark, and we've been forecasting, we've seen a drop off at the middle of the year in the China market, on-highway market, in particular, with the changeover between NS V and NS VI emission standard. So we saw inventory building up in the first half of the year, and we're now seeing that coming down and getting sold in regions that are still allowing NS V product sales. 
And so that, combined with a higher cost of the new emissions products, as we expected, driven a drop in on-highway demand, which we expect to come back to some degree. 2020 was a record year for China though. So our expectation is that market is going to come back to be more in line with what we saw in '19 for On-Highway. 
We are benefiting in China from additional content in the Components business with new emissions requirements and also the launch of the Endurant transmission now in China. So we see that benefit. And we think our [indiscernible] NS VI products are going to perform well in the market as well and give us some upside potential. 
But the market overall is down. The construction market has also come down some. And we are continuing to see some strength in the power gen market there.

So as things start to come back, I think we're better positioned than we've ever been. Add to it that we're now doing electrolyzers with a partner in China. We've got fuel cell launches in China. So on the New Power side, while things are moving slower in China than maybe people anticipated several years ago, that's just allowed us to position ourselves to be in those markets more strongly as they take off. 
So again, to date, looking where I am today, I'd say our position in China has really never been stronger. So yes, do I wish the market was stronger this year? Sure. But I think as it turns back down, we're able to consolidate more and strengthen our position."

Still, we would need to generate -- of course, we need green hydrogen in order to actually reduce the CO2 impact of the fuel. 
And really, hydrogen and combustion is a good answer, it's just not as efficient as a fuel cell. So if you're running a long-haul, heavy-duty truck, where fuel is your #1 cost or power energy is, then that efficiency increase from a fuel cell is going to be worth it to you. 
If you have a relatively short range or you have a vocational truck, our view is maybe a hydrogen engine might work for you, especially if the conversion to fuel cell is too expensive and you're not having that many units. 
So our view is there's a place for both. But if you want to think what's going to really drive the transportation economy 20 years, 15 years from now, you're going to need the efficiency that a fuel cell, especially with an electric system, is going to provide.

Number two, whilst we anticipated a sharp drop in the second half of the year in China, and that's playing out largely as we've expected, this business is doing a major product transition from NS V to NS VI. And invariably, when we start with the launch of new products, we're below optimal scale, demand is still pretty light for NS VI. So as we ramp up there, we'd expect margins to recover. 
The bigger challenge or the more knotty challenge is the rise in supply chain costs, which is really what we've seen, where in the first half of the year we saw our [ ECMs ] principally availability impacting our operations and supply chain in the Engine business. We've seen that spread more to more electrical components. And what's happened is the Components business has picked up more cost and inefficiency. So that one is [ not you ]. We're working through all that. Yes, we've got the metal costs. We've got the normal contract adjustments around that. But it's that focus on the supply chain and the other actions that we talked about at the start of the call that we're focused on here. 
But I just wanted to try and simplify the message. There's a lot of noise out there. 
I would just say one other thing, just you didn't ask me, just to clear up some noise here. Whilst in the explanations we mentioned higher product coverage cost in this segment, it's compared to an extraordinarily low number last year. There's no big charge for product coverage or warranty in the segment. So I just wanted to clear that up for other listeners."

We did -- early in the pandemic, we did do some structural reform. I think we talked about it in some previous calls, trying to say, hey, while the market is down, let's make sure that we get our capacity rightsized. And I think we did some good work early on, on that. 
But with the supply chain challenges, we've also seen a bunch of new problems that we weren't seeing before. You highlighted some of them. Do we have enough inventory in the right places? Are we outsourced in places we should be insourced? And then, of course, with trade challenges between countries, are we relying too much on cross-border trade? So all those things now are in our strategy looking forward about how we want to reposition our supply chain. 
So today, what we're doing is trying to get our costs, down trying to get our production up to meet customer demand and trying to keep our supply chain people at work when it's -- they're basically working 24/7. It's been really, really rough. So I would just say that the strategic elements, while we're doing a lot of work and analysis on them, there's no question that we've taken a back seat to try to keep operations going in the last couple of quarters. 
But those issues are first and foremost, for us in the leadership team, thinking about how we want to position. And I'll just say this, broadly speaking, what we're thinking about is we do need to reposition what we outsource and what we insource for the future, partly because of some of the supply chain challenges we've seen here, but also because the industry is likely to consolidate further. And we need to make sure that we can be the reliable supplier that we need to be for our customers. So we will be looking at that and thinking through the right way to position ourselves in different supply chains is. But I think you've hit on a key point, that there will be some optimization that will be helpful to us, both from a cost and reliability point of view over time."

And generally speaking, conversations are [ a phase ] behind on-highway in battery electric powertrains, but they are common. I mean, as you guess, every major off-highway producers trying to figure out what their long-term strategy is from a carbon point of view and sustainability point of view. So we are having conversations with many of them. 
In all cases, I think the battery electric conversation, these, at a high level, strategically is the same thing. All of them need a solution. All of them want to figure out when is the cost -- the total cost of ownership for end users work out, and it generally doesn't today, unless you're in a publicly financed application. If you're in a train or a bus or a ferry, okay. If you're in a commercially viable thing, it doesn't quite work out yet. But the numbers, as you know, are changing quickly, but it still doesn't work out. So they're trying to figure out how to position themselves for when it does work out, who they partner with and how. And today, most of those partnership conversations are pushed out because there's not a viable offering to make today, nor is there a way to get to a viable offering with the technologies and the cost as they are now. So everyone is looking forward and trying to figure out what does it look like. 
Off-Highway, I believe, strategically, will be in the same challenge that they're in today, not enough volume to justify a special one, but very specific needs to their application. And our view is that Cummins will be well positioned because we'll have products in on-highway, which will give us volume and scale, and then we'll have an understanding of their application and how to adapt the technologies most effectively to off-highway, so that we'll represent a good partner to them. And that's, as you guess, that's sort of the pitch I'm making to them now, that we'd be the right partner for them in battery electric as we are with engines."

And I'd say the big strategic move we wanted to make was to add some bigger projects to the backlog. And those conversations have been going much better. Backlog, I think last time we checked, was 60 megawatts or something, quite a good backlog, some newer, larger projects which were exciting to add in there. And of course, the problem with larger projects, they take longer to get together, so -- and more likely delays in funding. But that's where the -- that's where the market is going. We need to have those big ones. So it was good to see some of those come in the backlog. And I would just say that the interest in electrolyzers is still quite strong. 
As you mentioned, the bill, the build back better plan has some incentives in there for producing hydrogen or especially low -- carbon-free ammonia, we think that's going to be a good use of electrolyzers in the early phases of electrolyzers. We see it in Europe, where there's a carbon price already, that we see some fertilizer-related projects, and it's an area where there's a lot of carbon used in fertilizer through gray hydrogen. And making that hydrogen green is a way -- there's already demand. Calculations about how to get cost equivalency are pretty straightforward. They're not easy. They take some funding and they take some incentives, which is why you see those in the bill. But what -- once you do the calculations, you can see how you can get there. So I do expect that to be one of the markets that's likely to move more quickly, especially if those incentives make it through into law. I do think it will promote the green hydrogen -- green nitrogen, I guess, the green ammonia business pretty quickly in the U.S."

What's more is because of the supply chain challenges, right now OEM truck production is capped by suppliers. So they're not -- we're not anywhere near the maximum production of the industry today. I mean we hope to be, based on what engine user demand was, but we're not. We're in an area where there's -- they can produce more if they could get more parts.

And on the rest you need to negotiate if you want to make a change. It doesn't mean you can't negotiate, just means you have to negotiate with your partner. 
And then on generator sets and aftermarket, where we go directly to retail customers, then we only have what's on the order book as what you can't price on. 
So as Mark and Jen said, this year, we priced in the aftermarket early in the year. We priced in the aftermarket again in the middle of the year. And we always are looking back at that to see if we should do more.

Because right now, most automotive, most trucks and buses, are adding a significant portion of electronics each revolution.

I'll start with a summary of our third quarter financial results and our market trends by region and finish with a discussion of our outlook for the rest of 2021. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year.
Demand remained strong in the third quarter as the global economy continued to improve, driving strong sales growth across most businesses and regions outside of China. In China, industry-wide sales of trucks and construction equipment has slowed sharply but in line with our expectations.
We remain encouraged by the economic trends in our markets, which point to strong end-user demand extending into 2022. We also continue to see orders for our products outpace our competition as a result of their strong performance in the field.
Unfortunately, supply chain constraints continue to significantly impact our ability to produce and ship products, driving up costs and limiting sales growth in the short run. These supply chain constraints are impacting our OEM customers in much the same way.
Before getting further into our results, I want to take a moment to highlight a couple of strategic milestones in the evolution of our next-generation products and technologies.
In October, we announced that we will bring a 15-liter natural gas engine for heavy-duty trucks to the North American market. This engine was launched earlier this year in China and has been well received in the market, demonstrating excellent performance and reliability thus far. The 15-liter natural gas engine is an important part of our path to zero emission strategy by offering a significant reduction in both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases in a product that's available today and utilizes existing infrastructure. Equally exciting is that this engine is designed to accept a range of gaseous and renewable fuels, including hydrogen in the future. In fact, all of Cummins' engine platforms are being designed with the same fuel flexibility.
At the same time, we are working with Chevron and others in the energy industry to increase the availability of renewable natural gas and other renewable fuels to ensure infrastructure is in place to meet our customers' needs.
We also signed a letter of intent to establish a joint venture between Rush Enterprises and Cummins, which will produce Cummins-branded natural gas fuel delivery systems for the commercial vehicle market in North America, combining the strengths of Momentum Fuel Technologies' compressed natural gas fuel delivery systems and Cummins' powertrain expertise, along with the engineering and support infrastructure of both companies. These are important steps in expanding our portfolio of power solutions options to help customers meet their business goals and operational objectives while also meeting increasingly stringent emission standards and achieving our customers' sustainability goals.
Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the third quarter of 2021 and cover some of our key markets.
Revenues for the third quarter of 2021 were $6 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the third quarter of 2020. EBITDA was $862 million or 14.4% compared to $876 million or 17.1% a year ago. Higher freight and logistics expenses, rising material costs and other manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the ongoing supply chain challenges in our industry more than offset the benefits of global volume increases compared to the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, EBITDA in the third quarter of last year was helped by temporary salary reductions, which lowered our costs by approximately $90 million.
Our third quarter revenues in North America grew 13% to $3.4 billion driven by higher engine and component shipments across the heavy- and medium-duty on-highway markets.
Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the third quarter was 55,000 units, an increase of 10% from 2020 levels. Cummins sold 22,000 heavy-duty engines in the same period, up 30% from 2020 levels.
Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 26,000 units in the third quarter, a decrease of 5% from 2020 levels, while our unit sales -- our Cummins unit sales were $23,000, an increase of 25% in 2020.
We shipped 43,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the Ram pickups in the third quarter of this year, a decrease of 2% from the 2020 levels but still a very strong quarter.
Revenues for power generation grew by 2% due to higher demand in recreational vehicle, standby power and data center markets.
Our international revenues increased by 22% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to a year ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 11% due to lower demand in the medium- and heavy-duty truck markets. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 217,000 units, a decrease of 53% as the industry works through the National Standard V truck inventory on hand and lower demand for newer, higher-cost National Standard VI units.
Our unit sales and units, including joint ventures, were 40,000, a decrease of 49% versus the third quarter last year.
Our light-duty engine sales were 33,000, a decrease of 40% driven by supply chain constraints and weaker market demand.
Industry demand for excavators in China in the third quarter were 56,000 units, a decrease of 15% from 2020 levels. Our units at Cummins sold were 88,600 units, a decrease of 20%.
Power generation sales in China increased 52% in the third quarter compared to a year ago based on strong demand in data centers and other backup power applications. We continue to hold a market-leading position in the data center segment in China driven by strong end-user relationships and a compelling product offering.
Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $520 million, an increase of 76% from the third quarter of 2020. Industry truck production increased by 120%, while our shipments increased 135% as our joint venture partner continued to gain share. Demand for power generation and construction equipment also rebounded strongly in the third quarter compared to a very low base a year ago.
In our power systems markets, industrial engine revenue increased 33% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year driven by mining and oil and gas.
In Brazil, our revenues increased 26% driven by increased demand across all end markets.
Now let me quickly cover our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Based on our current forecast, we expect our revenue to be at the lower end of our guidance or up approximately 20% versus 2020.
EBITDA is now expected to be approximately 15%, below our previous guidance of 15.5% to 16% of sales. Our expected EBITDA margins are lower because of the persistence of the supply chain constraints and disruptions, which are now exacerbated by escalating material and freight prices.
We've lowered our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America to 228,000 units, up 25% compared to 2020 but below our prior guidance of 264,000 units. This is again due to the supply chain constraints impacting our customers rather than a lack of end-user demand.
In the medium-duty truck market, we are decreasing our forecast for industry production to 118,000 units, up 15% year-over-year but below our prior guidance of 134,000 units.
We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be up 25% compared to 2020, an increase of 7.5% from our expectations 3 months ago.
In China, we continue to expect domestic on-highway demand to decline from record levels a year ago. Our 2021 outlook for medium- and heavy-duty truck market demand is 1.65 million units. And our 2021 outlook for light-duty truck market is 2 million units, both unchanged from our previous guidance.
We continue to expect industry sales of excavators to be flat with the record levels achieved in 2020 and unchanged from our previous guidance.
In India, we anticipate industry demand for trucks to be up 75% compared to levels experienced in 2020. And our other businesses are showing promising growth due to continued infrastructure investment. This is also unchanged from previous guidance.
We now expect demand for mining engines to increase 60% in 2021, up from our expectation of 45% 3 months ago based on continued strength in commodity prices.
We continue to expect global power generation revenue to increase 15% primarily driven by the data center and recreational vehicle markets.
Summing up the quarter, strong demand across many of our markets drove continued sales growth in the third quarter. Despite this strong demand, supply chain constraints continue to significantly impact both our operations and those of our customers, resulting in higher material and logistics costs as well as capping revenue growth. We are working collaboratively with our customers and suppliers to navigate these challenges and position the company for better performance in 2022.
Customers are recognizing the strong performance of our products, resulting in our sales growing faster than industry demand in a number of important markets. We continue to invest in bringing new technology to our customers, outgrowing our end markets and providing strong cash returns to our shareholders. The company expects to return over 75% of our operating cash flow to shareholders in 2021 in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
Thank you for your time today, and now let me turn it over to Mark."

There are 4 key takeaways from our third quarter results. End customer demand remained strong in the third quarter, driving sales growth -- strong sales growth across most end markets and businesses outside of C",1371,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. There are 4 key takeaways from our third quarter results. End customer demand remained strong in the third quarter, driving sales growth -- strong sales growth across most end markets and businesses outside of China where truck and construction demand has weakened in line with our expectations. Global supply chains remain constrained, impacting our industry's ability to meet strong customer demand and resulting in higher freight, labor and logistics expenses and rising material costs.
As a result of the continued supply challenges and associated costs, we are lowering our full year sales and profitability outlook, even though underlying demand remains very strong.
Finally, we'll return $345 million to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases in the quarter and a total of $1.83 billion for the first 9 months of the year, consistent with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year.
Now let me go into more details on the third quarter. Revenues were $6 billion, an increase of 17% from a year ago. Sales in North America grew 13%, and international revenues rose 22%.
EBITDA was $862 million or 14.4% of sales for the quarter compared to $876 million or 17.1% of sales a year ago. As a reminder, EBITDA in Q3 last year was boosted by $90 million of temporary salary reductions and a $44 million VAT recovery in Brazil.
Along with the strong demand, the key feature of our performance in Q3 is that our gross margin continues to be challenged by the supply chain constraints and elevated costs. Gross margin of $1.4 billion or 23.7% of sales increased by $65 million but declined as a percent of sales by 270 basis points.
Global supply chain constraints continued to impact the industry's ability to meet elevated end customer demand and have resulted in higher costs. We incurred approximately $90 million of additional freight, labor and logistics costs in the third quarter, in addition to rising material costs, partially offset by increased pricing in the aftermarket.
SG&A expenses increased by $38 million or 7%, and research expenses increased by $42 million or 19% from a year ago primarily due to higher compensation expenses.
As a reminder, due to the significant uncertainty at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented temporary salary reductions in April of 2020 through the end of September last year. The salary reductions resulted in approximately $90 million of pretax savings for the company last year and impacted gross margin and our operating expenses and impacted the comparisons of the results of all of our operating segments.
Joint venture income was $94 million in the third quarter, down slightly from $98 million a year ago due primarily to weaker demand for both trucks and construction equipment in China.
Other income of $32 million increased by $11 million year-over-year.
Net earnings for the quarter were $534 million or $3.69 per diluted share compared to $501 million or $3.36 per share from a year ago primarily due to a lower tax rate and a reduced share count.
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.9%, and our income tax expense included favorable discrete items of $11 million or $0.08 per diluted share.
Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $569 million compared to $1.2 billion a year ago. An increase in working capital led to the lower operating cash flow for this quarter.
Now let me comment on segment performance and our latest guidance for the full year 2021.
The Engine segment third quarter revenues increased 22% from a year ago driven by increased demand for trucks in the U.S. and construction equipment in the U.S. and Europe. EBITDA decreased from 18.1% to 15.2% primarily driven by higher supply chain costs, lower joint venture income and higher compensation expense, partially offset by the benefits of stronger volumes and lower warranty expense.
For the full year, we've reduced our revenue guidance to be up 24% at the midpoint, down 1% for the full year. We now expect EBITDA margins to be between 14.2% and 14.7%, a little below our prior year guidance of 14.5% to 15% primarily due to the weaker sales and ongoing supply chain challenges.
In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 14% from a year ago. EBITDA increased in dollars but decreased as a percent of sales from 10.6% to 9.8% primarily due to some of the supply chain challenges and, again, the higher compensation costs. We have maintained our 2021 outlook for Distribution segment revenues to be up 8% and increased EBITDA margins to 9.3% of sales at the midpoint of our guidance.
Components segment revenues increased 16% in the third quarter driven primarily by stronger demand for trucks in North America. EBITDA decreased from 16.9% to 14.1% primarily due to higher supply chain costs and higher warranty expenses compared to very low cost of quality in the year ago quarter.
For the full year, we now expect Components revenue to increase 28%, lower than our prior guidance of up 32% primarily driven by a weaker outlook in North America and slightly lower outlook for China truck. We have also lowered our forecast EBITDA margins for the segment to be at 15.5% of sales at the midpoint, down from our prior guidance of 17% as the segment has been more hardly -- has been hit harder by the supply chain challenges and the slowdown in truck production in North America and China.
In the Power Systems segment, revenues increased 19% in the third quarter driven by stronger demand for power generation and mining equipment. EBITDA increased by $33 million and expanded from 10.3% to 11.5% of sales primarily due to the benefits of higher volumes and lower product coverage expense, partially offset by elevated supply chain costs.
For the full year, we're increasing our Power Systems revenue guidance to be up 22% from our prior guide of 18% growth driven primarily by a stronger outlook in the mining segment. We're also increasing our EBITDA margin forecast to be 11.5% of sales at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 11.25%.
In the New Power segment, revenues increased $23 million, up 28% due to stronger sales of battery electric systems. EBITDA losses for the quarter were $58 million as we continue to invest in new products and scale up ahead of widespread adoption of the new technologies that we're developing. For the full year, we now project New Power revenues of $120 million at the midpoint and EBITDA losses to be in the range of $200 million.
We expect total company revenues now to grow approximately 20%, at the low end of our prior guidance. We're also lowering our EBITDA margin guidance to be approximately 15% for the full year, down from our prior guidance of 15.5% to 16%. A slower pace of improvement in North American truck production and continued elevated costs associated with the global supply chain challenges are the primary drivers of the lower outlook.
We expect joint venture earnings to be up 10% for this year, in line with our prior expectations. We're forecasting our full year effective tax rate to be 21.5%, excluding discrete items.
Capital expenditures were $150 million in the quarter, up from $116 million a year ago. And we continue to expect full year capital spend of between $725 million and $775 million.
To summarize, we faced incredibly strong demand in many of our core markets but continue to face global supply chain challenges, which have impacted our cost base more so than we'd expected in the second half of the year. However, this end customer demand remains strong, outpacing supply in many important markets and setting us up for a strong 2022, assuming the global economy remains strong.
I want to thank all of our employees for their tireless work this year to ensure that we meet the needs of our customers while continuing to deliver solid financial results. We continue to prioritize improving our performance cycle over cycle, investing in the technologies that will power profitable growth and returning excess capital to shareholders.
Thank you for your interest today, and now let me turn it back over to Jack."

And I'd also say the freight side of things just seems like it's not quite getting better yet, and when you look at where containers are and what ports look like.
So there's no question that, as Mark said, internally, we are working as much as we can to address our cost side, inefficiencies. He talked about going out and negotiate, getting price increases. And as you know, on the material cost side, those come automatically, but we'll have to negotiate for the rest.

So we saw inventory building up in the first half of the year, and we're now seeing that coming down and getting sold in regions that are still allowing NS V product sales. And so that, combined with a higher cost of the new emissions product, as we expected, driven a drop in on-highway demand, which we expect to come back to some degree. 2020 was a record year for China, though. So our expectation is that market is going to come back to be more in line with what we saw in '19 for on-highway.
We are benefiting in China from additional content in the Components business with new emissions requirements and also the launch of the Endurant transmission now in China. So we see that benefit. And we think our NS VI products are going to perform well in the market as well and give us some upside potential. But the market overall is down. The construction market has also come down some. And we are continuing to see some strength in the power gen market there.
We are watching the impact of those -- the power shortage issues in China very closely with our suppliers. It's not created a major disruption for us to this point, but it is something we continue to watch closely."

Add to it that we're now doing electrolyzers with a partner in China. We've got fuel cell launches in China.

I mean, at this point, the demand out there is very strong. We're seeing growing back orders in some of our businesses. And I've been out in recent couple of months talking with both OEMs and end customers, and there's strong demand out there that, for sure, is real at this point. Customers are not getting all the trucks that they would like to get this year and do not believe -- even looking into next year, they think that, that -- there's going to be some limitations. So I think that orders are strong.
And as Tom said, we've got some contractual pricing on metals that we'll get as we go into next year. We've been taking pricing actions where we go direct to the market and aftermarket and power gen, and we're continuing to work with our OEM customers on first-fit to negotiate pricing just in light of the cost environment we see right now."

Still, we would need to generate -- of course, we need green hydrogen in order to actually reduce the CO2 impact of the fuel. And really, hydrogen and combustion is a good answer, it's just not as efficient as a fuel cell. So if you're running a long-haul, heavy-duty truck where fuel is your #1 cost or power energy is, then that efficiency increase from a fuel cell is going to be worth it to you. If you have a relatively short range or you have a vocational truck, our view is maybe a hydrogen engine might work for you, especially if the conversion to fuel cell is too expensive and you're not having that many units.
So our view is there's a place for both. But if you want to think what's going to really drive the transportation economy 20 years, 15 years from now, you're going to need the efficiency that a fuel cell, especially with an electric system, is going to provide. So our feeling still is fuel cells win for the majority of the trucking industry.

Our products are performing well. There's a lot of end user pull. And we've seen good position in the market.
The dynamic that is happening in the fourth quarter, in most cases, we have been able to work through the supply constraints and continue to supply to our OEM customers and have not, in most cases, been the reason they've not been able to build trucks. So as they take down some of their build rates, stabilize their production and complete these trucks that they build short of some components, we have seen some reduction in demand on the engine itself as they're working to really stabilize and get to more efficient build rates to make sure they're building with what supply and inventory they have and level that out.

If I just step back from the noise of the numbers, I'll come back to that in a moment, really, we're wrestling with 3 issues in that business that are somewhat different than we'd anticipated 3 or 6 months ago.
Number one, truck production in North America has not picked up in the second half of the year. If anything, it's drifted down a little bit and we were counting on that in our guidance. So we think underlying demand supports a robust environment for next year and that should take care of itself.
Number two, whilst we anticipated a sharp drop in the second half of the year in China, and that's playing out largely as we've expected, this business is doing a major product transition from NS V to NS VI. And invariably, when we start with the launch of new products, we're below optimal scale, demand is still pretty light for NS VI. So as we ramp up there, we'd expect margins to recover.
The bigger challenge or the more knotty challenge is the rise in supply chain costs, which is really what we've seen, where in the first half of the year, we saw our ECMs' principally availability impacting our operations and supply chain in the Engine business. We've seen that spread more to more electrical components. And what's happened is the Components business has picked up more costs and inefficiencies.
So that one is knotty. We're working through all that. Yes, we've got the metal costs. We've got the normal contractual adjustments around that. But it's that focus on the supply chain and the other actions that we talked about at the start of the call that we're focused on here. But I just wanted to try and simplify the message. There's a lot of noise out there.
I would just say one other thing, just -- you didn't ask me, just to clear up some noise here. Whilst in the explanations we mentioned higher product coverage costs in this segment, it's compared to an extraordinarily low number last year. There's no big charge for product coverage or warranty in the segment. So I just wanted to clear that up for other listeners."

We did -- early in the pandemic, we did do some structural reform. I think we talked about it in some previous calls, trying to say, hey, while the market is down, let's make sure that we get our capacity rightsized. And I think we did some good work early on, on that.
But with the supply chain challenges, we've also seen a bunch of new problems that we weren't seeing before. You highlighted some of them. Do we have enough inventory in the right places? Are we outsourced in places we should be insourced? And then, of course, with trade challenges between countries, are we relying too much on cross-border trade? So all those things now are in our strategy looking forward about how we want to reposition our supply chain.
So today, what we're doing is trying to get our costs down, trying to get our production up to meet customer demand and trying to keep our supply chain people at work when it's -- they're basically working 24/7. It's been really, really rough. So I would just say that the strategic elements, while we're doing a lot of work and analysis on them, there's no question that we've taken a back seat to try to keep operations going in the last couple of quarters.
But those issues are first and foremost for us in the leadership team, thinking about how we want to position. And I'll just say this, broadly speaking, what we're thinking about is we do need to reposition what we outsource and what we insource for the future, partly because of some of the supply chain challenges we've seen here but also because the industry is likely to consolidate further. And we need to make sure that we can be the reliable supplier that we need to be for our customers. So we will be looking at that and thinking through where the right way to position ourselves in different supply chains is. But I think you've hit on a key point that there will be some optimization that will be helpful to us, both from a cost and reliability point of view over time."

And generally speaking, conversations are a phase behind on-highway in battery electric powertrains, but they are common. I mean, as you guess, every major off-highway producer is trying to figure out what their long-term strategy is from a carbon point of view and sustainability point of view. So we are having conversations with many of them.
In all cases, I think the battery electric conversation, these, at a high level, strategically is the same thing. All of them need a solution. All of them want to figure out when is their cost -- the total cost of ownership for end users work out, and it generally doesn't today unless you're in a publicly financed application. If you're in a train or a bus or a ferry, okay. If you're in a commercially viable thing, it doesn't quite work out yet. And the -- but the numbers, as you know, are changing quickly, but it still doesn't work out. So they're trying to figure out how to position themselves for when it does work out, who they partner with and how.
And today, most of those partnership conversations are pushed out because there's not a viable offering to make today nor is there a way to get to a viable offering with the technologies and the costs as they are now. So everyone is looking forward and trying to figure out what does it look like.
Off-highway, I believe, strategically, will be in the same challenge that they're in today, not enough volume to justify a special one but very specific needs to their application. And our view is that Cummins will be well positioned because we'll have products in on-highway, which will give us volume and scale, and then we'll have an understanding of their application and how to adapt the technologies most effectively to off-highway so that we'll represent a good partner to them. And that's -- as you guess, that's sort of the pitch I'm making to them now that we'd be the right partner for them in battery electric as we are with engines."

And I'd say the big strategic move we wanted to make was to add some bigger projects to the backlog. And those conversations have been going much better. Backlog, I think last time we checked, was 60 megawatts or something, quite a good backlog, some newer, larger projects which were exciting to add in there. And of course, the problem with larger projects, they take longer to get together, so -- and more likely delays in funding. But that's where the market is going. We need to have those big ones. So it was good to see some of those come in the backlog. And I would just say that the interest in electrolyzers is still quite strong.
As you mentioned, the bill, the Build Back Better plan has some incentives in there for producing hydrogen or especially low -- carbon-free ammonia. We think that's going to be a good use of electrolyzers in the early phases of electrolyzers. We see it in Europe where there's a carbon price already, that we see some fertilizer-related projects, and it's an area where there's a lot of carbon used in fertilizer through gray hydrogen. And making that hydrogen green is a way -- there's already demand. Calculations about how to get cost equivalency are pretty straightforward. They're not easy. They take some funding and they take some incentives, which is why you see those in the bill. But what -- once you do the calculations, you can see how you can get there. So I do expect that to be one of the markets that's likely to move more quickly, especially if those incentives make it through into law.

But at the very top of the market, generally speaking, penetration goes up a little bit because they run out of capacity if they use both, if they have both their own demand and ours, but again, generally is not a good indicator for a given quarter. And as Mark was saying earlier, quarter-to-quarter variation is pretty high because they may have backlog. In this case, they may have unfinished trucks with more of their engines. So just quarter-to-quarter, it's hard to see.
What's more is because of the supply chain challenges, right now OEM truck production is capped by suppliers. So they're not -- we're not anywhere near the maximum production of the industry today. I mean we hope to be, based on what engine user demand was, but we're not. We're in an area where there's -- they can produce more if they could get more parts. So I think we're not really near the spot that you're asking about in terms of industry production."

That's the sort of sectors where you see some of those long-term agreements. The benefit of those, of course, is that we can count on continued customer orders over a period of time, over a phase of production of trucks and engines. And the pricing arrangements in those, for the most part, again, each one is a little different, but the general deal is on basic material cost, there's an escalator or a pass-through. And on the rest, you need to negotiate if you want to make a change. It doesn't mean you can't negotiate, just means you have to negotiate with your partner. And then on generator sets and aftermarket where we go directly to retail customers, then we only have what's on the order book as what you can price on.
So as Mark and Jen said, this year, we priced in the aftermarket early in the year. We priced in the aftermarket again in the middle of the year. And we always are looking back at that to see if we should do more. And in gensets, we also move pricing right away. And then now what we're doing is talking with all of our OEM customers about the fact that we've had these escalators, not just freight, by the way, freight, logistics, material costs, special shipments as a result of delays in semiconductors and other products that we want to recover from them and we're in negotiations with them now."

That's -- I mean, that's -- I don't mean to be pie in the sky about it, but that -- strategically, it's kind of a nightmare that we only have all those semiconductor wafers are coming from pretty much one factory or one set of factories in Taiwan and that we're a very small part of that company's output. That's not the ideal situation for a supply chain.
So if you had said, hey, what's the strategic plan, the strategic plan has to be to find semiconductor manufacturers who think the automotive industry is more critical to their success and ideally to have some closer to shore or onshore so that we can look at the total capacity and demand because right now, most automotive, most trucks and buses are adding a significant portion of electronics. Each revolution, each time that their new product rev come out, they add 30% more chips or sensors or something. And that's not the way the industry semiconductor -- the capacity for semiconductors is moving. So we need to add more capacity and we need to add it targeted at those customers."
