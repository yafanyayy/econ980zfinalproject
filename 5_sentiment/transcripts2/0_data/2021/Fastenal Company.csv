I might not be on my A game today, and I point that only because typically, when I do this call, I am very fortunate because then I'd have a moderator in the background, and that is my wife, who listens and will text me if I'm speaking too fast or rapidly or if I'm going too long. And some of you might say, she needs to step in sooner. But today, I think she's probably online trying to see if she can convert her Packer's season tickets into 2 tickets for Sunday's game. Time will tell. But if I go off on tangents, I apologize for that. 
I'd like to start with recapping our Board meeting, the last -- yesterday, our discussions with leadership earlier this morning as we were able to share our earnings and our progress a little bit more broadly within the organization. And a bit of the video that we share with the 20,000-plus employees within Fastenal. And one is a more somber piece, and that is, as we've done in prior quarters, just want to share some COVID statistics with our shareholders because we can talk about a lot of things, but we have to start with the most important and that is we were not immune, if you will, to the effects of COVID on the health of the Fastenal Blue Team family. 
Through September, and I've previously shared this information, we had 344 cases of COVID within the Fastenal organization. In the month of September, we were averaging about 17 new cases a week. In October, and as we progressed in the fourth quarter, we experienced what was experienced, generally speaking, throughout the markets when we operate. Our case count increased dramatically. In October, we had 27 cases per week, a 10 increase over the 17 in September. So 106 cases. So through October, we had cumulatively 450 cases within the Fastenal family. That number essentially doubled in November. In November, we had 430 cases, 86 per week. And in December, we're starting to see that trend down, but still quite high at 60 per week. 238 cases. So cumulatively, through the end of the year, we had 1,118 cases within Fastenal. That's just over 5% of our population of employees. 
When you consider the fact that our business and the way we operate doesn't afford us the ability to remove ourselves from society. 93%, 94% of our employees are in roles that involve day-to-day interactions with other human beings, whether that's at our branch or on-site locations, working in a distribution center, working in manufacturing, driving a truck, so we didn't have that luxury. And the fact that our number, I believe the U.S. population, if what I read is accurate, were just over 7% of the U.S. population has had COVID, and we're about 5%. So I believe our team has done a really nice job of exercising common sense and trying to protect themselves and those around them every day and being mindful of the anxieties that exist in society. 
When I think of 2020, I also think of things that we did from the perspective of things we did to improve our moat, to widen our moat, to improve our business as we move into 2021 and beyond. And I think one of the first things is we demonstrated to the market and we demonstrated to ourselves, perhaps, a bit of our problem-solving ability. Our growth drivers demonstrated their value. And value from the standpoint of it's a special way to engage with our customer. And because of the vending devices we have deployed, because of the onsites we have deployed, because of the way we engage with our customer, when most people were turned away at a customer's door, our folks were allowed to enter. And they were allowed to enter because we were stocking bins. We were filling vending machines. We were staffing the support infrastructure of their business from within inside their facility. And that was a special place to be and a special relationship. And because of that, we saw the success that we did in Qs 2, 3 and 4 on our ability to react and serve that marketplace in a unique way. 
The other pieces we demonstrated to a whole new group of customers, maybe something that's special about Fastenal. The other thing that I reminded our teams, and I reminded our Board is we're coming into a weird year. We're forced to pivot, and that's a great thing. We look forward to this pivot versus the last. But the optics of the year are abnormal. And I just sort of want to remind the analyst community of that is the, I don't recall in my 25 years with Fastenal, might have happened, maybe it happened back in the '90s or '80s or '70s. I don't recall a year where we entered, and we're going to be down 2 business days. And as all of you know, that's an important ingredient in our ability to grow and leverage the business. So in Q1, we will lose 1 business day. Q2, we don't lose any business days or gain any business days, but we have some weird comps because of the extreme surge we saw in safety sales in Q2 last year. Q3 is a normal quarter, if you will, and that it's a push on days. And in Q4, we lose a business day. So it's a 253 business day year versus 255. I just want to point that out. 
When I -- when you read the document and you hear our conversation, we'll touch on some things about the Apex transaction that we did back in March. And I'm really, really excited about what that means as far as our ability to broaden and illuminate how we serve our customer. And Apex is the technology that underpins our vending platform. And we have the largest industrial vending platform on the planet, and it's a great platform. A lot of our other systems were disjointed from that because it was a captive platform and so it allows us to broaden where we can bring supply chain knowledge and visibility to. And we're now referring to that as the FMI suite of things, Fastenal Managed Inventory. Within that are 3 distinct components, and Holden did a nice job illuminating it, I think, in the press release, and we'll talk about it today. But in that is F is FAST Vend, which is our vending platform, as we've talked about for years. The second component is FAST Bin, that's B-I-N. And that's a suite of bin technology, it's not restricted access like you see in the vending machine, it's open access. But it's for a lot of things like fasteners or pipe fittings or things like that. But it's smart in the standpoint the system tells us when it's hungry and needs to be fed. And we don't need to have a person go check it or worse yet, our frequency of checking, it means we have a bin that runs out. And it allow us to lean down inventory and eliminate the supply chain for our customer over time. So it's a better supply chain, but it's also more efficient from a labor productivity supply chain. The third component is what we call FAST Stock. And that is we deployed, as you all know, a tremendous amount of mobility technology. Now we've had a platform in the past, but that platform was very transactional based. This is more system based and allows us, again, to illuminate for the customer what they have in their facility, which is more efficient for the customer, more efficient for us. So we'll talk about that in combined, but take nothing away from the individual components of vending, which is a great element to enhance growth and engagement with our customer. We're just broadening it because the Apex transaction allows us to do that. 
If I move into Holden's flipbook, you can see -- and I'm on Page 3, our daily sales grew 6.5% in the quarter. The team did a great job of managing our operating cost throughout 2020 and it was exemplified in the current quarter, and we produced operating earnings that were double digit, 10.6%. 
Safety, as we've talked about on numerous prior calls, and I suspect will continue to talk about in the calls as we enter 2021 because COVID is not behind us. But safety has been an outperformer for years, largely because it's a product line that matches really well with our FAST Vend, our vending platform. So in the -- so despite safety being a little bit less than 20% of sales, it's produced, for the last several years, about 26% of our growth. But the contributions swelled to 156% in 2020. And as I touched on and when I was first talking, it highlighted our problem-solving culture in the marketplace and I believe this should open up new customer and end market opportunities to us in the future, and Holden will touch a little bit on that in the news talk. 
Customer engagement on growth drivers has improved. However, as you saw in 2020, it ravaged our ability to sign because in an environment where you're working really hard to protect your employees, maybe the last thing you want to do is, all of a sudden, hey, come on, folks, it's Fastenal. We love what you do, why don't you come in and move in with us. It introduces a variable that many folks in a year like 2020 don't want to introduce, and you saw that show up in our signing numbers, and I'll touch on that more in a few minutes. 
The Apex purchase I touched on already. Utilization of e-commerce took a big step-up in 2020. As I mentioned, commercialization of our FAST Bin and deployment of mobility, I believe, will really evolve our model and evolve our ability to be efficient. Because one thing that's really critical in this path, and we've talked about this for 4 or 5 years now, what's really critical is we're going much deeper into a -- what we call our key accounts growth, much deeper into a large customer. And the gross margin profile because of customer mix and product mix changes. And then it's incumbent upon us to allow the natural leverage to shine through. In other words, if you're doing more dollars, you have more places to spread your expense, but also to become more efficient, and that's what all these things tie to. 
The last piece is our branch model. We've evolved it -- and we'll touch on this in the months to come. But there's 2 distinct Fastenal branch models that have emerged in 2020. One is what we refer to as the CSB, the customer service branch. And that's the traditional branch that many of you are familiar with, where there's a showroom in front. There's walk-in element to our business. Still, most of it is going out the back door, but it's a more traditional. It's about half of our branch network today, during 2020, and actually, we've been testing this within a handful of regions for the last 2, 3 years. We have what's referred to as the CFC, the customer fulfillment center. Think of it as a branch where we closed the front door and the marketplace almost like that better or we're able to operate more efficiently and maybe we should keep it closed or maybe it's closed to everything other than a will call or a pickup or maybe on a regular account base. And it allows everybody to go out the backdoor and most of our revenues go out to backdoor. And that is about half our branch network right now. And those are the things that are driving improvements to things like e-commerce that I'll touch on in a few minutes. 
The last thing is, and I want to put a call out, I'm sitting here at a table with Holden Lewis and Sheryl Lisowski, our Chief Financial Officer and our Chief Accounting Officer. Different circumstances allow folks to shine in different ways, and our team was able to shine this year from the standpoint of solving problems in supply chain for customers. Holden and Sheryl and the entire team was able to shine in that we produced an amazingly strong cash flow in 2020. And it put us in a position late in the year, similar to we've seen in prior occasions, where we had some extra cash. We still didn't see a need for that in our investments in the future, and we paid out a supplemental dividend late in the year. So my complements to everybody on that as well. 
On Page 4, I started sharing this slide, I believe it was back in July. And this is looking at dispenses to vending. I think it's a way for us to illuminate for you, our shareholder, what we're seeing in underlying trends. So we index everything to 100, and these are weekly snapshots of dispenses going through those 95,000-plus vending devices in 25 countries. 
History would say, if we're at 100, we should be at 103 by the early March. And the reason I call out that data point, that's right before the world shut down. This year, we were running 2 points ahead of that, we were at 105. And as the economy shut down, so did the dispensing activity at our vending devices and it dropped 29 from 105 to 76. By the end of June, history would say we should be at 109, 2020 wasn't historic in that regard, we were at 93. So we were down 16 still from that 29 drop-off in March and April. By the end of September, history says, hey, we should be 112, we were 104. So that negative 16 is now a negative 8. And we always ignored the last couple of weeks of December because it's the world kind of shuts down because of the holidays. So if you look at the week just before that, history says, you should be about 121, we had about 115. We're still down. A piece of that is economic activity. A piece of that is we didn't sign as many vending devices because we weren't able to move in with as many people as we'd like to. And -- but -- and we're down 6. 
The next page said, this is dispenses, the next page is unique users. So how many people are coming to work at these customers. If there's 100 employees coming in every week back in October of 2019, history would say, because we've signed more machines, that should grow to 104. This year, we were at 107 in early March. Well, when those businesses shut down and weren't using as much just because they didn't have as many employees. The number dropped 22 and it dropped from 107 to 85. The -- history says, by the end of June, we should be at 109, we are at 101. We're down 8. By the end of September, we should be at 115, we were at 109. We're down 6. By that week before Christmas, we should be at 123, we're down 119, negative 4. In the employment front, that negative 4 is probably more about we didn't sign as many devices. So people are coming back to work and you're seeing in the underlying numbers. But there's still -- the activity is still subdued. 
And the one thing I did and point out on Page 4, and apologize for that. A few of the blips you see, in early July, that's obviously July 4th week. In late November, that's obviously Thanksgiving week. 
Going to Page 6. Onsites, we signed 36 in the quarter. Again, really, really choppy year. So we signed -- our goal coming in the quarter is 375 to 400. We're coming into the year, excuse me, was 375 and 400. It slowed in March. So in first quarter, we signed about 85. Second quarter was 40. Came back a bit in Q3 at 62. In many ways, Q4 was a more chaotic environment than Q2 was. In that case surge, I talked about our own surge internally, and we only signed 36, so 223 for the year. But Holden included in the flipbook and included in our write up, our mindset is the same. The market, we believe, will support us signing 375 to 400 a year. Conditions need to open up to allow us to do that. I don't want the investment community to read from what we sit here, ""Oh, things are back to normal. Everything is Hunky Dory, and we're going to do 400 signings."" This is going to play out in Q1 and Q2. And as we bought into the year, the way the economy and the marketplace and the COVID environment will allow it to happen. You saw how it played out in 2020. We don't have a crystal ball. We don't -- we're not the burning bush. We can't tell you what's going to happen. What you can tell is we believe the marketplace likes what this Onsite is about and is open to that Onsite. And it's really about engagement with the customer. The Onsite signings is just a marker in time of what that engagement has translated into. But we're very bullish on the fact that Onsite proved its value in 2020. 
Vending, I talked earlier about the whole FMI concept. That's meant to provide better information to the investment community, not to confuse the issue with vending and bins and all that kind of stuff. So read it as this is an outgrowth of the Apex transaction. 
E-commerce, 38% growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. In March, we broke 10% of our sales being e-commerce for the first time ever. And I'm pleased to say that despite the fact that the surge actually hurt it because most of the surge orders, actually, almost all of them, are outside of e-commerce. That's people in a chaotic fashion order getting product from us, and a lot of that is over the phone. But despite all that, for the first time in our history, e-commerce is more than 10% of our revenue. And again, that's e-commerce measured the way this community measures it. I personally think that's an inaccurate way to measure it because I think 20% of our revenue being Vending is E-commerce. I think 7% to 10% of our revenue being bins and FAST Stock is e-commerce. Because -- but it's better than e-commerce because the customer doesn't have to order it. That's the best digital flow there is. And then the final being this 10% debt true is e-commerce. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Holden because I don't have my text from my wife telling me to shut up."

Fourth quarter of 2020 sales were up 6.4% annually, that's an acceleration from the third quarter. Holiday timing was favorable this year, but even so, the overall tenor of the marketplace continued to improve during the period. Sales of safety products were up 34.6%, driven by growth to state and local government and health care customers, which is at 98.3% in the period. This continues to be some blend of COVID mitigation, PPE restocking and prestocking as well as share gains. The most encouraging data point is that 28% of the accounts that bought PPE from us for the first time in the second quarter of 2020, bought from us in the fourth quarter, and they tended to be the larger opportunities. So this continues to reinforce that we have gained share and increased our growth prospects with state and local government and health care customers that's going to carry into 2021. 
Nonsafety products were up 0.3% annually, accelerating versus the third quarter of 2020. Janitorial products, driven by the same trends as safety, were up 30.3%. More cyclical verticals remain negative in the fourth quarter of 2020, but generally saw moderation in the rates of decline. In fact, fasteners and material handling edged into growth territory in December. 
Improving macro data is producing better trends in core markets, particularly in manufacturing, which grew 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020. We don't have a lot of visibility, but our regional VPs remain optimistic that activity will continue to improve. The exception to this normalization is our growth driver signings. COVID continues to negatively affect labor markets and supply chains, but our customers are operating around those conditions. We believe that absent COVID, the market will support 100 vending signings per day and 100 Onsite signings per quarter. However, lack of access to facilities and decision-makers in light of COVID protocols is delaying new commitments, the challenge that is carrying into the first quarter of 2021 and makes it difficult to determine when signings activity will return to potential. 
Now to Slide 8. Gross margin was 45.6% in the fourth quarter of 2020, down 130 basis points due to product and channel mix, relative growth of lower-margin COVID products and organizational factors such as further clearance, lower vendor rebates and overhead deleveraging. Gross margin was up 30 basis points sequentially in a quarter that more commonly sees a decline. Relative to the third quarter of 2020, we saw the revenue share of lower-margin COVID-related products declined by 200 basis points, even as the margin on those products improved by 200 basis points on selective pricing actions taken in the quarter. We also experienced more favorable shipping and fleet costs in the period, largely from having rationalized our weekly routes earlier in the year. 
Strong growth and continued tight control of costs generated 210 basis points of SG&A leverage to produce an operating margin of 19.5%, up 80 basis points year-to-year. Nearly half this leverage came over labor costs as our record fourth quarter sales were achieved with headcount that was down mid-single digits versus last year. Labor productivity improved meaningfully in the fourth quarter and full year of 2020 and  we will look to sustain this in 2021. We also leveraged occupancy on lower branch count and vending costs as well as other expenses on tight control of travel, lower freight costs as we rationalized our branch pickup fleet and lower insurance costs. Our incremental margin was 31%. 
If you put it all together, we reported a fourth quarter 2020 earnings per share of $0.34, up 9.6% from $0.31 in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Turning to Slide 9. We produced $321 million of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2020, representing 164% of net income. For the full year, we produced $1.1 billion of operating cash flow or 128% of net income. Weak demand freed up cash and working capital, and we did benefit from $30 million in CARES Act-related deferred payroll taxes and about $20 million in payables that moved from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021. However, we also believe we are taking steps to be more productive with working capital. Accounts receivable were up 3.7% with growth related to higher sales mitigated by improved collections, with past dues down 23% year-over-year. Inventories were down 2.1%. We have taken steps to make it easier to move inventory internally to get it where it can best be used, which has been particularly useful as we have closed branches and migrated other branches to a leaner inventory model. We put energy into clearing older stock from our branches and hubs. As a result, branch inventory was down nearly 8% at year-end, while onsite and hub inventory was up just low single digits. 
Net capital spending was $158 million in 2020, the lower end of our $155 million to $180 million range. In 2021, we expect net capital spending to be $170 million to $200 million, with the increase over the prior year being a combination of catch-up maintenance spending following tight spending controls in 2020 as well as higher spending for a nonhub facility project that we know to support our growth. 
Record net income and operating cash flow in 2020 allowed us to acquire the assets of Apex, deploy significant resources to secure critical products and carry working capital for customers and returned $855 million to investors in the form of dividends, including a special dividend in December and share repurchase. At the same time, net debt is just 5.1% of total capital and substantially all of our revolvers are available for use. 
Now before turning it over to Q&A, there's 1 change to reporting I wanted to discuss, and Dan alluded to this. The bin stocks have long been used in distribution to hold product and customer facilities. Over the last few years, we have taken these bins, and we've equipped them with scales or sensors that turn them into digital tools that provide product visibility, continuously monitor those products and generate fulfillment efficiencies. These FAST Bins complement Vending to expand the products that can be digitally managed and round out our Fastenal Managed Inventory, or FMI offering. And we anticipate commercializing them more aggressively in 2021. As a result, in 2021, we will replace reporting on vending signings with weighted FMI signings. This is going to convert each vending device and FAST Bin device into a standard unit based on the target output of our FAST 5000 vending machine, which is 2,000 a month and combine that into a single data point. 
In 2020, our weighted FMI signings were 15,724. In 2021, we are targeting 23,000 to 25,000 weighted FMI signings. 
With that, operator, we'll take questions."

I guess I could probably interpret about 20 questions in that one. So I'll try to keep it short. If I think about, starting at gross margin, if I think about 2021, this might be one of those years where given the easy comps that we have, I would expect our gross margin to be up year-over-year. Now I've had some conversations with folks that are getting really, really high numbers and that sort of thing, so I don't think that the concept surprises anybody. But in order of magnitude, I think we need to think about, in 2019, our gross margin was 47.2%. If nothing else had changed, let's assume that mix would have pulled that down 60 basis points a year in 2020 and 2021, which puts it at about 46%, just naturally on mix, if nothing else had changed. The -- but if I think about -- so if I think about that as kind of a baseline, it's true that I don't expect the inefficiencies, particularly in the second quarter, to repeat. But I do expect that we're going to have higher COVID mix in 2020, just those types of projects in 2021 than we did in 2019. And I think that's going to work against that 2019 baseline a little bit. 
If I think about -- we're still going to be selling through mask inventory through the first 2 or 3 quarters of the year, and that's going to pull margin down a little bit. I will tell you, I think the shipping costs are showing every indication of probably moving up as we get towards the end of first quarter into second quarter, and so I think there's some pressure there. And so like I said, I do believe that our gross margin will be up a bit in 2021 over 2020. But as I said, I think we need to be somewhat tempered in our expectations of the order of magnitude. And I say that only because I've had some conversations where I think people are being a bit over aggressive with that. So hopefully, that gives you, Adam, a little bit of a framework to think about gross margin. 
As it relates to operating margin, I would expect that labor would get better or that we would add labor. I do consider that getting better because it means we're adding selling energy. But whatever our growth winds up being the top line, I would expect that our increase in FTEs would be no more than 50% of that growth and perhaps somewhat less than that. And I think that's kind of the objective of the organization. And so I think that we will leverage labor when we grow this year. 
And so when you tie it all together, I'm still thinking in terms of the framework of 20% to 25% incremental margins based on whatever level of growth that we can achieve this year. And those are, I think, the pieces that I would think about."

If I think of the FMI vending -- FMI vend component, that is really a non-Fastenal thing and close to 50% of the revenue going through vending is a safety product. So as we were evolving through that, go back to the earlier part of the last decade, we are having those discussions about what that meant from a mix standpoint. 
If I think of the FMI bin, and then I think of the excuse me -- FAST Bin and FAST Stock, FAST Bin, especially the RFID component of that, is, in a lot of cases, it might be in a production environment, where it's a Kanban system and when that bin is empty, you throw in a tub up above your shelf, and it tells us you have an empty bin. So it's pretty basic technology, if you think about it that way, resilient technology. That's probably more production environment, so that probably has a gross margin profile that's more akin to the vending. 
If I think of it from the standpoint of -- at my the third piece, FAST Stock, that's a lot of MRO, or a nice mix of MRO. And so that's probably -- and it's very fastener centered, and so that has a margin that's more like the fastener piece. Does that help, Dave?"

And my answer is often if vending machine doesn't have a gross margin, it really depends on the product that's vended and what margin comes with that product. And I would think about the FAST Bin the same way. I don't think the bin has an inherent margin, it depends on what is being stored in that bin. And so when we think about the bins, we've always had FAST Stock, which has been heavily oriented towards fasteners. And so you would argue that, that bin has a fastener type of margin. 
What we believe will happen in addition to the efficiencies that Dan talked about in terms of the fulfillment process, we think that these FAST Bins will actually lend themselves to our being able to be more involved with other lines outside of fasteners. Power transmission and fluid power come to mind, for instance. 
And so the -- we've always done fasteners in these bids. We'll continue to do fasteners in these bins. We have the benefits and efficiencies for fulfillment. We'll certainly try to leverage that into even more market share faster. But we've always done that.

I probably don't want to get ahead of ourselves on what that means for 2021 because it's still going to be -- it's still something new and to be honest with you, the only reason -- when we started vending years ago, we didn't start talking about it until we were about 3 years into it. And here, we're actually talking about it when we're about a year into it. And the other reason being is because in some cases, where we would have put a vending machine in the past, I think we'll put some bins in now because we now have a better suite of products because we own the underlying technology, and it improves our ability to bring the most efficient tool to bear. The -- we've talked in previous calls about what we call our LIFT concept, local inventory fulfillment terminal. And really, what that's about is perhaps, sometimes the best place to stock product as a PIC product is in the local branch or onsite. Sometimes were to do -- put that product is in the regional distribution center. And really what we're doing with LIFT is something we talked about years ago is supporting vending with maybe 1/3 type of distribution, and that's the fulfillment terminal, we're just what's gone in the vending machine is what's in that little LIFT facility. And we're managing it there, and we're able to strip -- these are high-frequency turnover products. We're able to strip some of that out of our branch and break it into the  LIFT facility, which is, from a labor standpoint, more efficient. But from a working capital standpoint, incredibly attractive over time. 
We had -- we have 9 LIFT facilities that are operating at the end of the year. We're still just touching a really, really small percentage of our vending devices. I think we're touching about 2,500 right now. And our goal is to double that LIFT from 9 operating at the end of this year to 18 at the end of next year. We'll still be -- even with our optimistic projections, still touching a relatively small number of vending devices at the end of the year, but it's ever growing, and that will work some working capital out. But it's still on a relatively small base. That logic equally applies to FAST Bin and FAST Stock."

Now those 80 widgets will still probably include some safety stock from our perspective because we want to make sure that we don't shut the customer down. And we need to make sure that we go and we check those bins and check those machines, et cetera. And so those 80 widgets are improvement. But when you think about what FAST Bin can do in terms of informing us in real-time about need, it's possible that those 80 widgets can be 75 because we're much more aware of what the quantities on hand are. 
I agree with Dan. I think 2021 is far too early to talk about what the impact of this is on working capital. This is the first year we're really aggressively commercializing what we've built and worked on. But I mean, intuitively, if we market this correctly, and I think we will, there should be some benefit over time to working capital from the efficiencies it brings to the fulfillment."

It's the way we spoke at our Virtual Leadership Meeting back in December, and it's centered on our government business, which was a huge recipient of a lot of these COVID type service sales. 
Our government business historically is a relatively small part of our business, it's about 4%. In the second quarter, it surged over 10% of our business. And I don't know what the final number was for the year, but it was -- through most of the year, on a year-to-date basis, it was up over 100% year-over-year. And so when we come into a year like 2021, the way we talk about it internally is, ""Okay, normally, that business, which is still a young business, we would expect it to grow, say, 20% a year."" So when we're looking at second quarter of 2021 for our government business, we're saying to our teams, ignore your year-over-year numbers because all that matters right now is where are we in January and where are we building to in September and October. And then what does that mean for 2022? But in the case of the second quarter, as an example, take your 2019 Q2 numbers, if you are in the government -- if you're leading our government team, add to it the 20% we would have expected in Q2 2020, ignoring the COVID thing, and then add another 20% to it for 2021. So 2019 plus 2020, 20 plus 20, 20% twice over. And that's where your head should be on where you're growing to -- going to be in the second quarter. And that's going to be a negative number for government in the second quarter, unless there's a different way to do math. And then the challenge to them is because of the broader exposure we received in the marketplace and the fact that more government customers know about us. And the only area where our Onsite signings accelerated in 2020 over 2019 was with government customers. In the rest of the world, you saw our overall numbers. 
And does that 20 plus 20 contemplate the fact that more people want to buy from us or more people are aware of us, and maybe that second 20 can become a 25 or 30, I don't know. But that's the way we're thinking about it."

Now this is an odd year because you look at our revenue, see demand was weak. But a lot of our demand didn't necessarily run through a lot of our physical structure. There's a lot more direct shift type of business in 2020 than is typical. 
The sort of off the side of that is if demand begins to go up, begins to improve, and that improvement is impacting the core of our business, which is our field sales and our branches and taking advantage of the business that we've built over 50-plus years, then we're going to leverage those assets. And so part of the -- I think part of the answer to your question is, what do you expect next year in terms of industrial production growth and market growth. If you believe that we're going to be growing next year, then I would expect that 2021, we would be leveraging. And we would be getting some benefit from that in contrast to what we saw in 2020.

And I feel we're better poised to do that than we have historically because we have better tracking information. We've deployed a lot of new technology over the last few years in order to continue to deploy it. And one of those is better illuminating what's where in our system, just like when you ship a small parcel, being able to know exactly where it is at any given point in time, we're getting better at that ourselves. 
The only other nuance I'd probably introduce is I mean, yes, we are a cyclical we're viewed within investing circles as a cyclical type company. Remember that we don't have anywhere near the amount of fixed cost in our gross profit or I guess, in our cost of goods as, say, an average manufacturer does, right? So does our leverage and deleverage work the same way? Yes, it does. Does it have the same order of magnitude on the upside or the downside as an average manufacturer does? No. No, we tend to be a little bit more muted in that regard. But it behaves the same way as your classic cyclical."

We're just nervous about change right now. We're worried about what's happening in the next 8 hours, 2 weeks, 2 months. We're more worried about that than we are about strategically improving our business because we don't have that luxury. And we don't want to invite new risk even have you move in. And so I think it would manifest itself in the fact that our pipeline that would expand, and you would see a resumption of the goals we talked -- the targets we talked about on Onsite signings and vending signings, et cetera. And again, those are markers to engagement with our customer. That's where you'd see it. 
I think you'd see the underlying economy improve because people, let's face it, we all -- we're all really tired of this. We want to get back to something that's closer to normal and retain -- there's a whole bunch of things that we learned in the last 10 months. But frankly, would it have taken us years to accomplish?

If COVID gets resolved, we may -- we have that tough comp in safety, but we have really easy comps in everything that's not safety, which is a bigger part of our mix, right? 
People might be concerned about our market share gains and safety and government, if COVID normalized, but it didn't do as well on signings because of it. And so we might lose one, but we gain the other. I think if you stand back from the specifics and look at the overall results for the year, it was -- actually, I think Dan and I both used in some writings, it was kind of a boring year or an unremarkable year if you step back and don't think about the specifics and just look at our results. And that combines remarkable performance in safety, terrible performance goes to the market in nonsafety. And if COVID gets resolved, that flips. And that's the perspective I would offer."

And I'll share an example, tomorrow is an important milestone for us. A year ago, on January 21, we did something we've never done. After conversations with 1 of our trusted suppliers, a company upriver called 3M, we locked down in our network N95 mask respirators because of what we were learning from our team in China, from our supplier base, and we locked it down, and we've never done that before. And we did it with some really crude tools. We just basically shut off our request system for one part for several part numbers.

And some of you might say, she needs to step in sooner. But today, I think she's probably online trying to see if she can convert her Packers season tickets into 2 tickets for Sunday's game. Time will tell. But if I go off on tangents, I apologize for that.
I'd like to start with recapping our Board meeting, the last -- yesterday, our discussions with leadership earlier this morning as we were able to share our earnings and our progress a little bit more broadly within the organization and a bit of the video that we share with the 20,000-plus employees within Fastenal. And one is a more somber piece, and that is, as we've done in prior quarters, just want to share some COVID statistics with our shareholders because we can talk about a lot of things, but we have to start with the most important and that is we were not immune, if you will, to the effects of COVID on the health of the Fastenal Blue Team family.
Through September, and I've previously shared this information, we had 344 cases of COVID within the Fastenal organization. In the month of September, we were averaging about 17 new cases a week. In October, and as we progressed through the fourth quarter, we experienced what was experienced, generally speaking, throughout the markets when we operate. Our case count increased dramatically. In October, we had 27 cases per week, a 10 increase over the 17 in September. So 106 cases.
So through October, we had cumulatively 450 cases within the Fastenal family. That number essentially doubled in November. In November, we had 430 cases, 86 per week. And in December, we're starting to see that trend down, but still quite high at 60 per week. 238 cases. So cumulatively, through the end of the year, we had 1,118 cases within Fastenal. That's just over 5% of our population of employees.
When you consider the fact that our business and the way we operate doesn't afford us the ability to remove ourselves from society. 93%, 94% of our employees are in roles that involve day-to-day interactions with other human beings, whether that's at our branch or on-site locations, working in a distribution center, working in manufacturing, driving a truck, so we didn't have that luxury. And the fact that our number -- I believe the U.S. population -- if what I read is accurate, where just over 7% of the U.S. population has had COVID, and we're about 5%. So I believe our team has done a really nice job of exercising common sense and trying to protect themselves and those around them every day and being mindful of the anxieties that exist in society.
When I think of 2020, I also think of things that we did from the perspective of things we did to improve our moat, to widen our moat, to improve our business as we move into 2021 and beyond. And I think one of the first things is we demonstrated to the market and we demonstrated to ourselves, perhaps, a bit of our problem-solving ability. Our growth drivers demonstrated their value. And value from the standpoint of -- it's a special way to engage with our customer. And because of the vending devices we have deployed, because of the Onsites we have deployed, because of the way we engage with our customer, when most people were turned away at a customer's door, our folks were allowed to enter.
And they were allowed to enter because we were stocking bins. We were filling vending machines. We were staffing the support infrastructure of their business from with -- inside their facility. And that was a special place to be and a special relationship. And because of that, we saw the success that we did in Qs 2, 3 and 4 on our ability to react and serve that marketplace in a unique way.
The other pieces we demonstrated to a whole new group of customers, maybe that's something that's special about Fastenal. The other thing that I reminded our teams and I reminded our Board is we're coming into a weird year. We're forced to pivot, and that's a great thing. We look forward to this pivot versus the last. But the optics of the year are abnormal. And I just sort of want to remind the analyst community of that is the, I don't recall in my 25 years with Fastenal, might have happened, maybe it happened back in the '90s or '80s or '70s. I don't recall a year where we entered, and we're going to be down 2 business days. And as all of you know, that's an important ingredient in our ability to grow and leverage the business.
So in Q1, we will lose 1 business day. Q2, we don't lose any business days or gain any business days, but we have some weird comps because of the extreme surge we saw in safety sales in Q2 last year. Q3 is a normal quarter, if you will, and that it's a push on days. And in Q4, we lose a business day. So it's a 253 business day year versus 255. Just want to point that out.
When I -- when you read the document and you hear our conversation, we'll touch on some things about the Apex transaction that we did back in March. And I'm really, really excited about what that means as far as our ability to broaden and illuminate how we serve our customer. And Apex is the technology that underpins our vending platform. And we have the largest industrial vending platform on the planet, and it's a great platform.
A lot of our other systems were disjointed from that because it was a captive platform. And so it allows us to broaden where we can bring supply chain knowledge and visibility to. And we're now referring to that as the FMI suite of things, Fastenal Managed Inventory. Within that are 3 distinct components, and Holden did a nice job illuminating it, I think, in the press release, and we'll talk about it today.
But in that is FAST Vend, which is our vending platform, as we've talked about for years. The second component is FAST Bin, that's B-I-N. And that's a suite of bin technology. It's not restricted access like you see in the vending machine, it's open access. But it's for a lot of things like fasteners or pipe fittings or things like that. But it's smart in the standpoint the system tells us when it's hungry and needs to be fed. And we don't need to have a person go check it or worse yet, our frequency of checking, it means we have a bin that runs out. And it allow us to lean down inventory and eliminate the supply chain for our customer over time. So it's a better supply chain, but it's also more efficient from a labor productivity supply chain.
The third component is what we call FAST Stock. And that is we deployed, as you all know, a tremendous amount of mobility technology. Now we've had a platform in the past, but that platform was very transactional based. This is more system based and allows us, again, to illuminate for the customer what they have in their facility, which is more efficient for the customer, more efficient for us. So we'll talk about that in combined, but take nothing away from the individual components of vending, which is a great element to enhance growth and engagement with our customer. We're just broadening it because the Apex transaction allows us to do that.
If I move into Holden's flipbook, you can see -- and I'm on Page 3, our daily sales grew 6.5% in the quarter. The team did a great job of managing our operating cost throughout 2020 and it was exemplified in the current quarter, and we produced operating earnings that were double digit, 10.6%.
Safety, as we've talked about on numerous prior calls and we'll, I suspect, continue to talk about in the calls as we enter 2021 because COVID is not behind us. But safety has been an outperformer for years largely because it's a product line that matches really well with our FAST Vend, our vending platform. So in the -- so despite safety being a little bit less than 20% of sales, it's produced, for the last several years, about 26% of our growth. But the contributions swelled to 156% in 2020. And as I touched on and when I was first talking, it highlighted our problem-solving culture in the marketplace and I believe this should open up new customer and end market opportunities to us in the future, and Holden will touch a little bit on that in his talk.
Customer engagement on growth drivers has improved. However, as you saw in 2020, it ravaged our ability to sign because in an environment where you're working really hard to protect your employees, maybe the last thing you want to do is, all of a sudden, ""Hey, come on, folks, it's Fastenal. We love what you do. Why don't you come in and move in with us?"" It introduces a variable that many folks in a year like 2020 don't want to introduce, and you saw that show up in our signing numbers, and I'll touch on that more in a few minutes.
The Apex purchase, I touched on already. Utilization of e-commerce took a big step-up in 2020. As I mentioned, commercialization of our FAST Bin and deployment of mobility, I believe, will really evolve our model and evolve our ability to be efficient. Because one thing that's really critical in this path, and we've talked about this for 4 or 5 years now, what's really critical is we're going much deeper into a -- what we call our key accounts growth, much deeper into a large customer. And the gross margin profile, because of customer mix and product mix, changes. And then it's incumbent upon us to allow the natural leverage to shine through. In other words, if you're doing more dollars, you have more places to spread your expense but also to become more efficient, and that's what all these things tie to.
The last piece is our branch model. We've evolved it -- and we'll touch on this in the months to come. But there's 2 distinct Fastenal branch models that have emerged in 2020. One is what we refer to as the CSB, the customer service branch. And that's the traditional branch that many of you are familiar with where there's a showroom in front. There's a walk-in element to our business. Still, most of it is going out the back door, but it's more traditional. It's about half of our branch network today.
During 2020 -- and actually, we've been testing this within a handful of regions for the last 2, 3 years. We have what's referred to as the CFC, the customer fulfillment center. Think of it as a branch where we close the front door and the marketplace almost like that better or we're able to operate more efficiently and maybe we should keep it closed or maybe it's closed to everything other than a will call or a pickup or maybe on a regular account base. And it allows everybody to go out the backdoor and most of our revenues go out the backdoor. And that is about half our branch network right now. And those are the things that are driving improvements to things like e-commerce that I'll touch on in a few minutes.
The last thing is, and I want to put a call out, I'm sitting here at a table with Holden Lewis and Sheryl Lisowski, our Chief Financial Officer and our Chief Accounting Officer. Different circumstances allow folks to shine in different ways, and our team was able to shine this year from the standpoint of solving problems in supply chain for customers. Holden and Sheryl and the entire team was able to shine in that we produced an amazingly strong cash flow in 2020. And it put us in a position late in the year, similar that we have seen in prior occasions where we had some extra cash. We still didn't see a need for that in our investments of the future, and we paid out a supplemental dividend late in the year. So my compliments to everybody on that as well.
On Page 4, I started sharing this slide, I believe it was back in July. And this is looking at dispenses through vending. I think it's a way for us to illuminate for you, our shareholder, what we're seeing in underlying trends. So we index everything to 100, and these are weekly snapshots of dispenses going through those 95,000-plus vending devices in 25 countries.
History would say, if we're at 100, we should be at 103 by the early March. And the reason I call out that data point, that's right before the world shut down. This year, we were running 2 points ahead of that, we were at 105. And as the economy shut down, so did the dispensing activity at our vending devices and it dropped 29 from 105 to 76. By the end of June, history would say we should be at 109, 2020 wasn't historic in that regard, we were at 93. So we were down 16 still from that 29 drop-off in March and April.
By the end of September, history says, hey, we should be 112, we were 104. So that negative 16 is now a negative 8. And we always ignored the last couple of weeks of December because it's -- the world kind of shuts down because of the holidays. So if you look at the week just before that, history says, you should be about 121, we had about 115. We're still down. A piece of that is economic activity. A piece of that is we didn't sign as many vending devices because we weren't able to move in with as many people as we'd like to. And -- but -- and we're down 6.
The next page said -- this is dispenses. The next page is unique users. So how many people are coming to work at these customers. If there's 100 employees coming in every week back in October of 2019, history would say, because we've signed more machines, that should grow to 104. This year, we were at 107 in early March, well, when those businesses shut down and weren't using as much just because they didn't have as many employees. The number dropped 22 and it dropped from 107 to 85. The -- history says, by the end of June, we should be at 109, we are at 101. We're down 8.
By the end of September, we should be at 115, we were at 109. We're down 6. By that week before Christmas, we should be at 123, we're down 119, negative 4. In the employment front, that negative 4 is probably more about we didn't sign as many devices. So people are coming back to work and you're seeing in the underlying numbers. But there's still -- the activity is still subdued. And the one thing I did point out on Page 4, and I apologize for that, a few of the blips you see, in early July, that's obviously July 4th week. In late November, that's obviously Thanksgiving week.
Going to Page 6. Onsites, we signed 36 in the quarter. Again, really, really choppy year. So we signed -- our goal coming in the quarter is 375 to 400 -- or coming into the year, excuse me, was 375 to 400. It slowed in March. So in first quarter, we signed about 85. Second quarter was 40. Came back a bit in Q3 at 62. In many ways, Q4 was a more chaotic environment than Q2 was. In that -- you had case surge -- I talked about our own surge internally. And we only signed 36, so 223 for the year.
But Holden included in the flipbook and included in our write up, our mindset is the same. The market, we believe, will support us signing 375 to 400 a year. Conditions need to open up to allow us to do that. I don't want the investment community to read from what we sit here, ""Oh, things are back to normal. Everything is hunky-dory, and we're going to do 400 signings."" This is going to play out in Q1 and Q2. And as we bought into the year, the way the economy and the marketplace and the COVID environment will allow it to happen.
You saw how it played out in 2020. We don't have a crystal ball. We don't -- we're not the burning bush. We can't tell you what's going to happen. What you can tell is we believe the marketplace likes what this Onsite is about and is open to that Onsite. And it's really about engagement with the customer. The Onsite signings is just a marker in time of what that engagement has translated into. But we're very bullish on the fact that Onsite proved its value in 2020.
Vending, I talked earlier about the whole FMI concept. That's meant to provide better information to the investment community, not to confuse the issue with vending and bins and all that kind of stuff. So read it as this is an outgrowth of the Apex transaction. 
E-commerce, 38% growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. In March, we broke 10% of our sales being e-commerce for the first time ever. And I'm pleased to say that despite the fact that the surge actually hurt it because most of the surge orders, actually, almost all of them, are outside of e-commerce. That's people in a chaotic fashion, order -- getting product from us, and a lot of that is over the phone. But despite all that, for the first time in our history, e-commerce is more than 10% of our revenue.
And again, that's e-commerce measured the way this community measures it. I personally think that's an inaccurate way to measure it because I think 20% of our revenue being vending is e-commerce. I think 7% to 10% of our revenue being bins and FAST Stock is e-commerce because -- but it's better than e-commerce because the customer doesn't have to order it. That's the best digital flow there is. And then the final being this 10%, that really is e-commerce.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Holden because I don't have my text from my wife telling me to shut up."

Fourth quarter of 2020 sales were up 6.4% annually, that's an acceleration from the third quarter. Holiday timing was favorable this year, but even so, the overall tenor of the marketplace continued to improve during the period. Sales of safety products were up 34.6%, driven by growth to state and local government and health care customers, which is at 98.3% in the period.
This continues to be some blend of COVID mitigation, PPE restocking and prestocking as well as share gains. The most encouraging data point is that 28% of the accounts that bought PPE from us for the first time in the second quarter of 2020 bought from us in the fourth quarter, and they tended to be the larger opportunities. So this continues to reinforce that we have gained share and increased our growth prospects with state and local government and health care customers that's going to carry into 2021.
Nonsafety products were up 0.3% annually, accelerating versus the third quarter of 2020. Janitorial products, driven by the same trends as safety, were up 30.3%. More cyclical verticals remained negative in the fourth quarter of 2020 but generally saw moderation in the rates of decline. In fact, fasteners and material handling edged into growth territory in December.
Improving macro data is producing better trends in core markets, particularly in manufacturing, which grew 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020. We don't have a lot of visibility, but our regional VPs remain optimistic that activity will continue to improve.
The exception to this normalization is our growth driver signings. COVID continues to negatively affect labor markets and supply chains, but our customers are operating around those conditions. We believe that absent COVID, the market will support 100 vending signings per day and 100 Onsite signings per quarter. However, lack of access to facilities and decision-makers in light of COVID protocols is delaying new commitments, the challenge that is carrying into the first quarter of 2021 and makes it difficult to determine when signings activity will return to potential.
Now to Slide 8. Gross margin was 45.6% in the fourth quarter of 2020, down 130 basis points due to product and channel mix, relative growth of lower-margin COVID products and organizational factors such as further clearance, lower vendor rebates and overhead deleveraging. Gross margin was up 30 basis points sequentially in a quarter that more commonly sees a decline.
Relative to the third quarter of 2020, we saw the revenue share of lower-margin COVID-related products decline by 200 basis points even as the margin on those products improved by 200 basis points on selective pricing actions taken in the quarter. We also experienced more favorable shipping and fleet costs in the period, largely from having rationalized our weekly routes earlier in the year.
Strong growth and continued tight control of costs generated 210 basis points of SG&A leverage to produce an operating margin of 19.5%, up 80 basis points year-to-year. Nearly half this leverage came over labor costs as our record fourth quarter sales were achieved with headcount that was down mid-single digits versus last year.
Labor productivity improved meaningfully in the fourth quarter and full year of 2020 and we will look to sustain this in 2021. We also leveraged occupancy on lower branch count and vending costs as well as other expenses on tight control of travel, lower freight costs as we rationalized our branch pickup fleet and lower insurance costs. Our incremental margin was 31%. If you put it all together, we reported a fourth quarter 2020 earnings per share of $0.34, up 9.6% from $0.31 in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Turning to Slide 9. We produced $321 million of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2020, representing 164% of net income. For the full year, we produced $1.1 billion of operating cash flow or 128% of net income. Weak demand freed up cash and working capital, and we did benefit from $30 million in CARES Act-related deferred payroll taxes and about $20 million in payables that moved from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021. However, we also believe we are taking steps to be more productive with working capital.
Accounts receivable were up 3.7% with growth related to higher sales mitigated by improved collections, with past dues down 23% year-over-year. Inventories were down 2.1%. We have taken steps to make it easier to move inventory internally to get it where it can best be used, which has been particularly useful as we have closed branches and migrated other branches to a leaner inventory model. We put energy into clearing older stock from our branches and hubs. As a result, branch inventory was down nearly 8% at year-end, while Onsite and hub inventory was up just low single digits.
Net capital spending was $158 million in 2020, the lower end of our $155 million to $180 million range. In 2021, we expect net capital spending to be $170 million to $200 million with the increase over the prior year being a combination of catch-up maintenance spending following tight spending controls in 2020 as well as higher spending for a non-hub facility project in Winona to support our growth.
Record net income and operating cash flow in 2020 allowed us to acquire the assets of Apex, deploy significant resources to secure critical products and carry working capital for customers and return $855 million to investors in the form of dividends, including a special dividend in December and share repurchase. At the same time, net debt is just 5.1% of total capital and substantially all of our revolvers are available for use.
Now before turning it over to Q&A, there's one change to reporting I wanted to discuss, and Dan alluded to this. The bin stocks have long been used in distribution to hold product and customer facilities. Over the last few years, we have taken these bins, and we've equipped them with scales or sensors that turn them into digital tools that provide product visibility, continuously monitor those products and generate fulfillment efficiencies.
These FAST Bins complement Vending to expand the products that can be digitally managed and round out our Fastenal Managed Inventory or FMI offering. And we anticipate commercializing them more aggressively in 2021. As a result, in 2021, we will replace reporting on vending signings with weighted FMI signings. This is going to convert each vending device and FAST Bin device into a standard unit based on the target output of our FAST 5000 vending machine, which is 2,000 a month, and combine that into a single data point. In 2020, our weighted FMI signings were 15,724. In 2021, we are targeting 23,000 to 25,000 weighted FMI signings.
With that, operator, we'll take questions."

I guess I could probably interpret about 20 questions in that one. So I'll try to keep it short. If I think about, starting at gross margin, if I think about 2021, this might be one of those years where given the easy comps that we have, I would expect our gross margin to be up year-over-year.
Now I've had some conversations with folks that are getting really, really high numbers and that sort of thing, so I don't think that the concept surprises anybody. But order of magnitude, I think we need to think about -- in 2019, our gross margin was 47.2%. If nothing else had changed, let's assume that mix would have pulled that down 60 basis points a year in 2020 and 2021, which puts it at about 46%, just naturally on mix, if nothing else had changed.
The -- but if I think about -- so if I think about that as kind of a baseline, it's true that I don't expect the inefficiencies, particularly in the second quarter, to repeat. But I do expect that we're going to have higher COVID mix in 2020, just those types of projects in 2021 than we did in 2019. And I think that's going to work against that 2019 baseline a little bit.
If I think about -- we're still going to be selling through mask inventory through the first 2 or 3 quarters of the year, and that's going to pull margin down a little bit. I will tell you, I think the shipping costs are showing every indication of probably moving up as we get towards the end of first quarter into second quarter, and so I think there's some pressure there.
And so like I said, I do believe that our gross margin will be up a bit in 2021 over 2020. But as I said, I think we need to be somewhat tempered in our expectations of the order of magnitude. And I say that only because I've had some conversations where I think people are being a bit overaggressive with that. So hopefully, that gives you, Adam, a little bit of a framework to think about gross margin.
As it relates to operating margin, I would expect that labor would get better or that we would add labor. I do consider that getting better because it means we're adding selling energy. But whatever our growth winds up being at the top line, I would expect that our increase in FTEs would be no more than 50% of that growth and perhaps somewhat less than that. And I think that's kind of the objective of the organization. And so I think that we will leverage labor when we grow this year.
And so when you tie it all together, I'm still thinking in terms of the framework of 20% to 25% incremental margins based on whatever level of growth that we can achieve this year. And those are, I think, the pieces that I would think about."

If I think of the FMI Bin, and then I think of the FMI -- excuse me, FAST Bin and FAST Stock, FAST Bin, especially the RFID component of that, is, in a lot of cases, it might be in a production environment, where it's a Kanban system and when that bin is empty, you throw in a tub up above your shelf and it tells us you have an empty bin. So it's pretty basic technology, if you think about it that way, resilient technology. That's probably more production environment, so that probably has a gross margin profile that's more akin to the vending.
If I think of it from the standpoint of -- my -- the third piece, FAST Stock, that's a lot of MRO and -- or a nice mix of MRO. And so that's probably -- and it's very fastener centered, and so that has a margin that's more like the fastener piece. Does that help, Dave?"

I get asked a lot, what is the gross margin of a vending machine? And my answer is often, a vending machine doesn't have a gross margin, it really depends on the product that's vended and what margin comes with that product.
And I would think about the FAST Bin the same way. I don't think the bin has an inherent margin, it depends on what is being stored in that bin. And so when we think about the bins, we've always had FAST Stock, which has been heavily oriented towards fasteners. And so you would argue that, that bin has a fastener type of margin.
What we believe will happen, in addition to the efficiencies that Dan talked about in terms of the fulfillment process, we think that these FAST Bins will actually lend themselves to our being able to be more involved with other lines outside of fasteners. Power transmission and fluid power come to mind, for instance.
And so the -- we've always done fasteners in these bins. We'll continue to do fasteners in these bins. We have the benefits and efficiencies for fulfillment. We'll certainly try to leverage that into even more market share faster. But we've always done that.
But to the extent that we can use FAST Bin to get into some of our other 9 product verticals, a little bit more deeply. Those verticals will typically have a lower gross margin than fasteners. And they'll probably be more consistent with our non-fastener business, which is in that sort of low to mid-40s type of range."

I probably don't want to get ahead of ourselves on what that means for 2021 because it's still going to be -- it's still something new. And to be honest with you, the only reason -- when we started vending years ago, we didn't start talking about it",397,"Yes. I probably don't want to get ahead of ourselves on what that means for 2021 because it's still going to be -- it's still something new. And to be honest with you, the only reason -- when we started vending years ago, we didn't start talking about it until we were about 3 years into it. And here, we're actually talking about it when we're about a year into it. And the other reason being is because in some cases, where we would have put a vending machine in the past, I think we'll put some bins in now because we now have a better suite of products because we own the underlying technology, and it improves our ability to bring the most efficient tool to bear.
The -- we've talked in previous calls about what we call our LIFT concept, Local Inventory Fulfillment Terminal. And really, what that's about is perhaps, sometimes the best place to stock product and to pick product is in the local branch or onsite. Sometimes where to do put that product is in the regional distribution center.
And really, what we're doing with LIFT is something we talked about years ago is supporting vending with maybe a third type of distribution, and that's the fulfillment terminal. We're just -- what's going in that vending machine is what's in that little LIFT facility. And we're managing it there, and we're able to strip -- these are high-frequency turnover products. We're able to strip some of that out of our branch and rake it into the LIFT facility, which is, from a labor standpoint, more efficient. But from a working capital standpoint, incredibly attractive over time.
We had -- we have 9 LIFT facilities that are operating at the end of the year. We're still just touching a really, really small percentage of our vending devices. I think we're touching about 2,500 right now. And our goal is to double that LIFT from 9 operating at the end of this year to 18 at the end of next year.
We'll still be, even with our optimistic projections, still touching a relatively small number of vending devices at the end of the year, but it's ever growing, and that will work some working capital out. But it's still on a relatively small base. That logic equally applies to FAST Bin and FAST Stock."

Now those 80 widgets will still probably include some safety stock from our perspective because we want to make sure that we don't shut the customer down, and we need to make sure that we go and we check those bins and check those machines, et cetera. And so those 80 widgets are an improvement. But when you think about what FAST Bin can do in terms of informing us in real time about need, it's possible that those 80 widgets can be 75 because we're much more aware of what the quantities on hand are.
I agree with Dan. I think 2021 is far too early to talk about what the impact of this is on working capital. This is the first year we're really aggressively commercializing what we've built and worked on. But I mean, intuitively, if we market this correctly, and I think we will, there should be some benefit over time to working capital from the efficiencies it brings to the fulfillment."

It's the way we spoke at our virtual leadership meeting back in December. And it's centered on our government business, which was a huge recipient of a lot of these COVID-type surge sales.
Our government business historically is a relatively small part of our business. It's about 4%. In the second quarter, it surged over 10% of our business. And I don't know what the final number was for the year, but it was -- through most of the year, on a year-to-date basis, it was up over 100% year-over-year.
And so when we come into a year like 2021, the way we talk about it internally is, ""Okay, normally, that business, which is still a young business, we would expect it to grow, say, 20% a year."" So when we're looking at second quarter of 2021 for our government business, we're saying to our teams, ignore your year-over-year numbers because all that matters right now is where are we in January and where are we building to in September and October and then what does that mean for 2022.
But in the case of the second quarter, as an example, take your 2019 Q2 numbers, if you are in the government -- if you're leading our government team. Add to it the 20% we would have expected in Q2 2020, ignoring the COVID thing, and then add another 20% to it for 2021. So 2019 plus 2020, 20% plus 20&, 20% twice over. And that's where your head should be on where you're growing to -- going to be in the second quarter. And that's going to be a negative number for government in the second quarter, unless there's a different way to do math.
And then the challenge to them is because of the broader exposure we received in the marketplace and the fact that more government customers know about us -- and the only area where our Onsite signings accelerated in 2020 over 2019 was with government customers. In the rest of the world, you saw our overall numbers.
And does that 20% plus 20% contemplate the fact that more people want to buy from us or more people are aware of us, and maybe that second 20% can become a 25% or 30%, I don't know. But that's the way we're thinking about it."

And we have seen an uptick in steel. I think many of you have talked about that very same dynamic. And if that continues or persists, then I would anticipate that we would have to take some action to mitigate that.
So right now, we're not taking broad pricing actions. We're certainly doing things from a tactical standpoint as we did to some degree with some of the safety products. But if the trends continue on steel, the way that they've begun or ended, I guess, ended 2021 -- sorry, ended 2020, then I would anticipate that we'd have to take some actions as you roll into the end of Q1 and into Q2 to mitigate that effect."

I know it's still early. And Holden you talked about maybe later this quarter, the rubber hitting the road on that and even put those out there in the market.

If we get into a situation where pricing is necessary because of more econ 101 variables like steel prices going up and things like that, I think that we would be able to address that in the same manner that we've addressed it historically.
The only difference, I would say, is that the structure that we've put in place internally to analyze and act on the -- where cost increases are happening, I think we're in a far better place today than we were pre tariffs. I think the tariffs really prompted us to shore up the technologies that we use, the analytics that we use and the internal structure and personnel that we rely on to make us more effective with that.
So I haven't seen any changes to the market dynamics. I think that our internal dynamics are in a better position today than even was the case 2 years ago pre tariffs."

Our captive fleet is part of that. But frankly, so is manufacturing, so is our purchasing, our Asian purchasing, et cetera, right?
So when demand is weak, that -- you tend to deleverage. Now this is an odd year because you look at our revenue, say, well, demand was weak. But a lot of our demand didn't necessarily run through a lot of our physical structure. There's a lot more direct shift type of business in 2020 than is typical.
The sort of off the side of that is if demand begins to go up, begins to improve, and that improvement is impacting the core of our business, which is our field sales and our branches and taking advantage of the business that we've built over 50-plus years, then we're going to leverage those assets.
And so part of the -- I think part of the answer to your question is, what do you expect next year in terms of industrial production growth and market growth? If you believe that we're going to be growing next year, then I would expect that 2021, we would be leveraging. And we would be getting some benefit from that as in contrast to what we saw in 2020.
So I think that the -- it depends heavily on what your expectations for underlying market growth is."

We have a certain amount that we invest in our freight and other elements of our infrastructure that the -- if we see demand begin to get better, I would expect that you might see increases in that, but not at the same rate that demand grows, and so we would leverage it. So I don't know that -- a ceiling in that.
There's some dynamics in there. We took out a truck -- a data service earlier in the year. When that truck is filled again or is overfilled. And we need to add another day of distribution, another truck service to that branch, that's something we've been doing for years. And so that grows with it.
The challenge for us is we did a really nice job in 2020. When we pulled that truck service out, we didn't see our third-party spend go up because we needed some service that wasn't there, and our team did a great job with that. We need to keep that reined in as well as we go into 2021. And I feel we're better poised to do that than we have historically because we have better tracking information.
We've deployed a lot of new technology over the last few years in order to continue to deploy it. And one of those is better illuminating what's where in our system. Just like when you ship a small parcel, being able to know exactly where it is at any given point in time, we're getting better at that ourselves.
The only other nuance I'd probably introduce is I mean, yes, we are a cyclical -- we're viewed within investing circles as a cyclical type company. Remember that we don't have anywhere near the amount of fixed cost in our gross profit or I guess, in our cost of goods as, say, an average manufacturer does, right?
So does our leverage and deleverage work the same way? Yes, it does. Does it have the same order of magnitude on the upside or the downside as an average manufacturer does? No. No, we tend to be a little bit more muted in that regard. But it behaves the same way as your classic cyclical."

We're worried about what's happening in the next 8 hours, 2 weeks, 2 months. We're more worried about that than we are about strategically improving our business because we don't have that luxury. And we don't want to invite new risk, even have you move in. And so I think it would manifest itself in the fact that our pipeline that would expand, and you would see a resumption of the goals we talk -- the targets we talk about on Onsite signings and vending signings, et cetera. And again, those are markers to engagement with our customer. That's where you'd see it.
I think you'd see the underlying economy improve because people, let's face it, we all -- we're all really tired of this.

People might be concerned about our market share gains in safety and government if COVID normalized, but it didn't do as well on signings because of it. And so we might lose one, but we gain the other.
I think if you stand back from the specifics and look at the overall results for the year, it was -- actually, I think Dan and I both used in some writings, it was kind of a boring year or an unremarkable year if you step back and don't think about the specifics and just look at our results. And that combines remarkable performance in safety. Terrible performance goes to the market in nonsafety. And if COVID gets resolved, that flips. And that's the perspective I would offer."

Tomorrow is an important milestone for us. A year ago, on January 21, we did something we'd never done. After conversations with one of our trusted suppliers, a company upriver called 3M, we locked down in our network N95 mask respirators because of what we were learning from our team in China, from our supplier base, and we locked it down, and we'd never done that before.
And we did it with some really crude tools. We just basically shut off our request system for one part for several part numbers.

Time will tell. But if I go off on tangents, I apologize for that. 
I'd like to start with recapping our Board meeting, the last -- yesterday, our discussions with leadership earlier this morning as we were able to share our earnings and our progress a little bit more broadly within the organization and a bit of the video that we share with the 20,000-plus employees within Fastenal. And one is a more somber piece, and that is, as we've done in prior quarters, just want to share some COVID statistics with our shareholders because we can talk about a lot of things, but we have to start with the most important and that is we were not immune, if you will, to the effects of COVID on the health of the Fastenal Blue Team family.
Through September, and I've previously shared this information, we had 344 cases of COVID within the Fastenal organization. In the month of September, we were averaging about 17 new cases a week. In October, and as we progressed through the fourth quarter, we experienced what was experienced, generally speaking, throughout the markets when we operate. Our case count increased dramatically. In October, we had 27 cases per week, a 10 increase over the 17 in September. So 106 cases.
So through October, we had cumulatively 450 cases within the Fastenal family. That number essentially doubled in November. In November, we had 430 cases, 86 per week. And in December, we started to see that trend down, but still quite high at 60 per week. 238 cases. So cumulatively, through the end of the year, we had 1,118 cases within Fastenal. That's just over 5% of our population of employees. 
When you consider the fact that our business and the way we operate doesn't afford us the ability to remove ourselves from society. 93%, 94% of our employees are in roles that involve day-to-day interactions with other human beings, whether that's at our branch or on-site locations, working in a distribution center, working in manufacturing, driving a truck, so we didn't have that luxury. And the fact that our number -- I believe the U.S. population -- if what I read is accurate, where just over 7% of the U.S. population has had COVID, and we're about 5%. So I believe our team has done a really nice job of exercising common sense and trying to protect themselves and those around them every day and being mindful of the anxieties that exist in society.
When I think of 2020, I also think of things that we did from the perspective of things we did to improve our moat, to widen our moat, to improve our business as we move into 2021 and beyond. And I think one of the first things is we demonstrated to the market and we demonstrated to ourselves, perhaps, a bit of our problem-solving ability. Our growth drivers demonstrated their value. And value from the standpoint of -- it's a special way to engage with our customer. And because of the vending devices we have deployed, because of the Onsites we have deployed, because of the way we engage with our customer, when most people were turned away at a customer's door, our folks were allowed to enter.
And they were allowed to enter because we were stocking bins. We were filling vending machines. We were staffing the support infrastructure of their business from with -- inside their facility. And that was a special place to be and a special relationship. And because of that, we saw the success that we did in Qs 2, 3 and 4 on our ability to react and serve that marketplace in a unique way.
The other pieces we demonstrated to a whole new group of customers, maybe that's something that's special about Fastenal. The other thing that I reminded our teams and I reminded our Board is we're coming into a weird year. We're forced to pivot, and that's a great thing. We look forward to this pivot versus the last. But the optics of the year are abnormal. And I just sort of want to remind the analyst community of that is the, I don't recall in my 25 years with Fastenal, might have happened, maybe it happened back in the '90s or '80s or '70s. I don't recall a year where we entered, and we're going to be down 2 business days. And as all of you know, that's an important ingredient in our ability to grow and leverage the business.
So in Q1, we will lose 1 business day. Q2, we don't lose any business days or gain any business days, but we have some weird comps because of the extreme surge we saw in safety sales in Q2 last year. Q3 is a normal quarter, if you will in that it's a push on days. And in Q4, we lose a business day. So it's a 253 business day year versus 255. Just want to point that out. 
When I -- when you read the document and you hear our conversation, we'll touch on some things about the Apex transaction that we did back in March. And I'm really, really excited about what that means as far as our ability to broaden and illuminate how we serve our customer. And Apex is the technology that underpins our vending platform. And we have the largest industrial vending platform on the planet, and it's a great platform.
A lot of our other systems were disjointed from that because it was a captive platform. And so it allows us to broaden where we can bring supply chain knowledge and visibility to. And we're now referring to that as the FMI suite of things, Fastenal Managed Inventory. Within that are 3 distinct components, and Holden did a nice job illuminating it, I think, in the press release, and we'll talk about it today.
But in that is FAST Vend, which is our vending platform, as we've talked about for years. The second component is FAST Bin, that's B-I-N. And that's a suite of bin technology. It's not restricted access like you see in the vending machine, it's open access. But it's for a lot of things like fasteners or pipe fittings or things like that. But it's smart in the standpoint the system tells us when it's hungry and needs to be fed. And we don't need to have a person go check it or worse yet, our frequency of checking, it means we have a bin that runs out. And it allow us to lean down inventory and illuminate the supply chain for our customer over time so it's a better supply chain, but it's also more efficient from a labor productivity supply chain. 
The third component is what we call FAST Stock. And that is we deployed, as you all know, a tremendous amount of mobility technology. Now we've had a platform in the past, but that platform was very transactional based. This is more system based and allows us, again, to illuminate for the customer what they have in their facility, which is more efficient for the customer, more efficient for us. So we'll talk about that in combined, but take nothing away from the individual components of vending, which is a great element to enhance growth and engagement with our customer. We're just broadening it because the Apex transaction allows us to do that.
If I move into Holden's flipbook, you can see -- and I'm on Page 3, our daily sales grew 6.5% in the quarter. The team did a great job of managing our operating cost throughout 2020 and it was exemplified in the current quarter, and we produced operating earnings that were double digit, 10.6%.
Safety, as we've talked about on numerous prior calls and we'll, I suspect, continue to talk about in the calls as we enter 2021 because COVID is not behind us. But safety has been an outperformer for years largely because it's a product line that matches really well with our FAST Vend, our vending platform. So in the -- so despite safety being a little bit less than 20% of sales, it's produced, for the last several years, about 26% of our growth. But the contributions swelled to 156% in 2020. And as I touched on and when I was first talking, it highlighted our problem-solving culture in the marketplace and I believe this should open up new customer and end market opportunities to us in the future, and Holden will touch a little bit on that in his talk.
Customer engagement on growth drivers has improved. However, as you saw in 2020, it ravaged our ability to sign because in an environment where you're working really hard to protect your employees, maybe the last thing you want to do is, all of a sudden, ""Hey, come on, folks, it's Fastenal. We love what you do. Why don't you come in and move in with us?"" It introduces a variable that many folks in a year like 2020 don't want to introduce, and you saw that show up in our signing numbers, and I'll touch on that more in a few minutes.
The Apex purchase, I touched on already. Utilization of e-commerce took a big step-up in 2020. As I mentioned, commercialization of our FAST Bin and deployment of mobility, I believe, will really evolve our model and evolve our ability to be efficient. Because one thing that's really critical in this path, and we've talked about this for 4 or 5 years now, what's really critical is we're going much deeper into a -- what we call our key accounts growth, much deeper into a large customer. And the gross margin profile, because of customer mix and product mix, changes. And then it's incumbent upon us to allow the natural leverage to shine through. In other words, if you're doing more dollars, you have more places to spread your expense but also to become more efficient, and that's what all these things tie to.
The last piece is our branch model. We've evolved it -- and we'll touch on this in the months to come. But there's 2 distinct Fastenal branch models that have emerged in 2020. One is what we refer to as the CSB, the customer service branch. And that's the traditional branch that many of you are familiar with where there's a showroom in front. There's a walk-in element to our business. Still, most of it is going out the back door, but it's more traditional. It's about half of our branch network today.
During 2020 -- and actually, we've been testing this within a handful of regions for the last 2, 3 years. We have what's referred to as the CFC, the customer fulfillment center. Think of it as a branch where we close the front door and the marketplace almost like that better or we're able to operate more efficiently and maybe we should keep it closed or maybe it's closed to everything other than a will call or a pickup or maybe on a regular account base. And it allows everybody to go out the backdoor and most of our revenues go out the backdoor. And that is about half our branch network right now. And those are the things that are driving improvements to things like e-commerce that I'll touch on in a few minutes.
The last thing is, and I want to put a call out, I'm sitting here at a table with Holden Lewis and Sheryl Lisowski, our Chief Financial Officer and our Chief Accounting Officer. Different circumstances allow folks to shine in different ways, and our team was able to shine this year from the standpoint of solving problems in supply chain for customers. Holden and Sheryl and the entire team was able to shine in that we produced an amazingly strong cash flow in 2020. And it put us in a position late in the year, similar to what we have seen in prior occasions where we had some extra cash. We didn't see a need for that in our investments of the future, and we paid out a supplemental dividend late in the year. So my compliments to everybody on that as well. 
On Page 4, I started sharing this slide, I believe it was back in July. And this is looking at dispenses through vending. I think it's a way for us to illuminate for you, our shareholder, what we're seeing in underlying trends. So we index everything to 100, and these are weekly snapshots of dispenses going through those 95,000-plus vending devices in 25 countries.
History would say, if we're at 100, we should be at 103 by the early March. And the reason I call out that data point, that's right before the world shut down. This year, we were running 2 points ahead of that, we were at 105. And as the economy shut down, so did the dispensing activity at our vending devices and it dropped 29 from 105 to 76. By the end of June, history would say we should be at 109, 2020 wasn't historic in that regard, we were at 93. So we were down 16 still from that 29 drop-off in March and April.
By the end of September, history says, hey, you should be 112, we were 104. So that negative 16 is now a negative 8. And we always ignore the last couple of weeks of December because it's -- the world kind of shuts down because of the holidays. So if you look at the week just before that, history says, you should be about 121, we had about 115. We're still down. A piece of that is economic activity. A piece of that is we didn't sign as many vending devices because we weren't able to move in with as many people as we'd like to. And -- but -- and we're down 6. 
The next page said -- this is dispenses. The next page is unique users. So how many people are coming to work at these customers. If there's 100 employees coming in every week back in October of 2019, history would say, because we've signed some more machines, that should grow to 104. This year, we were at 107 in early March, well, when those businesses shut down and weren't using as much just because they didn't have as many employees, the number dropped 22 and it dropped from 107 to 85. The -- history says, by the end of June, we should be at 109, we are at 101. We're down 8. 
By the end of September, we should be at 115, we were at 109. We're down 6. By that week before Christmas, we should be at 123, we're down 119, negative 4. In the employment front, that negative 4 is probably more about we didn't sign as many devices. So people are coming back to work and you're seeing it in the underlying numbers. But there's still -- the activity is still subdued. And the one thing I did point out on Page 4, and I apologize for that, a few of the blips you see, in early July, that's obviously July 4th week. In late November, that's obviously Thanksgiving week. 
Going to Page 6. Onsites, we signed 36 in the quarter. Again, really, really choppy year. So we signed -- our goal coming in the quarter is 375 to 400 -- or coming into the year, excuse me, was 375 to 400. It slowed in March. So in first quarter, we signed about 85. Second quarter was 40. Came back a bit in Q3 at 62. In many ways, Q4 was a more chaotic environment than Q2 was in that you had case surge and I talked about our own surge internally. And we only signed 36, so 223 for the year. 
But Holden included in the flipbook and included in our write up, our mindset is the same. The market, we believe, will support us signing 375 to 400 a year. Conditions need to open up to allow us to do that. I don't want the investment community to read from what we sit here, ""Oh, things are back to normal. Everything is hunky-dory, and we're going to do 400 signings."" This is going to play out in Q1 and Q2. And as we bought into the year, the way the economy and the marketplace and the COVID environment will allow it to happen.
You saw how it played out in 2020. We don't have a crystal ball. We don't -- we're not the burning bush. We can't tell you what's going to happen. What you can tell is we believe the marketplace likes what this Onsite is about and is open to that Onsite. And it's really about engagement with the customer. The Onsite signings is just a marker in time of what that engagement has translated into. But we're very bullish on the fact that Onsite proved its value in 2020.
Vending, and I talked earlier about the whole FMI concept. That's meant to provide better information to the investment community, not to confuse the issue with vending and bins and all that kind of stuff. So read it as this is an outgrowth of the Apex transaction. 
E-commerce, 38% growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. In March, we broke 10% of our sales being e-commerce for the first time ever. And I'm pleased to say that despite the fact that the surge actually hurt it because most of those surge orders, actually, almost all of them, are outside of e-commerce. That's people in a chaotic fashion, order -- getting product from us, and a lot of that is over the phone. But despite all that, for the first time in our history, e-commerce is more than 10% of our revenue. 
And again, that's e-commerce measured the way this community measures it. I personally think that's an inaccurate way to measure it because I think 20% of our revenue being vending is e-commerce. I think 7% to 10% of our revenue being bins and FAST Stock is e-commerce because -- but it's better than e-commerce because the customer doesn't have to order it. That's the best digital flow there is. And then the final being this 10%, that truly is e-commerce. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Holden because I don't have my text from my wife telling me to shut up."

Fourth quarter of 2020 sales were up 6.4% annually, that's an acceleration from the third quarter. Holiday timing was favorable this year, but even so, the overall tenor of the marketplace continued to improve during the period. Sales of safety products were up 34.6%, driven by growth to state and local government and health care customers, which is at 98.3% in the period.
This continues to be some blend of COVID mitigation, PPE restocking and prestocking as well as share gains. The most encouraging data point is that 28% of the accounts that bought PPE from us for the first time in the second quarter of 2020 bought from us in the fourth quarter, and they tended to be the larger opportunities. So this continues to reinforce that we have gained share and increased our growth prospects with state and local government and health care customers that's going to carry into 2021.
Nonsafety products were up 0.3% annually, accelerating versus the third quarter of 2020. Janitorial products, driven by the same trends as safety, were up 30.3%. More cyclical verticals remained negative in the fourth quarter of 2020 but generally saw moderation in the rates of decline. In fact, fasteners and material handling edged into growth territory in December.
Improving macro data is producing better trends in core markets, particularly in manufacturing, which grew 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020. We don't have a lot of visibility, but our regional VPs remain optimistic that activity will continue to improve.
The exception to this normalization is our growth driver signings. COVID continues to negatively affect labor markets and supply chains, but our customers are operating around those conditions. We believe that absent COVID, the market will support 100 vending signings per day and 100 Onsite signings per quarter. However, lack of access to facilities and decision-makers in light of COVID protocols is delaying new commitments, the challenge that is carrying into the first quarter of 2021 and makes it difficult to determine when signings activity will return to potential.
Now to Slide 8. Gross margin was 45.6% in the fourth quarter of 2020, down 130 basis points due to product and channel mix, relative growth of lower-margin COVID products and organizational factors such as further clearance, lower vendor rebates and overhead deleveraging. Gross margin was up 30 basis points sequentially in a quarter that more commonly sees a decline.
Relative to the third quarter of 2020, we saw the revenue share of lower-margin COVID-related products decline by 200 basis points even as the margin on those products improved by 200 basis points on selective pricing actions taken in the quarter. We also experienced more favorable shipping and fleet costs in the period, largely from having rationalized our weekly routes earlier in the year.
Strong growth and continued tight control of costs generated 210 basis points of SG&A leverage to produce an operating margin of 19.5%, up 80 basis points year-to-year. Nearly half this leverage came over labor costs as our record fourth quarter sales were achieved with headcount that was down mid-single digits versus last year.
Labor productivity improved meaningfully in the fourth quarter and full year of 2020 and we will look to sustain this in 2021. We also leveraged occupancy on lower branch count and vending costs as well as other expenses on tight control of travel, lower freight costs as we rationalized our branch pickup fleet and lower insurance costs. Our incremental margin was 31%. If you put it all together, we reported a fourth quarter 2020 earnings per share of $0.34, up 9.6% from $0.31 in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Turning to Slide 9. We produced $321 million of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2020, representing 164% of net income. For the full year, we produced $1.1 billion of operating cash flow or 128% of net income. Weak demand freed up cash and working capital, and we did benefit from $30 million in CARES Act-related deferred payroll taxes and about $20 million in payables that moved from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021. However, we also believe we are taking steps to be more productive with working capital.
Accounts receivable were up 3.7% with growth related to higher sales mitigated by improved collections, with past dues down 23% year-over-year. Inventories were down 2.1%. We have taken steps to make it easier to move inventory internally to get it where it can best be used, which has been particularly useful as we have closed branches and migrated other branches to a leaner inventory model. We put energy into clearing older stock from our branches and hubs. As a result, branch inventory was down nearly 8% at year-end, while Onsite and hub inventory was up just low single digits.
Net capital spending was $158 million in 2020, the lower end of our $155 million to $180 million range. In 2021, we expect net capital spending to be $170 million to $200 million with the increase over the prior year being a combination of catch-up maintenance spending following tight spending controls in 2020 as well as higher spending for a non-hub facility project in Winona to support our growth.
Record net income and operating cash flow in 2020 allowed us to acquire the assets of Apex, deploy significant resources to secure critical products and carry working capital for customers and return $855 million to investors in the form of dividends, including a special dividend in December and share repurchase. At the same time, net debt is just 5.1% of total capital and substantially all of our revolver is available for use. 
Now before turning it over to Q&A, there's one change to reporting I wanted to discuss, and Dan alluded to this. The bin stocks have long been used in distribution to hold product in customer facilities. Over the last few years, we have taken these bins, and we've equipped them with scales or sensors that turn them into digital tools that provide product visibility, continuously monitor those products and generate fulfillment efficiencies.
These FAST Bins complement Vending to expand the products that can be digitally managed and round out our Fastenal Managed Inventory or FMI offering. And we anticipate commercializing them more aggressively in 2021. As a result, in 2021, we will replace reporting on vending signings with weighted FMI signings. This is going to convert each vending device and FAST Bin device into a standard unit based on the target output of our FAST 5000 vending machine, which is 2,000 a month, and combine that into a single data point. In 2020, our weighted FMI signings were 15,724. In 2021, we are targeting 23,000 to 25,000 weighted FMI signings.
With that, operator, we'll take questions."

I guess I could probably interpret about 20 questions in that one. So I'll try to keep it short. If I think about, starting at gross margin, if I think about 2021, this might be one of those years where given the easy comps that we have, I would expect our gross margin to be up year-over-year.
Now I've had some conversations with folks that are getting really, really high numbers and that sort of thing, so I don't think that the concept surprises anybody. But order of magnitude, I think we need to think about -- in 2019, our gross margin was 47.2%. If nothing else had changed, let's assume that mix would have pulled that down 60 basis points a year in 2020 and 2021, which puts it at about 46%, just naturally on mix, if nothing else had changed.
The -- but if I think about -- so if I think about that as kind of a baseline, it's true that I don't expect the inefficiencies, particularly in the second quarter, to repeat. But I do expect that we're going to have higher COVID mix in 2020, just those types of projects in 2021 than we did in 2019. And I think that's going to work against that 2019 baseline a little bit.
If I think about -- we're still going to be selling through mask inventory through the first 2 or 3 quarters of the year, and that's going to pull margin down a little bit. I will tell you, I think the shipping costs are showing every indication of probably moving up as we get towards the end of first quarter into second quarter, and so I think there's some pressure there.
And so like I said, I do believe that our gross margin will be up a bit in 2021 over 2020. But as I said, I think we need to be somewhat tempered in our expectations of the order of magnitude. And I say that only because I've had some conversations where I think people are being a bit overaggressive with that. So hopefully, that gives you, Adam, a little bit of a framework to think about gross margin.
As it relates to operating margin, I would expect that labor would get better or that we would add labor. I do consider that getting better because it means we're adding selling energy. But whatever our growth winds up being at the top line, I would expect that our increase in FTEs would be no more than 50% of that growth and perhaps somewhat less than that. And I think that's kind of the objective of the organization. And so I think that we will leverage labor when we grow this year.
And so when you tie it all together, I'm still thinking in terms of the framework of 20% to 25% incremental margins based on whatever level of growth that we can achieve this year. And those are, I think, the pieces that I would think about."

And close to 50% of the revenue going through vending is a safety product. So as we were evolving through that, go back to the earlier part of the last decade, we were having those discussions about what that meant from a mix standpoint. 
If I think of the FMI Bin, and then I think of the FMI -- excuse me, FAST Bin and FAST Stock, FAST Bin, especially the RFID component of that, is, in a lot of cases, it might be in a production environment, where it's a Kanban system and when that bin is empty, you throw it in a tub up above your shelf and it tells us you have an empty bin. So it's pretty basic technology, if you think about it that way, resilient technology. That's probably more production environment, so that probably has a gross margin profile that's more akin to the vending. 
If I think of it from the standpoint of FMI, the third piece, FAST Stock, that's a lot of MRO and -- or a nice mix of MRO. And so that's probably -- and it's very fastener centered, and so that has a margin that's more like the fastener piece. Does that help, Dave?"

I get asked a lot, what is the gross margin of a vending machine? And my answer is often, a vending machine doesn't have a gross margin, it really depends on the product that's vended and what margin comes with that product.
And I would think about the FAST Bin the same way. I don't think the bin has an inherent margin, it depends on what is being stored in that bin. And so when we think about the bins, we've always had FAST Stock, which has been heavily oriented towards fasteners. And so you would argue that, that bin has a fastener type of margin.
What we believe will happen, in addition to the efficiencies that Dan talked about in terms of the fulfillment process, we think that these FAST Bins will actually lend themselves to our being able to be more involved with other lines outside of fasteners. Power transmission and fluid power come to mind, for instance.
And so the -- we've always done fasteners in these bins. We'll continue to do fasteners in these bins. We’ll get the benefits and efficiencies for fulfillment. We'll certainly try to leverage that into even more market share in fasteners. We've always done that. 
But to the extent that we can use FAST Bin to get into some of our other 9 product verticals a little bit more deeply, those verticals will typically have a lower gross margin than fasteners. And they'll probably be more consistent with our non-fastener business, which is in that sort of low to mid-40s type of range."

I probably don't want to get ahead of ourselves on what that means for 2021 because it's still going to be -- it's still something new.

I probably don't want to get ahead of ourselves on what that means for 2021 because it's still going to be -- it's still something new. And to be honest with you, the only reason -- when we started vending years ago, we didn't start talking about it until we were about 3 years into it. And here, we're actually talking about it when we're about a year into it. And the only reason being is because in some cases, where we would have put a vending machine in the past, I think we'll put some bins in now because we now have a better suite of products because we own the underlying technology, and it improves our ability to bring the most efficient tool to bear.
The -- we've talked in previous calls about what we call our LIFT concept, Local Inventory Fulfillment Terminal. And really, what that's about is perhaps, sometimes the best place to stock product and to pick product is in the local branch or onsite. Sometimes where to do put that product is in the regional distribution center.
And really, what we're doing with LIFT is something we talked about years ago is supporting vending with maybe a third type of distribution, and that's the fulfillment terminal. We're just -- what's going in that vending machine is what's in that little LIFT facility. And we're managing it there, and we're able to strip -- these are high-frequency turnover products. We're able to strip some of that out of our branch and rake it into the LIFT facility, which is, from a labor standpoint, more efficient. But from a working capital standpoint, incredibly attractive over time.
We had -- we have 9 LIFT facilities that are operating at the end of the year. We're still just touching a really, really small percentage of our vending devices. I think we're touching about 2,500 right now. And our goal is to double that LIFT from 9 operating at the end of this year to 18 at the end of next year.
We'll still be, even with our optimistic projections, still touching a relatively small number of vending devices at the end of the year, but it's ever growing, and that will work some working capital out. But it's still on a relatively small base. That logic equally applies to FAST Bin and FAST Stock."

Now those 80 widgets will still probably include some safety stock from our perspective because we want to make sure that we don't shut the customer down, and we need to make sure that we go and we check those bins and check those machines, et cetera. And so those 80 widgets are an improvement. But when you think about what FAST Bin can do in terms of informing us in real time about need, it's possible that those 80 widgets can be 75 because we're much more aware of what the quantities on hand are.
I agree with Dan. I think 2021 is far too early to talk about what the impact of this is on working capital.

It's the way we spoke at our virtual leadership meeting back in December. And it's centered on our government business, which was a huge recipient of a lot of these COVID-type surge sales.Our government business historic",395,"Well, I'll answer that this way. It's the way we spoke at our virtual leadership meeting back in December. And it's centered on our government business, which was a huge recipient of a lot of these COVID-type surge sales.
Our government business historically is a relatively small part of our business. It's about 4%. In the second quarter, it surged over 10% of our business. And I don't know what the final number was for the year, but it was -- through most of the year, on a year-to-date basis, it was up over 100% year-over-year.
And so when we come into a year like 2021, the way we talk about it internally is, ""Okay, normally, that business, which is still a young business, we would expect it to grow, say, 20% a year."" So when we're looking at second quarter of 2021 for our government business, we're saying to our teams, ignore your year-over-year numbers because all that matters right now is where are we in January and where are we building to in September and October and then what does that mean for 2022.
But in the case of the second quarter, as an example, take your 2019 Q2 numbers, if you are in the government -- if you're leading our government team. Add to it the 20% we would have expected in Q2 2020, ignoring the COVID thing, and then add another 20% to it for 2021. So 2019 plus 2020, 20% plus 20%, 20% twice over. And that's where your head should be on where you're growing to -- going to be in the second quarter. And that's going to be a negative number for government in the second quarter, unless there's a different way to do math.
And then the challenge to them is because of the broader exposure we received in the marketplace and the fact that more government customers know about us -- and the only area where our Onsite signings accelerated in 2020 over 2019 was with government customers. In the rest of the world, you saw our overall numbers.
And does that 20% plus 20% contemplate the fact that more people want to buy from us or more people are aware of us, and maybe that second 20% can become a 25% or a 30%, I don't know. But that's the way we're thinking about it."

That would be my expectation. But yes, at least at this point, it's still fairly soft. So we'll see. Obviously, comps play a role in that.

And we have seen an uptick in steel. I think many of you have talked about that very same dynamic. And if that continues or persists, then I would anticipate that we would have to take some action to mitigate that.
So right now, we're not taking broad pricing actions. We're certainly doing things from a tactical standpoint as we did to some degree with some of the safety products. But if the trends continue on steel, the way that they've begun or ended, I guess, ended 2021 -- sorry, ended 2020, then I would anticipate that we'd have to take some actions as you roll into the end of Q1 and into Q2 to mitigate that effect."

The only difference, I would say, is that the structure that we've put in place internally to analyze and act on the -- where cost increases are happening, I think we're in a far better place today than we were pre tariffs. I think the tariffs really prompted us to shore up the technologies that we use, the analytics that we use and the internal structure and personnel that we rely on to make us more effective with that.
So I haven't seen any changes to the market dynamics. I think that our internal dynamics are in a better position today than even was the case 2 years ago pre tariffs."

Our captive fleet is part of that. But frankly, so is manufacturing, so is our purchasing, our Asian purchasing, et cetera, right?
So when demand is weak, that -- you tend to deleverage. Now this is an odd year because you look at our revenue, say, well, demand was weak. But a lot of our demand didn't necessarily run through a lot of our physical structure. There's a lot more direct shift type of business in 2020 than is typical.
The sort of off the side of that is if demand begins to go up, begins to improve, and that improvement is impacting the core of our business, which is our field sales and our branches and taking advantage of the business that we've built over 50-plus years, then we're going to leverage those assets.
And so part of the -- I think part of the answer to your question is, what do you expect next year in terms of industrial production growth and market growth? If you believe that we're going to be growing next year, then I would expect that 2021, we would be leveraging. And we would be getting some benefit from that as in contrast to what we saw in 2020.

We took out a truck -- a data service earlier in the year. When that truck is filled again or is overfilled and we need to add another day of distribution, another truck service to that branch, that's something we've been doing for years. And so that grows with it. 
The challenge for us is we did a really nice job in 2020. When we pulled that truck service out, we didn't see our third-party spend go up because we needed some service that wasn't there, and our team did a great job with that. We need to keep that reined in as well as we go into 2021. And I feel we're better poised to do that than we have historically because we have better tracking information. 
We've deployed a lot of new technology over the last few years and are continuing to deploy it. And one of those is better illuminating what's where in our system. Just like when you ship a small parcel, being able to know exactly where it is at any given point in time, we're getting better at that ourselves. 
The only other nuance I'd probably introduce is I mean, yes, we are a cyclical -- we're viewed within investing circles as a cyclical type company. Remember that we don't have anywhere near the amount of fixed cost in our gross profit or I guess, in our cost of goods as, say, an average manufacturer does, right?
So does our leverage and deleverage work the same way? Yes, it does. Does it have the same order of magnitude on the upside or the downside as an average manufacturer does? No. No, we tend to be a little bit more muted in that regard. But it behaves the same way as your classic cyclical."

We're worried about what's happening in the next 8 hours, 2 weeks, 2 months. We're more worried about that than we are about strategically improving our business because we don't have that luxury. And we don't want to invite new risk, even have you move in. And so I think it would manifest itself in the fact that our pipeline that would expand, and you would see a resumption of the goals we talk -- the targets we talk about on Onsite signings and vending signings, et cetera.

People might be concerned about our market share gains in safety and government if COVID normalized, but it didn't do as well on signings because of it. And so we might lose one, but we gain the other.
I think if you stand back from the specifics and look at the overall results for the year, it was -- actually, I think Dan and I both used in some writings, it was kind of a boring year or an unremarkable year if you step back and don't think about the specifics and just look at our results.

Through September, and I've previously shared this information, we had 344 cases of COVID within the Fastenal organization. In the month of September, we were averaging about 17 new cases a week. In October, and as we progressed through the fourth quarter, we experienced what was experienced, generally speaking, throughout the markets when we operate. Our case count increased dramatically. In October, we had 27 cases per week, a 10 increase over the 17 in September. So 106 cases.
So through October, we had cumulatively 450 cases within the Fastenal family. That number essentially doubled in November. In November, we had 430 cases, 86 per week. And in December, we started to see that trend down, but still quite high at 60 per week. 238 cases. So cumulatively, through the end of the year, we had 1,118 cases within Fastenal. That's just over 5% of our population of employees. 
When you consider the fact that our business and the way we operate doesn't afford us the ability to remove ourselves from society. 93%, 94% of our employees are in roles that involve day-to-day interactions with other human beings, whether that's at our branch or on-site locations, working in a distribution center, working in manufacturing, driving a truck, so we didn't have that luxury. And the fact that our number -- I believe the U.S. population -- if what I read is accurate, where just over 7% of the U.S. population has had COVID, and we're about 5%. So I believe our team has done a really nice job of exercising common sense and trying to protect themselves and those around them every day and being mindful of the anxieties that exist in society.
When I think of 2020, I also think of things that we did from the perspective of things we did to improve our moat, to widen our moat, to improve our business as we move into 2021 and beyond. And I think one of the first things is we demonstrated to the market and we demonstrated to ourselves, perhaps, a bit of our problem-solving ability. Our growth drivers demonstrated their value. And value from the standpoint of -- it's a special way to engage with our customer. And because of the vending devices we have deployed, because of the Onsites we have deployed, because of the way we engage with our customer, when most people were turned away at a customer's door, our folks were allowed to enter.
And they were allowed to enter because we were stocking bins. We were filling vending machines. We were staffing the support infrastructure of their business from with -- inside their facility. And that was a special place to be and a special relationship. And because of that, we saw the success that we did in Qs 2, 3 and 4 on our ability to react and serve that marketplace in a unique way.
The other pieces we demonstrated to a whole new group of customers, maybe that's something that's special about Fastenal. The other thing that I reminded our teams and I reminded our Board is we're coming into a weird year. We're forced to pivot, and that's a great thing. We look forward to this pivot versus the last. But the optics of the year are abnormal. And I just sort of want to remind the analyst community of that is the, I don't recall in my 25 years with Fastenal, might have happened, maybe it happened back in the '90s or '80s or '70s. I don't recall a year where we entered, and we're going to be down 2 business days. And as all of you know, that's an important ingredient in our ability to grow and leverage the business.
So in Q1, we will lose 1 business day. Q2, we don't lose any business days or gain any business days, but we have some weird comps because of the extreme surge we saw in safety sales in Q2 last year. Q3 is a normal quarter, if you will in that it's a push on days. And in Q4, we lose a business day. So it's a 253 business day year versus 255. Just want to point that out. 
When I -- when you read the document and you hear our conversation, we'll touch on some things about the Apex transaction that we did back in March. And I'm really, really excited about what that means as far as our ability to broaden and illuminate how we serve our customer. And Apex is the technology that underpins our vending platform. And we have the largest industrial vending platform on the planet, and it's a great platform.
A lot of our other systems were disjointed from that because it was a captive platform. And so it allows us to broaden where we can bring supply chain knowledge and visibility to. And we're now referring to that as the FMI suite of things, Fastenal Managed Inventory. Within that are 3 distinct components, and Holden did a nice job illuminating it, I think, in the press release, and we'll talk about it today.
But in that is FAST Vend, which is our vending platform, as we've talked about for years. The second component is FAST Bin, that's B-I-N. And that's a suite of bin technology. It's not restricted access like you see in the vending machine, it's open access. But it's for a lot of things like fasteners or pipe fittings or things like that. But it's smart in the standpoint the system tells us when it's hungry and needs to be fed. And we don't need to have a person go check it or worse yet, our frequency of checking, it means we have a bin that runs out. And it allow us to lean down inventory and illuminate the supply chain for our customer over time so it's a better supply chain, but it's also more efficient from a labor productivity supply chain. 
The third component is what we call FAST Stock. And that is we deployed, as you all know, a tremendous amount of mobility technology. Now we've had a platform in the past, but that platform was very transactional based. This is more system based and allows us, again, to illuminate for the customer what they have in their facility, which is more efficient for the customer, more efficient for us. So we'll talk about that in combined, but take nothing away from the individual components of vending, which is a great element to enhance growth and engagement with our customer. We're just broadening it because the Apex transaction allows us to do that.
If I move into Holden's flipbook, you can see -- and I'm on Page 3, our daily sales grew 6.5% in the quarter. The team did a great job of managing our operating cost throughout 2020 and it was exemplified in the current quarter, and we produced operating earnings that were double digit, 10.6%.
Safety, as we've talked about on numerous prior calls and we'll, I suspect, continue to talk about in the calls as we enter 2021 because COVID is not behind us. But safety has been an outperformer for years largely because it's a product line that matches really well with our FAST Vend, our vending platform. So in the -- so despite safety being a little bit less than 20% of sales, it's produced, for the last several years, about 26% of our growth. But the contributions swelled to 156% in 2020. And as I touched on and when I was first talking, it highlighted our problem-solving culture in the marketplace and I believe this should open up new customer and end market opportunities to us in the future, and Holden will touch a little bit on that in his talk.
Customer engagement on growth drivers has improved. However, as you saw in 2020, it ravaged our ability to sign because in an environment where you're working really hard to protect your employees, maybe the last thing you want to do is, all of a sudden, ""Hey, come on, folks, it's Fastenal. We love what you do. Why don't you come in and move in with us?"" It introduces a variable that many folks in a year like 2020 don't want to introduce, and you saw that show up in our signing numbers, and I'll touch on that more in a few minutes.
The Apex purchase, I touched on already. Utilization of e-commerce took a big step-up in 2020. As I mentioned, commercialization of our FAST Bin and deployment of mobility, I believe, will really evolve our model and evolve our ability to be efficient. Because one thing that's really critical in this path, and we've talked about this for 4 or 5 years now, what's really critical is we're going much deeper into a -- what we call our key accounts growth, much deeper into a large customer. And the gross margin profile, because of customer mix and product mix, changes. And then it's incumbent upon us to allow the natural leverage to shine through. In other words, if you're doing more dollars, you have more places to spread your expense but also to become more efficient, and that's what all these things tie to.
The last piece is our branch model. We've evolved it -- and we'll touch on this in the months to come. But there's 2 distinct Fastenal branch models that have emerged in 2020. One is what we refer to as the CSB, the customer service branch. And that's the traditional branch that many of you are familiar with where there's a showroom in front. There's a walk-in element to our business. Still, most of it is going out the back door, but it's more traditional. It's about half of our branch network today.
During 2020 -- and actually, we've been testing this within a handful of regions for the last 2, 3 years. We have what's referred to as the CFC, the customer fulfillment center. Think of it as a branch where we close the front door and the marketplace almost like that better or we're able to operate more efficiently and maybe we should keep it closed or maybe it's closed to everything other than a will call or a pickup or maybe on a regular account base. And it allows everybody to go out the backdoor and most of our revenues go out the backdoor. And that is about half our branch network right now. And those are the things that are driving improvements to things like e-commerce that I'll touch on in a few minutes.
The last thing is, and I want to put a call out, I'm sitting here at a table with Holden Lewis and Sheryl Lisowski, our Chief Financial Officer and our Chief Accounting Officer. Different circumstances allow folks to shine in different ways, and our team was able to shine this year from the standpoint of solving problems in supply chain for customers. Holden and Sheryl and the entire team was able to shine in that we produced an amazingly strong cash flow in 2020. And it put us in a position late in the year, similar to what we have seen in prior occasions where we had some extra cash. We didn't see a need for that in our investments of the future, and we paid out a supplemental dividend late in the year. So my compliments to everybody on that as well. 
On Page 4, I started sharing this slide, I believe it was back in July. And this is looking at dispenses through vending. I think it's a way for us to illuminate for you, our shareholder, what we're seeing in underlying trends. So we index everything to 100, and these are weekly snapshots of dispenses going through those 95,000-plus vending devices in 25 countries.
History would say, if we're at 100, we should be at 103 by the early March. And the reason I call out that data point, that's right before the world shut down. This year, we were running 2 points ahead of that, we were at 105. And as the economy shut down, so did the dispensing activity at our vending devices and it dropped 29 from 105 to 76. By the end of June, history would say we should be at 109, 2020 wasn't historic in that regard, we were at 93. So we were down 16 still from that 29 drop-off in March and April.
By the end of September, history says, hey, you should be 112, we were 104. So that negative 16 is now a negative 8. And we always ignore the last couple of weeks of December because it's -- the world kind of shuts down because of the holidays. So if you look at the week just before that, history says, you should be about 121, we had about 115. We're still down. A piece of that is economic activity. A piece of that is we didn't sign as many vending devices because we weren't able to move in with as many people as we'd like to. And -- but -- and we're down 6. 
The next page said -- this is dispenses. The next page is unique users. So how many people are coming to work at these customers. If there's 100 employees coming in every week back in October of 2019, history would say, because we've signed some more machines, that should grow to 104. This year, we were at 107 in early March, well, when those businesses shut down and weren't using as much just because they didn't have as many employees, the number dropped 22 and it dropped from 107 to 85. The -- history says, by the end of June, we should be at 109, we are at 101. We're down 8. 
By the end of September, we should be at 115, we were at 109. We're down 6. By that week before Christmas, we should be at 123, we're down 119, negative 4. In the employment front, that negative 4 is probably more about we didn't sign as many devices. So people are coming back to work and you're seeing it in the underlying numbers. But there's still -- the activity is still subdued. And the one thing I did point out on Page 4, and I apologize for that, a few of the blips you see, in early July, that's obviously July 4th week. In late November, that's obviously Thanksgiving week. 
Going to Page 6. Onsites, we signed 36 in the quarter. Again, really, really choppy year. So we signed -- our goal coming in the quarter is 375 to 400 -- or coming into the year, excuse me, was 375 to 400. It slowed in March. So in first quarter, we signed about 85. Second quarter was 40. Came back a bit in Q3 at 62. In many ways, Q4 was a more chaotic environment than Q2 was in that you had case surge and I talked about our own surge internally. And we only signed 36, so 223 for the year. 
But Holden included in the flipbook and included in our write up, our mindset is the same. The market, we believe, will support us signing 375 to 400 a year. Conditions need to open up to allow us to do that. I don't want the investment community to read from what we sit here, ""Oh, things are back to normal. Everything is hunky-dory, and we're going to do 400 signings."" This is going to play out in Q1 and Q2. And as we bought into the year, the way the economy and the marketplace and the COVID environment will allow it to happen.
You saw how it played out in 2020. We don't have a crystal ball. We don't -- we're not the burning bush. We can't tell you what's going to happen. What you can tell is we believe the marketplace likes what this Onsite is about and is open to that Onsite. And it's really about engagement with the customer. The Onsite signings is just a marker in time of what that engagement has translated into. But we're very bullish on the fact that Onsite proved its value in 2020.
Vending, and I talked earlier about the whole FMI concept. That's meant to provide better information to the investment community, not to confuse the issue with vending and bins and all that kind of stuff. So read it as this is an outgrowth of the Apex transaction. 
E-commerce, 38% growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. In March, we broke 10% of our sales being e-commerce for the first time ever. And I'm pleased to say that despite the fact that the surge actually hurt it because most of those surge orders, actually, almost all of them, are outside of e-commerce. That's people in a chaotic fashion, order -- getting product from us, and a lot of that is over the phone. But despite all that, for the first time in our history, e-commerce is more than 10% of our revenue. 
And again, that's e-commerce measured the way this community measures it. I personally think that's an inaccurate way to measure it because I think 20% of our revenue being vending is e-commerce. I think 7% to 10% of our revenue being bins and FAST Stock is e-commerce because -- but it's better than e-commerce because the customer doesn't have to order it. That's the best digital flow there is. And then the final being this 10%, that truly is e-commerce. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Holden because I don't have my text from my wife telling me to shut up."

Fourth quarter of 2020 sales were up 6.4% annually, that's an acceleration from the third quarter. Holiday timing was favorable this year, but even so, the overall tenor of the marketplace continued to improve during the period. Sales of safety products were up 34.6%, driven by growth to state and local government and health care customers, which is at 98.3% in the period.
This continues to be some blend of COVID mitigation, PPE restocking and prestocking as well as share gains. The most encouraging data point is that 28% of the accounts that bought PPE from us for the first time in the second quarter of 2020 bought from us in the fourth quarter, and they tended to be the larger opportunities. So this continues to reinforce that we have gained share and increased our growth prospects with state and local government and health care customers that's going to carry into 2021.
Nonsafety products were up 0.3% annually, accelerating versus the third quarter of 2020. Janitorial products, driven by the same trends as safety, were up 30.3%. More cyclical verticals remained negative in the fourth quarter of 2020 but generally saw moderation in the rates of decline. In fact, fasteners and material handling edged into growth territory in December.
Improving macro data is producing better trends in core markets, particularly in manufacturing, which grew 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020. We don't have a lot of visibility, but our regional VPs remain optimistic that activity will continue to improve.
The exception to this normalization is our growth driver signings. COVID continues to negatively affect labor markets and supply chains, but our customers are operating around those conditions. We believe that absent COVID, the market will support 100 vending signings per day and 100 Onsite signings per quarter. However, lack of access to facilities and decision-makers in light of COVID protocols is delaying new commitments, the challenge that is carrying into the first quarter of 2021 and makes it difficult to determine when signings activity will return to potential.
Now to Slide 8. Gross margin was 45.6% in the fourth quarter of 2020, down 130 basis points due to product and channel mix, relative growth of lower-margin COVID products and organizational factors such as further clearance, lower vendor rebates and overhead deleveraging. Gross margin was up 30 basis points sequentially in a quarter that more commonly sees a decline.
Relative to the third quarter of 2020, we saw the revenue share of lower-margin COVID-related products decline by 200 basis points even as the margin on those products improved by 200 basis points on selective pricing actions taken in the quarter. We also experienced more favorable shipping and fleet costs in the period, largely from having rationalized our weekly routes earlier in the year.
Strong growth and continued tight control of costs generated 210 basis points of SG&A leverage to produce an operating margin of 19.5%, up 80 basis points year-to-year. Nearly half this leverage came over labor costs as our record fourth quarter sales were achieved with headcount that was down mid-single digits versus last year.
Labor productivity improved meaningfully in the fourth quarter and full year of 2020 and we will look to sustain this in 2021. We also leveraged occupancy on lower branch count and vending costs as well as other expenses on tight control of travel, lower freight costs as we rationalized our branch pickup fleet and lower insurance costs. Our incremental margin was 31%. If you put it all together, we reported a fourth quarter 2020 earnings per share of $0.34, up 9.6% from $0.31 in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Turning to Slide 9. We produced $321 million of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2020, representing 164% of net income. For the full year, we produced $1.1 billion of operating cash flow or 128% of net income. Weak demand freed up cash and working capital, and we did benefit from $30 million in CARES Act-related deferred payroll taxes and about $20 million in payables that moved from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021. However, we also believe we are taking steps to be more productive with working capital.
Accounts receivable were up 3.7% with growth related to higher sales mitigated by improved collections, with past dues down 23% year-over-year. Inventories were down 2.1%. We have taken steps to make it easier to move inventory internally to get it where it can best be used, which has been particularly useful as we have closed branches and migrated other branches to a leaner inventory model. We put energy into clearing older stock from our branches and hubs. As a result, branch inventory was down nearly 8% at year-end, while Onsite and hub inventory was up just low single digits.
Net capital spending was $158 million in 2020, the lower end of our $155 million to $180 million range. In 2021, we expect net capital spending to be $170 million to $200 million with the increase over the prior year being a combination of catch-up maintenance spending following tight spending controls in 2020 as well as higher spending for a non-hub facility project in Winona to support our growth.
Record net income and operating cash flow in 2020 allowed us to acquire the assets of Apex, deploy significant resources to secure critical products and carry working capital for customers and return $855 million to investors in the form of dividends, including a special dividend in December and share repurchase. At the same time, net debt is just 5.1% of total capital and substantially all of our revolver is available for use. 
Now before turning it over to Q&A, there's one change to reporting I wanted to discuss, and Dan alluded to this. The bin stocks have long been used in distribution to hold product in customer facilities. Over the last few years, we have taken these bins, and we've equipped them with scales or sensors that turn them into digital tools that provide product visibility, continuously monitor those products and generate fulfillment efficiencies.
These FAST Bins complement Vending to expand the products that can be digitally managed and round out our Fastenal Managed Inventory or FMI offering. And we anticipate commercializing them more aggressively in 2021. As a result, in 2021, we will replace reporting on vending signings with weighted FMI signings. This is going to convert each vending device and FAST Bin device into a standard unit based on the target output of our FAST 5000 vending machine, which is 2,000 a month, and combine that into a single data point. In 2020, our weighted FMI signings were 15,724. In 2021, we are targeting 23,000 to 25,000 weighted FMI signings.
With that, operator, we'll take questions."

I guess I could probably interpret about 20 questions in that one. So I'll try to keep it short. If I think about, starting at gross margin, if I think about 2021, this might be one of those years where given the easy comps that we have, I would expect our gross margin to be up year-over-year.
Now I've had some conversations with folks that are getting really, really high numbers and that sort of thing, so I don't think that the concept surprises anybody. But order of magnitude, I think we need to think about -- in 2019, our gross margin was 47.2%. If nothing else had changed, let's assume that mix would have pulled that down 60 basis points a year in 2020 and 2021, which puts it at about 46%, just naturally on mix, if nothing else had changed.
The -- but if I think about -- so if I think about that as kind of a baseline, it's true that I don't expect the inefficiencies, particularly in the second quarter, to repeat. But I do expect that we're going to have higher COVID mix in 2020, just those types of projects in 2021 than we did in 2019. And I think that's going to work against that 2019 baseline a little bit.
If I think about -- we're still going to be selling through mask inventory through the first 2 or 3 quarters of the year, and that's going to pull margin down a little bit. I will tell you, I think the shipping costs are showing every indication of probably moving up as we get towards the end of first quarter into second quarter, and so I think there's some pressure there.
And so like I said, I do believe that our gross margin will be up a bit in 2021 over 2020. But as I said, I think we need to be somewhat tempered in our expectations of the order of magnitude. And I say that only because I've had some conversations where I think people are being a bit overaggressive with that. So hopefully, that gives you, Adam, a little bit of a framework to think about gross margin.
As it relates to operating margin, I would expect that labor would get better or that we would add labor. I do consider that getting better because it means we're adding selling energy. But whatever our growth winds up being at the top line, I would expect that our increase in FTEs would be no more than 50% of that growth and perhaps somewhat less than that. And I think that's kind of the objective of the organization. And so I think that we will leverage labor when we grow this year.
And so when you tie it all together, I'm still thinking in terms of the framework of 20% to 25% incremental margins based on whatever level of growth that we can achieve this year. And those are, I think, the pieces that I would think about."

If I think of the FMI Bin, and then I think of the FMI -- excuse me, FAST Bin and FAST Stock, FAST Bin, especially the RFID component of that, is, in a lot of cases, it might be in a production environment, where it's a Kanban system and when that bin is empty, you throw it in a tub up above your shelf and it tells us you have an empty bin. So it's pretty basic technology, if you think about it that way, resilient technology. That's probably more production environment, so that probably has a gross margin profile that's more akin to the vending. 
If I think of it from the standpoint of FMI, the third piece, FAST Stock, that's a lot of MRO and -- or a nice mix of MRO. And so that's probably -- and it's very fastener centered, and so that has a margin that's more like the fastener piece. Does that help, Dave?"

I get asked a lot, what is the gross margin of a vending machine? And my answer is often, a vending machine doesn't have a gross margin, it really depends on the product that's vended and what margin comes with that product.
And I would think about the FAST Bin the same way. I don't think the bin has an inherent margin, it depends on what is being stored in that bin. And so when we think about the bins, we've always had FAST Stock, which has been heavily oriented towards fasteners. And so you would argue that, that bin has a fastener type of margin.
What we believe will happen, in addition to the efficiencies that Dan talked about in terms of the fulfillment process, we think that these FAST Bins will actually lend themselves to our being able to be more involved with other lines outside of fasteners. Power transmission and fluid power come to mind, for instance.
And so the -- we've always done fasteners in these bins. We'll continue to do fasteners in these bins. We’ll get the benefits and efficiencies for fulfillment. We'll certainly try to leverage that into even more market share in fasteners. We've always done that. 
But to the extent that we can use FAST Bin to get into some of our other 9 product verticals a little bit more deeply, those verticals will typically have a lower gross margin than fasteners. And they'll probably be more consistent with our non-fastener business, which is in that sort of low to mid-40s type of range."

I probably don't want to get ahead of ourselves on what that means for 2021 because it's still going to be -- it's still something new.

I probably don't want to get ahead of ourselves on what that means for 2021 because it's still going to be -- it's still something new. And to be honest with you, the only reason -- when we started vending years ago, we didn't start talking about it until we were about 3 years into it. And here, we're actually talking about it when we're about a year into it. And the only reason being is because in some cases, where we would have put a vending machine in the past, I think we'll put some bins in now because we now have a better suite of products because we own the underlying technology, and it improves our ability to bring the most efficient tool to bear.
The -- we've talked in previous calls about what we call our LIFT concept, Local Inventory Fulfillment Terminal. And really, what that's about is perhaps, sometimes the best place to stock product and to pick product is in the local branch or onsite. Sometimes where to do put that product is in the regional distribution center.
And really, what we're doing with LIFT is something we talked about years ago is supporting vending with maybe a third type of distribution, and that's the fulfillment terminal. We're just -- what's going in that vending machine is what's in that little LIFT facility. And we're managing it there, and we're able to strip -- these are high-frequency turnover products. We're able to strip some of that out of our branch and rake it into the LIFT facility, which is, from a labor standpoint, more efficient. But from a working capital standpoint, incredibly attractive over time.
We had -- we have 9 LIFT facilities that are operating at the end of the year. We're still just touching a really, really small percentage of our vending devices. I think we're touching about 2,500 right now. And our goal is to double that LIFT from 9 operating at the end of this year to 18 at the end of next year.
We'll still be, even with our optimistic projections, still touching a relatively small number of vending devices at the end of the year, but it's ever growing, and that will work some working capital out. But it's still on a relatively small base. That logic equally applies to FAST Bin and FAST Stock."

Now those 80 widgets will still probably include some safety stock from our perspective because we want to make sure that we don't shut the customer down, and we need to make sure that we go and we check those bins and check those machines, et cetera. And so those 80 widgets are an improvement. But when you think about what FAST Bin can do in terms of informing us in real time about need, it's possible that those 80 widgets can be 75 because we're much more aware of what the quantities on hand are.
I agree with Dan. I think 2021 is far too early to talk about what the impact of this is on working capital. This is the first year we're really aggressively commercializing what we've built and worked on. But I mean, intuitively, if we market this correctly, and I think we will, there should be some benefit over time to working capital from the efficiencies it brings to the fulfillment."

It's the way we spoke at our virtual leadership meeting back in December. And it's centered on our government business, which was a huge recipient of a lot of these COVID-type surge sales.
Our government business historically is a relatively small part of our business. It's about 4%. In the second quarter, it surged over 10% of our business. And I don't know what the final number was for the year, but it was -- through most of the year, on a year-to-date basis, it was up over 100% year-over-year.
And so when we come into a year like 2021, the way we talk about it internally is, ""Okay, normally, that business, which is still a young business, we would expect it to grow, say, 20% a year."" So when we're looking at second quarter of 2021 for our government business, we're saying to our teams, ignore your year-over-year numbers because all that matters right now is where are we in January and where are we building to in September and October and then what does that mean for 2022.
But in the case of the second quarter, as an example, take your 2019 Q2 numbers, if you are in the government -- if you're leading our government team. Add to it the 20% we would have expected in Q2 2020, ignoring the COVID thing, and then add another 20% to it for 2021. So 2019 plus 2020, 20% plus 20%, 20% twice over. And that's where your head should be on where you're growing to -- going to be in the second quarter. And that's going to be a negative number for government in the second quarter, unless there's a different way to do math.
And then the challenge to them is because of the broader exposure we received in the marketplace and the fact that more government customers know about us -- and the only area where our Onsite signings accelerated in 2020 over 2019 was with government customers. In the rest of the world, you saw our overall numbers.
And does that 20% plus 20% contemplate the fact that more people want to buy from us or more people are aware of us, and maybe that second 20% can become a 25% or a 30%, I don't know. But that's the way we're thinking about it."

So when demand is weak, that -- you tend to deleverage. Now this is an odd year because you look at our revenue, say, well, demand was weak. But a lot of our demand didn't necessarily run through a lot of our physical structure. There's a lot more direct shift type of business in 2020 than is typical.
The sort of off the side of that is if demand begins to go up, begins to improve, and that improvement is impacting the core of our business, which is our field sales and our branches and taking advantage of the business that we've built over 50-plus years, then we're going to leverage those assets.
And so part of the -- I think part of the answer to your question is, what do you expect next year in terms of industrial production growth and market growth?

The challenge for us is we did a really nice job in 2020. When we pulled that truck service out, we didn't see our third-party spend go up because we needed some service that wasn't there, and our team did a great job with that. We need to keep that reined in as well as we go into 2021. And I feel we're better poised to do that than we have historically because we have better tracking information. 
We've deployed a lot of new technology over the last few years and are continuing to deploy it. And one of those is better illuminating what's where in our system. Just like when you ship a small parcel, being able to know exactly where it is at any given point in time, we're getting better at that ourselves. 
The only other nuance I'd probably introduce is I mean, yes, we are a cyclical -- we're viewed within investing circles as a cyclical type company. Remember that we don't have anywhere near the amount of fixed cost in our gross profit or I guess, in our cost of goods as, say, an average manufacturer does, right?
So does our leverage and deleverage work the same way? Yes, it does. Does it have the same order of magnitude on the upside or the downside as an average manufacturer does? No. No, we tend to be a little bit more muted in that regard. But it behaves the same way as your classic cyclical."

And they've stated to us from the standpoint of our success. They stated to us, we like this Onsite model. We like this vending and bins and FAST Stock model. We like it a lot. We're just nervous about change right now.
We're worried about what's happening in the next 8 hours, 2 weeks, 2 months. We're more worried about that than we are about strategically improving our business because we don't have that luxury. And we don't want to invite new risk, even have you move in. And so I think it would manifest itself in the fact that our pipeline that would expand, and you would see a resumption of the goals we talk -- the targets we talk about on Onsite signings and vending signings, et cetera. And again, those are markers to engagement with our customer. That's where you'd see it.
I think you'd see the underlying economy improve because people, let's face it, we all -- we're all really tired of this. We want to get back to something that's closer to normal and retain -- there's a whole bunch of things that we learned in the last 10 months that frankly would have taken us years to accomplish.
But the necessity is the mother of invention. And we invented a lot in the last 10 months as a society. And there's a whole bunch of things that are positives coming out of it. Perhaps that makes our whole society a little bit better."

If COVID gets resolved, we may -- we have that tough comp in safety, but we have really easy comps in everything that's not safety, which is a bigger part of our mix, right?
People might be concerned about our market share gains in safety and government if COVID normalized, but it didn't do as well on signings because of it. And so we might lose one, but we gain the other.
I think if you stand back from the specifics and look at the overall results for the year, it was -- actually, I think Dan and I both used in some writings, it was kind of a boring year or an unremarkable year if you step back and don't think about the specifics and just look at our results. And that combines remarkable performance in safety. Terrible performance goes to the market in nonsafety. And if COVID gets resolved, that flips. And that's the perspective I would offer."

I'm also quite proud of the trust that was part of that, an important ingredient of that, with our customer and our supplier because we had to communicate like crazy and have trust throughout that supply chain that we could pull some stuff off. And I'll share an example. 
Tomorrow is an important milestone for us. A year ago, on January 21, we did something we'd never done. After conversations with one of our trusted suppliers, a company upriver called 3M, we locked down in our network N95 mask respirators because of what we were learning from our team in China, from our supplier base, and we locked it down, and we'd never done that before. 
And we did it with some really crude tools. We just basically shut off our request system for one part, or several part numbers. But it was all about trust between what our supplier could do and what our customer believed us, the supplier and Fastenal can do to support them. Thanks, everybody. Have a good day."

I will take you to -- we have our annual meeting a week from Saturday.

I will take you to -- we have our annual meeting a week from Saturday. And because of that and to much -- most people's great satisfaction, I'll not tell a story this morning and we'll get right into the quarter. 
If I go to Page 3 of the flip book -- but rest assured, if you participate in our annual meeting next weekend, I will tell a story or 2. If I go to Page 3 of our flip book, so our diluted earnings per share were $0.37 in the quarter, an increase of 3.7%. Net sales were up 3.7% as well. On a daily basis, they were up 5.3%. Some things stand out for me when I think of this quarter. Obviously, we had the storms in February and a massive storm, much more than we've seen in years past. But winter is like that. It has storms and it impacts our numbers. 
Probably the most meaningful impact though and larger than the storms was the fact that we had 1 less calendar day, 63 versus 64, I believe. And that might not seem like a big deal in the scheme of life but we do about $23 million a day. And that day, we missed -- most of our expenses center on the month, whether it's rent or payroll or things like that, they center on a period of time. And so most of our expenses are still here despite the fact we have 1 less day. So if I assume $0.30 to $0.40 of that $1 lost in that day would flow to the bottom line, that's about a $7 million to $9 million impact to the quarter, and so can have a very meaningful impact. 
I point that out only because Q4 has a similar anomaly. 2021 is a weird year. We lose 2 business days, 1 in the first quarter and 1 in the fourth. And I point that out just to make sure we're aware of that. But very impressed with what our team is doing to manage expenses and to grow the business in this environment. 
Additional item in the quarter, we wrote down about $8 million worth of 3-ply masks. Now 3-ply masks is not historically a product line or a product we sell much within Fastenal. As Holden mentioned in the release, from April of 2020 to March of 2021, we sold roughly $110 million worth of 3-ply masks. So it was about 2% of our sales over the last 12 months. That's a sign of the pandemic. And what we did as a supply chain partner in the marketplace is we went out last spring and locked up supply. We were willing to spend dollars to buy a sizable amount of inventory. We knew it was a risky venture going into it, but we felt it was the right thing to do for our customers, for our employees. And quite frankly, being in a strong position, we felt would also serve society quite well. And if I had a do-over, I'd do it again. I think it was a great decision. Our team did a great job. 
But I think it also demonstrated to our customers and to potential customers what we are about as a supply chain partner, and we're willing to do things like that in this type of environment. So not only did we have the operational capability to handle it, we have the financial capability to do it and we have the sense of prioritization to also do it. It requires all 3. And so I'm really impressed with the team. 
I have to say earlier this morning, I chuckled out reading through, I think Adam Oldman and Dave Manthey sent out reports earlier this morning, and I really had a kick out of Dave Manthey's. I believe it was bullet #3 where he commented, ""While FAST does not report adjusted anything,"" core gross margin, he went on to explain the impact of the $8 million. You are absolutely correct. We do not report adjusted anything. We are not an acquisitive company. We're not a manufacturer that's leveraging and talking about EBITDA. We're a distributor, and I don't think distributors in our position should be doing that. And I'm really proud of what we've done and with how it positions us going forward. 
I also think the write-down of inventory. It's still great inventory. The write-down of inventory is one of the most -- is one of the bullish -- most bullish comments we could make as an organization internally and externally because we believe the market is going to change for masks in the months to come because we believe the economy is healing. And that's showing up, as you see in our next bullet, when we talk about fastener daily growth. 
So we grew about 4% in the first quarter but it was 14% in March. Now before you get too excited about that number, that is a bit of a comp issue as well. So I think sequential has a lot more to tell the story. Just like we saw a decade ago in 2009, sequential was what it's about. January to March, our sequential fasteners grew -- sequentially, our fasteners grew 7.1%. If I go back to ignore 2020 and go back to the years before that, 2015-2019, on average, we grew 4.9%. That's a sign of the strength in the economy. And that's what led us to write down the masks because we see the market changing. And we saw very good sequential patterns in our manufacturing, particularly in our heavy manufacturing end markets. 
We also mentioned in the release that we are seeing increasing supply chain pressure. I don't think that should come as a surprise to anybody. I suspect everybody, regardless of where you live on the planet, saw that ship in the Suez Canal sitting cockeyed for about 5, 6 -- I think almost 5 days. That's merely a very thing that we're seeing in ports around North America, we're seeing in ports around the world. And there's a lot of constraint and constraint and rising activity create 1 thing and that is inflationary pressures. And we are seeing that. 
Pretty nominal impact to the first quarter. We do anticipate seeing a larger impact as we move into Q2 and Q3. As we saw in much of 2020 and it's continued in 2021, the team, whether that be our local team, our district and regional leadership, our finance teams, did a wonderful job managing working capital and as a result, very, very strong cash flow performance. 
Flipping on to Page 4. While we're not back to pre-pandemic signings, we saw improvement in the signings of Onsites and we signed 68 in the quarter. Again, that's our highest number since pandemic began. We ended the quarter with 1,285 active sites, an increase of 9% over last year. The daily sales in that Onsite business grew mid- to high single digits. And the only problematic area, if you will, in the quarter is, A, the level of signings, which is improving, but also the older Onsites are still sluggish and that's really a reflection of that underlying customer base, but the momentum is improving as we went through the quarter. 
Holden did soften a bit, the signings, and that's more of a function of the current environment we operate in, has nothing to say about the long-term opportunity we see in this piece of our business. We're very excited about the Onsite business. 
FMI, and hopefully, you've gotten -- you've adjusted to some of the new reporting that Holden has, I'll let him dig into that in a little more detail. I think he did a nice job explaining it in the release. I think he did a nice job explaining it in our annual report. With the acquisition of the Apex Technologies a year ago, and with additional pieces that our team has built, FMI has moved beyond being strictly vending to a much wider swath of business. We're really excited about that. Like Onsite, FMI requires strong engagement with the customer. It also requires going into customers' facilities. 
One thing that surprised me probably more in the last 12 months of anything is the willingness of customers to continue signing Onsites, to continue signing vending even at a lower level in an environment where you wanted to kind of lock up your facility and keep it safe for your employees. We have been -- during this entire time frame, we have been welcomed into customers' facilities to replenish bins, to replenish line stocking, to replenish vending. And we're seeing that open up more and more each and every day. 
Flipping to e-commerce. E-commerce daily sales rose 35% in the quarter. Our large customer-oriented EDI was up almost [ 38% ] and our web sales were up 29%. With that, I'll switch it over to Holden."

Total and daily sales were up 3.7% and 5.3%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2021. The severe storms that affected the U.S. in February reduced growth in the quarter by 50 to 100 basis points. Demand improved for our traditional manufacturing and construction customers. For instance, manufacturing is up 5.6% in the first quarter but accelerated to up 10.8% in March. Construction was down 7.5% in the first quarter but improved to flat in March. 
Fasteners are a great bellwether of activity. And as Dan noted, the rate of change between January and March of 2021 well exceeded the typical pattern. We saw similar patterns in vended safety products and total and heavy manufacturing industries. So yes, comparisons began to ease in March, but even so, it's clear that underlying demand growth is improving at an accelerating pace as well. 
Now the counterbalance to gains in our traditional business is moderating demand for COVID-related product. Daily sales of safety products were up 14.7% in the first quarter of 2021 but that slowed up 3.2% in March. We have seen daily sales of non-vended respirators and gloves, which were heavily pandemic-oriented, ease over the past few months. Daily sales to government customers were up 37.3% in the first quarter of 2021 but that slowed up 14.5% in March. This pattern will become more pronounced in the second quarter of 2021, given the absence of surge sales that we had in the second quarter last year. 
Our long-term goal, however, is to retain customers that engaged with us for the first time during the pandemic. Along those lines, 26% of the customers who bought PPE from us for the first time in the second quarter last year continued to buy from us in the first quarter, contributing more than $60 million in sales. 
The primary area that is still being restrained by COVID-related accommodations, are growth driver signings, as Dan discussed earlier. We do not believe market receptivity to our growth drivers has changed. As access to facilities and key decision makers continues to improve as it did in the first quarter, we believe signings activity will as well. 
When we look at the second quarter of '21, we see quarterly growth that is flat to slightly down. As you know, we do not traditionally provide forward guidance. However, given the convergence of accelerating demand in our traditional markets, share gains in safety and the absence of $350 million to $360 million in surge sales, we just felt some perspective on an unusual comparison would be useful. 
Now over to Slide 6. Gross margin was 45.4% in the first quarter of '21, down 120 basis points versus the first quarter of 2020. Roughly half of this decline related to the mask write-down addressed earlier. The remainder is split between customer mix and lower product margins in fasteners and safety. For fasteners, lower-margin OEMs growing faster than other categories, which is likely to continue. However, pressure related to a couple of large customer implementations and from spot buys to manage the tight supply chains should ease in the second and third quarters of 2021. 
In safety, PPE sales to government remain meaningful and carry lower margins. While the margin on this business may remain lower, likely improvement in the nongovernment mix in upcoming quarters relative to the first quarter should benefit the overall product margin. The decline in gross margin was matched by 120 basis points of SG&A leverage, producing an operating margin in the first quarter of 2021 of 19.8%, flat with the prior year. Excluding the write-down, it would have leveraged nicely in the first quarter of 2021. This leverage continues to be a function of good control of headcount, branch reductions, lower selling-related transportation expenses and reduction of discretionary spend such as travel and supplies. 
Our incremental margin was 18% but excluding the write-down would have been roughly 33%. The organization managed costs effectively in the first quarter of '21, and we believe that will continue. However, remember that in the second quarter of 2021, the comparisons will get tougher as we anniversary the first period to have been affected by the pandemic and the related cost savings measures. At the same time, demand is improving, which will likely bring incremental investment in the business. As a result, relative to the adjusted incremental margin of 33%, we would expect incremental margins to moderate in future quarters. Putting it all together, we reported first quarter 2021 EPS of $0.37, up 3.7% from $0.35 in the first quarter of 2020. 
Now turning to Slide 7. Operating cash flow of $275 million in the first quarter of 2021 was 131% of net income. Year-over-year, accounts receivable was up 2.1% while inventories were down 3%. Sequentially, our working capital expanded more slowly than is historically typical. This is due in part to improving receivables quality, lower branch count and initiatives to improve the flow of our internal logistics, reduce slow-moving product and make local inventory more efficient. We believe these represent improvements in our working capital that will be sustained. However, less welcome was tightening global supply chains, which contributed to our hubs having about $15 million less in inventory on hand than we had intended. 
Net capital spending in the first quarter of 2021 was $30 million, down from $47 million in the first quarter of 2020. This was largely from lower vending spend, which was a product of lower signings over the past 12 months and better device costs stemming from the Apex asset acquisition. Our 2021 net capital spending range is unchanged between $170 million to $200 million. 
We returned cash to shareholders in the quarter in the form of $161 million in dividends. And from a liquidity standpoint, we finished the first quarter of 2021 with net debt at 2.2% of total capital, down from 9.5% in the year-ago period and 5.1% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Essentially all of our revolver remains available for use. 
Now before moving into Q&A, I wanted to address a couple of subjects of current interest. First, we are experiencing significant material cost inflation, particularly for steel, fuel and transportation costs. This did not have a material impact on the first quarter of 2021. Price contributed 60 to 90 basis points to growth and the impact of price cost on margin was immaterial. However, we are instituting broad and material pricing actions in the second quarter of 2021 that will likely lift pricing contribution over the course of the year. Customers never like higher prices, of course, but they are busy in seeing increases throughout the supply chain. Further, the tools and processes we have developed, including data for our customers, has never been more effective. The environment today is receptive. 
Second, we are also impacted by tightening global and domestic supply chains. On the sales side, certain of our customers are not operating as fully as they could be due to shortage of components. On the cost and service side, moving product has become increasingly costly, and lead times have lengthened, causing product shortages in our hubs. These shortages have been overcome with spot buys made in the field that have allowed us to sustain service but at lower margins. We believe this dynamic could persist through 2021, though perhaps not quite as intensely in the second half as we are experiencing currently. That is all for our formal presentation. So with that, operator, we'll take questions. I'm sorry. We have 1 other comment."

And I just wanted to run through these with you. So since the start of COVID-19, we have had 1,685 cases within the Fastenal Blue Team family. With just over 20,000 employees, that's roughly 8.5% of our employees contracted COVID. 
I consider that a low number when you look at the fact that unlike many organizations, our employees didn't have the luxury of being able to work out of a room in their basement or home office. Our employees go to work every day and work in a manufacturing facility, a distribution center, work in a branch or Onsite location or drive a truck. And so they're actively engaged with customers in their environment. 
If I look at the peak, our peak period was November of 2020. We had 430 cases or roughly 86 per week. To give you a contrast, in March of 2021, we had 102 cases or 26 per week, a drop of 70%.

I mean, I think the way we described it was simply an environment where you're seeing an increase in costs around transportation. You're seeing it in steel, you're seeing it in fuel and that ultimately goes through plastics. So I think in general, we're seeing an inflationary environment, and I suspect that, that doesn't surprise anybody. 
It also shouldn't surprise anybody, I believe, that we're going to react to that a number of ways, but a part of that is going to involve pricing behavior. And so in the second quarter, we're going to have to institute some price increases as a means of mitigating things. So when I talked about the 60 to 90 basis points of impact from price in the first quarter, I do expect that to be higher as we get into the second half of this year. 
Now will it be outside of our normal sort of 0% to 2% range? No, I don't think it will be. I don't think it's anything of that order of magnitude. And I think that our objectives remain the same and that is to neutralize the impact on our margin and essentially stay even within the marketplace. And I think those are our goals. But in order to do that, obviously, we'll have to take actions, given where the market is today. 
I guess the good news, maybe let us call it the news, is that right now, our customers are really busy. Our customers are seeing these types of actions from a lot of different quarters. And so there's always a conversation. This is an environment where inevitably customers for -- within these supply chains start wondering if there's other places that they could get a better piece price, and that's the kind of thing that happens in the marketplace and during periods of inflation. But we're not seeing anything unusual or different in the marketplace in terms of an inflationary environment than I think we've experienced in the past, and we expect to be able to manage through it."

If we could -- we were probably $15 million, maybe a little bit more light in the hubs, versus what we would have expected to be going into the quarter. And the reason for that is because we simply couldn't -- we couldn't move product from where it was into our hubs as quickly as demand began to accelerate. And so to the question of, are we carrying a bunch of buffer inventory? No, I wouldn't say that we are carrying a bunch of buffer inventory. I'm not sure there's a lot of buffer inventory in the channel. 
But what I think is impressive about what our field does is, culturally, we have always empowered individuals in our business units to make very independent decisions. And this is not the first time that they have been called upon to go out and source product where we haven't been able to provide it out of the hub in certain cases. And when I sort of send out the survey to the RVPs, one of the comments that came through loud and clear is whatever supply chain disruptions are happening at the customer level, it's not because we aren't getting them product. We are managing to source product locally in the field and we're continuing to keep up with things. But it does involve a lot more effort and time sourcing that product. But I think that's one of the strengths of the organization. 
And so supply chain is not unique to Fastenal in terms of the tightness that's out there. But I think we're uniquely structured to manage it and navigate it. I think we saw that in Q1 and I think that's good for a -- in terms of market share gains over time. It does have a little bit of a margin impact, right? I mean, sourcing outside our supply chain isn't quite as profitable as sourcing within it. And you saw some of that in the fastener line. But as we normalize the supply chain as you go through the year, to the extent we can, I think you'll see that effect moderate."

I think that shined through in 2020. I think that has shined through in the years past when there's a little bit of chaos going on in the supply chain. 
It allows us to be a little bit more agile because we do have some inventory on the shelf. What we're really seeing in changes is, and I mentioned it to our own employees on an internal video, historically, our supply chain team might be pinging branches with reorder points that are 90 days out, 100 days out, 110 days out. What our supply chain teams are doing, we're going out even further. We're going out into August and September. And we're pinging folks and saying, ""Hey, we might want to order this now. We might want to do some things now, get it in motion now because there are some disruptions. We want to be in queue for product."" 
One thing that has historically helped us for being in queue for product, we're an organization that is known in the industry for being incredibly responsive to paying its bills. We have a strong cash position. We can move faster than anybody else as a result. And that positions us well. And history has told, being in environments like this, I believe it tips to scale towards Fastenal a bit on its ability to take market share because we will have inventory, we will have opportunities and abilities to move in the marketplace that some of our competitors won't. And I'm primarily talking about a lot of the more local competitors as opposed to some of the national players."

So I mean, on an order of magnitude, do I think that you're going to see $350 million to $360 million of sales that you wouldn't have otherwise in this current environment? No, nothing of that sort. 
But going back to what Dan and I talked about a moment ago, the ability of our people in the field to be able to go out and find product independently to fill in gaps that we may have as our traditional supply chain is perhaps a little tight, I think that, that is an advantage to our business. It was an advantage last year, as Dan talked about. I mean, a lot of the customers that we source and things like that, there was a local element to that. 
I think it will be an advantage this year just because right now, what our customers are concerned about as demand goes up is having a product available. And the flexibility in our business and in our model, I think that's going to provide us an advantage when making sure that service levels remain high and availability remains high, that I think it's going to give us market share.

And I'll speak to firsthand knowledge of what -- some things we're doing. So roughly 93%, 94% of our employees can't work remotely. I mentioned that earlier. Around 6% of our employees can work remotely because they're in supporting roles. And we did ask -- strongly asked a lot of those folks to go home a year ago because we wanted to create a safer environment for everybody else, the people that had to be here. We have folks that are coming back. And we are doing a lot of things as far as putting up partitions and different things that we didn't do over the last 12 months because it wasn't necessary because the rooms are empty. 
But we're putting up Plexiglas barriers and we're putting in a lot of sanitizing stuff because people are returning to work. That's going to create a core demand. But I'd be surprised to see a drop below 20%. And if it does, it's because everything else grew faster than I'm expecting."

It's what essentially -- and I'll talk to the RFID because that's the biggest piece of it, at least it is currently. We'll see if the IR beams within MRO bins, how big that becomes relative to it. But what it really is, is think of a kanban system. And in that kanban system, right now, what you have is somebody has to physically go out and observe empty bins or gather the empty bins. 
What really changes in an RFID environment is when that bin is empty, there's a -- think of it as a set of shelves and up above, there's this open box. And you put the bin up there and there's an RFID tag that reads it and it tells our branch. It actually tells our supply chain team, we need to replenish this bin. And so the biggest thing is the labor efficiency. But it also allows us to illuminate much more of the supply chain for the customer so they can really see it and can operate a little bit leaner and we can reduce the inventory. 
I believe the inventory lean-up for our customer will fund the capital it takes for the actual devices because the only thing that's really changing is the technology enablement. The bins are the bins. They were there before. You have an RFID tag on them. So the capital piece is relatively modest, except for the actual communication talking, but the economics are better than bedding. And the real reason is, it becomes much more labor efficient to serve that business in the marketplace."

So if you recall, last quarter, what we said is we talked about a 375 to 400 because we wanted to convey to people that we believe that's what the market can support. And we continue to believe that's what the market can support, but we also said at the time that business conditions would have to meaningfully improve in order for us to achieve that. 
And whereas I do believe that business conditions have improved, they haven't normalized to where they were pre pandemic at this point. And the fact is in Q1, we landed 68. And so to be on the type of pace that we would have to do, to do closer to 400, given that we've booked 68 in quarter 1, it just seems like a stretch when the conditions haven't fully normalized from where we were before, right? That's the 1 area that I believe is still being affected by COVID-related accommodations. 
So given that, I think that it was worth -- I mean, I think we sort of, I think, gave indication that this seemed like a high potential scenario when we talked last quarter, and it just seemed like a prudent thing to do. Now note, we've kind of said the same thing about FMI this quarter, right? We believe that the market can support 23,000 to 25,000 weighted FMI devices. But we're going to need to see the activity levels continue to improve even from where it was Q1 to get there. Right now, we're probably pacing a little bit low. 
But I think the important thing to just reiterate is, I don't think this has anything to do with the receptivity of the tools that we're providing in the marketplace. I don't believe that there's any belief on the part of our organization that we can't achieve those levels. But the environment is still normalizing. It's not there yet.

He's probably right but I don't know if I agree with him. 
And that is -- I think if you look at first quarter, I believe 29 of our 68 signings were in the month of March. So it did tick up as we went through the quarter. Now that's not an unusual pattern because January is usually tentative and February was weaker because of the storm, as you mentioned. I think the risk of signings this year is more about customers really being busy and they just can't think about it right now. They just can't do it right now. And I think that's the risk of it not getting to that 100 per quarter pace. And that's the only reason I didn't ask Holden to remove that sentence from both the earnings release and the flip book. 
Otherwise, I'd ask him to remove it because I think the model is great. I think the market is receptive to it. And I think we could ramp up faster, but there is that 1 risk that people are too busy to let it happen because change always takes energy and where do you want to prioritize your energy. But I'm not completely in agreement with Holden on this 1, but he's -- if I were a betting person, he's probably more right.

And as it does, I would expect the hub inventories to rise. I'm not sure that we've necessarily put a number to that. And I think a lot of it's going to depend on the degree to which demand continues to run the way that it is. 
So -- but I do believe that we're light on inventory in the hubs. As inflation continues to run through, I think that will put some upward pressure on values of inventory as well. So I'm not sure I have a good answer for you in terms of what the ultimate number is. But that's part of the answer to addressing what we're seeing in the supply chain and improving our service levels. 
But right now, we're a little bit low on inventory, we're a little bit low on fulfillment levels and we need to correct that. And in Q1, it would have required $15 million more, and I think that builds a little bit as you get into Q2 and the supply chain pressures build. Now that will be offset to some degree with the work that we're doing internally to take out slow- and no-moving inventory, in terms of reducing the branch count, which the field continues to take some of the branches out, that makes sense to them. 
Those or -- I think when we talk a little bit about the customer fulfillment center, which is a form of branch, which has much more customized and tailored inventory, those are all initiatives that I think are very sustainable. We'll continue to mitigate the effects of supply chain over the course of the year. But right now, our inventory would be better off in having a little bit more in it than it does, and that's going to motivate our work on improving the supply chain."

I mean, we all know that we have a relatively easy comp on gross margin in 2Q. And so I haven't really tried to think about it in terms of year-over-year rate of change. I think if you take the first quarter gross margin, you adjust for the write-down, which is our intention is that, that will be focused on 1Q '21 and be done. Adjust for that, you're looking at a first quarter margin about 45.9%. 
If I move over to 2Q, normally, second quarter would see a little bit of a decline sequentially from Q1. I think that, that could come in somewhere around flattish. And part of the reason is the mix that you're talking about. Interestingly enough, right now, the fastener/nonfastener mix is normalizing faster than the Onsite/non-Onsite mixes. And so that actually moderated the impact of mix in Q1, and we'll see how that plays out in Q2 but it's possible that could be a little bit moderate as well. And I think that contributes to that. And of course, assuming we're effective on pricing, that can contribute as well. So when I think about the second quarter gross margins, I think it gets really messy to think about it year-over-year when we can kind of think about sequential patterns and try to run off of that. 
And I guess, I think -- when I think about Q2, instead of thinking about it in terms of the normal 20 basis point decline, I think that, that could actually run a little bit more flattish. And that would obviously be a meaningful increase year-over-year but that's just a comp issue. Did that help?"

Understanding there was a pretty big step-up in activity sequentially into March, presumably, that continues just as things reopen on the fastener side. I know growth isn't really homogenous, it can come anywhere, but are there limits to being able to grow here in the short term? 
So you talked about kind of flattish to maybe down a little bit in 2Q. But if everything went your way, is there really capacity to grow a lot faster? I mean, I guess I'm thinking back to some of the weather interruptions in 2Q and those customers not being able to make up days immediately. Is that something that's sort of governed on the upside here, at least in the short term until some of the supply chain stuff works out?"

And -- but you saw a lot of that. You had good plants that where there was no electricity and they weren't operating. And you had pipes freezing.

But new customer acquisition is not usually so dramatic as what you saw during that period of time. So I think it's really difficult to say. 
What I would say is we continue to grow as a business, and I think if you look at industrial production and things of that nature, I don't think that you're seeing that grow. There are some surveys that are done out there. And certainly through February, those surveys were still pointing to distribution being negative. Industrial production was still slightly negative. We were growing. So I think those are the ways that I usually look at it to judge or understand the degree to which we are gaining market share.

But the RVPs have been reporting for the last several months that the construction -- the tone of the construction market was getting better. And there's been a bit of a lag to that.

I will take you to -- we have our annual meeting a week from Saturday. And because of that and to much -- most people's great satisfaction, I'll not tell",1517,"Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us for our Q1 earnings call. I will take you to -- we have our annual meeting a week from Saturday. And because of that and to much -- most people's great satisfaction, I'll not tell a story this morning and we'll get right into the quarter.
If I go to Page 3 of the flip book -- but rest assured, if you participate in our annual meeting next weekend, I will tell a story or 2. If I go to Page 3 of our flip book, so our diluted earnings per share were $0.37 in the quarter, an increase of 3.7%. Net sales were up 3.7% as well. On a daily basis, they were up 5.3%. Some things stand out for me when I think of this quarter. Obviously, we had the storms in February and a massive storm, much more than we've seen in years past. But winter is like that. It has storms and it impacts our numbers.
Probably the most meaningful impact though and larger than the storms was the fact that we had 1 less calendar day, 63 versus 64, I believe. And that might not seem like a big deal in the scheme of life but we do about $23 million a day. And that day, we missed -- most of our expenses center on the month, whether it's rent or payroll or things like that, they center on a period of time. And so most of our expenses are still here despite the fact we have 1 less day. So if I assume $0.30 to $0.40 of that $1 lost in that day would flow to the bottom line, that's about a $7 million to $9 million impact to the quarter, and so can have a very meaningful impact.
I point that out only because Q4 has a similar anomaly. 2021 is a weird year. We lose 2 business days, 1 in the first quarter and 1 in the fourth. And I point that out just to make sure we're aware of that. But very impressed with what our team is doing to manage expenses and to grow the business in this environment.
Additional item in the quarter, we wrote down about $8 million worth of 3-ply masks. Now 3-ply masks is not historically a product line or a product we sell much within Fastenal. As Holden mentioned in the release, from April of 2020 to March of 2021, we sold roughly $110 million worth of 3-ply masks. So it was about 2% of our sales over the last 12 months. That's a sign of the pandemic.
And what we did as a supply chain partner in the marketplace is we went out last spring and locked up supply. We were willing to spend dollars to buy a sizable amount of inventory. We knew it was a risky venture going into it, but we felt it was the right thing to do for our customers, for our employees. And quite frankly, being in a strong position, we felt would also serve society quite well. And if I had a do-over, I'd do it again. I think it was a great decision. Our team did a great job.
But I think it also demonstrated to our customers and to potential customers what we are about as a supply chain partner, and we're willing to do things like that in this type of environment. So not only did we have the operational capability to handle it, we have the financial capability to do it and we have the sense of prioritization to also do it. It requires all 3. And so I'm really impressed with the team.
I have to say earlier this morning, I chuckled out reading through, I think Adam Uhlman and Dave Manthey sent out reports earlier this morning, and I really had a kick out of Dave Manthey's. I believe it was bullet #3 where he commented, ""While FAST does not report adjusted anything,"" core gross margin, he went on to explain the impact of the $8 million. You are absolutely correct. We do not report adjusted anything. We are not an acquisitive company. We're not a manufacturer that's leveraging and talking about EBITDA. We're a distributor, and I don't think distributors in our position should be doing that. And I'm really proud of what we've done and with how it positions us going forward.
I also think the write-down of inventory. It's still great inventory. The write-down of inventory is one of the most -- is one of the bullish -- most bullish comments we could make as an organization internally and externally because we believe the market is going to change for masks in the months to come because we believe the economy is healing. And that's showing up, as you see in our next bullet, when we talk about FAST in our daily growth.
So we grew about 4% in the first quarter but it was 14% in March. Now before you get too excited about that number, that is a bit of a comp issue as well. So I think sequential has a lot more to tell the story. Just like we saw a decade ago in 2009, sequential was what it's about. January to March, our sequential fasteners grew -- sequentially, our fasteners grew 7.1%. If I go back to ignore 2020 and go back to the years before that, 2015-2019, on average, we grew 4.9%. That's a sign of the strength in the economy. And that's what led us to write down the masks because we see the market changing. And we saw very good sequential patterns in our manufacturing, particularly in our heavy manufacturing end markets.
We also mentioned in the release that we are seeing increasing supply chain pressure. I don't think that should come as a surprise to anybody. I suspect everybody, regardless of where you live on the planet, saw that ship in the Suez Canal sitting cockeyed for about 5, 6 -- I think almost 5 days. That's merely a very visual thing that we're seeing in ports around North America, we're seeing in ports around the world. And there's a lot of constraint. And constraint and rising activity create one thing, and that is inflationary pressures. And we are seeing that.
Pretty nominal impact to the first quarter. We do anticipate seeing a larger impact as we move into Q2 and Q3. As we saw in much of 2020 and it's continued in 2021, the team, whether that be our local team, our district and regional leadership, our finance teams, did a wonderful job managing working capital and as a result, very, very strong cash flow performance.
Flipping on to Page 4. While we're not back to pre-pandemic signings, we saw improvement in the signings of Onsites and we signed 68 in the quarter. Again, that's our highest number since pandemic began. We ended the quarter with 1,285 active sites, an increase of 9% over last year. The daily sales in that Onsite business grew mid- to high single digits. And the only problematic area, if you will, in the quarter is, A, the level of signings, which is improving, but also the older Onsites are still sluggish and that's really a reflection of that underlying customer base, but the momentum is improving as we went through the quarter.
Holden did soften a bit, the signings, and that's more of a function of the current environment we operate in, has nothing to say about the long-term opportunity we see in this piece of our business. We're very excited about the Onsite business.
FMI, and hopefully, you've gotten -- you've adjusted to some of the new reporting that Holden has, I'll let him dig into that in a little more detail. I think he did a nice job explaining it in the release. I think he did a nice job explaining it in our annual report. With the acquisition of the Apex Technologies a year ago, and with additional pieces that our team has built, FMI has moved beyond being strictly vending to a much wider swath of business. We're really excited about that. Like Onsite, FMI requires strong engagement with the customer. It also requires going into customers' facilities.
One thing that surprised me probably more in the last 12 months of anything is the willingness of customers to continue signing Onsites, to continue signing vending even at a lower level in an environment where you wanted to kind of lock up your facility and keep it safe for your employees. We have been -- during this entire time frame, we have been welcomed into customers' facilities to replenish bins, to replenish line stocking, to replenish vending. And we're seeing that open up more and more each and every day.
Flipping to e-commerce. E-commerce daily sales rose 35% in the quarter. Our large customer-oriented EDI was up almost 38%, and our web sales were up 29%.
With that, I'll switch it over to Holden."

Total and daily sales were up 3.7% and 5.3%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2021. The severe storms that affected the U.S. in February reduced growth in the quarter by 50 to 100 basis points. Demand improved for our traditional manufacturing and construction customers. For instance, manufacturing is up 5.6% in the first quarter but accelerated to up 10.8% in March. Construction was down 7.5% in the first quarter but improved to flat in March.
Fasteners are a great bellwether of activity. And as Dan noted, the rate of change between January and March of 2021 well exceeded the typical pattern. We saw similar patterns in vended safety products and total and heavy manufacturing industries. So yes, comparisons began to ease in March, but even so, it's clear that underlying demand growth is improving at an accelerating pace as well.
Now the counterbalance to gains in our traditional business is moderating demand for COVID-related product. Daily sales of safety products were up 14.7% in the first quarter of 2021 but that slowed up 3.2% in March. We have seen daily sales of non-vended respirators and gloves, which were heavily pandemic-oriented, ease over the past few months. Daily sales to government customers were up 37.3% in the first quarter of 2021 but that slowed up 14.5% in March. This pattern will become more pronounced in the second quarter of 2021, given the absence of surge sales that we had in the second quarter last year.
Our long-term goal, however, is to retain customers that engaged with us for the first time during the pandemic. Along those lines, 26% of the customers who bought PPE from us for the first time in the second quarter last year continued to buy from us in the first quarter, contributing more than $60 million in sales.
The primary area that is still being restrained by COVID-related accommodations are growth driver signings, as Dan discussed earlier. We do not believe market receptivity to our growth drivers has changed. As access to facilities and key decision makers continues to improve as it did in the first quarter, we believe signings activity will as well.
When we look at the second quarter of '21, we see quarterly growth that is flat to slightly down. As you know, we do not traditionally provide forward guidance. However, given the convergence of accelerating demand in our traditional markets, share gains in safety and the absence of $350 million to $360 million in surge sales, we just felt some perspective on an unusual comparison would be useful.
Now over to Slide 6. Gross margin was 45.4% in the first quarter of '21, down 120 basis points versus the first quarter of 2020. Roughly half of this decline related to the mask write-down addressed earlier. The remainder is split between customer mix and lower product margins in fasteners and safety. For fasteners, lower-margin OEM is growing faster than other categories, which is likely to continue. However, pressure related to a couple of large customer implementations and from spot buys to manage the tight supply chains should ease in the second and third quarters of 2021.
In safety, PPE sales to government remain meaningful and carry lower margins. While the margin on this business may remain lower, likely improvement in the nongovernment mix in upcoming quarters relative to the first quarter should benefit the overall product margin.
The decline in gross margin was matched by 120 basis points of SG&A leverage, producing an operating margin in the first quarter of 2021 of 19.8%, flat with the prior year. Excluding the write-down, it would have leveraged nicely in the first quarter of 2021. This leverage continues to be a function of good control of headcount, branch reductions, lower selling-related transportation expenses and reduction of discretionary spend such as travel and supplies.
Our incremental margin was 18% but excluding the write-down would have been roughly 33%. The organization managed costs effectively in the first quarter of '21, and we believe that will continue. However, remember that in the second quarter of 2021, the comparisons will get tougher as we anniversary the first period to have been affected by the pandemic and the related cost savings measures. At the same time, demand is improving, which will likely bring incremental investment in the business. As a result, relative to the adjusted incremental margin of 33%, we would expect incremental margins to moderate in future quarters. Putting it all together, we reported first quarter 2021 EPS of $0.37, up 3.7% from $0.35 in the first quarter of 2020.
Now turning to Slide 7. Operating cash flow of $275 million in the first quarter of 2021 was 131% of net income. Year-over-year, accounts receivable was up 2.1% while inventories were down 3%. Sequentially, our working capital expanded more slowly than is historically typical. This is due in part to improving receivables quality, lower branch count and initiatives to improve the flow of our internal logistics, reduce slow-moving product and make local inventory more efficient. We believe these represent improvements in our working capital that will be sustained. However, less welcome was tightening global supply chains, which contributed to our hubs having about $15 million less in inventory on hand than we had intended.
Net capital spending in the first quarter of 2021 was $30 million, down from $47 million in the first quarter of 2020. This was largely from lower vending spend, which was a product of lower signings over the past 12 months and better device costs stemming from the Apex asset acquisition. Our 2021 net capital spending range is unchanged between $170 million to $200 million.
We returned cash to shareholders in the quarter in the form of $161 million in dividends. And from a liquidity standpoint, we finished the first quarter of 2021 with net debt at 2.2% of total capital, down from 9.5% in the year-ago period and 5.1% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Essentially all of our revolver remains available for use.
Now before moving into Q&A, I wanted to address a couple of subjects of current interest. First, we are experiencing significant material cost inflation, particularly for steel, fuel and transportation costs. This did not have a material impact on the first quarter of 2021. Price contributed 60 to 90 basis points to growth and the impact of price cost on margin was immaterial. However, we are instituting broad and material pricing actions in the second quarter of 2021 that will likely lift pricing contribution over the course of the year. Customers never like higher prices, of course, but they are busy in seeing increases throughout the supply chain. Further, the tools and processes we have developed, including data for our customers, has never been more effective. The environment today is receptive.
Second, we are also impacted by tightening global and domestic supply chains. On the sales side, certain of our customers are not operating as fully as they could be due to shortage of components. On the cost and service side, moving product has become increasingly costly, and lead times have lengthened, causing product shortages in our hubs. These shortages have been overcome with spot buys made in the field that have allowed us to sustain service but at lower margins. We believe this dynamic could persist through 2021, though perhaps not quite as intensely in the second half as we are experiencing currently.
That is all for our formal presentation. So with that, operator, we'll take questions."

Before we switch over to Q&A, in the last several quarters, I've shared with you our employee COVID numbers and I neglected to mention that earlier. And I just wanted to run through these with you. So since the start of COVID-19, we have had 1,685 cases within the Fastenal Blue Team family. With just over 20,000 employees, that's roughly 8.5% of our employees contracted COVID.
I consider that a low number when you look at the fact that unlike many organizations, our employees didn't have the luxury of being able to work out of a room in their basement or a home office. Our employees go to work every day and work in a manufacturing facility, a distribution center, work in a branch or Onsite location or drive a truck. And so they're actively engaged with customers in their environment.
If I look at the peak, our peak period was November of 2020. We had 430 cases or roughly 86 per week. To give you a contrast, in March of 2021, we had 102 cases or 26 per week, a drop of 70%. We think that is a sign of what's happening in the underlying marketplace and makes us bullish as we look out into 2021.
We'll switch over to Q&A now, please."

I mean, I think the way we described it was simply an environment where you're seeing an increase in costs around transportation. You're seeing it in steel, you're seeing it in fuel and that ultimately goes through plastics. So I think in general, we're seeing an inflationary environment, and I suspect that, that doesn't surprise anybody.
It also shouldn't surprise anybody, I believe, that we're going to react to that a number of ways, but a part of that is going to involve pricing behavior. And so in the second quarter, we're going to have to institute some price increases as a means of mitigating things. So when I talked about the 60 to 90 basis points of impact from price in the first quarter, I do expect that to be higher as we get into the second half of this year.
Now will it be outside of our normal sort of 0% to 2% range? No, I don't think it will be. I don't think it's anything of that order of magnitude. And I think that our objectives remain the same and that is to neutralize the impact on our margin and essentially stay even within the marketplace. And I think those are our goals. But in order to do that, obviously, we'll have to take actions, given where the market is today.
I guess the good news, maybe let us call it the news, is that right now, our customers are really busy. Our customers are seeing these types of actions from a lot of different quarters. And so there's always a conversation. This is an environment where inevitably customers for -- within these supply chains start wondering if there's other places that they could get a better piece price, and that's the kind of thing that happens in the marketplace and during periods of inflation. But we're not seeing anything unusual or different in the marketplace in terms of an inflationary environment than I think we've experienced in the past, and we expect to be able to manage through it."

If we could -- we were probably $15 million, maybe a little bit more light in the hubs, versus what we would have expected to be going into the quarter. And the reason for that is because we simply couldn't -- we couldn't move product from where it was into our hubs as quickly as demand began to accelerate. And so to the question of, are we carrying a bunch of buffer inventory? No, I wouldn't say that we are carrying a bunch of buffer inventory. I'm not sure there's a lot of buffer inventory in the channel.
But what I think is impressive about what our field does is, culturally, we have always empowered individuals in our business units to make very independent decisions. And this is not the first time that they have been called upon to go out and source product where we haven't been able to provide it out of the hub in certain cases.
And when I sort of send out the survey to the RVPs, one of the comments that came through loud and clear is whatever supply chain disruptions are happening at the customer level, it's not because we aren't getting them product. We are managing to source product locally in the field and we're continuing to keep up with things. But it does involve a lot more effort and time sourcing that product. But I think that's one of the strengths of the organization.
And so supply chain is not unique to Fastenal in terms of the tightness that's out there. But I think we're uniquely structured to manage it and navigate it. I think we saw that in Q1 and I think that's good for a -- in terms of market share gains over time. It does have a little bit of a margin impact, right? I mean sourcing outside our supply chain isn't quite as profitable as sourcing within it. And you saw some of that in the fastener line. But as we normalize the supply chain as you go through the year, to the extent we can, I think you'll see that effect moderate."

I think that shined through in 2020. I think that has shined through in the years past when there's a little bit of chaos going on in the supply chain.
It allows us to be a little bit more agile because we do have some inventory on the shelf. What we're really seeing in changes is, and I mentioned it to our own employees on an internal video, historically, our supply chain team might be pinging branches with reorder points that are 90 days out, 100 days out, 110 days out. What our supply chain teams are doing, we're going out even further. We're going out into August and September. And we're pinging folks and saying, ""Hey, we might want to order this now. We might want to do some things now, get it in motion now because there are some disruptions. We want to be in queue for product.""
One thing that has historically helped us for being in queue for product, we're an organization that is known in the industry for being incredibly responsive to paying its bills. We have a strong cash position. We can move faster than anybody else as a result. And that positions us well. And history has told, being in environments like this, I believe it tips to scale towards Fastenal a bit on its ability to take market share because we will have inventory, we will have opportunities and abilities to move in the marketplace that some of our competitors won't.

But going back to what Dan and I talked about a moment ago, the ability of our people in the field to be able to go out and find product independently to fill in gaps that we may have as our traditional supply chain is perhaps a little tight, I think that, that is an advantage to our business. It was an advantage last year, as Dan talked about. I mean a lot of the customers that we source and things like that, there was a local element to that.
I think it will be an advantage this year just because right now, what our customers are concerned about as demand goes up is having a product available and the flexibility in our business and in our model, I think that's going to provide us an advantage when making sure that service levels remain high and availability remains high, that I think it's going to give us market share.

But what it really is, is think of a kanban system. And in that kanban system, right now, what you have is somebody has to physically go out and observe empty bins or gather the empty bins.
What really changes in an RFID environment is when that bin is empty, there's a -- think of it as a set of shelves and up above, there's this open box. And you put the bin up there and there's an RFID tag that reads it and it tells our branch. It actually tells our supply chain team, we need to replenish this bin. And so the biggest thing is the labor efficiency. But it also allows us to illuminate much more of the supply chain for the customer so they can really see it and can operate a little bit leaner and we can reduce the inventory.
I believe the inventory lean-up for our customer will fund the capital it takes for the actual devices because the only thing that's really changing is the technology enablement. The bins are the bins. They were there before. You have an RFID tag on them. So the capital piece is relatively modest, except for the actual communication talking, but the economics are better than betting.

Could you maybe expand on what you're seeing in the negotiations that led you to reduce the full year signings outlook?

So if you recall, last quarter, what we said is we talked about a 375 to 400 because we wanted to convey to people that we believe that's what the market can support.

So if you recall, last quarter, what we said is we talked about a 375 to 400 because we wanted to convey to people that we believe that's what the market can support. And we continue to believe that's what the market can support, but we also said at the time that business conditions would have to meaningfully improve in order for us to achieve that.
And whereas I do believe that business conditions have improved, they haven't normalized to where they were pre pandemic at this point. And the fact is in Q1, we landed 68. And so to be on the type of pace that we would have to do to do closer to 400, given that we've booked 68 in quarter 1, it just seems like a stretch when the conditions haven't fully normalized from where we were before, right? That's the one area that I believe is still being affected by COVID-related accommodations.
So given that, I think that it was worth -- I mean, I think we sort of, I think, gave indication that this seemed like a high potential scenario when we talked last quarter, and it just seemed like a prudent thing to do. Now note, we've kind of said the same thing about FMI this quarter, right? We believe that the market can support 23,000 to 25,000 weighted FMI devices. But we're going to need to see the activity levels continue to improve even from where it was Q1 to get there. Right now, we're probably pacing a little bit low.
But I think the important thing to just reiterate is, I don't think this has anything to do with the receptivity of the tools that we're providing in the marketplace. I don't believe that there's any belief on the part of our organization that we can't achieve those levels. But the environment is still normalizing. It's not there yet. And as a result, we may come in a little bit shorter, but the trend line is up."

When I was reading through Holden's flip book, I saw that he had put in that sentence about the 300 to 350 range. There are certain times I go into Holden and I tell him I disagree with him and certain times, I tell him I agree with him. So this is one where I don't know that I agree with him. He's probably right, but I don't know if I agree with him.
And that is -- I think if you look at first quarter, I believe 29 of our 68 signings were in the month of March. So it did tick up as we went through the quarter. Now that's not an unusual pattern because January is usually tentative and February was weaker because of the storm, as you mentioned. I think the risk of signings this year is more about customers really being busy and they just can't think about it right now. They just can't do it right now. And I think that's the risk of it not getting to that 100 per quarter pace. And that's the only reason I didn't ask Holden to remove that sentence from both the earnings release and the flip book.
Otherwise, I'd ask him to remove it because I think the model is great. I think the market is receptive to it. And I think we could ramp up faster, but there is that one risk that people are too busy to let it happen because change always takes energy and where do you want to prioritize your energy. But I'm not completely in agreement with Holden on this one, but he's -- if I were a betting person, he's probably more right. But my message to our team internally is there's no reason why in the second half of the year, we shouldn't be at 100 a quarter. And the question is can we get there in the month of -- or in the second quarter? And I'll happily be wrong."

And as it does, I would expect the hub inventories to rise. I'm not sure that we've necessarily put a number to that. And I think a lot of it's going to depend on the degree to which demand continues to run the way that it is.
So -- but I do believe that we're light on inventory in the hubs. As inflation continues to run through, I think that will put some upward pressure on values of inventory as well. So I'm not sure I have a good answer for you in terms of what the ultimate number is. But that's part of the answer to addressing what we're seeing in the supply chain and improving our service levels.
But right now, we're a little bit low on inventory, we're a little bit low on fulfillment levels and we need to correct that. And in Q1, it would have required $15 million more, and I think that builds a little bit as you get into Q2 and the supply chain pressures build. Now that will be offset to some degree with the work that we're doing internally to take out slow- and no-moving inventory, in terms of reducing the branch count, which the field continues to take some of the branches out, that makes sense to them.
Those sort -- I think when we talk a little bit about the customer fulfillment center, which is a form of branch, which has much more customized and tailored inventory, those are all initiatives that I think are very sustainable. We'll continue to mitigate the effects of supply chain over the course of the year. But right now, our inventory would be better off in having a little bit more in it than it does, and that's going to motivate our work on improving the supply chain."

I mean we all know that we have a relatively easy comp on gross margin in 2Q. And so I haven't really tried to think about it in terms of year-over-year rate of change. I think if you take the first quarter gross margin, you adjust for the write-down, which is our intention is that, that will be focused on 1Q '21 and be done. Adjust for that, you're looking at a first quarter margin about 45.9%.
If I move over to 2Q, normally, second quarter would see a little bit of a decline sequentially from Q1. I think that, that could come in somewhere around flattish. And part of the reason is the mix that you're talking about. Interestingly enough, right now, the fastener/nonfastener mix is normalizing faster than the Onsite/non-Onsite mixes.
And so that actually moderated the impact of mix in Q1, and we'll see how that plays out in Q2 but it's possible that could be a little bit moderate as well. And I think that contributes to that. And of course, assuming we're effective on pricing, that can contribute as well. So when I think about the second quarter gross margins, I think it gets really messy to think about it year-over-year when we can kind of think about sequential patterns and try to run off of that.
And I guess, I think -- when I think about Q2, instead of thinking about it in terms of the normal 20-basis-point decline, I think that, that could actually run a little bit more flattish. And that would obviously be a meaningful increase year-over-year but that's just a comp issue. Does that help?"

So you talked about kind of flattish to maybe down a little bit in 2Q. But if everything went your way, is there really capacity to grow a lot faster? I mean, I guess I'm thinking back to some of the weather interruptions in 2Q and those customers not being able to make up days immediately. Is that something that's sort of governed on the upside here, at least in the short term until some of the supply chain stuff works out?"

And -- but you saw a lot of that. You had good plants that where there was no electricity and they weren't operating. And you had pipes freezing. You had hundreds and thousands of feet of pipes being replaced in a lot of facilities because they froze and they broke.

What I would say is we continue to grow as a business, and I think if you look at industrial production and things of that nature, I don't think that you're seeing that grow. There are some surveys that are done out there. And certainly through February, those surveys were still pointing to distribution being negative. Industrial production was still slightly negative. We were growing. So I think those are the ways that I usually look at it to judge or understand the degree to which we are gaining market share.

Similar to the last 5 quarters, we're just going to start with a few stats on our COVID experience. So to date, we've had 1,950 cases of COVID-19 among our employee base. So about 9.5% of our employees have contracted the virus over the last 5 quarters. Looking at it from a pattern standpoint and as we've discussed in previous quarters, our worst quarter was the fourth quarter of 2020 -- November of 2020 was our worst month. But in the fourth quarter, we averaged about 60 cases per week. In the first quarter of 2021, that dropped to 44. In the second quarter, that dropped to 20 cases per week, and I'm pleased to say, in the month of June, we averaged 8 cases per week. They had about 30 cases throughout the company. So very good patterns. Not unlike what we're seeing, generally speaking, in society, especially in the countries in which the bulk of our employees are located.
If I -- one of the things that should jump out at a reader of our earnings release or in some of the commentary, one of the struggles that we are seeing that is not unique to Fastenal. I suspect most companies will cite this is a difficulty in the hiring on the addition of people as we're reemerging from the shutdown economy of 2020 and the first part of '21. And there's, I think, 3 distinct subsets that drive it, at least in our case. As you all know, historically, we are a promotion with in culture, and we believe in starting early in a person's career on that promote within culture. And we hire a lot of partner employees. And those partner employees, a very high percentage of those employees or full-time students. And we think of it as -- in most cases, in a perfect world, you're not hiring a part-time employee, you're hiring a future full-time employee. And we provide a tremendous amount of flexibility to folks earlier in their career. We focus very acutely on 4-year state colleges, and 2-year technical colleges. And so in a period where schools are closed and people are studying remotely, a big chunk of our recruiting base has vaporized from the areas that we traditionally approach, and that has created some challenges for us. I'm pleased to say those challenges have lessened over time, but they're still pretty acute.
A fair number of our part-time employees, especially in our distribution centers. A lot of them, we represent a second job. I heard an example the other day of individual that had pulled back their hours with us because they hold a second job because they have a child and college. It's a great way to earn extra money. We're incredibly flexible with employees on scheduling. But their employer has gone to mandatory overtime and so they just don't have the hours to work for us. So that's creating some challenges.
The third, and this is more across when I think of generally speaking, our branch and Onsite network. We are seeing some geographic biases in the numbers as far as country by country and state by state in the United States, depending on how open or close the society is, what impediments there are to hiring from the standpoint of public policy. We are seeing some patterns there. We are seeing no meaningful pattern from a ratio perspective of hiring. The progress we've made over the last decade, we continue to see that throughout the business.
Where we have seen a stark weakness, and I talked about this in our April Annual Meeting is on the gender side. We've seen the application side of the business during 2020, and this has continued in 2021. Our female applications are down about 1/3 from what we've seen in recent years. And we've seen worse than historical patterns as far as turnover. In an environment where society is shut down and a lot of schools and daycares closed, we've seen a dramatic impact, and that's fallen largely on the female portion of our employee base and our potential employee base, and we're making efforts to improve that, but they're difficult. And -- but with that, I'll switch over to the flipbook.
Sales to manufacturing and construction customers grew 21.5% in the second quarter. There was, as expected, a fall off in the pandemic-related sales, frankly a good thing and -- which resulted in an overall flat sales performance from a year-over-year basis. I believe we continue to manage costs really well. I'm so impressed with the team throughout Fastenal and our ability to manage expenses well. We did have some resets and Holden talks to that in the earnings release. Branch and on-site, our incentive comp, there's a reset going on there because a year ago, a lot of customers were idled or shut down. And a lot of our surge business was direct container shipments or not container ship, excuse me, direct pallet and truckload shipments. And so it was a different cost structure. So I'm pleased to say our branch and on-site business is coming back in a resounding fashion, and we're paying people for that.
We're also seeing an incredible reset in the health care. I believe health care expenses were up about 25% this quarter. And that's really a function of -- we're self-insured when it comes to health care. People weren't using it a year ago. They're using it now. So we're seeing a reset there. Where we're seeing some partial resets on things like travel. In the -- our airfare was up about tenfold from second quarter 2020, the second quarter 2021. Now before you read anything into that, that that's meaningful, we're still 82% below where we were in 2019. We don't know ultimately where that number settles on. The number I've challenged our team with is with some of the technology tools we have in our -- and some cultural changes as far as working from a distance and communicating from a distance. I do believe that 30% to 40% reduction is an achievable number. And time will tell if that -- if I'm correct or I'm full of it. But I believe it's something that will be achievable. Right now, we're about 80% down.
Price actions to date have largely matched cost increases. There's a ton of inflation going on. There's inflation because of disruption and shipping, i.e., the cost of moving a container and this is pretty public information, so I don't need to cite figures, but it's gotten really expensive to move a container across the ocean. And it takes a longer time than it did 12 and 18 and 24 months ago because of all the congestion at the ports. And so massive inflation going on. We've been largely able to move with that. The higher gross margin we experienced is really about product mix. The fact that the organization is moving more product and more stuff going through our manufacturing. There's a utilization of the corporate overhead organizational leverage going on. And within the safety product category, there's a meaningful shift in customer mix. And when you're shipping truckloads of product versus pieces of product, the gross margin profile is different, and we're seeing that play through in the numbers.
The final point talks and I see the team put it in here a few times, the conversation, I think it's on both pages, about our digital footprint. I guess they want to make sure they screw up and miss it. But if you think about the digital footprint we're talking about, so about 42% of our sales are part of what we call our digital footprint. It starts with FMI. In FMI, there's a device component and there's a mobility component. The device component is our vending machines that we've talked about for the last decade. It also includes in growing importance over the last 12 to 15 months, our digitally enhanced, our technology-enhanced bins where the bins tell us when they're hungry, just like the vending machine tells us when its hungry needs to be fed. And so about or so, 21% or so -- 22% of our business is going through one of those devices.
Another about 10% is going through what we call FASTStock, and that's where the mobility that we've deployed. We're out there scanning bins. And that's really about a productivity play in the short term, but I believe an ability to grow faster in the long term. And on Page 7 -- excuse me, Page 4 in the earnings release, Holden has a great table in there that lays out the FMI pieces, the devices as well as the FASTStock.
The third piece is looking at e-com, and that's growing quite dramatically, and I'll touch on more of that in a second. But about 10% of that is outside the FMI world. So you add those 3 pieces together, about 42% of our sales is now digitally connected. And the vast majority of that is where it's FMI and the importance of FMI, the goal should be an easier way to order. The goal should be if it's recurring business, why the heck are you ordering it? And why don't you have a partner that supplies it when you need it? And that's what we endeavor to be, a great supply chain partner for our customers.
Flipping to Page 4 of the book, pleased to say our Onsite signings ticked up again in the second quarter of '21. We had 87 signings. That's our best quarter since COVID started. And -- of equal importance, it's about participation, how many of our district business units are signing and Onsite. We had 30% of our district business units signed an Onsite. We haven't been north of 30% since the first quarter of in 2020. So not only are the numbers strong, it's broadly dispersed across our business, so there's great participation. We ended the quarter with 1,323 active sites just over 9% increase from second quarter last year. And our daily sales in the Onsite business grew just over 25%. So very, very strong performance there, and it's improving. And that builds upon our ability to engage with our customers and grow the business long term.
FMI, I touched on that yesterday -- or excuse me on the last slide, and I did touch on it yesterday with the board, it's a different matter. There's 5,843 devices. That's a weighted number signed in the second quarter. That's 91 per day. Similar to Onsite, a nice improving strong performance. Our ending installed base was up just over 9% from June of last year. And if you look at it, and I'm going to flip to some points on that table on Page 4 of the earnings release. So sales through the devices are up 40.4%. Sales through FASTStock is up 148%. And you combine the 2 together, FMI grew 61.4%. Really excited about what we have going there as far as momentum. E-commerce, 53% increase large customer-oriented EDI was up 51%. That's about the economy. That's about strengthening of our existing customer base, and we're seeing it happen to play out right there.
When I look at web sales being up 61%, that's about habits changing. That's about how our customers are engaging with us. So 2 dynamics going on, both very positive from the standpoint of how our customer is engaging with us and how is our underlying customer doing starts business.
I'm going to skip the digital footprint since I covered that pretty thoroughly already. And flipping to Page 5, this is a new table. I believe Holden plan to have it in here in this quarter. I suspect next quarter, maybe fourth quarter, but -- it's really doing a quick snapshot of understanding if we ignore the noise of COVID-19 for a second and just say, what did our business do in the second quarter of 2019, what did it do in the second quarter of 2021? Some things that stand out. Our margin is down about 40 basis points in that period. And that's about the shift that we've talked about in prior quarters of our business to a more of an on-site. A higher proportion of our business being on site, where it's a larger customer, larger transaction, better expense leverage. And you see that expense leverage play out in the operating administrative expenses being down 140 basis points in that same time period. So our operating income is up 100 basis points.
Pleased to say we had great incremental margin of about 31% in that time frame. And with that -- and we generated good cash.
With that, I'll turn it over to Holden."

As Dan indicated, our sales were basically flat in the second quarter of 2021 and I think everybody understands the dynamics at play here, about $350 million to $360 million in surge business from last year did",1366,"Great. Thanks, Dan. Now turning to Slide 6. As Dan indicated, our sales were basically flat in the second quarter of 2021 and I think everybody understands the dynamics at play here, about $350 million to $360 million in surge business from last year did not repeat, and that was offset by a significant rebound in demand from our traditional manufacturing construction customers and to a lesser degree, new sales to customers that had never bought from Fastenal prior to the pandemic. Our fastener products grew 28.4% and best represent the strength of our underlying business conditions. If we were to adjust out the impact of surge sales, we believe that safety and other products would have grown at a level that's comparable to our fastener growth.
Manufacturing and particularly heavy manufacturing, is exhibiting broad strength. And in the case of both manufacturing and nonresidential construction, sequential quarterly growth in the period exceeded historical norms. Combined with access to customers that is approaching prepandemic levels, as evidenced by our improved on-site and FMI signings in the second quarter of 2021, our outlook remains positive.
It's also worth highlighting that while government sales were down 63% in the second quarter of 2021, they were up 37% versus the second quarter of 2019. And we had similar dynamics play out with certain large customers. We continue to believe that we gained market share during the pandemic.
Now to Slide 7. Operating margin in the second quarter of 2021 was 21.1%, up 20 basis points. Gross margin was 46.5% in the second quarter of 2021, up 200 basis points versus the second quarter of 2020. Our safety product margin improved on a combination of mix as lower-margin COVID affected PPE mix retreated to prepandemic levels and a recovery in pricing as the market has normalized. We leveraged overhead costs on an improvement in volumes and favorable rebates, which is a combination of lower rebates to certain customers that were heavy surge buyers in 2020 and our own purchasing of key products improving versus 2020. Product mix, specifically growth of fasteners versus non-fasteners, was also a significant contributor to the growth and was a significant factor in gross margin outperforming our expectations for the period.
Our pricing actions largely match inflation we are seeing in the marketplace and price cost did not meaningfully affect gross margin in the second quarter of 2021. The increase in gross margin was partly offset by operating expenses growing faster than sales. In the second quarter of 2020, in response to the onset of the pandemic, we took certain proactive steps to reduce costs. Certain costs naturally declined in result of the weak business and a large portion of our surge sales went direct as opposed to through our branches, which is a very low labor intensity source of revenue.
In response to improving conditions in the second quarter of 2021, these situations reversed. Our headcount remains under control, but is appropriately ticking up as demand recovers at our branches. Further, incentive compensation was up almost 20% and health care costs were up 25%. Travel expenses are growing strongly off very easy comparisons as the economy fully opens. Fuel costs are rising sharply. As we indicated last quarter, deleveraging operating expenses in the second quarter of 2021 is a function of anniversary-ing the first period of pandemic-related cost savings measures, combined with a strongly recovering marketplace. Setting aside these upticks, however, we believe the organization continues to manage costs well. If you put it all together, we reported second quarter 2021 earnings per share of $0.42, which is flat versus $0.42 in the first quarter -- I'm sorry, the second quarter of 2020.
Now turning to Slide 8. Operating cash flow was $172 million in the second quarter of 2021. This is down 32% annually and was 71.5% of net income. Now recall that in the second quarter of 2020, pandemic-related legislation allowed us to defer 2 tax payments into the third quarter of 2020. That deferral was not available to us in the second quarter of 2021, and we made those 2 payments as we historically have. The better way to think about cash generation is by considering that in the 5 years from 2015 to 2019, our second quarter cash conversion averaged 63.5%. Against this, we were pleased with our cash generation in the second quarter.
Year-over-year, accounts receivable was up 3.1%. Though sales were flattish, the shift away from PPE surge buyers last year and toward traditional buyers this year blended up our days outstanding. Inventory was down 5.3%, and there's a lot of moving pieces here. A part of this is due to the difficulty in getting sufficient imported products, although our hub inventory deficit has not widened meaningfully versus where it was in the first quarter of 2021 as we are finding domestic sources of product. However, the decrease also reflects deliberate efforts to clean out slow-moving hub and branch inventory, branch closures and the shift in our stocking focus in the field. We believe these represent improvements in our working capital that will be sustained.
Net capital spending in the second quarter of 2021 was $32 million, down from $38 million in the first quarter of 2020. This was largely from lower FMI hardware spend, which is a product of lower signings over the past 12 months and greater refurbishment of FMI equipment. Our 2021 net capital spending range is unchanged at $170 million to $200 million, and we're tracking in the lower half of this range at this time.
We returned cash to shareholders in the quarter in the form of $161 million in dividend. And from a liquidity standpoint, we finished the second quarter with net debt at 2.5% of total capital, down from 6.4% in the year ago period and 5.1% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Essentially, all of our revolver remains available for use.
Now before moving to Q&A, I wanted to update a few subjects of current interest. First, we continue to experience significant cost inflation, particularly for steel, fuel and transportation. In the second quarter of 2021, price contributed 80 to 110 basis points to growth. This largely tracked our increase in costs and the impact of price cost on margin was immaterial. Cost pressures remain high, however, which will require us to institute further material price actions in the period. The marketplace is still receptive to price actions and the tools and processes we have developed have been effective. Even so, given the rate of inflation, maintaining price cost parity will be a bigger challenge in the third quarter of 2020.
Global supply chains remain tight. We have managed this well domestically, which has allowed our customer service levels to remain high as a result of spot buys, which do tend to carry a lower margin and inventory in certain areas to build to meet projected future needs. Internationally, there continues to be a shortage of capacity, which has made moving products, particularly fasteners, increasingly costly and sustained long lead times. We believe this dynamic could persist at its current level of intensity through 2021.
Now Dan commented earlier on the labor shortages in most of our business. We have largely managed this to this point. However, we are beginning to see those pressures be reflected in our labor costs and the increase in on-site signings and implementations could introduce some additional strains there. However, recognize a few things. First, this is all partly a by-product of strong demand and happens to some degree with every cycle. Strong growth will allow leverage of other costs that will help us to mitigate these pressures.
Second, much of what we're doing with our digital footprint and the change in our branch model will address many of these matters. Third, none of these pressures are unique to Fastenal, but we believe that our culture and our structure is uniquely geared to navigate them. We've seen -- we have seen no moderation in these pressures over the past 3 months, but we continue to believe that we'll gain share through them.
That is all for our formal presentation. So with that, operator, we'll take questions."

And if vending is a little over 20% of our revenue, you can see it's a relatively small piece, it's touching. So I don't want to overbuild what LIFT is in the short term, we're really excited about it in the longer term. And so that's one element. So the CFC, so the fulfillment center type branch. So we have 2 branch types. And I'm generally speaking, talking about our U.S. business in this commentary. When we go outside the U.S., there's some nuance to it, but I don't want to muddy the conversation with that. In the U.S., in the metro areas about 70% of our branches now are a fulfillment center. And all that means is we're not -- we might have limited hours that were -- that the front door is open. And part of this spring out of COVID. We found that, that wasn't horribly disruptive to our customer because every customer has a cell phone. Every customer has Internet access. So saying to our customer, ""Hey, call us when you're come in or order electronically, we'll be ready for you. And the door is going to be locked when you get here, we'll let you in. because most of our business is recurring customers, business-to-business relationships. And that's just the way the branch operates. We -- the front showroom has been contracted down. I guess, that's redundant, contracted. And so there's a small footprint, you walk into if the front door is open or you pick it up at a locker of the front door is closed or you call and we let you in. That's just a branch.
Separate to that branch setup. And then the other 30% in metro areas would be the traditional service branch that you've visited over the years. The only event changes when you get up to the metros, the mix is a little bit different. It's about 60-40. But separate from the branch facility is this LIFT. Now the LIFT might be adjacent to a distribution center. It might be completely independent of the distribution center. And that's just a very focused distribution center that's picking not a pallet of product for a branch delivery. It's picking a total product for a customer vending machine delivery and it's removing that labor that's relatively inefficient at the branch and putting it into a LIFT where it's much more efficient. We can bring some automation to it. We bring scale to it. And over time, that will become a bigger and bigger piece of our vending business. And the real question is, can we do some of those same things for our FASTStock? Because highly repetitive transactions. You can bring scale to those transactions for the branch network and be more efficient. Does that help?"

And I've always said that I feel like if you achieve price/cost parity anytime within a quarter ahead to 2 quarters behind, that's kind of what the business supports, and I still believe that's true. But there's always timing involved when cost is trending. And that's the situation that we have today. We've gone to the marketplace for different purposes a couple of times, done at least 1 large increase earlier in the second quarter. And that was received fairly well. But based on what cost is doing, we'll have to go to the market with some additional ones. To this point, we continue to hear from the field that customers are still so busy and receiving it from so many areas that it's not been a huge bone of contention. But there are timing issues around cost and around contracts that we navigate every cycle, and we'll navigate this one too."

And so what we're essentially trying to time to think through is how much labor are we putting into 80% of our accounts that represents 4% of our revenues. And when we think about the development of e-commerce, and you see in this quarter, our e-commerce -- our web sales of e-commerce were up north of 60%. That wasn't entirely because of our conversations with these smaller customers about how we can service them to that model, but a part of it was certainly because of that. So we don't view it as walking away from a lot of revenues. We view it as aligning the best way to service different groups of customers within our branch in a way that, in turn, frees up time for our people to sell. So much like the question earlier, we created a LIFT program to free up time for our people to sell to customers that are really going to move the needle. The things that we're doing in the branch is really intended to do very much the same thing.
And what I'll tell you is I'm not sure this model is a whole lot different from what we did 15 years ago. So it's a bit of a evolution towards that, if you will. So you asked what we're giving up. This just seems like a refinement in the model to focus on key accounts that can really move the needle and free up a lot of time for talented salespeople to go after those accounts. And we think that makes us grow faster."

And that plan involves know who your larger opportunities are in the marketplace and make sure you're engaging with those customers.

And that means when some things ordered electronically and it's a smaller customer, serve the heck out of that customer, meet that customer where it works for both parties. And that means if somebody orders it, if it's in the branch, it's ready for them in a short lender of time for them to come in and pick it up. If it's something that's not in the brand and it's in the distribution center, we get it in the next morning, and it's in a locker at 7:00 in the morning. And -- or it's ready for the customer to pick up in the branch at 7:00 in the morning. So you're very mindful of what is your plan because the bulk of the dollar opportunity is coming from the larger opportunities in the market. That's just bad. But you want a nice mix to your business because it helps you be a great partner to a wide range of customers. And we can be a special business because we can fulfill transactions faster than our industry because of our local stocking and our captive distribution network. We have a better cost structure to our industry. We have a better fulfillment cycle to our industry, and it's incredibly reliable. And we have that local team that can react to the unexpected.

A pace of 100 is probably a little bit more than we might have expected. Why that is, I'm not sure. Now each quarter, we -- again, we go through why we're seeing closings. And what we take out of that is the large majority of those closings continue to either be a plant being shut in the volume going elsewhere or going to a different geography or simply a decision on the part of somebody at Fastenal to say -- this isn't actually working out as an Onsite. We think we can service this just as well, if not better, at a branch, and we're going to take it back there and do it that way. And that continues to be the vast majority of the closures that we see as opposed to those fewer cases where we've lost the business, which does happen, but it's the minority of those closures. So in the case of the first, there's not much we can do about plants moving, right? In the case of the second, we're making a business decision. And I can't tell you it's a bad decision. In the case of the third, that happens. Every now and again, you lose a piece of business. But for the most part, what we're not seeing is our competitive moat around Onsite get degraded, and that's why we're seeing closings. We just haven't seen any indication of that.

Obviously, the cost of fuel, not a big expense, but continues to go up. If you think about the fill-in buys that Dan referred to earlier. Those are going to continue to be at a fairly high clip. If we think about price cost being a wildcard, I don't think that our second quarter is going to be 46.5%. I would not be surprised to see it taper off from that level. But where that goes order me -- I'm sorry, what did I say? Second, sorry, third quarter. Yes, I fully expect second quarter to 46.5%. I don't expect third quarter to be at that level. I think that there's just forces in the marketplace that are going to work against that before you talk about price cost. And then there's the wild card about our level of achievement on price cost.

No, it's not more challenging. There's ample opportunity out there. What is challenging is in the last 15, 16, 17 months of the proposition of talking to a customer moving in with them when they want to be distanced from everybody on the planet. Imagine having an apartment, you're bringing in a roommate. It's kind of the same concept. You don't want to be around people. And that's changing. And so that's seeing that expand. Some things that -- if you think about vending, which we've been doing now for 13 -- going on 13 years. When vending really took off for us in that latter part of 2011, 2012 standpoint. In the following year, we were pulling out 25%, 28% of the devices that we've installed because some of them are just bad. And we didn't know -- we didn't really know what we were doing yet because we were creating an industry. And then that went to 22%. And then it went to 18%. And then as our participation and our knowledge base across the organization improved, today, 13 years later, we remove every year about 12% of our devices. We think we can get that to 10 with our LIFT strategy and some of the things we're doing to make it a little bit easier to to serve FMI devices. But we think we can get that to 10%, but it's still 10%.
The real question is what is that natural number for Onsite. And 5 years into a really hard push. Unfortunately, a year plus of that 5 years is COVID. And so I don't know that we know what that number is. Now we do know that about half the Onsites that we close are because the customer moved the facility or closed down the facility. And the other half are -- we pull some back. We lose some business. There's a number of dynamics. There are some where we grow it from 30 to 60, and we get stuck at 60. And as Holden mentioned a few minutes ago, we just moved back to the branch because it's more efficient for everybody or the customer kicks us out because they're out of room. And I don't like on-site closures, but I know -- and I don't like FMI devices coming back, but I know it's part of the business. And the real question is, can we, as an organization, over time, outgrow our industry and gain market share more efficiently, more productively and maybe redundant quicker than everybody else, so we can do that with Onsite and FMI devices and all the things we're doing. I love the business."

And so when you think about the closure rate, think about cut it in half because a bunch of the business, we're still maintaining. And then as Dan indicated, there's some historical precedent here with vending. We ran hard and fast to sort of get into the marketplace. We learned a lot. And as we learned a lot, we sort of cleaned up some things that maybe we did when we were early on in the initiative and then we were smarter and more efficient coming out of it.

It might be higher because people are much more conscious about safety today than about wearing a mask or wearing gloves or doing anything. People are better about washing their damn hands today than they were 1.5 years ago. And so to that extent, you might have fewer people and more consumption because everybody is saying, do this, do this, do this, and yet more conscious to it."

Similar to the last 5 quarters, we're just going to start with a few stats on our COVID experience. So to date, we've had 1,950 cases of COVID-19 among our employee base. So about 9.5% of our employees have contracted the virus over the last 5 quarters. Looking at it from a pattern standpoint and as we've discussed in previous quarters, our worst quarter was the fourth quarter of 2020 -- November of 2020 was our worst month. But in the fourth quarter, we averaged about 60 cases per week. In the first quarter of 2021, that dropped to 44. In the second quarter, that dropped to 20 cases per week, and I'm pleased to say, in the month of June, we averaged 8 cases per week. They had about 30 cases throughout the company. So very good patterns. Not unlike what we're seeing, generally speaking, in society, especially in the countries in which the bulk of our employees are located. 
If I -- one of the things that should jump out at a reader of our earnings release or in some of the commentary, one of the struggles that we are seeing that is not unique to Fastenal, I suspect most companies will cite this, is a difficulty in the hiring on the addition of people as we're reemerging from the shutdown economy of 2020 and the first part of 2021. And there's, I think, 3 distinct subsets that drive it, at least in our case. 
As you all know, historically, we are a promote-from-within culture, and we believe in starting early on a person's career on that promote-from-within culture. And we hire a lot of part-time employees. And those part-time employees, a very high percentage of those employees are full-time students. And we think of it as -- in most cases, in a perfect world, you're not hiring a part-time employee, you're hiring a future full-time employee. 
And we provide a tremendous amount of flexibility to folks earlier in their career. We focus very acutely on 4-year state colleges, and 2-year technical colleges. And so in a period where schools are closed and people are studying remotely, a big chunk of our recruiting base has vaporized from the areas that we traditionally approach, and that has created some challenges for us. I'm pleased to say those challenges have lessened over time, but they're still pretty acute. 
A fair number of our part-time employees, especially in our distribution centers, a lot of them, we represent a second job. I heard an example the other day of individuals that had pulled back their hours with us because they hold a second job because they have a child and college. It's a great way to earn extra money. We're incredibly flexible with employees on scheduling. But their employer has gone to mandatory overtime and so they just don't have the hours to work for us. So that's creating some challenges. 
The third -- and this is more across when I think of generally speaking, our branch and Onsite network. We are seeing some geographic biases in the numbers as far as country by country and state by state in the United States, depending on how open or close the society is, what impediments there are to hiring from the standpoint of public policy. We are seeing some patterns there. We are seeing no meaningful pattern from a racial perspective of hiring. The progress we've made over the last decade, we continue to see that throughout the business. 
Where we have seen a stark weakness, and I talked about this in our April Annual Meeting is on the gender side. We've seen the application side of the business during 2020, and this has continued in 2021, our female applications are down about 1/3 from what we've seen in recent years. And we've seen worse than historical patterns as far as turnover. In an environment where society is shut down and a lot of schools and daycares closed, we've seen a dramatic impact, and that's fallen largely on the female portion of our employee base and our potential employee base, and we're making efforts to improve that, but they're difficult. And -- but with that, I'll switch over to the flipbook. 
Sales to manufacturing and construction customers grew 21.5% in the second quarter. There was, as expected, a fall off in the pandemic-related sales, frankly a good thing and -- which resulted in an overall flat sales performance from a year-over-year basis. I believe we continue to manage costs really well. I'm so impressed with the team throughout Fastenal and our ability to manage expenses well. We did have some resets and Holden talks to that in the earnings release. Branch and Onsite, our incentive comp, there's a reset going on there because a year ago, a lot of customers were idled or shut down. And a lot of our surge business was direct container shipments  or -- not container ship, excuse me, direct pallet and truckload shipments. And so it was a different cost structure. So I'm pleased to say our branch and Onsite business is coming back in a resounding fashion, and we're paying people for that. 
We're also seeing an incredible reset in the health care. I believe health care expenses were up about 25% this quarter. And that's really a function of -- we're self-insured when it comes to health care. People weren't using it a year ago. They're using it now. So we're seeing a reset there. Where we're seeing some partial resets on things like travel. In the -- our airfare was up about tenfold from second quarter 2020 to second quarter 2021. Now before you read anything into that, that that's meaningful, we're still 82% below where we were in 2019. We don't know ultimately where that number settles on. The number I've challenged our team with is with some of the technology tools we have in our -- and some cultural changes as far as working from a distance and communicating from a distance, I do believe that 30% to 40% reduction is an achievable number. And time will tell if that -- if I'm correct or I'm full of it. But I believe it's something that will be achievable. Right now, we're about 80% down. 
Price actions to date have largely matched cost increases. There's a ton of inflation going on. There's inflation because of disruption and shipping, i.e., the cost of moving a container and this is pretty public information, so I don't need to cite figures, but it's gotten really expensive to move a container across the ocean. And it takes a longer time than it did 12 and 18 and 24 months ago because of all the congestion at the ports. And so massive inflation going on. We've been largely able to move with that. The higher gross margin we experienced is really about product mix. The fact that the organization is moving more product and more stuff going through our manufacturing. There's a utilization of the corporate overhead organizational leverage going on. And within the safety product category, there's a meaningful shift in customer mix. And when you're shipping truckloads of product versus pieces of product, the gross margin profile is different, and we're seeing that play through in the numbers. 
The final point talks -- and I see the team put it in here a few times, the conversation, I think it's on both pages, about our digital footprint. I guess they want to make sure Dan don't screw up and miss it. But if you think about the digital footprint we're talking about, so about 42% of our sales are part of what we call our digital footprint. It starts with FMI. And in FMI, there's a device component and there's a mobility component. The device component is our vending machines that we've talked about for the last decade. It also includes in growing importance over the last 12 to 15 months, our digitally enhanced, our technology-enhanced bins where the bins tell us when they're hungry, just like the vending machine tells us when its hungry and needs to be fed. And so about 21% or so -- 22% of our business is going through one of those devices. 
Another about 10% is going through what we call FAST Stock, and that's where -- the mobility that we've deployed, we're out there scanning bins. And that's really about a productivity play in the short term, but I believe an ability to grow faster in the long term. And on Page 7 -- excuse me, Page 4 in the earnings release, Holden has a great table in there that lays out the FMI pieces, the devices as well as the FAST Stock. 
The third piece is looking at e-com, and that's growing quite dramatically, and I'll touch on more of that in a second. But about 10% of that is outside the FMI world. So you add those 3 pieces together, about 42% of our sales is now digitally connected. And the vast majority of that is where it's FMI and the importance of FMI, the goal shouldn't be an easier way to order. The goal should be if it's recurring business, why the heck are you ordering it? And why don't you have a partner that supplies it when you need it? And that's what we endeavor to be, a great supply chain partner for our customers. 
Flipping to Page 4 of the book, pleased to say our Onsite signings ticked up again in the second quarter of '21. We had 87 signings. That's our best quarter since COVID started. And of equal importance, it's about participation, how many of our district business units are signing in Onsite. We had 30% of our district business units sign an Onsite. We haven't been north of 30% since the first quarter of in 2020. So not only are the numbers strong, it's broadly dispersed across our business, so there's great participation. We ended the quarter with 1,323 active sites, just over 9% increase from second quarter last year. And our daily sales in the Onsite business grew just over 25%. So very, very strong performance there, and it's improving. And that builds upon our ability to engage with our customers and grow the business long term. 
FMI, I touched on that yesterday -- or excuse me, on the last slide, and I did touch on it yesterday with the board. That's a different matter. There's 5,843 devices. That's a weighted number signed in the second quarter. That's 91 per day. Similar to Onsite, a nice improving strong performance. Our ending installed base was up just over 9% from June of last year. And if you look at it, and I'm going to flip to some points on that table on Page 4 of the earnings release. So sales through the devices are up 40.4%. Sales through FAST Stock is up 148%. And you combine the 2 together, FMI grew 61.4%. Really excited about what we have going there as far as momentum. E-commerce, 53% increase. Large customer-oriented EDI was up 51%. That's about the economy. That's about strengthening of our existing customer base, and we're seeing it happen play out right there.
When I look at web sales being up 61%, that's about habits changing. That's about how our customers are engaging with us. So 2 dynamics going on, both very positive from the standpoint of how our customer is engaging with us and how is our underlying customer doing starts business.
I'm going to skip the digital footprint since I covered that pretty thoroughly already. And flipping to Page 5, this is a new table. I believe Holden plans to have it in here in this quarter. I suspect next quarter, maybe fourth quarter, but -- it's really doing a quick snapshot of understanding if we ignore the noise of COVID-19 for a second and just say, what did our business do in the second quarter of 2019, what did it do in the second quarter of 2021, some things that stand out. Our margin is down about 40 basis points in that period. And that's about the shift that we've talked about in prior quarters of our business to more of an Onsite. A higher proportion of our business being Onsite, where it's a larger customer, larger transaction, better expense leverage. And you see that expense leverage play out in the operating administrative expenses being down 140 basis points in that same time period. So our operating income is up 100 basis points.
Pleased to say we had great incremental margin of about 31% in that time frame. And with that -- and we generated good cash.
With that, I'll turn it over to Holden."

As indicated, our sales were basically flat in the second quarter of 2021. I think everybody understands the dynamics at play here, about $350 million to $360 million in surge business from last year did not repeat, and that was offset by a significant rebound in demand from our traditional manufacturing construction customers and to a lesser degree, new sales to customers that had never bought from Fastenal prior to the pandemic. Our fastener products grew 28.4% and best represent the strength of our underlying business conditions. If we were to adjust out the impact of surge sales, we believe that safety and other products would have grown at a level that's comparable to our fastener growth.
Manufacturing and particularly heavy manufacturing, is exhibiting broad strength. And in the case of both manufacturing and nonresidential construction, sequential quarterly growth in the period exceeded historical norms. Combined with access to customers that is approaching pre-pandemic levels, as evidenced by our improved Onsite and FMI signings in the second quarter of 2021, our outlook remains positive.
It's also worth highlighting that while government sales were down 63% in the second quarter of 2021, they were up 37% versus the second quarter of 2019. We had similar dynamics play out with certain large customers. We continue to believe that we gained market share during the pandemic.
Now to Slide 7. Operating margin in the second quarter of 2021 was 21.1%, up 20 basis points. Gross margin was 46.5% in the second quarter of 2021, up 200 basis points versus the second quarter of 2020. Our safety product margin improved on a combination of mix as lower-margin COVID affected PPE mix retreated to pre-pandemic levels and a recovery in pricing as the market has normalized. We leveraged overhead costs on an improvement in volumes and favorable rebates, which is a combination of lower rebates to certain customers that were heavy surge buyers in 2020 and our own purchasing of key products improving versus 2020. Product mix, specifically growth of fasteners versus non-fasteners, was also a significant contributor to the growth and was a significant factor in gross margin outperforming our expectations for the period.
Our pricing actions largely match inflation we are seeing in the marketplace and price cost did not meaningfully affect gross margin in the second quarter of 2021. The increase in gross margin was partly offset by operating expenses growing faster than sales. In the second quarter of 2020, in response to the onset of the pandemic, we took certain proactive steps to reduce costs. Certain costs naturally declined in result of the weak business and a large portion of our surge sales went direct as opposed to through our branches, which is a very low labor intensity source of revenue.
In response to improving conditions in the second quarter of 2021, these situations reversed. Our headcount remains under control but is appropriately ticking up as demand recovers at our branches. Further, incentive compensation was up almost 20% and health care costs were up 25%. Travel expenses are growing strongly off very easy comparisons as the economy fully opens. Fuel costs are rising sharply. As we indicated last quarter, deleveraging operating expenses in the second quarter of 2021 is a function of anniversary-ing the first periods of pandemic-related cost savings measures, combined with a strongly recovering marketplace. Setting aside these optics, however, we believe the organization continues to manage costs well. If you put it all together, we reported second quarter 2021 earnings per share of $0.42, which is flat versus $0.42 in the first quarter -- I'm sorry, the second quarter of 2020.
Now turning to Slide 8. Operating cash flow was $172 million in the second quarter of 2021. This is down 32% annually and was 71.5% of net income. Now recall that in the second quarter of 2020, pandemic-related legislation allowed us to defer 2 tax payments into the third quarter of 2020. That deferral was not available to us in the second quarter of 2021, and we made those 2 payments as we historically have. The better way to think about cash generation is by considering that in the 5 years from 2015 to 2019, our second quarter cash conversion averaged 63.5%. Against this, we were pleased with our cash generation in the second quarter.
Year-over-year, accounts receivable was up 3.1%. Though sales were flattish, the shift away from PPE surge buyers last year and toward traditional buyers this year blended up our days outstanding. Inventory was down 5.3%, and there's a lot of moving pieces here. A part of this is due to the difficulty in getting sufficient imported products, although our hub inventory deficit has not widened meaningfully versus where it was in the first quarter of 2021 as we are finding domestic sources of product. However, the decrease also reflects deliberate efforts to clean out slow-moving hub and branch inventory, branch closures and the shift in our stocking focus in the field. We believe these represent improvements in our working capital that will be sustained.
Net capital spending in the second quarter of 2021 was $32 million, down from $38 million in the first quarter of 2020. This was largely from lower FMI hardware spend, which is a product of lower signings over the past 12 months and greater refurbishment of FMI equipment. Our 2021 net capital spending range is unchanged at $170 million to $200 million, and we're tracking in the lower half of this range at this time.
We returned cash to shareholders in the quarter in the form of $161 million in dividend. And from a liquidity standpoint, we finished the second quarter with net debt at 2.5% of total capital, down from 6.4% in the year ago period and 5.1% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Essentially, all of our revolver remains available for use.
Now before moving to Q&A, I wanted to update a few subjects of current interest. First, we continue to experience significant cost inflation, particularly for steel, fuel and transportation. In the second quarter of 2021, price contributed 80 to 110 basis points to growth. This largely tracked our increase in costs and the impact of price cost on margin was immaterial. Cost pressures remain high, however, which will require us to institute further material price actions in the period. The marketplace is still receptive to price actions and the tools and processes we have developed have been effective. Even so, given the rate of inflation, maintaining price/cost parity will be a bigger challenge in the third quarter of 2020.
Global supply chains remain tight. We have managed this well domestically, which has allowed our customer service levels to remain high as a result of spot buys, which do tend to carry a lower margin and inventory in certain areas to build to meet projected future needs. Internationally, there continues to be a shortage of capacity, which has made moving products, particularly fasteners, increasingly costly and sustained long lead times. We believe this dynamic could persist at its current level of intensity through 2021.
Now Dan commented earlier on the labor shortages in most of our business. We have largely managed this to this point. However, we are beginning to see those pressures be reflected in our labor costs and the increase in Onsite signings and implementations could introduce some additional strains there. However, recognize a few things. First, this is all partly a by-product of strong demand and happens to some degree with every cycle. Strong growth will allow leverage of other costs that will help us to mitigate these pressures.
Second, much of what we're doing with our digital footprint and the change in our branch model will address many of these matters. Third, none of these pressures are unique to Fastenal, but we believe that our culture and our structure is uniquely geared to navigate them. We've seen -- we have seen no moderation in these pressures over the past 3 months, but we continue to believe that we'll gain share through them.
That is all for our formal presentation. So with that, operator, we'll take questions."

But as Dan indicated, there's been no change in our expectation that we're going to be at a 20% to 22% operating margin business and a 25%-plus return on capital business. There's no change in that."

I think that's where we ended the quarter. About 8% of our vending revenue is being touched by LIFT. And if vending is a little over 20% of our revenue, you can see it's a relatively small piece it's touching. So I don't want to overbuild what LIFT is in the short term. 
We're really excited about it in the longer term. And so that's one element. So the CFC, so the fulfillment center type branch, so we have 2 branch types. And I'm generally speaking, talking about our U.S. business in this commentary. When we go outside the U.S., there's some nuance to it, but I don't want to muddy the conversation with that. In the U.S., in the metro areas, about 70% of our branches now are a fulfillment center. And all that means is we're not -- we might have limited hours that were -- that the front door is open. And part of this sprang out of COVID. 
We found that, that wasn't horribly disruptive to our customer because every customer has a cell phone. Every customer has Internet access. So saying to our customer, ""Hey, call us when you come in,"" or ""Order electronically, and we'll have them ready for you, and the door is going to be locked but when you get here, we'll let you in,"" because most of our business is recurring customers, business-to-business relationships. And that's just the way the branch operates. 
We -- the front showroom has been contracted down. I guess, that's redundant, contracted. And so it's a small footprint you walk into if the front door is open or you pick it up at a locker if the front door is closed or you call and we let you in. That's just a branch.
Separate to that branch setup, and then the other 30% in metro areas would be the traditional service branch that you've visited over the years. The only thing that changes when you get out to the metros, the mix is a little bit different. It's about 60-40. But separate from the branch facility is this LIFT. Now the LIFT might be adjacent to a distribution center. It might be completely independent of the distribution center. And that's just a very focused distribution center that's picking not a pallet of product for a branch delivery. It's picking a total product for a customer vending machine delivery and it's removing that labor that's relatively inefficient at the branch and putting it into a LIFT where it's much more efficient. We can bring some automation to it. We bring scale to it. And over time, that will become a bigger and bigger piece of our vending business. And the real question is, can we do some of those same things for our FAST Stock? Because highly repetitive transactions, you can bring scale to those transactions for the branch network and be more efficient. Does that help?"

And much as we saw during the period of tariffs and inflation, when you see a rapid rate of ascent that continues on for a period of time, it can be difficult to maintain the pace, particularly when you have a business like ours where over half of it is national accounts and contract business. 
So now much like in the prior period, do we think that you catch up to this? Absolutely. And I've always said that I feel like if you achieve price/cost parity anytime within a quarter ahead to 2 quarters behind, that's kind of what the business supports, and I still believe that's true. But there's always timing involved when cost is trending. And that's the situation that we have today. We've gone to the marketplace for different purposes a couple of times, done at least 1 large increase earlier in the second quarter. 
And that was received fairly well. But based on what cost is doing, we'll have to go to the market with some additional ones. To this point, we continue to hear from the field that customers are still so busy and receiving it from so many areas that it's not been a huge bone of contention. But there are timing issues around cost and around contracts that we navigate every cycle, and we'll navigate this one too."

And we estimate right now that the magnitude of fill-in buys that we do this year will be about 5x what we see in a typical year. There's always issues that come up. There's a spike in demand, and we need to do a fill-in by. There's an issue with production from a manufacturer or shipment, we do a fill-in buy. But the magnitude is so much bigger right now.

Part of the reason for -- we aren't necessarily removing some counter labor. Part of it is it doesn't exist. So our business -- our branch-based business is up 20-some percent. Our FTE at the branch is up less than 1. And that isn't my choice. That's what's available. And so part of it is an offshoot of COVID. Part of it is legacy because we don't have some of the staffing we want. Part of it, we do believe this is our model for the future, and we believe it's a better model."

And so what we're essentially trying with time to think through is how much labor are we putting into 80% of our accounts that represents 4% of our revenues. 
And when we think about the development of e-commerce, and you see in this quarter, our e-commerce -- our web sales of e-commerce were up north of 60%. That wasn't entirely because of our conversations with these smaller customers about how we can service them through that model, but a part of it was certainly because of that. So we don't view it as walking away from a lot of revenues. 
We view it as aligning the best way to service different groups of customers within our branch in a way that, in turn, frees up time for our people to sell. So much like the question earlier, we created the LIFT program to free up time for our people to sell to customers that are really going to move the needle. The things that we're doing in the branch is really intended to do very much the same thing.
And what I'll tell you is I'm not sure this model is a whole lot different from what we did 15 years ago. So it's a bit of a evolution towards that, if you will. So you asked what we're giving up. This just seems like a refinement in the model to focus on key accounts that can really move the needle and free up a lot of time for talented salespeople to go after those accounts.

And that plan involves know who your larger opportunities are in the marketplace and make sure you're engaging with those customers. Know who -- really understand the potential of your existing customers in the market and engage with that customer and then have a plan for everybody else. And that means when something is ordered electronically and it's a smaller customer, serve the heck out of that customer, meet that customer where it works for both parties. 
And that means if somebody orders it, if it's in the branch, it's ready for them in a short window of time for them to come in and pick it up. If it's something that's not in the branch and it's in the distribution center, we get it in the next morning, and it's in a locker at 7:00 in the morning. And -- or it's ready for the customer to pick up in the branch at 7:00 in the morning. So you're very mindful of what is your plan because the bulk of the dollar opportunity is coming from the larger opportunities in the market. That's just math. 
But you want a nice mix to your business because it helps you be a great partner to a wide range of customers. And we can be a special business because we can fulfill transactions faster than our industry because of our local stocking and our captive distribution network. We have a better cost structure to our industry. We have a better fulfillment cycle to our industry, and it's incredibly reliable. And we have that local team that can react to the unexpected.

A pace of 100 is probably a little bit more than we might have expected. Why that is, I'm not sure. Now each quarter, we -- again, we go through why we're seeing closings. 
And what we take out of that is the large majority of those closings continue to either be a plant being shut and the volume going elsewhere or going to a different geography or simply a decision on the part of somebody at Fastenal to say -- this isn't actually working out as an Onsite. We think we can service this just as well, if not better, at a branch, and we're going to take it back there and do it that way. And that continues to be the vast majority of the closures that we see as opposed to those fewer cases where it's we've lost the business, which does happen, but it's the minority of those closures. 
So in the case of the first, there's not much we can do about plants moving, right? In the case of the second, we're making a business decision. And I can't tell you it's a bad decision. In the case of the third, that happens. Every now and again, you lose a piece of business.

No, it's not more challenging. There's ample opportunity out there. What is challenging is in the last 15, 16, 17 months of the proposition of talking to a customer, moving in with them when they want to be distanced from everybody on the planet. Imagine having an apartment, you're bringing in a roommate. It's kind of the same concept. You don't want to be around people. And that's changing. And so that's seeing that expand. 
Some things that -- if you think about vending, which we've been doing now for 13 -- going on 13 years, when vending really took off for us in that latter part of 2011, 2012 standpoint, in the following year, we were pulling out 25%, 28% of the devices that we've installed because some of them were just bad. And we didn't know -- we didn't really know what we were doing yet because we were creating an industry. And then that went to 22%. 
And then it went to 18%. And then as our participation and our knowledge base across the organization improved, today, 13 years later, we remove every year about 12% of our devices. We think we can get that to 10% with our LIFT strategy and some of the things we're doing to make it a little bit easier to serve FMI devices. But we think we can get that to 10%, but it's still 10%.
The real question is what is that natural number for Onsite. And 5 years into a really hard push, unfortunately, a year plus of that 5 years is COVID. And so I don't know that we know what that number is. Now we do know that about half the Onsites that we close are because the customer moved the facility or closed down the facility. And the other half are -- we pull some back. We lose some business. There's a number of dynamics. There are some where we grow it from 30 to 60, and we get stuck at 60. And as Holden mentioned a few minutes ago, we just move it back to the branch because it's more efficient for everybody or the customer kicks us out because they're out of room. And I don't like Onsite closures, but I know -- and I don't like FMI devices coming back, but I know it's part of the business. And the real question is, can we, as an organization, over time, outgrow our industry and gain market share more efficiently, more productively and maybe redundant quicker than everybody else? If we can do that with Onsite and FMI devices and all the things we're doing, I love the business."

And I think the reason we look at it every quarter and why those closings happen, it's just so that we understand why. And when you think about that typically, I think people think about a closure as a loss of revenue. And in the large -- in the majority of cases, the closure of an Onsite is not a loss of revenue. In fact, to the extent that there was some progress at the Onsite -- at the original inception, you might be bringing more to the brands than left then initially. And so when you think about the closure rate, think about cut it in half because a bunch of the business, we're still maintaining. And then as Dan indicated, there's some historical precedent here with vending. We ran hard and fast to sort of get into the marketplace. We learned a lot. And as we learned a lot, we sort of cleaned up some things that maybe we did when we were early on in the initiative and then we were smarter and more efficient coming out of it. I think we're really following a very similar pattern."

But -- when it comes to vending, the FMI devices or the vending machine, over half the revenue there is PP&E. And that's directly related to how many human beings are in that plant and for how many hours of the day. And so if there's a smaller number of human beings but they're spread out over multiple shifts, so the same amount of hours are being worked, I wouldn't expect safety to be impacted. It might be higher because people are much more conscious about safety today than about wearing a mask or wearing gloves or doing anything. People are more -- are better about washing their d*** hands today than they were 1.5 years ago. And so to that extent, you might have fewer people and more consumption because everybody is saying, do this, do this, do this, and we're conscious to it."

And I'm going to start on Page 3 of Holden's flipbook, and run through some thoughts on the quarter. And some of the prior quarters, Holden will share his thoughts on the latter half of the flipbook, and then we'll do some Q&A at the tail end of this call. 
So for the quarter, we grew our sales 10%. We ended the quarter with the business a bit stronger, up 11% and of equal or perhaps more importance, when I think of our sequential patterns, we're -- and we highlight that, and Holden will touch on that, but we highlight that in our September information web release, we're in a good spot as far as where we were in January and where we are in September, and how that positions us for going into 2022 from the standpoint of the strength of the business, the gains in the business, et cetera. 
If I set aside the noise of comparisons for a second, in comparisons to 2020 -- and I take a longer peer back and Holden on Page 5 of the flipbook, similar to what we did last quarter, is we did a comparison to 2019. And we did that because it allows us to not have to explain all the conditionality of the comparisons and look at it and say, here's what the business looked like before the pandemic started and here's what our business looks like today. And everybody on this call knows what happened in the last 24 months as it relates to Fastenal's business. The success we enjoyed, the help to society we were able to provide last year and the products that we were bringing to bear and the impact we saw in our safety business in 2020. So let's just ignore all that noise for a second. 
And what stands out to me is we continue to invest in the growth drivers of the business, we continue to invest in the people side of the business, we continue to execute and grow our market share. And what you see is an organization that is about 13% bigger than we were 2 years ago. As we've talked in the past -- and I'm looking at Page 5 in the flipbook right now. As we've talked in the past, our growth drivers carry a different gross profit profile. And you'd see with the rounding and Holden's schedule there, our gross margin is about 90 basis points lower than it was 2 years ago. 
What we've talked about is what we like about these growth drivers, is they differentiate us in the marketplace and they tap into the strengths of Fastenal, and we're able to bring scale to these elements and manage our operating expenses more effectively. And you can see that not only did we improve our operating expenses as a percentage of sales in the last 2 years, we completely offset the impact of the gross margin change. In fact, that's a little bit of rounding, it's closer to 100 basis points. 
And as a result, our operating income as a percentage of sales is 10 basis points higher today than it was 2 years ago. And so I believe in that 2-year time frame, we've done a great service to our employees, we've done a great service to our customers. I believe we've done a great service to society in general and what we were able to accomplish in 2020 and 2021. And I believe we served our shareholders well in the process. 
If you think about the operating and administrative expenses and what's really happened, we picked up about 30 basis points on the people side of the business. We picked up about 70 basis points in that 2-year period on the non-people side of the business. If I look at the people component, so our expense on the people side is up about $28 million in that 2-year period. 14% of that number is the addition of people and/or changing roles and/or inflation in rates. That raised the base element of our pay above 14%. The incentive component, and this is looking at that 14%, 14% of the increase came from that. 61% of the increase, that $28 million over the last 2 years, 61% is related to incentive compensation. 
So when we find success as an organization, we share that deeply into the organization. And like we saw last year, our incentive comp pulled back, it reloaded itself this year. On a 2-year basis, 60% of our increase in human costs is incentive comp. Another 14% is health care, one thing that's rippling really significantly through our P&L right now, not just on a 1-year basis, which is like 45% increase. But on a 2-year basis, 14% of our cost increase is health care. And I don't know where that's going to go, in all honesty. Another 1% of our increase came from profit sharing and 90% of our increases are bucketed into those 4 categories in the last 2-year period. The other 10%, the biggest individual component of that is social taxes and then other little noise in the numbers. 
If I look at the increases, our remaining expenses -- in operating expenses increased about $4.5 million on a 2-year basis. 25% of that increase relates to FMI, vending and bins. 25% of that increase relates to distribution center increases. Now part of that is cost for facilities, part of that is cost that we're doing to manage through the chaos that is supply chain in today's world, 50% of that increase is IT equipment. As you know, last year, we deployed 8,000-plus mobile devices throughout our network to create productivity gains, to create social distancing, to create a better means to serve our customers and illuminate for them what we do. That 50% of our increase there is what's funding a big piece of our labor efficiencies in the last 2 years. 
The final -- the other [ guide shift ] over the last 2 years, fuel prices are a little bit higher. Fortunately, everything else in our P&L offset the impact of fuel. And so I hope you find that helpful of taking the noise out of the 1-year comparison and looking at it holistically and say, what happened in the last 2 years. Fastenal has invested in its ability to serve, to manage its cost effectively, it shared the fruits of our labor with our team. And I think we served customers and society and our shareholders well in that process. 
Flipping back to Page 3, and I'll get back off my tangent. FAST Bin, we have talked about that next stage as we broaden our FMI, Fastenal Managed Inventory footprint. And vending has been around for 13, 14 years. Putting technology into bins is relatively new. A year ago, we had 705 machine equivalent units deployed across our network. It's still a pretty small piece of the business. That number has grown almost fourfold to 2,600 in the third quarter of 2021. It's now about 1% of our sales going through that footprint. Again, it's small, but the power to become more efficient and provide a differentiated value in the marketplace is strong. 
I talked a few minutes ago about the mobility technology we deployed. A year ago, that mobility technology helped us manage 6% of our revenue. Today, it's 11%. And again, ways to better illuminate and create efficiencies for our team and, frankly, keep our team safer because these devices create social distance. When you're in -- whether we're in a pandemic or an endemic right now, I'm not smart enough to know, but these things help in our business. 
As you read about in the paper and as I've seen in some of the write-ups and I've seen from some of our peers and some of our other industries, the product and shipping cost inflation is not just high, it's brutally high. The chaos and the impact, not just from a financial perspective, but from a toll it takes on our human capital, is immense. The thing that stands out for me is the entrepreneurial culture within Fastenal. Our ability to solve problems for others means you can also solve problems for yourself. The disruptions we're seeing, our teams in the local market are able to figure out solutions to take care of their customer. Just like we did in 2020, we're doing it again in 2021, but it does take a toll to the organization. 
As we go through all this and have a lot of discussions with customers about disruption, about cost changes, price changes, as you can imagine, takes a lot of energy away from some of our growth drivers and had lengthen some of the sales cycles. And you're seeing that show up a bit in our Onsite, in our FMI program. So on-site wise, we signed 75 devices during the -- excuse me, 75 onsites during the quarter. Perfect world, I'd like that number to be 100. And -- but it really is about how much participation are we getting across the network and how many customers are saying, yes, move in with me. We'd like Fastenal help us on-premises. That's a tougher sale on -- in this environment. However, our total Onsites grew 10.5% over -- the number of Onsites grew 10.5% and the sales through those Onsites grew more than 20% in the last 12 months. So they've proven what they can do for our customer and what they can do for revenue growth. We just like to get a few more signings. 
As I touched on the Fastenal managed inventory, I think Holden does an excellent job, and I know we haven't filed our 10-Q yet. But in our last quarter 10-Q and the 10-Q they'll be filing in the upcoming days, does a very good job explaining our digital footprint. And looking at the FMI component of that as well as the e-commerce component of that. We're pushing the hardest on the FMI because we think a great supply chain partner doesn't simplify the ordering process. They simplify the supply chain process and why are you physically ordering repetitive items. And we believe that's a unique place for us to be. 
Similar to what we saw in Onsite, our -- Fastenal-managed inventory from a device standpoint is up 10% year-over-year. So we continue to see great traction. But I would like the signings to be a little bit higher. E-commerce, it's about 14% of our sales now, it grew 43%. There's still a lot of one-off stuff, and we're seeing that we're providing a better tool in the marketplace to help grow that piece of our business. You combine FMI and e-commerce, our digital footprint is now 44% of sales -- 45% of sales, excuse me, and that's where we ended the quarter in September. And that number, 9 months ago, was in the 30s. So really pleased with that. 
Before I transition over to Holden, I thought I'd touch a little bit on our in-market locations. Page 13 in his flipbook, he does -- he has a great table in there that shows our end-market location statistics. And I thought I'd share some perspectives on this. In the 6 years that I've been in this role, in the several years before that, we were doing a pivot. And that pivot was really about the intensity of our branch-based locations, the intensity of our network, we were starting to morph that into a few more Onsites, and we took that into a really high gear in 2016. 
But if I look at what's happened in the last 8 years, we've removed 938 locations from the Fastenal network, and that's basically adding up all those closed, converted branch numbers over that time frame. And in 3 of those years, 2016, 2018 and 2021, we've removed more than 150 branch locations. Part of that is us looking at our network and saying, for what we are in the marketplace, what makes the most sense, but it's also a reflection of the Onsite as we're moving more and more business out of the branch network and moving into the customer, you rationalize your network. Most organizations would look at this and say, ""Geez, 938 on a base of [ 2,687 ] 8 years ago. That's like a big restructuring charge. Let's do it all at once, sets through everything plus the kitchen sink into it and have cover."" That's not how we operate. 
Our district managers, our district leaders have figured out over that 8-year period, how to be creative on making the economics of that work. In some cases, they might go to a customer and we sell part of a building to them. But they figured out how to manage that process and constructively rationalize our footprint over an 8-year period, where our footprint now, when you add in openings, we're 31% lower than we were 8 years ago. But there wasn't a big disruptive impact. We just did it as a normal course of business. That's something I think is the hallmark of the Fastenal organization.
In prior quarters, I've shared some COVID stats with the group. We had a tough quarter in the third quarter. We had -- in the Fourth quarter of 2020, we had 5 weeks where we had more than 50 cases in that discrete week, in the fourth quarter of 2020. Two of those weeks were over 100. In the third quarter of 2021, we had 7 weeks where we had more than 50 cases, one of those over 100. I'm proud of the fact that our teams looked for ways to take care of our employee base, looked for ways to protect each other, and managed through that process because it's been incredibly disruptive in the third quarter. Staffing locations, when you have people out with COVID, when your average location has 5 to 10 employees, is incredibly challenging. We managed through it. 
The other thing during the third quarter, we did a survey, we did a pulse survey of our employees. And some things that jumped out in that survey our employees felt -- and we always get a very high participation in these surveys, our employees felt in that survey, their manager, the team around them, truly cared about each other, and we were protecting each other. And as the leader of Fastenal, I'm incredibly proud of Blue Team for doing that. 
There was a negative in there. There was one that felt, wished there was a little more communication internally. And that's a message to me. We need to always be good about communicating what we're seeing in the marketplace. And the other thing that jumped out is I know what's expected of me of work, and my manager cares about my wellbeing and about my development as a person. So a lot of positive things, the team is tired from going through this period, but a lot of positive things we're seeing. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Holden."

The period still has some difficult COVID-related comparison with government customers down 40.4%, and saf",1226,"Great. Thanks, Dan. Turning over to Slide 6. As indicated, our sales were up 10% in the third quarter of 2021, which includes up 11.1% in September. The period still has some difficult COVID-related comparison with government customers down 40.4%, and safety and janitorial products being down 2.9% and 15.4%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2021. As a result, we believe that total growth for the quarter understates the strength we are experiencing in our traditional manufacturing and construction customers as the chart on the page illustrates. 
On the product side, this is also well demonstrated by our 20.2% growth in fasteners, but sales of our other products segment, excluding janitorial, was also up 16.8%. In safety, sales of vended safety product, which removes from both periods direct shipped, typically COVID-related bulk product, was up 28.5%. National Accounts sales were up 16.8%. And while our smaller accounts were only up 2.2%, if we adjust for the government, our remaining customers would have been up 11.7%. So bottom line, we continue to experience broad strength in our traditional markets, consistent with macro data points such as PMI and industrial production. 
Pricing contributed 230 to 260 basis points to growth in the third quarter of 2021, up from 80 to 110 basis points in the second quarter. This reflects actions taken year-to-date to mitigate the increases we are seeing in product, particularly steel and transportation, particularly overseas shipping. Inflation continued to rise over the course of the third quarter of 2021, particularly for overseas containers and shipping services. While we have a range of efforts underway to mitigate the impacts of inflation on our customers' costs, further price actions may also be necessary in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
Aside from inflation, and as Dan discussed, our marketplace continues to experience tight supply chains and labor shortages. These disruptions impacted customer production more in the third quarter of 2021 than the previous quarter, and the increase in COVID infections exacerbated these challenges. These trends seem likely to persist in the near term. To address these, we will continue to lean on technology and branch initiatives to improve productivity and an organizational culture that empowers local leaders to sustain high service levels. And while the supply chain remains elongated, we do expect an inflow of imported product in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 that should sustain our high product availability and reduce the impact of fill-in buys. 
Now to Slide 7. Operating margin in the third quarter of 2021 was 20.5%, flat versus the third quarter of 20 -- sorry, the third quarter of 2020. Gross margin was 46.3% in the third quarter of 2021, up 100 basis points versus the third quarter of 2020. This relates to 2 items: first, we experienced good leverage of overhead and organizational expenses due to strong product demand and growth; second, we had better product margin, primarily in safety products. Lower margin COVID-affected PPE was a smaller proportion of total safety sales versus last year, and the margin on those COVID-affected products increased. 
Product and customer mix did not impact gross margins in the third quarter of 2021 versus the prior year, in contrast to the favorable impact experienced in the second quarter of 2021. Relatively strong fastener growth allowed positive product mix to offset the negative impact of strong on-site growth on customer mix, but the gap was narrower sequentially, a trend that is likely to persist. While the impact of pricing in the third quarter of 2021 exceeded our original expectations, inflation and shipping costs similarly exceeded our expectations. As a result, price/cost continued to be largely neutral in our gross margins in the third quarter of 2021. 
The increase in gross margin was offset by operating expenses growing faster than sales. Part of this is due to the comparison, as third quarter 2020 operating expense leverage still reflected COVID-related low labor intensity sales versus current sales being generated in a more traditional high-touch manner. Just as relevant, however, is the role of cost resets. In the first year of a manufacturing recovery, it is typical for various operating expenses to have an outsized recovery. We're experiencing that in 2021, including in the third quarter, but also believe that the breadth of resets are unusually wide. For instance, we are seeing a 40% increase in incentive pay, but we're also seeing a 50% increase in fuel costs, a 165% increase in travel expenses and a 45% increase in health care costs. The nature of past downturns and recoveries would not have necessarily led to so dramatic a rise, particularly in the latter 2 items. 
As with last quarter, deleveraging operating expenses in the third quarter of 2021 is a function of anniversary-ing the first periods of pandemic-related cost savings measures, combined with a strongly recovering marketplace. Similar dynamics are likely to play out in the fourth quarter of 2021, although not likely on the same order of magnitude, and we anticipate being able to leverage in 2022 for a comparable level of growth. Putting it all together, we reported third quarter 2021 EPS of $0.42, up from $0.38 in the third quarter of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 8. Operating cash flow was $168 million in the third quarter of 2021, down 32% annually and 68.8% of net income. We paid roughly $30 million in payroll taxes, which were deferred from 2020 as part of pandemic-related legislation. The bigger impact on our conversion, however, was an increase in working capital. Year-over-year, accounts receivable was up 13.8%. This reflects strong customer demand and a shift away from PPE surge buyers last year and to our traditional customers this year that slightly blended up days outstanding. 
Inventory was up 4.4%. We did see meaningful reduction in our three-ply mask inventory in the third quarter of 2021 and anticipate clearing out this inventory in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for this, inventory would have been up 6.2%. We continue to clean out slow-moving hub and branch inventory, closed branches and shift our stocking focus in the field. We believe these represent improvements in our working capital that will be sustained. That is being offset by product installation and to a lesser degree, product flowing into our network. We have a significant amount of imported product in transit and we expect to see product availability in our hubs improve over the next couple of quarters. 
In the current environment, this is how we are utilizing our balance sheet to support customer service and growth. Net capital spending in the third quarter of 2021 was $47 million, up from $34 million in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting spending on a non-hub construction project in Winona. We have lowered our 2021 net capital spending range to $155 million to $175 million, down from $170 million to $200 million, as supply chain difficulties are limiting our purchases of vehicles, branch supplies and other products. From a liquidity standpoint, we finished the third quarter of 2021 with debt at 11% of total capital and net debt at 3.4% of total capital. Net debt is up from 2.2% in the year-ago period and 5.1% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Essentially, all of our revolver remains available for use. 
That's all for our formal presentation. So with that, operator, we will take questions."

If you look at -- so we have a variety of supply chain partners, some of which are domestic supply chain partners, and they might be selling us, in many cases, branded product and that might be a domestically manufactured or North American manufactured or a globally manufactured item. And then you have the items that are more commodity in makeup and Fastenal is a high player in that, that tend to be produced offshore, and that's been the case for 60, 70 years. 
And as you can appreciate, we upped our safety stock and the depth of inventory we have on domestically sourced product. And if I think of our supply chain, if I think of our distribution centers and our service level that we measure with fulfillment to our branch network, we're at a very good spot there. It's product that we bring in from overseas that is manufactured overseas. And one thing that helps us in the process, and we've gotten some grief from over the years from the analyst community and justifiably so. We carry a lot of inventory. And we have inventory spread across 3,400 locations, branch Onsites and distribution centers. And so that gives us some resiliency that a lot of our peers don't have. But no, it's crushingly bad right now on product coming in that has to go through a port and we're not immune to that. 
We just have maybe a little more resourcefulness locally because some business models are so leveraged to scale that when things get tough, they kind of fall apart. Our model is leveraged to scale. But when things get tough, our local folks step up and fill in the gaps, but it's brutally hard work."

And so on a sequential basis, yes, we would lose a couple of selling days and then that's leverage that you do give up, on top of the seasonality, right, fourth quarter is just typically not quite as active a period as occurs in the third quarter, but that happens every year. 
I think if you look at history, history would suggest that the -- you would expect some flat to down 3%, give or take. And that really depends heavily on compensation costs, right? Whether you're flat or down 3%, is really driven by compensation costs, which makes sense because it's 70% of our operating expense line. 
I will note, I think that whereas we have a difficult comparison from a days standpoint, we do have a little bit of an easy comparison from a wage standpoint. We had some wages that were deferred into Q4 last year and we will not necessarily replicate that this year. So that creates a little bit of an easier comparison. And I do think that we'll have somewhat lower growth on days and lower gross margin, et cetera. And if you bank all that in, honestly, I think somewhere within that normal range still makes sense to me, David."

And we had a lot of -- we have a lot of Onsites in K-12 school districts, in the Southeast, particularly in Florida early on. And then Bob will tell everybody about it and pretty soon everybody else is kind of dabbling in it and finding success there. And then we moved into expansion in some of the higher ed and sign some Onsites. 
One thing that stands out for me when I think of the last 9 months is I periodically hear -- and it's not just coming from Bob anymore, but I periodically hear about a health care facility that we just signed up as an onsite. So far, most of those that I've heard about have been tethered to a university, but seeing traction there. Now the numbers are incredibly small, don't get me wrong in the scheme of things, but that's not something I heard about 15 and 20 months ago, that I am hearing about as we go through each quarter of 2021. And I see that as a positive because it widens the basket of potential customers out there. 
The other thing stands out, Holden and I have ongoing conversations with our team about metropolitan areas and what's our plan. Last Friday, we went through Minneapolis and the -- and St. Paul area, what's our plan for this market. Every one of those discussions now include a discussion about some traction we're getting on the government and educational fronts and health care fronts as it relates to business activity and onsite. And again, you would have to draw out the people in the past. Now it's offered up, it's a growth opportunity in individual markets. With that, we'll take the next question."

And our best pipeline for talent for -- over the last 50 years has been get somebody with a year or 2 years left of college, or is it going to -- whether that's a 4-year state college or a 2-year technical college ask them to come work for us. Tell them, hey, we'll get you some experience, you get some cash coming in, which is always helpful to a student. And we're looking at 15 to 20 hours a week.

And then you'll join your Blue Team and grow your career. 
That's a tough recruiting model in the last 1.5 years, because if colleges close and kids go home, well, we need to -- our model is to hire them when they're at school and not when they're 3 hours away at home. So that just devastated that. Kids are back in school now. Now we're only a month basically, a month and maybe 5 weeks into school. We haven't seen an uptick that I can tangibly put my finger on. Most of it is anecdotal. I believe that piece of hiring will get better. And I don't know if I believe that, because I'm being a glass half-full optimist and I'm just wrong or I believe it because I think a lot of people are hungry to get back to some sense of normalcy. And part of it is, hey, I need a part time job in college. But it's not planned."

As you can appreciate, sometimes at quarter end or during the quarter, you're looking at so many different things that I don't want to give you inaccurate information. What I can tell you is the buffer we're building into our supply chain for import is dramatic. And it's measured in weeks, not in days. 
And those weeks are -- I could almost say it in months rather than weeks. But it's a -- I'm trying to stall so Holden can look it up, but I don't think I'm going to get that luxury. But suffice it to say, it's weakened out. And yesterday with our Board, I share an insight I pose to them. And that is, as an organization and one of the Board's obligations to the shareholders is to manage risk. And one of the things I said to the Board from a risk standpoint that we have to be acutely aware of -- and I don't know if acutely aware of is 6 months from now or 6 years from now, I honestly don't know how this is going to work its way out because a lot of capacity was taken out from the steamship lines last year. And part of the issue is capacity just isn't there. 
So is this something that's part of our new normal that we're going to have this kind of consternation that we need to build an extra 30 or 45 days of time into supply chain. The risk is when that flips and again, I don't know if it's 6 months from now or 6 years from now, when that flips, we have to be acutely aware it's happening, when it's happening. Because right now, we sell $13 million worth of inventory a day. If all of a sudden, stuff comes in 3 weeks faster, 4 weeks faster, you get -- well, $13 million times 20 business days in a month is $260 million. So you could add $100 million, $200 million, $250 million of inventory really fast, if you're not dialed in and managing it. And -- but it's measured in weeks. And I apologize, we don't have it at our fingertip. But a 30- to 45-day window won't surprise me, but I just don't have the accurate number in my fingertips."

And today, frankly, that's probably more in the $1.45 million annualized level. And that's an improvement over last year. And frankly, it's actually an improvement over 2019 as well. So we have begun to see that improvement occur.  
It's one of those things, I think, is relevant to talk about because we talk about the signings being somewhat weaker. But that team in the Onsite group, we've seen the average size go up. We've actually seen the margin on that group go up. And we've seen the inventory on hand actually decline in terms of days on hand number. So we've talked a lot about as you sort of get out of this hyper growth process into sort of more of a fast growth process that comes with a certain level of productivity and efficiency. We have seen that over the last 12 months. And so when we get back to being able to sign 375 to 400 when the market normalizes, I think we are doing so off of a larger, more productive base. And I think that's an exciting development. Does that answer the question? Or did I miss a point of it?"

In September, so total transit time for deliveries in August hit a Fastenal record 58 days. And September was trending higher at the time they provided this update, this was a couple of weeks ago. If I look at that back in the first quarter of 2020, which is the earliest bars on my chart here, that number was in the 30s as far as days. And this includes both the transit time to the port and then the average time discharged from port to destination. So it's not just what it takes to cross the ocean and get to the port, and are you sitting there for 10 days or 9 days out in the Ocean Rock Port off Southern Cal or whatever it might be. But then getting it through the terminal and transferred. 
And probably the thing that jumps out the most for me is in the -- typically, when we're negotiating rates, that's a rate that goes from the port in the original country to our destination, which is our distribution center. And the steamship lines handle that entire journey. 35% of our containers coming in, in the third quarter, we actually couldn't get them to the destination because they weren't available because there's such a shortage of containers. 35% had to be manually unloaded at the port, loaded on a semi and driven to our distribution center. And everything you read about is what's happening with the container cost coming from overseas. That doesn't include that layer of expense because putting it on a semi and driving it across North America, is a lot more expensive than the container going on a train and going across North America. 
And that actually, I mean, we see a fourfold increase in container costs year-over-year. If you added that piece in, the increase is more like sixfold. But that's on 35% of our containers coming in. The only silver lining in that is that 35% was 45% in August, and it was 28% in September. So I don't know if it's coming down and it's going to continue that trend because 1 month isn't a trend. It's a data point. But that's been a brutal piece of the inflation as well. 
I see we're at 5 minutes before the hour. I trust we've answered most of the questions satisfactorily. And if you have any follow-up, Holden and I are around for the balance of the day. 
I would put one quick call out to the Fastenal team. EHS today recognized Fastenal, along with 9 other organizations, as America's -- as one of America's safest companies. And I want to say to our EH&S team, our safety teams that develop our plan and our employees that honor and respect that plan, thanks for keeping each other safe in 2020. Thanks for what you did for society, and congratulations on the recognition. Take care, everybody."

And I'm going to start on Page 3 of Holden's flipbook, and run through some thoughts on the quarter. And some of the prior quarters, Holden will share his thoughts on the latter half of the flipbook, and then we'll do some Q&A at the tail end of this call. 
So for the quarter, we grew our sales 10%. We ended the quarter with the business a bit stronger, up 11% and of equal or perhaps more importance, when I think of our sequential patterns, we're -- and we highlight that, and Holden will touch on that, but we highlight that in our September information web release, we're in a good spot as far as where we were in January and where we are in September and how that positions us for going into 2022 from the standpoint of the strength of the business, the gains in the business, et cetera. 
If I set aside the noise of comparisons for a second, in comparisons to 2020 -- and I take a longer peer back and Holden on Page 5 of the flipbook, similar to what we did last quarter, is we did a comparison to 2019. And we did that because it allows us to not have to explain all the conditionality of the comparisons and look at it and say, here's what the business looked like before the pandemic started and here's what our business looks like today. And everybody on this call knows what happened in the last 24 months as it relates to Fastenal's business. The success we enjoyed, the help to society we were able to provide last year and the products that we will bringing to bear and the impact we saw in our safety business in 2020. So let's just ignore all that noise for a second. 
And what stands out to me is we continue to invest in the growth drivers of the business, we continue to invest in the people side of the business, we continue to execute and grow our market share. And what you see is an organization that is about 13% bigger than we were 2 years ago. As we've talked in the past -- and I'm looking at Page 5 in the flipbook right now. As we've talked in the past, our growth drivers carry a different gross profit profile. And you'd see with the rounding in Holden's schedule there, our gross margin is about 90 basis points lower than it was 2 years ago. 
What we've talked about is what we like about these growth drivers is they differentiate us in the marketplace and they tap into the strengths of Fastenal, and we're able to bring scale to these elements and manage our operating expenses more effectively. And you can see that not only did we improve our operating expenses as a percentage of sales in the last 2 years, we completely offset the impact of the gross margin change. In fact, that's a little bit of rounding, it's closer to 100 basis points. 
And as a result, our operating income as a percentage of sales is 10 basis points higher today than it was 2 years ago. And so I believe in that 2-year time frame, we've done a great service to our employees, we've done a great service to our customers. I believe we've done a great service to society in general and what we were able to accomplish in 2020 and 2021. And I believe we served our shareholders well in the process. 
If you think about the operating and administrative expenses and what's really happened, we picked up about 30 basis points on the people side of the business. We picked up about 70 basis points in that 2-year period on the non-people side of the business. If I look at the people component, so our expense on the people side is up about $28 million in that 2-year period. 14% of that number is the addition of people and/or changing roles and/or inflation in rates. That raised the base element of our pay above 14%. The incentive component, and this is looking at that -- not 14%, 14% of the increase came from that. 61% of the increase, that $28 million over the last 2 years, 61% is related to incentive compensation. 
So when we find success as an organization, we share that deeply into the organization. And like we saw last year, our incentive comp pulled back, it reloaded itself this year. On a 2-year basis, 60% of our increase in human costs is incentive comp. Another 14% is health care, one thing that's rippling really significantly through our P&L right now, not just on a 1-year basis, which is like 45% increase. But on a 2-year basis, 14% of our cost increase is health care. And I don't know where that's going to go, in all honesty. Another 1% of our increase came from profit sharing and 90% of our increases are bucketed into those 4 categories in the last 2-year period. The other 10%, the biggest individual component of that is social taxes and then other little noise in the numbers. 
If I look at the increases, our remaining expenses in operating expenses increased about $4.5 million on a 2-year basis. 25% of that increase relates to FMI, vending and bins. 25% of that increase relates to distribution center increases. Now part of that is cost for facilities, part of that is cost that we're doing to manage through the chaos that is supply the chain in today's world, 50% of that increase is IT equipment. As you know, last year, we deployed 8,000-plus mobile devices throughout our network to create productivity gains, to create social distancing, to create a better means to serve our customers and illuminate for them what we do. That 50% of our increase there is what's funding a big piece of our labor efficiencies in the last 2 years. 
The final -- the other [ guide shift ] over the last 2 years, fuel prices are a little bit higher. Fortunately, everything else in our P&L offset the impact of fuel. And so I hope you find that helpful of taking the noise out of the 1-year comparison and looking at it holistically and say, what happened in the last 2 years. Fastenal has invested in its ability to serve, it managed its cost effectively, it shared the fruits of our labor with our team. And I think we served customers and society and our shareholders well in that process. 
Flipping back to Page 3, and I'll get back off my tangent. FAST Bin, we have talked about that next stage as we broaden our FMI, Fastenal Managed Inventory footprint. And vending has been around for 13, 14 years. Putting technology into bins is relatively new. A year ago, we had 705 machine equivalent units deployed across our network. It's still a pretty small piece of the business. That number has grown almost fourfold to 2,600 in the third quarter of 2021. It's now about 1% of our sales going through that footprint. Again, it's small, but the power to become more efficient and provide a differentiated value in the marketplace is strong. 
I talked a few minutes ago about the mobility technology we deployed. A year ago, that mobility technology helped us manage 6% of our revenue. Today, it's 11%. And again, ways to better illuminate and create efficiencies for our team and, frankly, keep our team safer because these devices create social distance. When you're in -- whether we're in a pandemic or an endemic right now, I'm not smart enough to know, but these things help in our business. 
As you read about in the paper and as I've seen in some of the write-ups and I've seen from some of our peers and some of our other industries, the product and shipping cost inflation is not just high, it's brutally high. The chaos and the impact, not just from a financial perspective, but from a toll it takes on our human capital, is immense. The thing that stands out for me is the entrepreneurial culture within Fastenal. Our ability to solve problems for others means you can also solve problems for yourself. The disruptions we're seeing, our teams in the local market are able to figure out solutions to take care of their customer. Just like we did in 2020, we're doing it again in 2021, but it does take a toll to the organization. 
As we go through all this and have a lot of discussions with customers about disruption, about cost changes, price changes, as you can imagine, it takes a lot of energy away from some of our growth drivers and had lengthened some of the sales cycles. And you're seeing that show up a bit in our Onsite, in our FMI program. So Onsite-wise, we signed 75 devices during the -- excuse me, 75 Onsites during the quarter. Perfect world, I'd like that number to be 100. And -- but it really is about how much participation are we getting across the network and how many customers are saying, yes, move in with me. We'd like Fastenal to help us on-premises. That's a tougher sale on -- in this environment. However, our total Onsites grew 10.5% over -- the number of Onsites grew 10.5% and the sales through those Onsites grew more than 20% in the last 12 months. So they've proven what they can do for our customer and what they can do for revenue growth, we just like to get a few more signings. 
As I touched on the Fastenal-managed inventory, I think Holden does an excellent job, and I know we haven't filed our 10-Q yet. But in our last quarter 10-Q, and the 10-Q we'll be filing in the upcoming days, does a very good job explaining our digital footprint. And looking at the FMI component of that as well as the e-commerce component of that, we're pushing the hardest on the FMI because we think a great supply chain partner doesn't simplify the ordering process. They simplify the supply chain process and why are you physically ordering repetitive items. And we believe that's a unique place for us to be. 
Similar to what we saw in Onsites, our Fastenal-managed inventory from a device standpoint is up 10% year-over-year. So we continue to see great traction. But I would like the signings to be a little bit higher. E-commerce, it's about 14% of our sales now, it grew 43%. There's still a lot of one-off stuff, and we're seeing that we're providing a better tool in the marketplace to help grow that piece of our business. You combine FMI and e-commerce, our digital footprint is now 44% of sales -- 45% of sales, excuse me, and that's where we ended the quarter in September. And that number, 9 months ago, was in the 30s. So really pleased with that. 
Before I transition over to Holden, I thought I'd touch a little bit on our in-market locations. Page 13 in his flipbook, he does -- he has a great table in there that shows our end-market location statistics. And I thought I'd share some perspectives on this. In the 6 years that I've been in this role, in the several years before that, we were doing a pivot. And that pivot was really about the intensity of our branch-based locations, the intensity of our network, we were starting to morph that into a few more Onsites, and we took that into a really high gear in 2016. 
But if I look at what's happened in the last 8 years, we've removed 938 locations from the Fastenal network, and that's basically adding up all those closed, converted branch numbers over that time frame. And in 3 of those years, 2016, 2018 and 2021, we've removed more than 150 branch locations. Part of that is us looking at our network and saying, for what we are in the marketplace, what makes the most sense, but it's also a reflection of the Onsite as we're moving more and more business out of the branch network and moving into the customer, you rationalize your network. Most organizations would look at this and say, ""Geez, 938 on a base of [ 2,687 ] 8 years ago. Let's take a big restructuring charge. Let's do it all at once, let's throw everything plus the kitchen sink into it and have cover."" That's not how we operate. 
Our district managers, our district leaders have figured out over that 8-year period, how to be creative on making the economics of that work. In some cases, they might go to a customer and we sell part of a building to them. But they figured out how to manage that process and constructively rationalize our footprint over an 8-year period, where our footprint now, when you add in openings, we're 31% lower than we were 8 years ago. But there wasn't a big disruptive impact. We just did it as a normal course of business. That's something I think is the hallmark of the Fastenal organization.
In prior quarters, I've shared some COVID stats with the group. We had a tough quarter in the third quarter. We had -- in the fourth quarter of 2020, we had 5 weeks where we had more than 50 cases in that discrete week, in the fourth quarter of 2020. Two of those weeks were over 100. In the third quarter of 2021, we had 7 weeks where we had more than 50 cases, one of those over 100. I'm proud of the fact that our teams looked for ways to take care of our employee base, looked for ways to protect each other and managed through that process because it's been incredibly disruptive in the third quarter. Staffing locations, when you have people out with COVID, when your average location has 5 to 10 employees, is incredibly challenging. We managed through it. 
The other thing during the third quarter, we did a survey, we did a pulse survey of our employees. And some things that jumped out in that survey, our employees felt -- and we always get a very high participation in these surveys. Our employees felt in that survey, their manager, the team around them, truly cared about each other, and we were protecting each other. And as the leader of Fastenal, I'm incredibly proud of Blue Team for doing that. 
Still there was a negative in there. There was one that felt -- wished there was a little more communication internally. And that's a message to me. We need to always be good about communicating what we're seeing in the marketplace. And the other thing that jumped out is I know what's expected of me at work, and my manager cares about my wellbeing and about my development as a person. So a lot of positive things, the team is tired from going through this period, but a lot of positive things we're seeing. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Holden."

As indicated, our sales were up 10% in the third quarter of 2021, which includes up 11.1% in September. The period still has some difficult COVID-related comparisons with government customers down 40.4%, and sa",1226,"Great. Thanks, Dan. Turning over to Slide 6. As indicated, our sales were up 10% in the third quarter of 2021, which includes up 11.1% in September. The period still has some difficult COVID-related comparisons with government customers down 40.4%, and safety and janitorial products being down 2.9% and 15.4%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2021. As a result, we believe that total growth for the quarter understates the strength we are experiencing in our traditional manufacturing and construction customers as the chart on the page illustrates.  
On the product side, this is also well demonstrated by our 20.2% growth in fasteners, but sales of our other product segment, excluding janitorial, was also up 16.8%. In safety, sales of vended safety product, which removes from both periods direct shipped, typically COVID-related bulk product, was up 28.5%. National Accounts sales were up 16.8%. And while our smaller accounts were only up 2.2%, if we adjust for the government, our remaining customers would have been up 11.7%. So bottom line, we continue to experience broad strength in our traditional markets, consistent with macro data points such as PMI and industrial production.  
Pricing contributed 230 to 260 basis points to growth in the third quarter of 2021, up from 80 to 110 basis points in the second quarter. This reflects actions taken year-to-date to mitigate the increases we are seeing in product, particularly steel; and transportation, particularly overseas shipping. Inflation continued to rise over the course of the third quarter of 2021, particularly for overseas containers and shipping services. While we have a range of efforts underway to mitigate the impacts of inflation on our customers' costs, further price actions may also be necessary in the fourth quarter of 2021.  
Aside from inflation, and as Dan discussed, our marketplace continues to experience tight supply chains and labor shortages. These disruptions impacted customer production more in the third quarter of 2021 than the previous quarter, and the increase in COVID infections exacerbated these challenges. These trends seem likely to persist in the near term. To address these, we will continue to lean on technology and branch initiatives to improve productivity and an organizational culture that empowers local leaders to sustain high service levels. And while the supply chain remains elongated, we do expect an inflow of imported product in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 that should sustain our high product availability and reduce the impact of fill-in buys.  
Now to Slide 7. Operating margin in the third quarter of 2021 was 20.5%, flat versus the third quarter of 20 -- sorry, the third quarter of 2020. Gross margin was 46.3% in the third quarter of 2021, up 100 basis points versus the third quarter of 2020. This relates to 2 items: first, we experienced good leverage of overhead and organizational expenses due to strong product demand and growth; second, we had better product margin, primarily in safety products. Lower margin COVID-affected PPE was a smaller proportion of total safety sales versus last year, and the margin on those COVID-affected products increased.  
Product and customer mix did not impact gross margins in the third quarter of 2021 versus the prior year, in contrast to the favorable impact experienced in the second quarter of 2021. Relatively strong fastener growth allowed positive product mix to offset the negative impact of strong on-site growth on customer mix, but the gap was narrower sequentially, a trend that is likely to persist. While the impact of pricing in the third quarter of 2021 exceeded our original expectations, inflation and shipping costs similarly exceeded our expectations. As a result, price/cost continued to be largely neutral in our gross margins in the third quarter of 2021.  
The increase in gross margin was offset by operating expenses growing faster than sales. Part of this is due to the comparison, as third quarter 2020 operating expense leverage still reflected COVID-related low labor intensity sales versus current sales being generated in a more traditional high-touch manner. Just as relevant, however, is the role of cost resets. In the first year of a manufacturing recovery, it is typical for various operating expenses to have an outsized recovery. We're experiencing that in 2021, including in the third quarter, but also believe that the breadth of resets are unusually wide. For instance, we are seeing a 40% increase in incentive pay, but we're also seeing a 50% increase in fuel costs, a 165% increase in travel expenses and a 45% increase in health care costs. The nature of past downturns and recoveries would not have necessarily led to so dramatic a rise, particularly in the latter 2 items.  
As with last quarter, deleveraging operating expenses in the third quarter of 2021 is a function of anniversary-ing the first periods of pandemic-related cost savings measures combined with a strongly recovering marketplace. Similar dynamics are likely to play out in the fourth quarter of 2021, although not likely on the same order of magnitude, and we anticipate being able to leverage in 2022 for a comparable level of growth. Putting it all together, we reported third quarter 2021 EPS of $0.42, up from $0.38 in the third quarter of 2020.  
Turning to Slide 8. Operating cash flow was $168 million in the third quarter of 2021, down 32% annually and 68.8% of net income. We paid roughly $30 million in payroll taxes, which were deferred from 2020 as part of pandemic-related legislation. The bigger impact on our conversion, however, was an increase in working capital. Year-over-year, accounts receivable was up 13.8%. This reflects strong customer demand and a shift away from PPE surge buyers last year and to our traditional customers this year that slightly blended up days outstanding.  
Inventory was up 4.4%. We did see meaningful reduction in our three-ply mask inventory in the third quarter of 2021 and anticipate clearing out this inventory in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for this, inventory would have been up 6.2%. We continue to clean out slow-moving hub and branch inventory, closed branches and shift our stocking focus in the field. We believe these represent improvements in our working capital that will be sustained. That is being offset by product installation and to a lesser degree, product flowing into our network. We have a significant amount of imported products in transit and we expect to see product availability in our hubs improve over the next couple of quarters.  
In the current environment, this is how we are utilizing our balance sheet to support customer service and growth. 
Net capital spending in the third quarter of 2021 was $47 million, up from $34 million in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting spending on a non-hub construction project in Winona. We have lowered our 2021 net capital spending range to $155 million to $175 million, down from $170 million to $200 million, as supply chain difficulties are limiting our purchases of vehicles, branch supplies and other products. From a liquidity standpoint, we finished the third quarter of 2021 with debt at 11% of total capital and net debt at 3.4% of total capital. Net debt is up from 2.2% in the year-ago period and 5.1% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Essentially, all of our revolver remains available for use.  
That's all for our formal presentation. So with that, operator, we will take questions."

If you look at -- so we have a variety of supply chain partners, some of which are domestic supply chain partners, and they might be selling us, in many cases, branded product and that might be a domestically manufactured or North American-manufactured or a globally manufactured item. And then you have the items that are more commodity in makeup and fasteners is a high player in that, that tend to be produced offshore, and that's been the case for 60, 70 years. 
And as you can appreciate, we upped our safety stock and the depth of inventory we have on domestically sourced product. And if I think of our supply chain, if I think of our distribution centers and our service level that we measure with fulfillment to our branch network, we're at a very good spot there. It's product that we bring in from overseas that is manufactured overseas. And one thing that helps us in the process, and we've gotten some grief from over the years from the analyst community and justifiably so, we carry a lot of inventory. And we have inventory spread across 3,400 locations, branch Onsites and distribution centers. And so that gives us some resiliency that a lot of our peers don't have. But no, it's crushingly bad right now on product coming in that has to go through a port and we're not immune to that. 
We just have maybe a little more resourcefulness locally because some business models are so leveraged to scale that when things get tough, they kind of fall apart. Our model is leveraged to scale. But when things get tough, our local folks step up and fill in the gaps, but it's brutally hard work."

I think the biggest risk for some of the smaller and the folks that don't have as deep a supply chain is actually only now popping its head up because my perception is some of that fill-in buying activity of stuff that's imported by others that proves to be fill-in buys, that product is becoming more scarce in the marketplace, which I believe puts us in an even better position to be serving our customer and not going through Herculean efforts to make it happen."

But given that day situation, is there any thoughts you can give us relative to the roughly $400 million SG&A you reported in the third quarter? How we should be thinking about the fourth quarter SG&A?"

And so on a sequential basis, yes, we would lose a couple of selling days and then that's leverage that you do give up on top of the seasonality, right, fourth quarter is just typically not quite as active a period as occurs in the third quarter, but that happens every year. 
I think if you look at history, history would suggest that the -- you would expect flat to down 3%, give or take. And that really depends heavily on compensation costs, right? Whether you're flat or down 3% is really driven by compensation costs, which makes sense because it's 70% of our operating expense line. 
I will note, I think that whereas we have a difficult comparison from a days standpoint, we do have a little bit of an easy comparison from a wages standpoint. We had some wages that were deferred into Q4 last year and we will not necessarily replicate that this year. So that creates a little bit of an easier comparison. And I do think that we'll have somewhat lower growth on days and lower gross margin, et cetera. And if you bank all that in, honestly, I think somewhere within that normal range still makes sense to me, David."

And Holden touched on the actual statistics. I'll tell you -- I'll touch on the anecdote piece. 
So if I go back in time, 3 years, 4 years ago, and I'd be out traveling, probably the only place I would hear about things that we were doing that were noteworthy as it related to either government and -- government or health care, I'd be traveling down in Florida, and Bob Hopper would be telling me about a K-12 school district that he had -- we were doing business with or that had expanded, and perhaps I'd visit a site. And we had a lot of -- we have a lot of Onsites in K-12 school districts, in the Southeast, particularly in Florida early on. And then Bob will tell everybody about it and pretty soon everybody else is kind of dabbling in it and finding success there. And then we moved into expansion in some of the higher ed and sign some Onsites. 
One thing that stands out for me when I think of the last 9 months is I periodically hear -- and it's not just coming from Bob anymore, but I periodically hear about a health care facility that we just signed up as an Onsite. So far, most of those that I've heard about have been tethered to a university, but seeing traction there. Now the numbers are incredibly small, don't get me wrong, in the scheme of things. But that's not something I heard about 15 and 20 months ago, that I am hearing about as we go through each quarter of 2021. And I see that as a positive because it widens the basket of potential customers out there. 
The other thing that stands out, Holden and I have ongoing conversations with our team about metropolitan areas and what's our plan for -- last Friday, we went through Minneapolis in the Saint Paul area, what's our plan for this market. Every one of those discussions now include a discussion about some traction we're getting on the government and educational fronts and health care fronts as it relates to business activity and Onsite. And again, you would have to [ draw out the ] people in the past. Now it's offered up, it's a growth opportunity in individual markets. With that, we'll take the next question."

And the most acute part for us we're -- we build pipelines, we build sales pipelines, we build pipelines of talent. And our best pipeline for talent over the last 50 years has been get somebody with a year or 2 years left of college, or is it going to -- whether that's a 4-year state college or a 2-year technical college, ask them to come work for us. Tell them, hey, we'll give you some experience, you get some cash coming in, which is always helpful to a student. And we're looking at 15 to 20 hours a week. But what we're really doing is dating, with the thought process being when you graduate we think you will like us and we think we'll like you, and we'll get married. And then you'll join your Blue Team and grow your career. 
That's a tough recruiting model in the last 1.5 years because if colleges close and kids go home, well, we need to -- our model is to hire them when they're at school and not when they're 3 hours away and at home. So that just devastated that. Kids are back in school now. Now we're only a month basically, a month and maybe 5 weeks into school. We haven't seen an uptick that I can tangibly put my finger on. Most of it is anecdotal. I believe that piece of hiring will get better. And I don't know if I believe that because I'm being a glass half-full optimist and I'm just wrong or I believe it because I think a lot of people hunger to get back to some sense of normalcy. And part of it is, hey, I need a part time job in college but it's not planned."

As you can appreciate, sometimes at quarter end or during the quarter, you're looking at so many different things that I don't want to give you inaccurate information. What I can tell you is the buffer we're building into our supply chain for import is dramatic. And it's measured in weeks, not in days. 
And those weeks are -- I could almost say it in months rather than weeks. But it's a -- and I'm trying to stall so Holden can look it up, but I don't think I'm going to get that luxury. But suffice it to say, it's weakened out. And yesterday with our Board, I'll share an insight I posed to them. And that is, as an organization, one of the Board's obligations to the shareholders is to manage risk. And one of the things I said to the Board from a risk standpoint that we have to be acutely aware of -- and I don't know if acutely aware of is 6 months from now or 6 years from now because I honestly don't know how this is going to work its way out because a lot of capacity was taken out from the steamship lines last year. And part of the issue is the capacity just isn't there. 
So is this something that's part of our new normal that we're going to have this kind of consternation that we need to build an extra 30 or 45 days of time into supply chain? The risk is when that flips -- and again, I don't know if it's 6 months from now or 6 years from now, when that flips, we have to be acutely aware it's happening when it's happening. Because right now, we sell $13 million worth of inventory a day. If all of a sudden, stuff comes in 3 weeks faster, 4 weeks faster, you get -- well, $13 million times 20 business days in a month is $260 million. So you could add $100 million, $200 million, $250 million of inventory really fast if you're not dialed in and managing it. And -- but it's measured in weeks. And I apologize, we don't have it at our fingertip. But a 30- to 45-day window wouldn't surprise me, but I just don't have the accurate number in my fingertips."

I mean when we started this, we had a smaller cohort of Onsites that did between $1.8 million and $2 million in revenue per site. And today, frankly, that's probably more in the $1.45 million annualized level. And that's an improvement over last year. And frankly, it's actually an improvement over 2019 as well. So we have begun to see that improvement occur.  
It's one of those things, I think, is relevant to talk about because we talk about the signings being somewhat weaker. But that team in the Onsite group, we've seen the average size go up. We've actually seen the margin on that group go up. And we've seen the inventory on hand actually decline in terms of days on hand number. 
So we've talked a lot about as you sort of get out of this hyper growth process into sort of more of a fast growth process that comes with a certain level of productivity and efficiency, we have seen that over the last 12 months. And so when we get back to being able to sign 375 to 400 when the market normalizes, I think we are doing so off of a larger, more productive base. And I think that's an exciting development. Does that answer the question? Or did I miss a point of it?"

In September, so total transit time for deliveries in August hit a Fastenal record 58 days. And September was trending higher at the time they provided this update, this was a couple of weeks ago. If I look at that back in the first quarter of 2020, which is the earliest bars on my chart here, that number was in the 30s as far as days. And this includes both the transit time to the port and then the average time discharged from port to destination. So it's not just what it takes to cross the ocean and get to the port, and are you sitting there for 10 days or 9 days out in the ocean Rockport off Southern Cal or wherever it might be. But then getting it through the terminal and transferred. 
And probably the thing that jumps out the most for me is in the -- typically, when we're negotiating rates, that's a rate that goes from the port in the original country to our destination, which is our distribution center. And the steamship lines handle that entire journey. 35% of our containers coming in, in the third quarter, we actually couldn't get them to the destination because they weren't available because there's such a shortage of containers. 35% had to be manually unloaded at the port, loaded on a semi and driven to our distribution center. And everything you read about is what's happening with the container cost coming from overseas, that doesn't include that layer of expense because putting it on a semi and driving it across North America is a lot more expensive than the container going on a train and going across North America. 
And that actually, I mean, we see a fourfold increase in container costs year-over-year. If you added that piece in, the increase is more like sixfold. But that's 35% of our containers coming in. The only silver lining in that is that 35% was 45% in August, and it was 28% in September. So I don't know if it's coming down and it's going to continue that trend because 1 month isn't a trend, it's a data point. But that's been a brutal piece of the inflation as well. 
I see we're at 5 minutes before the hour. I trust we've answered most of the questions satisfactorily. And if you have any follow-up, Holden and I are around for the balance of the day. 
I would put one quick call out to the Fastenal team. EHS Today recognized Fastenal, along with 9 other organizations, as America's -- as one of America's safest companies. And I want to say to our EH&S (sic) [ EHS&S ] team, our safety teams that developed our plan and our employees that honor and respect that plan, thanks for keeping each other safe in 2020. Thanks for what you did for society, and congratulations on the recognition. Take care, everybody."
