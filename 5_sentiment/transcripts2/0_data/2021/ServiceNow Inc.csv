Thank you for joining us for ServiceNow's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our fourth quarter 2020 financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the first quarter of 2021 and full year 2021. 
Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call, particularly our guidance, is based on information as of January 27, 2021, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. The guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as for the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating. Those assumptions are based on the facts we know today. Many of these assumptions relate to matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly including, but not limited to, the time frames for and severity of social distancing and other mitigation requirements, the continued impact of COVID-19 on customers' purchasing decisions, and the length of our sales cycle particularly for customers in certain industries. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and MD&A sections of our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and our 10-K that will be filed for the fiscal year 2020, for information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. 
We'd also like to point out that the company presents non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute, for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, net income; remaining performance obligations or RPO, and current RPO or CRPO. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to our press release filed earlier today and our investor presentation and for prior quarters' previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com. 
A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill."

Let me begin by extending my hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. Having confronted an unprecedented global environment, we are looking ahead with optimism and are thankful to be so well positioned to serve our customers. 
Needless to say, we delivered a market-leading 2020. We significantly beat expectations across the board, bringing great momentum into the new year. I could not be prouder of our team's execution. We delivered over 30% organic top line growth, 25% operating margins and $1.4 billion in free cash flow, just an outstanding performance and a testament to our ServiceNow Strong culture. 
Throughout the year, we led with courage and conviction. We took care of our team, our customers and our communities. And most importantly, we led with ServiceNow's purpose to make the world of work work better for people. We strive to see the world for our customer's eyes with empathy to address their needs. 
The workflow revolution is happening, and the pandemic is accelerating digital transformation. Every business needs speed, agility and resilience, and every C-suite leader wants to deliver great experiences for their employees and their customers. Businesses are changing the way they operate. They need to deliver fierce customer loyalty and deep employee engagement to win. It's all about people, empathy at mass scale as the business imperative of the 21st century. The secular tailwinds of digital transformation, cloud computing and business model innovation have all intersected at a perfect moment in time. A paradigm shift is happening worldwide. 
In 2020, for the first time in history, we saw digital transformation spending accelerate despite GDP declining globally. Digital investments are at an all-time high and are expected to continue growing. According to IDC, worldwide digital transformation investments will total more than $7.4 trillion by 2044. the digital economy is firing on all cylinders. 
ServiceNow is the platform company for digital business. The Now Platform, what I call the platform of platforms, offers the speed, flexibility and innovation companies need. Our simple low-code app development enables fast workflows to solve any business challenge, delivering consumer-grade digital experiences. And Now Platform enables easier and faster implementation, delivering unbeatable time to value and fast ROI. That's the beauty of the Now Platform: one platform, one data model and one architecture. We seamlessly integrated all of this and through our system. 
And that system integrates seamlessly with all systems of record that matter most to our customers. We deliver workflows through their preferred collaboration platform as well. We give our customers the freedom of choice to use their preferred tools and the unique ability to build apps at record speed. 
Hungry and nimble is a core ServiceNow value. It's proven now or never. We are grateful to be in such a strong position at such a pivotal moment, and we are hungry. We are eager to use our strengths to help our customers succeed, help make our community stronger and help create great experiences for people. 
We are seeing an extraordinary expansion of use cases in our business. Health care organizations are using ServiceNow to improve operations and service delivery, which means better outcomes for people. St. Jude Children's Hospital has been on a journey to accelerate progress towards finding cures and saving children. In 2020, COVID-19 created a significant headwind to that mission. With much of the hospital staff required to work from home, the need to digitize manual workflows became more important than ever. The hospital leveraged ServiceNow's low-code app engine and innovation to integrate disparate systems and build custom end-to-end workflows, ultimately allowing them to ensure seamless delivery of clinical services. In under 4 weeks the ServiceNow solution was implemented at St. Jude's Children's Hospital and everybody was moving toward their goal. 
We're also proud to be supporting NHS Scotland in their efforts to vaccinate 5.5 million citizens. NHS Scotland is using the Now Platform and our customer workflow to deploy a customized solution designed to meet their specific needs. Deployment took only 6 weeks, showing the agility of the Now Platform. ServiceNow is enabling a comprehensive solution for the schedule and reporting of vaccination for Scotland's most vulnerable citizens. Within 12 hours of rollout, NHS Scotland booked over 220,000 appointments. 
So as you can see, it's not just about business workflows. It's about real people, enterprise digital transformation with how every organization in every sector in every geo are adapting, growing, creating new business models and empowering their people to be productive in any environment and in condition. That's modern, agile, resilient business at work. And it's being powered by the Now Platform. Our unique platform and innovative product suite, our strong brand, high customer satisfaction and compelling value proposition are the differentiating factors and competitive advantages fueling our performance. 
Our Q4 results are testament. We dreamed big and delivered. We grew billings by more than 40% year-over-year organically. We delivered 89 deals greater than $1 million and now have close to 1,100 customers paying us over $1 million annually. We landed our largest deal ever, surpassing the deal record we set in Q3 with the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. Deal sizes overall keep getting larger. Our renewal rate remained best in class at 99%. Here are some key customer wins from Q4. 
We signed a multiyear and multi-product strategic deal with AT&T. They are transforming by focusing on broadband connectivity, 5G and software-based entertainment while relentlessly focusing on digital, consumer preferences and experiences. 
We're delighted to work with AT&T Communications in its transformation. ServiceNow's AI-powered platform and service operations product lines will provide AT&T accurate and real-time operational visibility into every layer of the network fabric and help deliver the best-in-class customer experience, better experiences for people enabled by ServiceNow. 
One of the U.K.'s big 4 banks is using multiple ServiceNow products, including our purpose-built new financial services operations product to help transform the way it operates and to deliver better customer experiences. The bank has seen a 70% efficiency and improvement of payment processing by integrating the Now Platform into its core banking systems. With ServiceNow, this bank implemented new automated processes in 60 workdays. In their words, employees moved from cut and paste, swivel chair manual processes to efficient, automated workflows. In one case, employees went from managing 10 requests an hour to 1,000 requests in 3 minutes on the Now Platform, better experiences for people. 
PayPal recently expanded their relationship with ServiceNow as a key partner for elements of their digital transformation. And we're proud to have expanded our relationship with Nike, who is using the Now Platform to create better customer and employee experiences. Other Q4 deals across our portfolio represented wins with major customers in key sectors such as Booking.com in travel and hospitality, BP in energy, Santander U.K. and USAA in financial services. 
And the list goes on and on. I hear so many ServiceNow success stories every day. Companies are onboarding thousands of people in a work from home environment, making them feel productive and part of the team from day 1. Customers are going live on the new platform in days, not months, making a difference for people now, not next month or next year. Now. More productive employees, happier customers, more efficient operations, there is not a CEO on the planet who doesn't want that. The Now Platform delivers. 
These examples show how technology is no longer supporting the business technology in the business. Our IT leadership in workflows gives us a uniquely strong foundation to be the leading platform for digital transformation across the enterprise. In Q4, IT workflow products remained strong. ITSM delivered 17 deals over $1 million. Our AI and machine learning capabilities embedded within our Pro SKU continue to resonate with our customers. ITSM Pro penetration is now over 20%. And the AI/ML capabilities of our Pro SKUs are automating processes to allow people to focus on the work that really matters. We saw a 3x increase in usage of our virtual agent technology in 2020. 
And our Element AI acquisition underscores our commitment to being the leader in AI-enabled workflows. Element AI's deep bench of world-class scientists and practitioners will accelerate our AI innovation on the Now Platform, delivering not only better capabilities for it, but for employee and customer experiences as well. ITOM was included in 16 of the top 20 deals and had 15 deals over $1 million. 
Risk had a very strong Q4, booking more wins than all of the prior year combined. Our ability to manage risk is really resonating with customers. ServiceNow is no longer viewed as back-end IT-oriented solution. We're now seen as a strategic partner that impacts the entire business. 
Customer workflows is our next $1 billion-plus market opportunity for ServiceNow, and Q4 showed strong momentum. Customer workflows were included in 11 of our top 20 deals, driving such wins as AT&T. 10 of our customer workflow deals were greater than $1 million. 
In this pandemic, the employee experience is more important than ever, and our employee workflows is seeing strong demand. In Q4, 11 of our top 20 deals included employee workflows. 
The pandemic is creating the greatest workflow challenge of our time, and ServiceNow is responding with agility speed and continuous innovation. We began last spring, as you'll remember, with our emergency response apps helping the state of Washington and many others respond to COVID. We fast followed that release with our Safe Workplace suite of apps that has demonstrated the power of the Now Platform and great employee workflows that we can deliver very quickly. In fact, more than 900 organizations now have downloaded the suite already. 
This week, we just launched the first in a suite of planned vaccine administration applications to deliver out-of-the-box functionality for our customers. Our comprehensive approach enables workflow solutions to the complex challenges of vaccine distribution, administration and monitoring. As we have done with Safe Workplace, we will be delivering continuous innovation with our vaccine administration management applications. I'm excited to announce that the state of North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services is already leveraging the ServiceNow platform to power its COVID vaccine management system to help quickly and efficiently vaccinate 10 million North Carolinians. 
President Biden has declared the distribution of COVID vaccines a top priority for his administration. This is one of the great workflow challenges of our time. As we are doing right now in Scotland, North Carolina and many other places, ServiceNow is ready to ensure vaccine distribution, administration and monitoring that it's simple, it's fast and it's effective. It will be so at the federal, state and local level.
In summary, we had an outstanding close to 2020, and we are not slowing down. We are changing the world one workflow at a time, and our vision is really resonating. C-level executives realize that behind every great experience is a great workflow. Our company is hitting on all cylinders. 
In 2020, we grew our global workflows by 26%, hiring 3,000 people in 25 countries, with most hired and onboarded digitally. We are hiring incredible talent, including some of the greatest minds in the AI industry. 
Our culture is incredibly strong. Our employee engagement is at historic highs. So too is our employee retention. Our brand is strong. C-suite awareness increased in double digits. 
Our innovation pipeline is robust. We delivered 70% more features and innovations on the platform in 2020. 
Our partner ecosystem is expanding. IBM, Microsoft, Accenture, Deloitte, EY, KPMG and all the great partners in India, and many others have joined the workflow revolution with us. Together, we're bringing the innovation speed of a start-up with the scale and reach of a rapidly growing $5 billion-plus pure-play SaaS company. 
And our RPO is nearly double that at $9 billion. We're the only born in the cloud software company to have reached this size with our large-scale M&A. And we have a clear path to achieve our $10 billion revenue target. 
We are also deeply committed to making the world of work work better for people to helping our customers succeed. We are deeply committed to making the world work better, too. Gina will share more about our focus on elevating our global impact. I'm incredibly proud of our just announced $100 million investment in an impact fund benefiting underserved communities. 
And we're deeply committed to being a leader in building a diverse, inclusive workforce in which everyone feels that they belong. Because diverse teams with an indomitable will to win create great companies. ServiceNow is such a company, and we are well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. That's our dream, and we will pursue it tirelessly with courage, passion and conviction. 
Thank you. Over to you, Gina."

I want to start off by echoing Bill's praise for all the employees of ServiceNow. It has been a year of unprecedented challenges, but the team has remained focused on executing and meeting the needs of our customers. I couldn't be more impressed with our resilience, which is a testament to our great culture here at ServiceNow. 
And it's thanks to our people that we delivered another fantastic quarter to cap a strong year. We exceeded the high end of our subscription revenues and subscription billings guidance, which carried through to strong free cash flow generation. 
Q4 subscription revenues were $1.184 billion, representing 32% year-over-year growth, inclusive of a 3-point tailwind from FX. Q4 subscription billings were very strong at $1.828 billion, representing 41% year-over-year growth and $183 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. Adjusted growth was 38% year-over-year. 
The outperformance was driven by tremendous execution from our sales team, which resulted in significant net new ACV upside for the quarter as well as $80 million of billings pulled forward from 2021 due to early customer payments. We believe the high levels of early payments were onetime in nature as a result of customers having excess cash at the end of the year, given the incremental cost savings enterprises saw from COVID. Excluding these early payments, normalized Q4 billings would have grown 35% year-over-year, still well ahead of our guidance. 
Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $8.9 billion, representing 35% year-over-year growth. And current RPO was approximately $4.4 billion, representing 33% year-over-year growth. FX was about a 3-point tailwind. 
The traction we are seeing in our top line results reflect our focus on meeting the needs of our customers and their employees. As Bill noted, the workflow revolution is underway and is centered around the best experiences. And that's the Now Platform's super power, the ability to deliver workflows that create those great experiences for people. The Now Platform is playing a critical role in accelerating digital transformation. We're treating our customers as partners, listening and learning about their challenges so we can help solve them. We aren't selling point products. We're providing them with comprehensive solutions with measurable results and quick time to value. Better together, that's the power of our portfolio. 
It's this attention to our customers' needs that's driving our best-in-class renewal rate of 99%, demonstrating the stickiness of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. Our sales teams continued to win bigger deals in Q4, including our largest deal ever, which is 3x the size of our previous largest deal. 
We closed 89 deals greater than $1 million in ACV in the quarter, with average deal sizes up 18% year-over-year. In 2020, we added nearly 700 net new customers, ending the year with almost 6,900 enterprises. The number of customers paying us $5 million or more in ACV grew over 40% in fiscal 2020. Customers are realizing the strategic value of combining ServiceNow IT workflows with everything from HR, CSM and our App Engine to deliver greater value across the enterprise. Our ability to land new logos and expand our existing relationships amid a pandemic further validate the strength of our platform and the value we're delivering to enterprise C-suite.
Turning to profitability. Q4 operating margin was 22%, a 100 basis point beat versus our guidance, driven by our strong top line outperformance. Year-over-year, our Q4 operating margin was consistent with last year as lower T&E expenses were offset by planned incremental R&D investments and marketing spend on pipeline generation. Our free cash flow margin was 45%, up 900 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower T&E spend and strong collection. 
For full year 2020, operating margin was 25%, up 300 basis points year-over-year. And free cash flow was 32%, up 400 basis points year-over-year. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. 
Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the macro trends we're seeing in the business. The highly affected industries we outlined early last year, which represented about 20% of our business, continue to see macro headwinds but remained resilient. 3 of our top 20 deals in the quarter were from highly impacted industries, including retail, automotive and energy. We do expect headwinds in some severely impacted industries to persist in 2021. However, retention of existing customers remained very strong in Q4. 
Overall, we're entering 2021 with strong secular tailwinds created by a surge in demand for digital transformation. Our pipeline continues to look healthy, and our brand continues to resonate with enterprise leaders. ServiceNow is exceptionally well positioned to seize this opportunity. We have the unique platform and innovative product suite businesses need, the workflow standard for enterprise transformation.
Turning to guidance. For transparency and clarity, I'd like to call out a few items. First, as I noted earlier, we saw $80 million in early payments from customers in Q4, which was an approximately 200 basis point tailwind to full year subscription billings growth in 2020. These result in a more significant headwind of about 350 basis points for 2021 billings growth. To be clear, these early payments have no effect on the timing of revenue. We've also previously talked about how early renewals and success with very large customers were impacting billing cycles as they can add additional volatility to timing and duration. This makes billings a less reliable leading indicator of top line growth. 
Given this noise and to provide investors with even greater transparency, we're introducing quarterly CRPO guidance. We believe CRPO will provide better visibility and is a more consistent indicator of business performance, normalizing for timing and duration noise. We will continue to provide billings guidance throughout 2021 as a transition period. 
Second, the need to digitally transform has been accelerated by the current macro environment, creating a very large opportunity for ServiceNow. With the savings we are recognizing from our more efficient operating environment, we're continuing to invest in R&D and quota-bearing resources to drive innovation and pipeline to fuel our tremendous organic growth engine, ensuring that we maintain our market leadership and are well positioned to take advantage of the digital acceleration. These investments include those we were making in AI, such as the acquisition of Element AI. Similar to previous investments and successful growth initiatives like our Pro Skus or geographic expansion, we will be disciplined about our spend. 
Beyond our business investments, we will also be investing in people and communities. We've always been focused on diversity, inclusion and belonging. And as Bill noted, we recently announced our first ever $100 million investment in a racial equity fund to build equitable opportunity for Black communities. This investment is expected to earn a solid return while facilitating sustainable wealth creation through homeownership, entrepreneurship and neighborhood revitalization. 
Finally, COVID cases have been spiking in recent weeks, and some regions have reentered lockdown protocols. While we haven't seen any significant impact on our business, we will continue to monitor and be transparent in our disclosures throughout 2021. 
With that in mind, for Q1, we expect subscription revenues between $1.275 billion and $1.28 billion, representing 28% to 29% year-over-year growth, including a 4-point FX tailwind. 
We expect subscription billings between $1.31 billion and $1.315 billion, representing 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early payments from customers in 2020, our Q1 normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 32% year-over-year. Growth includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 4 points. 
We expect CRPO growth of 32% year-over-year, including a 5-point FX tailwind. We expect an operating margin of 25% and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. 
For the full year 2021, we expect subscription revenues between $5.48 billion and $5.5 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth, including a 3-point FX tailwind. We expect subscription billings between $6.205 billion and $6.225 billion, representing 25% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our 2021 normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 28% to 29% year-over-year growth. This growth reflects an acceleration in net new ACV in 2021, and it also includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 2 points. 
We expect subscription gross margin of 85%, reflecting some federal and public sector customers moving to our newly launched Azure offering as well as increased support for customers impacted by new and evolving data residency requirements. We expect an operating margin of 23.5%, representing 150 basis points expansion off of our pre-COVID 2020 run rate. I would note that this is also an incremental 50 basis points more than the 100 basis points of expansion we target each year. Finally, we expect free cash flow margin of 30% and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the year.
In summary, in 2020 we delivered a combination of both strong top line growth and profitability, an incredible accomplishment in a COVID environment. Our outstanding results continue to demonstrate our strong product portfolio, our focus on building deep customer relationships and our commitment to enabling their digital transformation. We're delivering great experiences that drive powerful employee engagement, fierce customer loyalty and significant productivity gains. We are the platform company for digital business. 
I'm extremely proud of our team's performance and our unrelenting execution in a turbulent year. We can't thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication. We're well on our way to becoming a $10 billion revenue company on the strength of incredible organic innovation. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2021.

And ce",535,"Well, thank you very much, Sterling. This is Bill. What you're seeing out there is each industry has its own nuances. For example in financial services, I talked about security. Obviously, the future of work is a big movement to work from anywhere. And certainly enable that modern work environment and do that in a way where people can be onboarded without actually even meeting them, train them appropriately, and do the ongoing management of people where they can truly execute their mission and they know all the information and they have all the data to do their job. 
So this it's happening in every industry, and it's happened in every geo, and each persona has its own unique needs. What we think is unique about ServiceNow is that this platform, think of it as the workflow automation platform, comprehends all the opportunities with App Engine to customize things very rapidly like vaccine management, for example.  It also offers the IntegrationHub, and what the IntegrationHub enables is all the things from RPA, process mining, API integration, process analytics, native mobile, contextual interfaces and all the other things that CIOs and leaders of businesses are counting on to create end-to-end continuity in the business. 
And that's what makes us so unique. So having that platform advantage and our well-known position in IT is equally as relevant with the employee experience, because now you have one portal with a consumer-grade UX. All the complexity of hidden. All the onboarding caring for the employee is done. And they are right off and running with their mission.  In some cases, I have one very high level executive tell me, ""I haven't met the 5,000 people I hired this year because of the Now Platform."" 
And then on customer service management, in every industry, I gave the AT&T example as one, you're seeing the frictionless business environment really take off. So how do we deal with the end consumer and do so directly in a way that enables our services to be consumed. 
So you're seeing this ease of use around ServiceNow. You're seeing the virtual agent guide people through subscription processes. And you're seeing all of our deep machine learning and AI help the customer navigate their sign-on processes and so forth. 
And the workflow then becomes the exception because humans shouldn't have to get involved in these processes unless the computer didn't get the job done. And that gives us such an advantage because we're seeing situations where we can literally consolidate hundreds of systems to the Now Platform, take out huge costs, give the customer a great experience, and obviously not put so much pressure on human capital because people are only engaged when they're absolutely necessary in the customer satisfaction process. 
So you're seeing a mass consolidation of all the old stuff to the Now Platform. You're seeing IT, employee, customer and all the App Engine and IntegrationHub opportunities really come together on one common platform, one data model and one architecture. So it's now a solutions company. It's now selling a suite. And the broad spectrum of offerings gives us reach to the whole C-level executive team, not just one persona on the executive team."

I was wondering if you could just drill down a little bit more on, a, the visibility into that; and b, anything that's bubbling up in in terms of -- this seems to be a greater emphasis to drive that net new ACV. What area? 
The follow-on question I want to direct to you, Bill, if I could. Last year, you were pretty clear that acquisitions was not part of your strategy. Maybe some tuck-ins here and there. '21 the new year, lots of changes, the digital landscape is a greater priority. Is there any change in your thoughts as you're considering how ServiceNow could effectively build that long-term model as it relates to M&A.? That's it for me."
22967487,700352503,2183006,"ServiceNow, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","ServiceNow, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Well, thank you very much, Keith. Maybe I'll start off and then give Gina a chance to build as she wishes on the net new ACV inquiry. First of all, I'll just say that net new ACV on a year-over-year basis will increase. And the pipelines that we ha",554,"Yes. Well, thank you very much, Keith. Maybe I'll start off and then give Gina a chance to build as she wishes on the net new ACV inquiry. 
First of all, I'll just say that net new ACV on a year-over-year basis will increase. And the pipelines that we have in the company, and we manage the company on what we call the CEO of dashboards in real time, give us much greater coverage than we had last year. So we know that the facts substantiate the net new ACV increase. 
One of the interesting things that is fascinating is actually our executive briefings have increased 70% on a year-over-year basis. So if you think about our ability to get to the C-suite and increase the contact in this kind of virtual environment, it's actually gone way up. So a lot of people, I guess, need a good meeting, and they want to figure out how they're going to digitally transform. And the Now Platform has just dynamite tailwind, Keith. 
Now in terms of the whole digital landscape, IDC, I think, the $7.4 trillion is very interesting statistic. This is factual. If you just look at the way companies are prioritizing their investments, the one thing that's not going to get deprioritized is digital transformation and things that enable digital business. Because it's really the only way to either get yourself competitive or to increase your competitive advantage in your peer group, and every CEO completely understands that. 
And within that context, I think the uniqueness of ServiceNow to have so much momentum, not just in exciting new areas like the future of work with our employee experience or customer service management which is really a frictionless economy now more and more coming Servicenow's way. But even in our core with IT, you look at our ITSM core business, it's outgrown our internal expectations by a lot. And you're seeing with the Pro SKU where we add on the machine learning and the AI capabilities on a platform approach, that too is growing fast. 
And our engineering team is incredible here. I mean the level of innovation they're pushing out was 70% increase 2020 over 2019. And we have major releases coming this year commensurate with what we did last year. 
So I wanted to give you a lot of confidence that the net new ACV is going up. The customers are buying, and the pipeline is super strong. 
And here's one thing that I found fascinating. There was a study done by Deloitte. And with all this digital transformation, a lot of executives are looking back and saying, ""Hey, why didn't I get a better return on all I put into digital?"" And what they found is that about 3/4 of the digital transformation projects didn't give the yielded return on investment that they had hoped for, and the #1 root cause was integration. 
So as you think about the Now Platform integrating with 550 systems of record out of the box and all the collaboration tools, no matter which one the customer likes, and have that completely synchronized into the Now Platform out of the box, and you're up and running in days, it's [kind of] an attractive value proposition to our customers and even noncustomers that want to jump on board."

We've gotten tremendous people into the organization to put all the value into the Now Platform and to generate net new revenue growth in the SKUs, such as what we did with IT, we'll do with employee, we'll do with customer, and obviously we'll do with the low-code no-code innovation that we can give to the creator, which is literally a business analyst or anyone that wants to write a low-code application in an enterprise. 
So the way we look at large-scale or larger scale M&A, we wouldn't be doing our job if we didn't look at every opportunity to satisfy our customers and our shareholders. But it's important just to register with you that our projection on the $10 billion is clearly in hand with our organic innovation and the momentum we have in the marketplace with our customers and also the noncustomers that want to join the team. 
So there's nothing on the table right now for a larger deal, but it's not like we don't have our eyes wide open at the various opportunities. And if they ever presented themselves, you would know that we thought through it rigorously and it was part of our strategic imperative to really do the best we can for our shareholders and our customers. But right now, that is not on the table, and it's not something that's actionable at this time."

You had a good few guys that just kind of struggled with that one. 
And then let's start with one for Bill. Bill, ITSM Pro should give you like a -- we see the early momentum there. You talked about a 20% penetration. Just how does it help you on the expansion and the renewal and the conversations you get with clients as a really good tool to engage the client base?"

And so you might take it out of 2020 and add it back into 2021. And so it's about a 200 basis points tailwind to 2020, but then about a 350 basis headwind in '21. 
So we try to do all the math for you so that is pretty clear. And just to be clear that these were early customer payments, and we feel like it's onetime in nature. And it was really a result of our hub customers having excess cash, driven by the OpEx savings that we said they were seeing in 2020. And so I hope that, that clarifies to you, Raimo."

First of all, it's growing in steep double digits, very important. And while we've penetrated 20%, that means we still have 80% to go. So we really, really want the growth opportunity from a shareholder value creation perspective. 
But what you're looking at is the remote IT services requests growing exponentially, and many of the IT organizations out there are looking for ways to deflect lower-tier [cases]. So by leveraging Chatbox and streamlining processes, part of the AI capabilities are embedded in our Pro SKU. So that's one aspect of it. 
And when you start to think about all the innovation that we've built in to this platform and the latest product releases, again the value is so much greater because of the organic innovation the team has put into it. But customers are loving, ""Gee wow, I can transform IT,"" which then has an impact on the employee experience and the whole future of work. 
And incidentally, there isn't a customer out there now that's not asking us to revolutionize their call center operations or enable people to work from a virtual environment better. And obviously in this frictionless economy, ""How can I do things with a no-touch or possibly the lowest touch possible? How can I eliminate the middleman in my margin pursuit?"" as companies trying to grow in different industries. 
All of that requires an IT backbone. So what you're seeing is a multiplying effect of one story compounding to another and really scratching the part of what we're doing for executives across the enterprise. That's why we're seeing deal sizes get larger and larger. You are seeing us be in a very strong position in terms of the product, the value that it delivers, and the processes that we've built for not only increased presale value creation but also post-sale value creation. So ML, AI and the leadership that we've built into this platform is really unique."

My question for you, Bill, is the company has done a phenomenal job increasing its wallet share with really large companies through ITSM Pro, system workflow, HR, et cetera.

So as you look at the -- how do we put the scaling up of ServiceNow into a company that can serve not just 8,000, 9,000 customers, but more like 100,000, 200,000 customers, what does that journey look like?

As you think about our company, what's the beauty of us right now is we execute with the speed of a start-up, but we have the scale of a global company. So you're seeing us now expand in Europe quite dramatically. We're hiring amazing, amazing talent. You're seeing us make moves into the Middle East. You're seeing the expansion in Latin America. We're really like starting to kick it into high gear in Asia with an expansion in South Korea. We have lots of plans. And we have a well known brand, of course, in Australia, in other more mature markets. 
In the United States, I feel like we're just getting started based upon the amazing receptivity to this new platform. And I think that a lot of that came from our emergency response to COVID and now the vaccine management. And you look at markets and industries like financial services, like telecommunications, like our Boeing business and so many more. 
So I would say we're just getting started in terms of the real extent and the scale. The brand has now become a very well-known brand. The ecosystem tailwind has really kicked in, in the last 12 months. 
And once you get calls from amazing big brands who then say, ""I have to team up with you. My customers have demanded that I team up with you and integrate beautifully in Now Platform. My customers are telling me."" That's a large telco company. In fact, it's not the one that I mentioned as the example, and they said, ""We got to do more with you."" 
So you're seeing now a world where the Fortune 2000 gives us an extreme opportunity for growth beyond $10 billion. But our brand in industry; in geography; in persona; in same account revenue growth; in net new logos, which Gina and I also have an operating plan that increases very large this year-over-year in addition to the ACV. 
So Kash, it's going to be -- look at our 4 businesses that we already are in. Look at every one of them as multibillion opportunities. And then don't forget the platform. Because I think more and more, as the citizen developer concept takes off with ServiceNow, will find us in locations that go way beyond the Fortune 2000. 
And keep in mind, a lot of those large companies that we mentioned, they might have about a couple of thousand companies, and they say they have a couple of hundred thousand because of all the subsidiaries and so on. So we're talking about real companies with real names, and I think the subsidiaries of those in all areas of the world will really take off as well. We're in the early days here."

And I believe strongly that ServiceNow has now pivoted to be that platform company for digital transformation. And that is a big difference from being what some used to say was the ERP of it. 
So think about this as a platform company. Think about the core business and the continuous innovation that we're doing in the core, to stretch the core into new frontiers. We have a whole organization that is focused on the next big thing. 
So all the businesses that you would understand well, whether we invented it or someone else did, they all want to cooperate with the Now Platform because the IntegrationHub enables them to get in. And once they get in, then they can build their imagination and their dreams with ServiceNow. 
So I think there's a big business model in that, that we have only scratched the surface on. If you think about employee experience, I think the companies that I talked to, including ours, we run someone else's system of record. But if you talk to 13,000 people in ServiceNow, nobody could possibly pick the system of record out of a lineup. Because all they look at is this gorgeous consumer-grade UI that's driven by the ServiceNow portal, where all the services that they need based on their job profile are right there for them. I mean how big is that market? 
And the same thing with customer service management. We're learning fast in this new world that we've gone way beyond SFA and upsells and cross-sells and conditioning that around a marketing campaign. We're into business model innovation, where great companies like Disney or AT&T are rethinking their business model entirely. And they're capitalizing on the streaming rage, and they're coming up with subscription business models that reinvent the customer experience and give them net new businesses. ServiceNow is in that to win, and I think that TAM is absolutely unbelievable. 
The other TAM that's pretty interesting that nobody spent much time talking about, but it's one of the reasons I see ServiceNow's future is so bright, if you just take paper-based processes that are clocking up all of these companies and you digitize them to the Now Platform. There is a well-known bank out there that says the U.S. market alone is a $280 billion market, which maybe globally that's a $400 billion market. And then I think this platform business, I really see an amazing, amazing future for the platform business. 
Just think about this. If you're the state of North Carolina and you're a ServiceNow customer and you've got a vaccine management challenge, like literally in days they can build a custom application tailored to 10 million citizens to get them the vaccine in their arm to protect them from this terrible virus. Again, that is just built on to the Now Platform using the app engine, the IntegrationHub and all the innovation that our great engineers have built. 
So we're at the early days and there are some things that we have planned for that will be forthcoming in the months and year ahead. But right now, I just want to keep you focused on what we're doing, because literally we've only scratched the surfaces of these businesses."

There isn't a partner that's a global partner right now that does not have a business plan that's $1 billion or more with ServiceNow. And many of them are in the multiple billions, and they're building their business model. Some of them tell me, they look at the Now Platform as the cross-platform integration engine of their business model with the various other companies, whether it's system of record software company or collaborative software company that they also have partnerships with. But they're looking at us at the center of that digital transformation effort. That is a very, very big tailwind. And many of the net new innovative applications that they will bring to their customers, their building on the Now Platform because the low code, no-code simplicity of the platform can enable them to do things at record speeds. And I think that is a big, big unlock for them. 
So platform is really big. I also think the ML and the AI movement that we're on, Element AI was kind of the finishing touch of 4 M&A moves that we made, which was really about acquiring not just patents and thought leadership, but real enablement of the Now Platform so we can truly unleash humanity in ways that heretofore were not possible. And the computer and the human now can do things in terms of decision-making, removing soul-crushing work that nobody really wants to do. Issuing workflow orders only when it's necessary because the virtual agent can solve 90% of the problems in most engagement with customers. 
And this is now like a whole new universe because many of those partners looked at us in IT, and now 
the employee experience for example, [they get] the employee experience and they give us reach globally. And there are others on customer service management now that is saying what we're doing especially with digitizing business processes, ease of use on subscription models, like Disney+. We are so honored to see Disney+ say, ""That's our digital bridge to the future. We have great core businesses, but this is a digital bridge to the future."" And ServiceNow is right in the mix of all of that. So look, it's a once in a generation opportunity, and I'm really, really happy. 
And I also look at the technology partners that we have now that have just adopted us as the standard for IT and so many other things. We made the announcement on IBM where they basically looked at their ITSM on-premise business and said, ""We got to go to the cloud. We'd rather go to the cloud with you. That's where the innovation is."" 
And we formed very good partnerships like what we're doing with Microsoft, connecting with 365, Teams dynamics and bringing a whole new understanding of what's possible with the Now Platform working interdependently with Microsoft. So all that and more is all in the mix for our growth plan."

We obviously have extremely bold ambitions to what we think we can do in the customer service management arena. Also, [John Ball], who is the gentleman that we hired as you know, he ran the Einstein initiative over another software company in the area. And we feel that he has domain expertise. And when he saw what we were doing in customer service management, he said, ""This is where I want to work."" He said, ""this is the biggest thing that I've seen."" He said, ""I can't get over this Now Platform, its simplicity, how quickly I can innovate on it."" 
I'll give you an example. He was front and center on the vaccine management innovation. Literally, that whole process took us 3 weeks where vaccine management as a concept and an application was developed in 3 weeks and launched to the global marketplace. And it's in Scotland, it's in U.K., it's in many states now in the United States. In the not-too-distant future, hopefully it's helping many of the federal agencies help the Biden administration save lives here in America and obviously in other parts of the world too. 
So it's the speed at which you can innovate on this platform. It's the pristine nature of this platform that you don't have to work with multiple different platforms from different M&A moves or different levels of complexity that others have built up over time. Here, it's just like there it is innovate on, it. What's the idea, let's code it and let's get it out to the market. 
We did emergency response apps, if you remember, over a weekend. And we launched them globally in a week. I mean it's just unheard of. And that's what's really exciting that our engineers are spending all of their time coding new innovations as opposed to integrating past applications."

And I'd like to ask as someone who actually led no-code projects for Fortune 500 companies during the pandemic, I'd love to dig into your low-code vision a little bit more. How do you see ServiceNow positioned within the low- and no-code markets, to be able to enable line of business users to develop workflow automation and really deliver on that promise of democratizing development?"
22967487,700352503,2183006,"ServiceNow, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","ServiceNow, Inc.","Executives","Yes, that's the whole point. That's what we're talking about here. I'll give you an example. I had one CEO said to me, ""Hey, I want to get a good score on Glassdoor."" And he said, ""There doesn't seem to be an application on the market for it."" I said, """,326,"Yes, that's the whole point. That's what we're talking about here. 
I'll give you an example. I had one CEO said to me, ""Hey, I want to get a good score on Glassdoor."" And he said, ""There doesn't seem to be an application on the market for it."" I said, ""Yes, why don't you get a business analyst and we'll design a workflow around that, and then you can launch it comp out into your company in record speed like a couple of days."" 
So what's unique here in the case of vaccine management as an example, you took the platform and you customized something in a few days basically to vaccinate 5.5 million people. But in the case of something where you just need to flow chart a workflow and rethink a process to, for example, roll out a rewards program or a recognition program, that could be done by a business analyst. So we're not inhibited by prepackaged software or doing things that are quite complex in development in the case of the platform because all you need is an idea. And if you have an idea, a business analyst can code on this platform. If you have an idea that's a little bit more complex, you can have a low-code situation where somebody with a little bit of computer intelligence skills can navigate this platform. 
So this is kind of the secret sauce. I tell you when I think about what it can be because of the architecture and the simplicity of the platform itself, our imaginations just keep getting more and more fulfilled with dreams and excitement. And I'm just so excited by our engineering teams. And Gina and I have made sure that we fund them now appropriately. And most of the investments around here go to the great engineers and the people that serve our customers. There's 0 bureaucracy in this company, just like there's 0 bureaucracy in the platform."

Let me begin by extending my hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. Having confronted an unprecedented global environment, we are looking ahead with optimism and are thankful to be so well positioned to serve our customers. 
Needless to say, we delivered a market-leading 2020. We significantly beat expectations across the board, bringing great momentum into the new year. I could not be prouder of our team's execution. We delivered over 30% organic top line growth, 25% operating margins and $1.4 billion in free cash flow, just an outstanding performance and a testament to our ServiceNow strong culture. 
Throughout the year, we led with courage and conviction. We took care of our team, our customers and our communities. And most importantly, we led with ServiceNow's purpose to make the world of work work better for people. We strive to see the world through our customer's eyes with empathy to address their needs. 
The workflow revolution is happening, and the pandemic is accelerating digital transformation. Every business needs speed, agility and resilience, and every C-suite leader wants to deliver great experiences for their employees and their customers. Businesses are changing the way they operate. They need to deliver fierce customer loyalty and deep employee engagement to win. It's all about people, empathy at mass scale is the business imperative of the 21st century. The secular tailwinds of digital transformation, cloud computing and business model innovation have all intersected at a perfect moment in time. A paradigm shift is happening worldwide. 
In 2020, for the first time in history, we saw digital transformation spending accelerate despite GDP declining globally. Digital investments are at an all-time high and are expected to continue growing. According to IDC, worldwide digital transformation investments will total more than $7.4 trillion by 2044. The digital economy is firing on all cylinders. 
ServiceNow is the platform company for digital business. The Now Platform, what I call the platform of platforms, offers the speed, flexibility and innovation companies need. Our simple low-code app development enables fast workflows to solve any business challenge, delivering consumer-grade digital experiences. And Now Platform enables easier and faster implementation, delivering unbeatable time to value and fast ROI. That's the beauty of the Now Platform: one platform, one data model and one architecture. We seamlessly integrated all of this and through our system. 
And that system integrates seamlessly with all systems of record that matter most to our customers. We deliver workflows through their preferred collaboration platform as well. We give our customers the freedom of choice to use their preferred tools and the unique ability to build apps at record speed. 
Hungry and humble is a core ServiceNow value. It's proven now in the number. We are grateful to be in such a strong position at such a pivotal moment, and we are hungry. We are eager to use our strengths to help our customers succeed, help make our community stronger and help create great experiences for people. 
We are seeing an extraordinary expansion of use cases in our business. Health care organizations are using ServiceNow to improve operations and service delivery, which means better outcomes for people. St. Jude Children's Hospital has been on a journey to accelerate progress towards finding cures and saving children. 
In 2020, COVID-19 created a significant headwind to that mission. With much of the hospital staff required to work from home, the need to digitize manual workflows became more important than ever. The hospital leveraged ServiceNow's low-code App Engine and integration hub to integrate disparate systems and build custom end-to-end workflows, ultimately allowing them to ensure seamless delivery of clinical services. In under 4 weeks the ServiceNow solution was implemented at St. Jude's Children's Hospital and everybody was moving toward their goal. 
We're also proud to be supporting NHS Scotland in their efforts to vaccinate 5.5 million citizens. NHS Scotland is using the Now Platform and our customer workflow to deploy a customized solution designed to meet their specific needs. Deployment took only 6 weeks, showing the agility of the Now Platform. ServiceNow is enabling a comprehensive solution for the schedule and the reporting of vaccination for Scotland's most vulnerable citizens. Within 12 hours of rollout, NHS Scotland booked over 220,000 appointments. 
So as you can see, it's not just about business workflows. It's about real people, enterprise digital transformation with how every organization in every sector in every geo are adapting, growing, creating new business models and empowering their people to be productive in any environment under any condition. That's modern, agile, resilient business at work. And it's being powered by the Now Platform. Our unique platform and innovative product suite, our strong brand, high customer satisfaction and compelling value proposition are the differentiating factors and competitive advantages fueling our performance. 
Our Q4 results are testament. We dreamed big and delivered. We grew billings by more than 40% year-over-year organically. We delivered 89 deals greater than $1 million and now have close to 1,100 customers paying us over $1 million annually. We landed our largest deal ever, surpassing the deal record we set in Q3 with the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. Deal sizes overall keep getting larger. Our renewal rate remained best in class at 99%. Here are some key customer wins from Q4. 
We signed a multiyear and multi-product strategic deal with AT&T. They are transforming by focusing on broadband connectivity, 5G and software-based entertainment while relentlessly focusing on digital, consumer preferences and experiences. 
We're delighted to work with AT&T Communications in its transformation. ServiceNow's AI-powered platform and service operations product lines will provide AT&T accurate and real-time operational visibility into every layer of the network fabric and help deliver the best-in-class customer experience, better experiences for people enabled by ServiceNow. 
One of the U.K.'s big 4 banks is using multiple ServiceNow products, including our purpose-built new financial services operations product to help transform the way it operates and to deliver better customer experiences. The bank has seen a 70% efficiency and improvement of payment processing by integrating the Now Platform into its core banking systems. With ServiceNow, this bank implemented new automated processes in 60 workdays. In their words, employees moved from cut and paste, swivel chair manual processes to efficient, automated workflows. In one case, employees went from managing 10 requests an hour to 1,000 requests in 3 minutes on the Now Platform, better experiences for people. 
PayPal recently expanded their relationship with ServiceNow as a key partner for elements of their digital transformation. And we're proud to have expanded our relationship with Nike, who is using the Now Platform to create better customer and employee experiences. Other Q4 deals across our portfolio represented wins with major customers in key sectors such as Booking.com in travel and hospitality, BP in energy, Santander U.K. and USAA in financial services. 
And the list goes on and on. I hear so many ServiceNow success stories every day. Companies are onboarding thousands of people in a work from home environment, making them feel productive and part of the team from day 1. Customers are going live on the Now Platform in days, not months, making a difference for people now, not next month or next year. Now. More productive employees, happier customers, more efficient operations, there is not a CEO on the planet who doesn't want that. The Now Platform delivers. 
These examples show how technology is no longer supporting the business. Technology is the business. Our IT leadership and workflows gives us a uniquely strong foundation to be the leading platform for digital transformation across the enterprise. In Q4, IT workflow products remained strong. ITSM delivered 17 deals over $1 million. Our AI and machine learning capabilities embedded within our Pro SKU continue to resonate with our customers. ITSM Pro penetration is now over 20%. The AI/ML capabilities of our Pro SKUs are automating processes to allow people to focus on the work that really matters. We saw a 3x increase in usage of our virtual agent technology in 2020. 
And our Element AI acquisition underscores our commitment to being the leader in AI-enabled workflows. Element AI's deep bench of world-class scientists and practitioners will accelerate our AI innovation on the Now Platform, delivering not only better capabilities for it, but for employee and customer experiences as well. ITOM was included in 16 of the top 20 deals and had 15 deals over $1 million. 
Risk had a very strong Q4, booking more wins than all of the prior year combined. Our ability to manage risk is really resonating with customers. ServiceNow is no longer viewed as back-end IT-oriented solution. We're now seen as a strategic partner that impacts the entire business. 
Customer workflows is our next $1 billion-plus market opportunity for ServiceNow, and Q4 showed strong momentum. Customer workflows were included in 11 of our top 20 deals, driving such wins as AT&T. 10 of our customer workflow deals were greater than $1 million. 
In this pandemic, the employee experience is more important than ever, and our employee workflows is seeing strong demand. In Q4, 11 of our top 20 deals included employee workflows. 
The pandemic is creating the greatest workflow challenge of our time, and ServiceNow is responding with agility speed and continuous innovation. We began last spring, as you'll remember, with our emergency response apps helping the state of Washington and many others respond to COVID. We fast followed that release with our Safe Workplace suite of apps that has demonstrated the power of the Now Platform and great employee workflows that we can deliver very quickly. In fact, more than 900 organizations now have downloaded the suite already. 
This week, we just launched the first in a suite of planned vaccine administration applications to deliver out-of-the-box functionality for our customers. Our comprehensive approach enables workflow solutions to the complex challenges of vaccine distribution, administration and monitoring. As we have done with Safe Workplace, we will be delivering continuous innovation with our vaccine administration management applications. I'm excited to announce that the state of North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services is already leveraging the ServiceNow Platform to power its COVID vaccine management system to help quickly and efficiently vaccinate 10 million North Carolinians. 
President Biden has declared the distribution of COVID vaccines a top priority for his administration. This is one of the great workflow challenges of our time. As we are doing right now in Scotland, North Carolina and many other places, ServiceNow is ready to ensure vaccine distribution, administration and monitoring that it's simple, it's fast and it's effective. It will be so at the federal, state and local level.
In summary, we had an outstanding close to 2020, and we are not slowing down. We are changing the world one workflow at a time, and our vision is really resonating. C-level executives realize that behind every great experience is a great workflow. Our company is hitting on all cylinders. 
In 2020, we grew our global workflows by 26%, hiring 3,000 people in 25 countries, with most hired and onboarded digitally. We are hiring incredible talent, including some of the greatest minds in the AI industry. 
Our culture is incredibly strong. Our employee engagement is at historic highs. So too is our employee retention. Our brand is strong. C-suite awareness increased in double digits. 
Our innovation pipeline is robust. We delivered 70% more features and innovations on the platform in 2020. 
Our partner ecosystem is expanding. IBM, Microsoft, Accenture, Deloitte, EY, KPMG and all the great partners in India, and many others have joined the workflow revolution with us. Together, we're bringing the innovation speed of a start-up with the scale and reach of a rapidly growing $5 billion-plus pure-play SaaS company. 
And our RPO is nearly double that at $9 billion. We're the only born in the cloud software company to have reached this size without large-scale M&A. And we have a clear path to achieve our $10 billion revenue target. 
We are also deeply committed to making the world of work work better for people to helping our customers succeed. We are deeply committed to making the world work better, too. Gina will share more about our focus on elevating our global impact. I'm incredibly proud of our just announced $100 million investment in an impact fund benefiting underserved communities. 
And we're deeply committed to being a leader in building a diverse, inclusive workforce in which everyone feels that they belong. Because diverse teams with an indomitable will to win create great companies. ServiceNow is such a company, and we are well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. That's our dream, and we will pursue it tirelessly with courage, passion and conviction. 
Thank you. Over to you, Gina."

I want to start off by echoing Bill's praise for all the employees of ServiceNow. It has been a year of unprecedented challenges, but the team has remained focused on executing and meeting the needs of our customers. I couldn't be more impressed with our resilience, which is a testament to our great culture here at ServiceNow. 
And it's thanks to our people that we delivered another fantastic quarter to cap a strong year. We exceeded the high end of our subscription revenues and subscription billings guidance, which carried through to strong free cash flow generation. 
Q4 subscription revenues were $1.184 billion, representing 32% year-over-year growth, inclusive of a 3-point tailwind from FX. Q4 subscription billings were very strong at $1.828 billion, representing 41% year-over-year growth and $183 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. Adjusted growth was 38% year-over-year. 
The outperformance was driven by tremendous execution from our sales team, which resulted in significant net new ACV upside for the quarter as well as $80 million of billings pulled forward from 2021 due to early customer payments. We believe the high levels of early payments were onetime in nature and the result of customers having excess cash at the end of the year, given the incremental cost savings enterprises saw from COVID. Excluding these early payments, normalized Q4 billings would have grown 35% year-over-year, still well ahead of our guidance. 
Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $8.9 billion, representing 35% year-over-year growth. And current RPO was approximately $4.4 billion, representing 33% year-over-year growth. FX was about a 3-point tailwind. 
The traction we are seeing in our top line results reflect our focus on meeting the needs of our customers and their employees. As Bill noted, the workflow revolution is underway and is centered around the best experiences. And that's the Now Platform's super power, the ability to deliver workflows that create those great experiences for people. The Now Platform is playing a critical role in accelerating digital transformation. We're treating our customers as partners, listening and learning about their challenges so we can help solve them. We aren't selling point products. We're providing them with comprehensive solutions with measurable results and quick time to value. Better together, that's the power of our portfolio. 
It's this attention to our customers' needs that's driving our best-in-class renewal rate of 99%, demonstrating the stickiness of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. Our sales teams continued to win bigger deals in Q4, including our largest deal ever, which is 3x the size of our previous largest deal. 
We closed 89 deals greater than $1 million in ACV in the quarter, with average deal sizes up 18% year-over-year. In 2020, we added nearly 700 net new customers, ending the year with almost 6,900 enterprises. The number of customers paying us $5 million or more in ACV grew over 40% in fiscal 2020. Customers are realizing the strategic value of combining ServiceNow IT workflows with everything from HR, CSM and our App Engine to deliver greater value across the enterprise. Our ability to land new logos and expand our existing relationships amid a pandemic further validate the strength of our platform and the value we're delivering to enterprise C-suite.
Turning to profitability. Q4 operating margin was 22%, a 100 basis point beat versus our guidance, driven by our strong top line outperformance. Year-over-year, our Q4 operating margin was consistent with last year as lower T&E expenses were offset by planned incremental R&D investments and marketing spend on pipeline generation. Our free cash flow margin was 45%, up 900 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower T&E spend and strong collection. 
For full year 2020, operating margin was 25%, up 300 basis points year-over-year. And free cash flow was 32%, up 400 basis points year-over-year. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. 
Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the macro trends we're seeing in the business. The highly affected industries we outlined early last year, which represented about 20% of our business, continue to see macro headwinds but remained resilient. 3 of our top 20 deals in the quarter were from highly impacted industries, including retail, automotive and energy. We do expect headwinds in some severely impacted industries to persist in 2021. However, retention of existing customers remained very strong in Q4. 
Overall, we're entering 2021 with strong secular tailwinds created by a surge in demand for digital transformation. Our pipeline continues to look healthy, and our brand continues to resonate with enterprise leaders. ServiceNow is exceptionally well positioned to seize this opportunity. We have the unique platform and innovative product suite businesses need, the workflow standard for enterprise transformation.
Turning to guidance. For transparency and clarity, I'd like to call out a few items. First, as I noted earlier, we saw $80 million in early payments from customers in Q4, which was an approximately 200 basis point tailwind to full year subscription billings growth in 2020. These result in a more significant headwind of about 350 basis points for 2021 billings growth. To be clear, these early payments have no effect on the timing of revenue. We've also previously talked about how early renewals and success with very large customers were impacting billing cycles as they can add additional volatility to timing and duration. This makes billings a less reliable leading indicator of top line growth. 
Given this noise and to provide investors with even greater transparency, we're introducing quarterly CRPO guidance. We believe CRPO will provide better visibility and is a more consistent indicator of business performance, normalizing for timing and duration noise. We will continue to provide billings guidance throughout 2021 as a transition period. 
Second, the need to digitally transform has been accelerated by the current macro environment, creating a very large opportunity for ServiceNow. With the savings we are recognizing from our more efficient operating environment, we're continuing to invest in R&D and quota-bearing resources to drive innovation and pipeline to fuel our tremendous organic growth engine, ensuring that we maintain our market leadership and are well positioned to take advantage of the digital acceleration. These investments include those we were making in AI, such as the acquisition of Element AI. Similar to previous investments and successful growth initiatives like our Pro SKUs or geographic expansion, we will be disciplined about our spend. 
Beyond our business investments, we will also be investing in people and communities. We've always been focused on diversity, inclusion and belonging. And as Bill noted, we recently announced our first ever $100 million investment in a racial equity fund to build equitable opportunity for Black communities. This investment is expected to earn a solid return while facilitating sustainable wealth creation through homeownership, entrepreneurship and neighborhood revitalization. 
Finally, COVID cases have been spiking in recent weeks, and some regions have reentered lockdown protocols. While we haven't seen any significant impact on our business, we will continue to monitor and be transparent in our disclosures throughout 2021. 
With that in mind, for Q1, we expect subscription revenues between $1.275 billion and $1.28 billion, representing 28% to 29% year-over-year growth, including a 4-point FX tailwind. 
We expect subscription billings between $1.31 billion and $1.315 billion, representing 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early payments from customers in 2020, our Q1 normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 32% year-over-year. Growth includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 4 points. 
We expect cRPO growth of 32% year-over-year, including a 5-point FX tailwind. We expect an operating margin of 25% and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. 
For the full year 2021, we expect subscription revenues between $5.48 billion and $5.5 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth, including a 3-point FX tailwind. We expect subscription billings between $6.205 billion and $6.225 billion, representing 25% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our 2021 normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 28% to 29% year-over-year growth. This growth reflects an acceleration in net new ACV in 2021, and it also includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 2 points. 
We expect subscription gross margin of 85%, reflecting some federal and public sector customers moving to our newly launched Azure offering as well as increased support for customers impacted by new and evolving data residency requirements. We expect an operating margin of 23.5%, representing 150 basis points expansion off of our pre-COVID 2020 run rate. I would note that this is also an incremental 50 basis points more than the 100 basis points of expansion we target each year. Finally, we expect free cash flow margin of 30% and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the year.
In summary, in 2020, we delivered a combination of both strong top line growth and profitability, an incredible accomplishment in a COVID environment. Our outstanding results continue to demonstrate our strong product portfolio, our focus on building deep customer relationships and our commitment to enabling their digital transformation. We're delivering great experiences that drive powerful employee engagement, fierce customer loyalty and significant productivity gains. We are the platform company for digital business. 
I'm extremely proud of our team's performance and our unrelenting execution in a turbulent year. We can't thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication. We're well on our way to becoming a $10 billion revenue company on the strength of incredible organic innovation. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2021.

Obviously, the future of work is a big movement to work from anywhere. And certainly enable that modern work environment and do that in a way where people can be onboarded without actually even meeting them, train them appropriately, and do the ongoing management of people where they can truly execute their mission and they know all the information and they have all the data to do their job. 
So this -- it's happening in every industry, and it's happened in every geo, and each persona has its own unique needs. What we think is unique about ServiceNow is that this platform, think of it as the workflow automation platform, comprehends all the opportunities with App Engine to customize things very rapidly like vaccine management, for example. It also offers the IntegrationHub, and what the IntegrationHub enables is all the things from RPA, process mining, API integration, process analytics, native mobile, contextual interfaces and all the other things that CIOs and leaders of businesses are counting on to create end-to-end continuity in the business. 
And that's what makes us so unique. So having that platform advantage and our well-known position in IT is equally as relevant with the employee experience, because now you have one portal with a consumer-grade UX. All the complexity of hidden. All the onboarding caring for the employee is done. And they are right off and running with their mission. In some cases, I have one very high level executive tell me, ""I haven't met the 5,000 people I hired this year because of the Now Platform."" 
And then on customer service management, in every industry, I gave the AT&T example as one, you're seeing the frictionless business environment really take off. So how do we deal with the end consumer and do so directly in a way that enables our services to be consumed. 
So you're seeing this ease of use around ServiceNow. You're seeing the virtual agent guide people through subscription processes. And you're seeing all of our deep machine learning and AI help the customer navigate their sign-on processes and so forth. 
And the workflow then becomes the exception because humans shouldn't have to get involved in these processes unless the computer didn't get the job done. And that gives us such an advantage because we're seeing situations where we can literally consolidate hundreds of systems to the Now Platform, take out huge costs, give the customer a great experience, and obviously not put so much pressure on human capital because people are only engaged when they're absolutely necessary in the customer satisfaction process. 
So you're seeing a mass consolidation of all the old stuff to the Now Platform. You're seeing IT, employee, customer and all the App Engine and IntegrationHub opportunities really come together on one common platform, one data model and one architecture. So it's now a solutions company. It's now selling a suite. And the broad spectrum of offerings gives us reach to the whole C-level executive team, not just one persona on the executive team."

What area? 
The follow-on question I want to direct to you, Bill, if I could. Last year, you were pretty clear that acquisitions was not part of your strategy. Maybe some tuck-ins here and there. '21 the new year, lots of changes, the digital landscape is a greater priority. Is there any change in your thoughts as you're considering how ServiceNow could effectively build that long-term model as it relates to M&A? That's it for me."
22967487,700352503,2183330,"ServiceNow, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","ServiceNow, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Well, thank you very much, Keith.

First of all, I'll just say that net new ACV on a year-over-year basis will increase. And the pipelines that we have in the company, and we manage the company on what we call the CEO of dashboards in real time, give us much greater coverage than we had last year. So we know that the facts substantiate the net new ACV increase. 
One of the interesting things that is fascinating is actually our executive briefings have increased 70% on a year-over-year basis. So if you think about our ability to get to the C-suite and increase the contact in this kind of virtual environment, it's actually gone way up. So a lot of people, I guess, need a good meeting, and they want to figure out how they're going to digitally transform. And the Now Platform has just dynamite tailwind, Keith. 
Now in terms of the whole digital landscape, IDC, I think, the $7.4 trillion is very interesting statistic. This is factual. If you just look at the way companies are prioritizing their investments, the one thing that's not going to get deprioritized is digital transformation and things that enable digital business. Because it's really the only way to either get yourself competitive or to increase your competitive advantage in your peer group, and every CEO completely understands that. 
And within that context, I think the uniqueness of ServiceNow to have so much momentum, not just in exciting new areas like the future of work with our employee experience or customer service management which is really a frictionless economy now more and more coming ServiceNow's way. But even in our core with IT, you look at our ITSM core business, it's outgrown our internal expectations by a lot. And you're seeing with the Pro SKU where we add on the machine learning and the AI capabilities on a platform approach, that too is growing fast. 
And our engineering team is incredible here. I mean the level of innovation they're pushing out was 70% increase 2020 over 2019. And we have major releases coming this year commensurate with what we did last year. 
So I wanted to give you a lot of confidence that the net new ACV is going up. The customers are buying, and the pipeline is super strong. 
And here's one thing that I found fascinating. There was a study done by Deloitte. And with all this digital transformation, a lot of executives are looking back and saying, ""Hey, why didn't I get a better return on all I put into digital?"" And what they found is that about 3/4 of the digital transformation projects didn't give the yielded return on investment that they had hoped for, and the #1 root cause was integration. 
So as you think about the Now Platform integrating with 550 systems of record out of the box and all the collaboration tools, no matter which one the customer likes, and have that completely synchronized into the Now Platform out of the box, and you're up and running in days, it's kind of an attractive value proposition to our customers and even noncustomers that want to jump on board."

We've gotten tremendous people into the organization to put all the value into the Now Platform and to generate net new revenue growth in the SKUs, such as what we did with IT, we'll do with employee, we'll do with customer, and obviously we'll do with the low-code no-code innovation that we can give to the creator, which is literally a business analyst or anyone that wants to write a low-code application in an enterprise. 
So the way we look at large-scale or larger scale M&A, we wouldn't be doing our job if we didn't look at every opportunity to satisfy our customers and our shareholders. But it's important just to register with you that our projection on the $10 billion is clearly in hand with our organic innovation and the momentum we have in the marketplace with our customers and also the noncustomers that want to join the team. 
So there's nothing on the table right now for a larger deal, but it's not like we don't have our eyes wide open at the various opportunities. And if they ever presented themselves, you would know that we thought through it rigorously and it was part of our strategic imperative to really do the best we can for our shareholders and our customers. But right now, that is not on the table, and it's not something that's actionable at this time."

And then let's start with one for Bill. Bill, ITSM Pro should give you like a -- we see the early momentum there. You talked about a 20% penetration. Just how does it help you on the expansion and the renewal and the conversations you get with clients as a really good tool to engage the client base?"

And so you might take it out of 2020 and add it back into 2021. And so it's about a 200 basis points tailwind to 2020, but then about a 350 basis headwind in '21. 
So we try to do all the math for you so that is pretty clear. And just to be clear that these were early customer payments, and we feel like it's onetime in nature. And it was really a result of our hub customers having excess cash, driven by the OpEx savings that we said they were seeing in 2020. And so I hope that, that clarifies to you, Raimo."

First of all, it's growing in steep double digits, very important. And while we've penetrated 20%, that means we still have 80% to go. So we really, really want the growth opportunity from a shareholder value creation perspective. 
But what you're looking at is the remote IT services requests growing exponentially, and many of the IT organizations out there are looking for ways to deflect lower-tier cases. So by leveraging Chatbox and streamlining processes, part of the AI capabilities are embedded in our Pro SKU. So that's one aspect of it. 
And when you start to think about all the innovation that we've built into this platform and the latest product releases, again the value is so much greater because of the organic innovation the team has put into it. But customers are loving, ""Gee wow, I can transform IT,"" which then has an impact on the employee experience and the whole future of work. 
And incidentally, there isn't a customer out there now that's not asking us to revolutionize their call center operations or enable people to work from a virtual environment better. And obviously in this frictionless economy, ""How can I do things with a no-touch or possibly the lowest touch possible? How can I eliminate the middleman in my margin pursuit?"" as companies trying to grow in different industries. 
All of that requires the IT backbone. So what you're seeing is a multiplying effect of one story compounding into another and really stretching the perimeter of what we're doing for executives across the enterprise. That's why you're seeing deal sizes get larger and larger. You are seeing us be in a very strong position in terms of the product, the value that it delivers, and the processes that we've built for not only presale value creation but also post-sale value creation. So ML, AI and the leadership that we've built into this platform is really unique."

My question for you, Bill, is the company has done a phenomenal job increasing its wallet share with really large companies through ITSM Pro, CSM workflow, HR, et cetera.

So as you look at the -- how do we put the scaling up of ServiceNow into a company that can serve not just 8,000, 9,000 customers, but more like 100,000, 200,000 customers, what does that journey look like?

As you think about our company, what's the beauty of us right now is we execute with the speed of a start-up, but we have the scale of a global company. So you're seeing us now expand in Europe quite dramatically. We're hiring amazing, amazing talent. You're seeing us make moves into the Middle East. You're seeing the expansion in Latin America. We're really like starting to kick it into high gear in Asia with an expansion in South Korea. We have lots of plans. And we have a well-known brand, of course, in Australia, in other more mature markets. 
In the United States, I feel like we're just getting started based upon the amazing receptivity to this Now Platform. And I think that a lot of that came from our emergency response to COVID and now the vaccine management. And you look at markets and industries like financial services, like telecommunications, like our government business and so many more. 
So I would say we're just getting started in terms of the real extent and the scale. The brand has now become a very well-known brand. The ecosystem tailwind has really kicked in, in the last 12 months. 
And once you get calls from amazing big brands who then say, ""I have to team up with you. My customers have demanded that I team up with you and integrate beautifully in Now Platform. My customers are telling me."" That's a large telco company. In fact, it's not the one that I mentioned as the example, and they said, ""We got to do more with you."" 
So you're seeing now a world where the Fortune 2000 gives us an extreme opportunity for growth beyond $10 billion. But our brand in industry; in geography; in persona; in same account revenue growth; in net new logos, which Gina and I also have an operating plan that increases very large this year-over-year in addition to the ACV -- net new ACV. 
So Kash, it's going to be -- look at our 4 businesses that we already are in. Look at every one of them as multibillion opportunities. And then don't forget the platform. Because I think more and more, as the citizen developer concept takes off with ServiceNow, will find us in locations that go way beyond the Fortune 2000. 
And keep in mind, a lot of those large companies that we mentioned, they might have about a couple of thousand companies, and they say they have a couple of hundred thousand because of all the subsidiaries and so on. So we're talking about real companies with real names, and I think the subsidiaries of those in all areas of the world will really take off as well. We're in the early days here."

Well, first of all, I would feature, Walter, the platform itself. And I believe strongly that ServiceNow has now pivoted to be that platform company for digital transformation.

And I believe strongly that ServiceNow has now pivoted to be that platform company for digital transformation. And that is a big difference from being what some used to say was the ERP of it. 
So think about this as a platform company. Think about the core business and the continuous innovation that we're doing in the core, to stretch the core into new frontiers. We have a whole organization that is focused on the next big thing. 
So all the businesses that you would understand well, whether we invented it or someone else did, they all want to cooperate with the Now Platform because the IntegrationHub enables them to get in. And once they get in, then they can build their imagination and their dreams with ServiceNow. 
So I think there's a big business model in that, that we have only scratched the surface on. If you think about employee experience, I think the companies that I talked to, including ours, we run someone else's system of record. But if you talk to 13,000 people in ServiceNow, nobody could possibly pick the system of record out of a lineup. Because all they look at is this gorgeous consumer-grade UI that's driven by the ServiceNow portal, where all the services that they need based on their job profile are right there for them. I mean how big is that market? 
And the same thing with customer service management. We're learning fast in this new world that we've gone way beyond SFA and upsells and cross-sells and conditioning that around a marketing campaign. We're into business model innovation, where great companies like Disney or AT&T are rethinking their business model entirely. And they're capitalizing on the streaming rage, and they're coming up with subscription business models that reinvent the customer experience and give them net new businesses. ServiceNow is in that to win, and I think that TAM is absolutely unbelievable. 
The other TAM that's pretty interesting that nobody spent much time talking about, but it's one of the reasons I see ServiceNow's future is so bright, if you just take paper-based processes that are clocking up all of these companies and you digitize them to the Now Platform. There is a well-known bank out there that says the U.S. market alone is a $280 billion market, which maybe globally that's a $400 billion market. And then I think this platform business, I really see an amazing, amazing future for the platform business. 
Just think about this. If you're the state of North Carolina and you're a ServiceNow customer and you've got a vaccine management challenge, like literally in days they can build a custom application tailored to 10 million citizens to get them the vaccine in their arm to protect them from this terrible virus. Again, that is just built on to the Now Platform using the app engine, the IntegrationHub and all the innovation that our great engineers have built.

Bill, I wanted to ask you just a question on the app engine. Just looking at this percentage of ACV mix surged to 15%. You're seeing certainly larger and larger customers and more customers lean in on the App Engine vision. 
I'd love to hear a little bit more about that. In particular, if you could talk about what the App Engine vision has meant for your relationship with the channel partners, Accenture, Deloitte and others. Just broadly speaking, it would be fantastic to hear about how you look at that today and how that's changing how big customers and partners like your SIs are leaning in here."
22967487,700352503,2183330,"ServiceNow, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","ServiceNow, Inc.","Executives","Yes, fantastic. So let's start with the whole idea of the partners. There isn't a partner that's a global partner right now that does not have a business plan that's $1 billion or more with ServiceNow. And many of them are in the multiple billions, and th",513,"Yes, fantastic. So let's start with the whole idea of the partners. There isn't a partner that's a global partner right now that does not have a business plan that's $1 billion or more with ServiceNow. And many of them are in the multiple billions, and they're building their business model. Some of them tell me, they look at the Now Platform as the cross-platform integration engine of their business model with the various other companies, whether it's system of record software company or collaborative software company that they also have partnerships with. But they're looking at us at the center of that digital transformation effort. That is a very, very big tailwind. Many of the net new innovative applications that they will bring to their customers, they're building on to -- on the Now Platform because the low code, no-code simplicity of the platform can enable them to do things at record speeds. And I think that is a big, big unlock for them. 
So platform is really big. I also think the ML and the AI movement that we're on, Element AI was kind of the finishing touch of 4 M&A moves that we made, which was really about acquiring not just patents and thought leadership, but real enablement of the Now Platform so we can truly unleash humanity in ways that heretofore were not possible. And the computer and the human now can do things in terms of decision-making, removing soul-crushing work that nobody really wants to do. Issuing workflow orders only when it's necessary because the virtual agent can solve 90% of the problems in most engagement with customers. 
And this is now like a whole new universe because many of those partners looked at us in IT, and now the employee experience, for example, is one of Deloitte's most desired personas, and they're actually extraordinarily good at the employee experience and they give us reach globally. And there are others on customer service management now that is saying what we're doing especially with digitizing business processes, ease of use on subscription models, like Disney+. We are so honored to see Disney+ say, ""That's our digital bridge to the future. We have great core businesses, but this is the digital bridge to the future."" And ServiceNow is right in the mix of all of that. So look, it's a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and I'm really, really happy. 
And I also look at the technology partners that we have now that have just adopted us as the standard for IT and so many other things. We made the announcement on IBM where they basically looked at their ITSM on-premise business and said, ""We got to go to the cloud. We'd rather go to the cloud with you. That's where the innovation is."" 
And we formed very good partnerships like what we're doing with Microsoft, connecting with O 365, Teams, Dynamics and bringing a whole new understanding of what's possible with the Now Platform working interdependently with Microsoft. So all that and more is all in the mix for our growth plan."

We obviously have extremely bold ambitions to what we think we can do in the customer service management arena. Also, John Ball, who is the gentleman that we hired as you know, he ran the Einstein Initiative over another software company in the area. And we feel that he has domain expertise. And when he saw what we were doing in customer service management, he said, ""This is where I want to work."" He said, ""this is the biggest thing that I've seen."" He said, ""I can't get over this Now Platform, its simplicity, how quickly I can innovate on it."" 
I'll give you an example. He was front and center on the vaccine management innovation. Literally, that whole process took us 3 weeks where vaccine management as a concept and an application was developed in 3 weeks and launched to the global marketplace. And it's in Scotland, it's in U.K., it's in many states now in the United States. In the not-too-distant future, hopefully it's helping many of the federal agencies help the Biden administration save lives here in America and obviously in other parts of the world, too. 
So it's the speed at which you can innovate on this platform. It's the pristine nature of this platform that you don't have to work with multiple different platforms from different M&A moves or different levels of complexity that others have built up over time. Here, it's just like, here it is, innovate on it. What's the idea, let's code it and let's get it out to the market. 
We did emergency response apps, if you remember, over a weekend. And we launched them globally in a week. I mean it's just unheard of. And that's what's really exciting that our engineers are spending all of their time coding new innovations as opposed to integrating past applications."

How do you see ServiceNow positioned within the low- and no-code markets, to be able to enable line of business users to develop workflow automation and really deliver on that promise of democratizing development?"
22967487,700352503,2183330,"ServiceNow, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","ServiceNow, Inc.","Executives","Yes, that's the whole point. That's what we're talking about here. I'll give you an example. I had one CEO said to me, ""Hey, I want to get a good score on Glassdoor."" And he said, ""There doesn't seem to be an application on the market for it."" I said, """,324,"Yes, that's the whole point. That's what we're talking about here. 
I'll give you an example. I had one CEO said to me, ""Hey, I want to get a good score on Glassdoor."" And he said, ""There doesn't seem to be an application on the market for it."" I said, ""Yes, why don't you get a business analyst and we'll design a workflow around that, and you can launch it out into your company in record speed like a couple of days."" 
So what's unique here in the case of vaccine management as an example, you took the platform and you customized something in a few days basically to vaccinate 5.5 million people. But in the case of something where you just need to flow chart a workflow and rethink a process to, for example, roll out a rewards program or a recognition program, that could be done by a business analyst. So we're not inhibited by prepackaged software or doing things that are quite complex in development in the case of the platform because all you need is an idea. And if you have an idea, a business analyst can code on this platform. If you have an idea that's a little bit more complex, you can have a low-code situation where somebody with a little bit of computer intelligence skills can navigate this platform. 
So this is kind of the secret sauce. I tell you when I think about what it can be because of the architecture and the simplicity of the platform itself, our imaginations just keep getting more and more fulfilled with dreams and excitement. And I'm just so excited by our engineering teams. And Gina and I have made sure that we funded them now appropriately. And most of the investments around here go to the great engineers and the people that serve our customers. There's 0 bureaucracy in this company, just like there's 0 bureaucracy in the platform."

Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call, particularly our guidance is based on information as of April 28, 2021, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions.

Many of these assumptions relate to matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly, including, but not limited to, the time frames for and severity of social distances and other mitigation requirements. The continued impact of COVID-19 on customers' purchasing decisions and the length of our sales cycle, particularly for customers in certain industries. Please refer to the press release and the Risk factors and MD&A sections of our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and our 10-K filed for fiscal year 2020 for information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. 
We'd also like to point out that the company presents non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, net income, remaining performance obligations or RPO and current RPO or cRPO.

We started 2021 with another outstanding quarter, delivering a perfect balance of growth and profitability. Our team is executing, maintaining a swift pace towards our path to $10 billion in revenue and beyond. In Q1, we grew subscription revenue 30% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance. We delivered strong profitability with operating margin over 27%. And we increased free cash flow margin 7 points year-over-year to 46%. Our significant Q1 beat across the board represents the passion our culture has for innovating and our relentless focus on the customer. We are ideally positioned to deliver what our customers need. 
In the past year, the transformation of work has accelerated the adoption of digital products, services and experiences. As a result, digital investments are an all-time high and will total more than $7.8 trillion by 2024 according to IDC. ServiceNow is the strategic authority for digital transformation across the enterprise. We have expanded the boundaries from IT to employee, customer and now creator workflows for citizen developers. The digital economy is firing on all cylinders, and so are we. 
Our culture was born for this moment. Our team of 14,000 colleagues are exponential thinkers. This is how we continuously bring innovation to everything we do. In just the past 18 months, we have more than doubled the features and functionality of our platform for our customers. We're at the epicenter of the workflow revolution. Our purpose has never been more relevant. We are making the world of work, work better for people. We are helping our customers drink bit and to build their digital bridge to the future. 
Xerox, for example, is working with ServiceNow to transform the services industry, leveraging our field service management, their technicians will use machine learning to proactively solve customer problems. They're using virtual and augmented reality tools to resolve their customers' issues via desktop, mobile and smart glass devices. In this bold mill world is as if their agents are there in person. 
Digital transformation is about creating great employee and customer experiences. In an increasingly distributed hybrid workforce, companies need to create frictionless experiences that make it easy for employees to get work done. This requires seamless cross enterprise workflows, linking systems, silos, departments and processes, only the Now platform can do this with native integrations. The platform of platforms, the power of one, one data model, one architecture, one enterprise solution to workflow every business challenge. This is what ServiceNow delivers. We are the only ones doing what we do, the way we do it. 
Strong demand for ServiceNow is evident in our results, high growth, organically driven at mass scale, while aggressively investing in future growth and delivering significant profitability. An amazing business model and a true testament to the power of the Now platform. 
Our teams keep innovating. We're proud that Québec, our latest platform release delivered 1,700 new customer capabilities, breakthrough innovations like predictive AI operations, AI search and virtual agents that enhance every experience, to name a few. ServiceNow is helping customers move to the cloud and invent new business models. The past year has demonstrated that giving people the right productivity tools is critical to success, especially in distributed work environments. It's why organizations like Adobe, Deutsche Telekom, Logitech, city of Los Angeles and Discover are using the Now platform. Discover, in fact, is fully utilizing the Now platform's ease of upgrade, participating in the early adopter program for our Québec release. Now Discover is able to focus on timely availability, and adoption of new functionality, the Now platform is the gold standard for time to value. 
By the end of 2021, Forrester Research predicts that 75% of development shops will use low-code platforms. With Québec, we are delivering new low-code tools that move app development beyond the borders of the engineering organization and into the hands of citizen developers. Employees without software expertise who need to quickly create workflow applications. We're seeing strong response. 
The National cancer Institute at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is a great example. NCI has established a digital service center around ServiceNow's low-code app engine platform. In just 10 days, NCI leverage ServiceNow to build a new application for an online portal to collect and track specimens from COVID-19 patients. ServiceNow's low-code app is helping NCI staff support the global research community in understanding how genetic factors contribute to the severity of COVID-19 cases. 
We also introduced process and workforce optimization capabilities in our new enterprise SKUs. This brings even more intelligence to our customers, allowing them to be more agile. We're putting new AI capabilities in the hands of our customers, so they can enhance productivity while spending more time on human creativity. With our recent acquisition of Intellibot, ServiceNow will have an unmatched intelligent workflow automation solution with RPA, AI, machine learning and process mining native to the Now platform. You'll hear more about this from our Chief Product and Engineering Officer, CJ Desai, at our upcoming Investor Day. Please be there. 
Now let's look more closely at Q1 performance highlights across our portfolio. Our better together solutions continue to drive more multiproduct deals. Our core IT workflows remain strong. ITSM was in 12 of our top 20 deals. Our AI and ML capabilities embedded with our pro SKU, continue to resonate with customers. ITOM had a strong quarter and was in 13 of the top 20 deals. 
EMEA was especially strong. We're hitting a new Gear with CEO engagement. We're seeing more demand across industries, including financial services as EU banking regulations require companies to have full visibility into their assets while also managing risk. HSBC, for example, chose ServiceNow in a multiyear partnership as their workflow partner of choice to help them digitize at scale. Supporting HSBC's employees, ServiceNow will deliver the technologies needed to simplify their architectural landscape. This creates efficiencies, better controls and compliance. 
Australia and New Zealand Banking group also chose the ServiceNow platform to consolidate, simplify its IT systems and streamline operations to improve the employee experience. The Now platform gives them the advantage of a fully integrated view of technology and risk. We continue to see strength in our customer workflows. Our investment in the telco vertical are gaining traction daily and it's materializing in wins across the globe. 
Lumen Technologies, a leading telecommunications company is transforming its customer care, and assurance function with ServiceNow customer workflows. They will use the Now platform to deliver best-in-class customer experiences across their networking, cloud and security solutions. 
Telia, a leading multinational telecommunications company, selected ServiceNow to transform service operations, connecting network operations, employees and customers around the world. 
Creating workflows, our platform business was in 19 of our top 20 deals. 3 of our top 10 app engine wins came from APJ where we are seeing increased awareness of ServiceNow and is continuing to drive demand. A large global manufacturing company in Japan is planning to use our app engine to automate manual processes take out cost and risk associated with migrating on-premise applications to the cloud. This will be a movement in Japan. 
In the U.S., the Now platform is at the heart of the city of Los Angeles' digital transformation, helping to provide reliable access to essential services for its 4 million citizens. The city is expanding its use of digital technology to provide immediate access services, which enables citizens to get the assistance they deserve. 
Employee workflows were included in 8 of our top 20 deals. Zalando is a leading online platform for fashion and lifestyle, connecting customers, brands and partners. As part of their HR transformation, they will implement a central employee services portal using ServiceNow's employee workflows. Zalando sees this as a critical component in supporting their growth, and improving their employee experiences. 
Employee and workplace safety are top of mind for our customers. We are the only company with a complete suite of applications to meet these critical needs. Since the start of the Pandemic, ServiceNow has been at the forefront of solving unprecedented challenges. We saw the meet early and acted quickly. First, our emergency response apps, then our safe workplace apps and now with vaccine administration management, we leverage the speed and agility of the Now platform and the incredible talent of our product team to innovate fast, deliver market-leading solutions to support our customers and help keep them safe. 
You see, organization trap in the last mile of vaccine management as they lack the processes and infrastructure needed to vaccinate people quickly. This is the workflow challenge of our time. To address these challenges, organizations are using the Now platform as their vaccine management manage center. Our workflows are connected organization's existing technology infrastructure to help orchestrate the critical elements of the vaccine management process, including distributing administering and monitoring vaccines. The Minnesota children's hospital implemented our vaccine administration management in 5 days, so they can stay focused on their #1 priority, caring for children. The hospital is using ServiceNow virtual assistant to answer questions and scheduled patient vaccinations. They are leveraging inventory tracking and scheduling to ensure appointments, staffing levels and vaccines are all in sync. 
Germany's largest state, North Ryan Westfalia, is using ServiceNow to support vaccinations for millions of people. Within 2 hours of the portal going live, 120,000 people have registered and received an appointment. ServiceNow ended Q1 working with over 100 organizations and governments globally to help vaccinate people at scale. We are supporting the delivery and management of millions of vaccines globally. We will continue to do more. The workflow revolution is all about helping people. We are humbled to be helping so many people around the world manage this workflow challenge. 
In summary, we had a great start to the year with strong momentum. I'm so proud of what our team has accomplished over the past year and what they continue to achieve. From the beginning of this pandemic, we have focused on taking care of our people and taking care of our customers. That's why we're so grateful to be named to the Fortune 100 Best places to work list for the first time. And we're proud to have increased our position on the Fortune Best Workplaces in Technology list by more than 10 points. 
Our culture demonstrates time and again how we powered through all-weather conditions. Our engineering pride is unmatched. Our innovation relentless and our customer focus tireless. We have a very, very robust pipeline. Substantially greater than anything we've seen before. We have all the learnings of digital customer relationship management. Our strong go-to-market organization is operating in high gear. Our customer services and partner ecosystem is accelerating time to value. Our business is ever resilient. Our opportunities never greater. We continue to work with some of the world's greatest brands, including BMW, Bristol-Myers Squibb, FIS, Subway, Standard & Poor's, we're honored to be their digital transformation partner.
And we're also excited to highlight even more customers at our upcoming knowledge 21 experience in May, which will be our biggest customer event ever. And we look forward to seeing all of you at our upcoming Investor Day. 
This ServiceNow machine is firing on all cylinders. We're not slowing down. We are well on our way to $10 billion and beyond, and we are striving with all we have to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. 
Gina, over to you."
22967487,710567394,2261484,"ServiceNow, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","ServiceNow, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Q1 was a great start to the year. On the heels of a tremendous Q4, the team continued to execute well and delivered another strong quarter of outperformance. We exceeded the high end of our subscription revenue, subscription billings and",1303,"Thank you, Bill. Q1 was a great start to the year. On the heels of a tremendous Q4, the team continued to execute well and delivered another strong quarter of outperformance. We exceeded the high end of our subscription revenue, subscription billings and cRPO guidance and those top line beats carried through to a very robust operating margin and strong free cash flow. 
Q1 subscription revenues were $1.293 billion, representing 30% year-over-year growth, inclusive of a 4-point tailwind from FX. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $8.8 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth, putting us well on our way towards our $10 billion revenue target. 
Current RPO was approximately $4.4 billion representing 33% year-over-year growth and 100 basis points beat versus our guidance. Notably, we delivered that beat with 100 basis points less of an FX tailwind. Due to the weaker euro, currency contributed 4 points instead of our original outlook for a 5-point tailwind. 
Q1 subscription billings were $1.365 billion, representing 29% year-over-year growth and a $3 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. FX and duration were a 4-point tailwind year-over-year. 
As Bill mentioned, we saw particular strength in EMEA as investments made in 2020 are gaining traction. In Q1, the region closed one of its largest deals ever, helping to drive very strong year-over-year net new ACV growth. We're also seeing improving trends in APJ, where we were in 2 of the top 3 platform deals in the quarter. 
We continue to see the secular tailwinds driven by the intersection of digital transformation, cloud computing and business model innovation. Every C-suite leader wants to create great experiences for their employees and their customers, and ServiceNow is delivering. The Now platform offers the speed flexibility and innovation companies needs. 
The sustained strength of our top line growth is the result of consistent execution from across the organization as we address these opportunities. From our engineers who continue to drive leading edge innovation to the sales and customer success teams who partner with our customers to ensure we're delivering value and everyone else in between that helped to deliver great experiences. It's been a tremendous team effort. 
Our renewal rate remains strong at 97% as the Now platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. We closed 37 deals greater than 1 million ACV in the quarter, including 7 net new customers. Our focus on selling comprehensive solutions instead of point products continue to drive more multi-product fields as 17 of our top 20 deals included 3 or more products. We now have 1,146 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 23% year-over-year, and the number of customers paying us $5 million or more in ACV grew over 50% year-over-year. 
Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 27%, up 300 basis points year-over-year, driven by our strong top line outperformance and the timing of some spend that will shift into Q2. Our free cash flow margin was 46%, up 700 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong collections and lower T&E. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. 
Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the macro trends we're seeing in our business. The industry is highly affected by COVID that we outlined earlier last year, which represent about 20% of our business, remains resilient in Q1. We closed several 7-figure deals in these verticals, and renewal rates were ahead of the company average. However, we did continue to see some headwinds in severely impacted industries such as airlines. 
Regardless of the industry, in an increasingly distributed and hybrid workforce, companies need to create consistent and frictionless experiences that make it easy for employees to get work done. Digital investments are at an all-time high and are expected to continue growing as companies must reinvest themselves for the new economy. ServiceNow is the strategic authority in digital transformation, and we're committed to helping our customers succeed in that journey. 
These strong secular tailwinds paired with the strength and agility of the Now platform positions us well for 2021 and beyond. Pipeline generation has remained robust globally, even ahead of our Knowledge 2021 event, which is a big driver, particularly for the Americas. It is helping to drive the net new ACV acceleration in our business this year. Enterprises around the world are recognizing the strength of our one architecture model and its ability to deliver great scalable experiences with speed and efficiency. 
Now let's turn to guidance. For Q2, we expect subscription revenues between $1.29 billion and $1.295 billion, representing 27% to 28% year-over-year growth, including a 300 basis point FX tailwind. We expect cRPO growth of 30% year-over-year, including a 250 basis point FX tailwind. We expect subscription billings between $1.25 billion and $1.255 billion, representing 23% year-over-year growth. Growth includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 300 basis points. We expect an operating margin of 21.5%, which includes $15 million of sales and marketing spend that shifted out of Q1 and into Q2, and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. 
For the full year 2021, we're raising our top line growth guidance on a constant currency basis. We are increasing the midpoint of our previous subscription revenue expectations by $32 million based on the strong trends we saw in Q1. However, a weaker euro resulted in a $59 million headwind to our growth. Taken together, we expect subscription revenues between $5.455 billion and $5.47 billion, representing 27% to 28% year-over-year growth. This includes a 200 basis point FX tailwind. 
Similarly, we're increasing the midpoint of our previous subscription billings expectation by $50 million on a constant currency basis. However, the weaker euro resulted in a $68 million headwind to our growth. Taken together, we expect subscription billings between $6.19 billion and $6.205 billion, representing 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. This includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 150 basis points. 
In terms of quarterly seasonality, we're continuing to see a shift of Q2 and Q3 subscription billings into Q4. We now expect about 21% of our total subscription billings to be in Q3 and 37% to be in Q4. We continue to expect subscription gross margins of 85% and operating margin of 23.5%. Finally, we expect recapture margin of 30% and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the year. You'll hear more about our strategy and long-term opportunity at our upcoming Investor Day on May 10, which will be webcast on our Investor Relations website. 
In addition to making work, work better for people, we're also committed to making the world work better as well. This week, we unveiled our first ever global impact report. At our Investor Day, I'm excited to be able to share ServiceNow's global impact strategy with you. 
In conclusion, ServiceNow is leading this once in a generation opportunity to make work, work better for people. We are focused, disciplined and committed to helping our customers succeed. We have the platform businesses need and where the workflow standard for enterprise transformation. Customers are using the Now platform to create new workflows for new value chains, to improve experiences across silo systems and functions to reduce friction in people's daily lives, and it's showing in our financial results. I'm very excited about the future in front of us. 
Finally, before moving on to Q&A, I just want to thank all of our employees around the world for helping to make ServiceNow one of the Fortune 100 Best places to work. ServiceNow's greatest strength is its people, and you all continue to make us ServiceNow strong. Bill and I couldn't be prouder of this team. 
And with that, I'll open it up to Q&A."

So as you know, with digital transformation is a whole move to modernized apps, and this is really tying engineering and business together, and we're seeing a greater market awareness for ServiceNow's digital transformation enablement to automate manual processes within organizations. And we have a focus in this company on being the platform of all platforms, which means we don't need anyone to lose for us to win. So lots of folks integrate into the Now platform. And our low-code, no-code app development to create new workflows that deliver great experiences is really taking off. And I gave a couple of examples in our prepared remarks, one such example is a National Cancer Institute. So if you think about what they're doing at NCI, they established a digital service center of excellence, and they've done that around ServiceNow's low-code app engine platform. And when you think about time to value, it's just 10 days, they were up and running with an online portal to collect and track specimens of COVID-19 patients. So we think that this is going to be a runaway success story for the company. And when you look at the year-on-year growth here and you look at the pipeline, we are extremely bullish on this business."

And then in terms of the full year billings guide, it looks like the constant currency guide is about 23% at the midpoint. Just to clarify, was it about 22% before?

So I'll take the first question on the Q2 billings and the deceleration from Q1.

So I'll take the first question on the Q2 billings and the deceleration from Q1. So first off, you can see in our IR deck that in Q1, we had $11 million in multiyear billings that we don't expect to occur in Q2. So that's part of the deceleration. As well, we talked about timing, and we've talked about this in the past and why billings is not the best metric, right, because if customers are co terming during the contract period, they often renew early, which changes the timing of renewals and really impact billings. And so one of the reasons why billings is not the greatest of metrics and why we are pointing to and giving guidance now for cRPO of 30% in Q2. What I would say is that we are, in fact, seeing a reacceleration of net new ACV in Q2, given the Q2 comp from last year. It's just that there is a lot of noise in billings. And so I just continue to really stress that we should be looking more at cRPO. And then for the full year, it's about 28% normalized because remember, last year, we had the pull forward of $80 million of billings out of Q1 of 2021 and into Q4. And so the full year guide, we have increased it by almost the full Q1 be that you're seeing."

First of all, when you look at the pipeline in my prepared remarks, I was very careful to point out that it's never been better than it is right now. And in fact, it's outstanding. And has a couple of driving forces here: One, if you look at EMEA as a theater, the EMEA business is smoking hot. And you saw 80% year-on-year growth in the first quarter out of EMEA. So let that be the first indicator that the brand is now alive and -- we are operating extremely well through the Rolodex of EMEA and the CEOs across various industries and various mission-critical geographies are adopting us as the workflow standard. Continue to believe in EMEA as a great wellspring of growth to ServiceNow, and that was a big one for us to get really rolling. 
The other piece is APJ. We're seeing now outstanding growth out of APJ, and I would say the same is true for the brand. Now we're well known. We're on fire in Japan. As you know, Japan is an on-premise market and needs to move to the cloud. The workflow revolution is one great way to get them going in the cloud. I gave an example of that in my prepared remarks. We're also expecting better things that was with the leadership adjustment that we've made. We see South Korea doing extremely well. So I want you to believe in APJ is yet another well spring of growth that can go higher and higher with ServiceNow. We've always been strong in the Americas. The Americas had an extraordinary Q4, as you know, and they'll kick back into their normal growth rates at higher and be on course with where we wanted them to be at the end of Q2. So you add all that up in the geographic theaters and the business is in great shape. 
The other thing we've done is really focused on some breakthrough industries, financial services and telecommunications quickly come to mind, where once we get rolling, the Bowling alley effect takes effect very, very quickly here. And keep in mind, we're now in a global economy. That is shifting quickly to lights back on. Last year, GDP was down substantially in the global economy, yet digital transformation spend was up. This year as the economy comes back, they're not slowing down digital transformation spend, actually, it's also going up, but the economy is waking up. So what's gorgeous about this for us is we now have the CRM techniques of digital selling, combine it with the direct selling that always worked well. And some of the techniques that we've enabled also on inside selling and how we've taken the whole marketing value chain from the brand and communications to field marketing, industry specialization product marketing and then all the resources in the field to basically take that industry specific, value-driven story to the customer, and we've aligned that with our services organization, and an expansive ecosystem with all the big partners betting long on ServiceNow, setting up global practices with ServiceNow. 
So Alex, I've been in this business for 20 years. I've never seen an opportunity like this in my career, and I actually think we're just getting started."

Additionally, self-hosted deals could potentially impact the RPO vis-à-vis revenue growth. So there's no one perfect indicator, but cRPO is definitely a stronger indicator with less noise.

The truth is that we lean vaccine management on an emergency response, return to work in vaccine management level it was great for our brand. It was the right thing for our purpose, and it was wonderful in terms of expanding the inspiration of ServiceNow in the global economy. 
On a financial level, we, like everyone else, had to figure out a new way of connecting with customers. And in that environment, you'll always do better with your existing customers that already really like you and a loyal to you in terms of expanding your portfolio across your base. What you're going to see now is net new logos, net new ACV really kick up into high Gear at ServiceNow, which makes this such an exciting story because our sales force is a largely go-to-market direct sales force. And now they will be able to utilize all of those skills that have been built into that culture and are wired for perfection, really wired for perfection geographically, by industry and by Persona, and that will now be a new tailwind for the investors to enjoy as we progress in 2021. 
The lead generation, I tried to cover that earlier to, Kash, because I want to really make this clear. We have really refined the company in the context of generating leads. And what I mean by that is we took the brand. We ran a campaign today if you care to see it. You can look at the Wall Street Journal, and you'll see the Wanka campaign because we're letting the world know that the workflow revolution is on. And even the Willy Wonka chocolate factory can run better on the backbone of the ServiceNow platform. And we're educating a whole new generation around what workflow is really all about. And we've taken the brand, the communications, the field, the product marketing and align that to the industry, the GEO, the persona, the inside sales, the direct sales, and we're managing that funnel with a meticulous level of detail around machine learning and AI that manifests itself ultimately in a CEO dashboard, but we manage the whole company on a CRM level that is a really, really world class. In fact, I've never seen it anywhere at the depth of analytics who're running the business on Now. 
So the leads are not all equal. You have to understand how to manage the pipeline. You have to manage the noise in the pipeline. And as the economy opens up, those processes have been built now for industrial mass scale. So I want to let you know, watch net new ACV, watch net new logos, and watch this machine tick into higher on the back of Knowledge '21 and an already robust and swelling pipeline. We're really in great shape."

And they're trying to drive it across a mix of legacy and, of course, modern applications. And when you think about RPA, it's not a particularly differentiating technology, but it's particularly important for integrating with legacy applications that don't support API-based integrations. So what Intellibot does has a very strong experience in developing RPA solution and has existing product capabilities and technical talent that will help us accelerate and enhance our automation efforts. So think about it this way. 
Our focus is on delivering world-class automation and a platform we call the Now platform. And what we want to do is accelerate digital transformation. And RPA is a piece of that strategy. So RPA will extend our core ServiceNow workflows and it will automate certain repetitive tasks and it'll integrate with these legacy systems for basically intelligent end-to-end automation. And this is strengthened with our existing technologies, such as AI and ML. 
And as it relates to our participation in the open market, I can tell you that customers tell me that they feel like RPA has left them with islands of automation. And it's getting harder for them to manage as they scale, they're kind of hitting a wall. So what they're looking for is what we are providing, which is a single platform where workflow is the core engine that drives the process. And then they have a choice of the right automation technology for the use case, based on integrations, RPA, decision management or artificial intelligence. So what we'll give them is we'll give them something that's natively integrated into the Now platform. 
But for example, if you IPF or any other well-known RPA technology out there such as automation anywhere automation anywhere, if they're looking to work with them, that simply integrates into the Now platform. And they support us, and we support them because we're all on the size of the customer, and that's what really matters. And I really think this is a breakthrough a moment in this Q&A because we have taken that position with all participants in the market. But we don't need anyone to lose for us to win. What we do is we workflow end-to-end business processes, and we're automating work to make it work better for people. And if the customer has a certain vendor that they're working with, it integrates seamlessly within Now platform, it's okay. But there's a lot more of them that is saying, give it to me on one platform, make my life simple. I don't want islands of automation. I want a platform that really manages my business in a smart way. Either way the customer wants to work with us, we're happy to work with them."

Because they use the new user interface builder. And this capability has allowed them to basically create modern and data-rich applications at an incredible pace. And then at the same time, what you see happening is innovation at the edge of the enterprise. Like I'm the executive sponsor for one of the biggest banking customers in the world. They've got to modernize 5,000 applications. So as I saying to me is how can I, for my business people. Modernize an application really quick or build a net new application. So what you're seeing is this convergence now between the developers and the business people demanding innovation and change swiftly coming together on the Now platform. This business, I would not be surprised if it ends up being the biggest business we have. I see the money going to the cloud, whether it's multi-cloud platforms, it's SaaS platforms or its app innovation at the edge of the enterprise, and we are right there.

The guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating. Those assumptions are based on the facts we know today. Many of these assumptions relate to matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly, including but not limited to the time frames for and severity of social distancing and other mitigation requirements; the continued impacts of COVID-19 on customers' purchasing decisions; and the length of our sales cycle, particularly for customers in certain industries. Please refer to the press release and the Risk Factors and MD&A sections of our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and our 10-K filed for fiscal year 2020, for information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements.

And good afternoon to all of you. Welcome to our Q1 earnings call. I hope everyone remains healthy and safe and you and your loved ones are benefiting from broader vaccine availability.
ServiceNow remains grateful to be in such a strong position to help support our families, communities and customers. We started 2021 with another outstanding quarter, delivering a perfect balance of growth and profitability. Our team is executing, maintaining a swift pace towards our path to $10 billion in revenue and beyond. In Q1, we grew subscription revenue 30% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance. We delivered strong profitability with operating margin over 27%. And we increased free cash flow margin 7 points year-over-year to 46%. Our significant Q1 beat across the board represents the passion our culture has for innovating and our relentless focus on the customer. We are ideally positioned to deliver what our customers need.
In the past year, the transformation of work has accelerated the adoption of digital products, services and experiences. As a result, digital investments are at an all-time high; and will total more than $7.8 trillion by 2024, according to IDC. ServiceNow is the strategic authority for digital transformation across the enterprise. We have expanded the boundaries from IT to employee, customer and now creator workflows for citizen developers. The digital economy is firing on all cylinders, and so are we.
Our culture was born for this moment. Our team of 14,000 colleagues are exponential thinkers. This is how we continuously bring innovation to everything we do. In just the past 18 months, we have more than doubled the features and functionality of our platform for our customers. We're at the epicenter of the workflow revolution. Our purpose has never been more relevant. We are making the world of work, work better for people. We are helping our customers dream big and to build their digital bridge to the future. Xerox, for example, is working with ServiceNow to transform the services industry. Leveraging our field service management, their technicians will use machine learning to proactively solve customer problems. They're using virtual and augmented reality tools to resolve their customers' issues via desktop, mobile and smart glass devices. In this bold new world, it's as if their agents are there in person.
Digital transformation is about creating great employee and customer experiences. In an increasingly distributed, hybrid workforce, companies need to create frictionless experiences that make it easy for employees to get work done. This requires seamless cross-enterprise workflows linking systems, silos, departments and processes. Only the Now Platform can do this with native integrations: the platform of platforms, the power of one, one data model, one architecture, one enterprise solution to workflow every business challenge. This is what ServiceNow delivers. We are the only ones doing what we do the way we do it. Strong demand for ServiceNow is evident in our results, high growth organically driven at mass scale while aggressively investing in future growth and delivering significant profitability, an amazing business model and a true testament to the power of the Now Platform.
Our teams keep innovating. We're proud that Quebec, our latest platform release, delivered 1,700 new customer capabilities; breakthrough innovations like predictive AI operations, AI search and virtual agents that enhance every experience, to name a few. ServiceNow is helping customers move to the cloud and invent new business models. The past year has demonstrated that giving people the right productivity tools is critical to success, especially in distributed work environments. It's why organizations like Adobe, Deutsche Telekom, Logitech, city of Los Angeles and [ Discover ] are using the Now Platform. [ Discover ], in fact, is fully utilizing the Now Platform's ease of upgrade, participating in the early adopter program for our Quebec release. Now [ Discover ] is able to focus on timely availability and adoption of new functionality. The Now Platform is the gold standard for time to value.
By the end of 2021, Forrester Research predicts that 75% of development shops will use low-code platforms. With Quebec, we are delivering new low-code tools that move app development beyond the borders of the engineering organization and into the hands of citizen developers, employees without software expertise who need to quickly create workflow applications. We're seeing strong response. The National Cancer Institute at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is a great example. NCI has established a digital service center around ServiceNow's low-code app engine platform. In just 10 days, NCI leveraged ServiceNow to build a new application for an online portal to collect and track specimens from COVID-19 patients. ServiceNow's low-code app is helping NCI staff support the global research community in understanding how genetic factors contribute to the severity of COVID-19 cases.
We also introduced process and workforce optimization capabilities in our new enterprise SKUs. This brings even more intelligence to our customers, allowing them to be more agile. We're putting new AI capabilities in the hands of our customers so they can enhance productivity while spending more time on human creativity. With our recent acquisition of Intellibot, ServiceNow will have an unmatched intelligent workflow automation solution with RPA, AI, machine learning and process mining native to the Now Platform. You'll hear more about this from our Chief Product and Engineering Officer, CJ Desai, at our upcoming Investor Day. Please be there.
Now let's look more closely at Q1 performance highlights across our portfolio.
Our better together solutions continue to drive more multiproduct deals. Our core IT workflows remain strong. ITSM was in 12 of our top 20 deals. Our AI and ML capabilities embedded with our pro SKU continue to resonate with customers. ITOM had a strong quarter and was in 13 of the top 20 deals. EMEA was especially strong. We're hitting a new gear with CEO engagement. We're seeing more demand across industries, including financial services, as EU banking regulations require companies to have full visibility into their assets while also managing risk. HSBC, for example, chose ServiceNow in a multiyear partnership as their workflow partner of choice to help them digitize at scale. Supporting HSBC's employees, ServiceNow will deliver the technologies needed to simplify their architectural landscape. This creates efficiencies, better controls and compliance. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group also chose the ServiceNow platform to consolidate, simplify its IT systems and streamline operations to improve the employee experience. The Now Platform gives them the advantage of a fully integrated view of technology and risk.
We continue to see strength in our customer workflows. Our investments in the telco vertical are gaining traction daily and it's materializing in wins across the globe. Lumen Technologies, a leading telecommunications company, is transforming its customer care and assurance function with ServiceNow customer workflows. They will use the Now Platform to deliver best-in-class customer experiences across their networking, cloud and security solutions. Telia, a leading multinational telecommunications company, selected ServiceNow to transform service operations, connecting network operations, employees and customers around the world.
Creator workflows, our platform business, was in 19 of our top 20 deals. 3 of our top 10 app engine wins came from APJ, where we are seeing increased awareness of ServiceNow and is continuing to drive demand. A large global manufacturing company in Japan is planning to use our app engine to automate manual processes, take out costs and risks associated with migrating on-premise applications to the cloud. This will be a movement in Japan. In the U.S., the Now Platform is at the heart of the city of Los Angeles' digital transformation, helping to provide reliable access to essential services for its 4 million citizens. The city is expanding its use of digital technology to provide immediate-access services, which enables citizens to get the assistance they deserve. Employee workflows were included in 8 of our top 20 deals. Zalando is a leading online platform for fashion and lifestyle connecting customers, brands and partners. As part of their HR transformation, they will implement a central employee services portal using ServiceNow's employee workflows. Zalando sees this as a critical component in supporting their growth and improving their employee experiences.
Employee and workplace safety are top of mind for our customers. We are the only company with a complete suite of applications to meet these critical needs. Since the start of the pandemic, ServiceNow has been at the forefront of solving unprecedented challenges. We saw the need early and acted quickly, first, with our Emergency Response apps; then our Safe Workplace apps; and now with Vaccine Administration Management. We leverage the speed and agility of the Now Platform and the incredible talent of our product team to innovate fast, deliver market-leading solutions to support our customers and help keep them safe.
You see organizations are trapped in the last mile of vaccine management, as they lack the processes and infrastructure needed to vaccinate people quickly. This is the workflow challenge of our time. To address these challenges, organizations are using the Now Platform as their vaccine management command center. Our workflows are connecting organizations' existing technology infrastructure to help orchestrate the critical elements of the vaccine management process, including distributing, administering and monitoring vaccines. The Minnesota Children's hospital implemented our Vaccine Administration Management in 5 days so they could stay focused on their #1 priority, caring for children. The hospital is using ServiceNow virtual assistant to answer questions and schedule patient vaccinations. They are leveraging inventory tracking and scheduling to ensure appointments, staffing levels and vaccines are all in sync. Germany's largest state, North Rhine-Westphalia, is using ServiceNow to support vaccinations for millions of people. Within 2 hours of the portal going live, 120,000 people have registered and received an appointment. ServiceNow ended Q1 working with over 100 organizations and governments globally to help vaccinate people at scale. We are supporting the delivery and management of millions of vaccines globally. We will continue to do more. The workflow revolution is all about helping people. We are humbled to be helping so many people around the world manage this workflow challenge.
In summary, we had a great start to the year with strong momentum. I'm so proud of what our team has accomplished over the past year and what they continue to achieve. From the beginning of this pandemic, we have focused on taking care of our people and taking care of our customers. That's why we're so grateful to be named to the Fortune 100 ""best places to work"" list for the first time. And we're proud to have increased our position on the Fortune's Best Workplaces in Technology list by more than 10 points. Our culture demonstrates time and again how we've powered through all weather conditions. Our engineering pride is unmatched, our innovation relentless and our customer focus tireless. We have a very, very robust pipeline substantially greater than anything we've seen before. We have all the learnings of digital customer relationship management. Our strong go-to-market organization is operating in high gear. Our customer services and partner ecosystem is accelerating time to value. Our business is ever resilient, our opportunities never greater.
We continue to work with some of the world's greatest brands, including BMW, Bristol Myers Squibb, FIS, Subway, Standard & Poor's. We're honored to be their digital transformation partner. And we're also excited to highlight even more customers at our upcoming Knowledge21 experience in May, which will be our biggest customer event ever. And we look forward to seeing all of you at our upcoming Investor Day.
This ServiceNow machine is firing on all cylinders. We're not slowing down. We are well on our way to $10 billion and beyond, and we are striving with all we have to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.
Gina, over to you."
22967487,710567394,2261854,"ServiceNow, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","ServiceNow, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill.Q1 was a great start to the year. On the heels of a tremendous Q4, the team continued to execute well and delivered another strong quarter of outperformance.

Q1 was a great start to the year. On the heels of a tremendous Q4, the team continued to execute well and delivered another strong quarter of outperformance. We exceeded the high end of our subscription revenue, subscription billings and cRPO guidance; and those top line beats carried through to a very robust operating margin and strong free cash flow.
Q1 subscription revenues were $1.293 billion, representing 30% year-over-year growth inclusive of a 4-point tailwind from FX. Remaining performance obligations or RPO ended the quarter at approximately $8.8 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth, putting us well on our way towards our $10 billion revenue target. Current RPO was approximately $4.4 billion, representing 33% year-over-year growth and a 100 basis points beat versus our guidance. Notably, we delivered that beat with 100 basis points less of an FX tailwind. Due to the weaker euro, currency contributed 4 points instead of our original outlook for a 5-point tailwind.
Q1 subscription billings were $1.365 billion, representing 29% year-over-year growth and a $50 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. FX and duration were a 4-point tailwind year-over-year.
As Bill mentioned, we saw particular strength in EMEA as investments made in 2020 are gaining traction. In Q1, the region closed one of its largest deals ever, helping to drive very strong year-over-year net new ACV growth. We're also seeing improving trends in APJ, where we landed 2 of the top 3 platform deals in the quarter.
We continue to see the secular tailwinds driven by the intersection of digital transformation, cloud computing and business model innovation. Every C-suite leader wants to create great experiences for their employees and their customers, and ServiceNow is delivering. The Now Platform offers the speed, flexibility and innovation companies need. The sustained strength of our top line growth is the result of consistent execution from across the organization as we address these opportunities, from our engineers who continue to drive leading-edge innovation, to the sales and customer success teams who partner with our customers to ensure we're delivering value and everyone else in between that help to deliver great experiences. It's been a tremendous team effort.
Our renewal rates remained strong at 97%, as the Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. We closed 37 deals greater than $1 million ACV in the quarter, including 7 net new customers. Our focus on selling comprehensive solutions instead of point products continue to drive more multi-product deals as 17 of our top 20 deals included 3 or more products. We now have 1,146 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 23% year-over-year. And the number of customers paying us $5 million or more in ACV grew over 50% year-over-year.
Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 27%, up 300 basis points year-over-year, driven by our strong top line outperformance and the timing of some spend that will shift into Q2. Our free cash flow margin was 46%, up 700 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong collections and lower T&E. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability.
Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the macro trends we're seeing in our business. The industries highly affected by COVID that we outlined early last year, which represent about 20% of our business, remained resilient in Q1. We closed several 7-figure deals in these verticals, and renewal rates were ahead of the company average. However, we did continue to see some headwinds in severely impacted industries such as airlines. Regardless of the industry, in an increasingly distributed and hybrid workforce, companies need to create consistent and frictionless experiences that make it easy for employees to get work done. Digital investments are at an all-time high and are expected to continue growing, as companies must reinvest themselves for the new economy. ServiceNow is the strategic authority in digital transformation, and we're committed to helping our customers succeed in that journey.
These strong secular tailwinds, paired with the strength and agility of the Now Platform, positions us well for 2021 and beyond. Pipeline generation has remained robust globally even ahead of our Knowledge 2021 event, which is a big driver particularly for the Americas. [ It is ] helping to drive the net new ACV acceleration in our business this year. Enterprises around the world are recognizing the strength of our one architecture model; and its ability to deliver great, scalable experiences with speed and efficiency.
Now let's turn to guidance.
For Q2, we expect subscription revenues between $1.29 billion and $1.295 billion, representing 27% to 28% year-over-year growth, including a 300 basis point FX tailwind. We expect cRPO growth of 30% year-over-year, including a 250 basis point FX tailwind. We expect subscription billings between $1.25 billion and $1.255 billion, representing 23% year-over-year growth. Growth includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 300 basis points.
We expect an operating margin of 21.5%, which includes $15 million of sales and marketing spend that shifted out of Q1 and into Q2; and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter.
For the full year 2021, we're raising our top line growth guidance on a constant currency basis. We are increasing the midpoint of our previous subscription revenue expectations by $32 million based on the strong trends we saw in Q1. However, a weaker euro resulted in a $59 million headwind to our growth. Taken together, we expect subscription revenues between $5.455 billion and $5.47 billion, representing 27% to 28% year-over-year growth. This includes a 200 basis points FX tailwind. Similarly, we're increasing the midpoint of our previous subscription billings expectation by $50 million on a constant currency basis. However, the weaker euro resulted in a $68 million headwind to our growth. Taken together, we expect subscription billings between $6.19 billion and $6.205 billion, representing 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. This includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 150 basis points.
In terms of quarterly seasonality, we're continuing to see a shift of Q2 and Q3 subscription billings into Q4. We now expect about 21% of our total subscription billings to be in Q3 and 37% to be in Q4. We continue to expect subscription gross margins of 85% and an operating margin of 23.5%.
Finally, we expect free cash flow margin of 30% and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the year.
You'll hear more about our strategy and long-term opportunity at our upcoming Investor Day on May 10, which will be webcast on our Investor Relations website. In addition to making work, work better for people, we're also committed to making the world work better as well. This week, we unveiled our first-ever global impact report. At our Investor Day, I'm excited to be able to share ServiceNow's global impact strategy with you.
In conclusion. ServiceNow is leading this ""once in a generation"" opportunity to make work, work better for people. We are focused, disciplined and committed to helping our customers succeed. We have the platform [ businesses need ], and we're the workflow standard for enterprise transformation. Customers are using the Now Platform to create new workflows for new value chains to improve experiences across siloed systems and functions to reduce friction in people's daily lives, and it's showing in our financial results. I'm very excited about the future in front of us.
Finally, before moving on to Q&A, I just want to thank all of our employees around the world for helping to make ServiceNow one of the Fortune 100 best places to work. ServiceNow's greatest strength is its people, and you all continue to make us ServiceNow strong. Bill and I couldn't be prouder of this team.
And with that, I'll open it up to Q&A."

Thank you for the question. I think the answer is we've done all of those things. With Quebec, we're delivering new low-code tools that move app development beyond the borders of just the engineering organization and really into the hands of the citizen developers. So as you know, with digital transformation there's a whole move to modernize apps, and this is really tying engineering and business together. And we're seeing a greater market awareness for ServiceNow's digital transformation enablement to automate manual processes within organizations. And we have a focus in this company on being the platform of all platforms, which means we don't need anyone to lose for us to win. So lots of folks integrate into the Now Platform. And our low-code, no-code app development to create new workflows that deliver great experiences is really taking off, and I gave a couple of examples in our prepared remarks. One such example is National Cancer Institute, if you think about what they're doing at NCI. They established a digital service center of excellence, and they've done that around ServiceNow's low-code app engine platform. And when you think about time to value: In just 10 days, they were up and running with an online portal to collect and track specimens of COVID-19 patients. So we think that this is going to be a runaway success story for the company. And when you look at the year-on-year growth here and you look at the pipeline, we are extremely bullish on this business."

So I'll take the first question, on the Q2 billings and the deceleration from Q1.

So I'll take the first question, on the Q2 billings and the deceleration from Q1. So first off, you can see in our IR deck that in Q1 we had $11 million in multiyear billings that we don't expect to occur in Q2. So that's part of the deceleration. As well, we talk about timing. And we've talked about this in the past, and why billings is not the best metric, right? Because if customers are co-terming during a contract period, they often renew early, which changes the timing of renewals and really impacts billings and so one of the reasons why billings is not the greatest of metrics and why we are pointing to and giving guidance now for cRPO of 30% in Q2. What I would say is that we are in fact seeing a reacceleration of net new ACV in Q2 given the Q2 comp from last year. It's just that there is a lot of noise in billings, and so I just continue to really stress that we should be looking more at cRPO. And then for the full year, it's about 28% normalized because, remember, last year, we had the pull-forward of $80 million of billings out of Q1 of 2021 and into Q4. And so the full year guide, we have increased it by almost the full Q1 beat that you're seeing."

And first of all, when you look at the pipeline, in my prepared remarks I was very careful to point out that it's never been better than it is right now. And in fact, it's outstanding, and there's a couple of driving forces here. One, if you look at EMEA as a theater, the EMEA business is smoking hot. And you saw 80% year-on-year growth in the first quarter out of EMEA. So let that be the first indicator that the brand is now alive and well. We are operating extremely well through the Rolodex of EMEA. And the CEOs across various industries and various mission-critical geographies are adopting us as the workflow standard. Continue to believe in EMEA as a great wellspring of growth for ServiceNow, and that was a big one for us to get really rolling. The other piece is APJ. We're seeing now outstanding growth out of APJ, and I would say the same is true for the brand. Now we are well known, and we're on fire in Japan. As you know, Japan is an on-premise market and needs to move to the cloud. The workflow revolution is one great way to get them going into cloud. I gave an example of that in my prepared remarks. We're also expecting better things out of Australia with the leadership adjustments that we've made. We see South Korea doing extremely well, so I want you to believe APJ is yet another wellspring of growth that can go higher and higher for ServiceNow. We've always been strong in the Americas. The Americas had an extraordinary Q4, as you know. And they will kick back into their normal growth rates and higher and be on course with where we wanted them to be at the end of Q2. So you add all that up in the geographic theaters and the business is in great shape.
The other thing we've done is really focused on some breakthrough industries. Financial services and telecommunications quickly come to mind, where once we get rolling, the bowling alley effect takes effect very, very quickly here. And keep in mind we're now in a global economy that is shifting quickly to lights back on. Last year, GDP was down substantially in the global economy, yet digital transformation spend was up. This year, as the economy comes back, they're not slowing down digital transformation spend actually. It's also going up, but the economy is waking up. So what's gorgeous about this for us is we now have the CRM techniques of digital selling. Combine it with the direct selling that always worked well; and some of the techniques that we've enabled also on inside selling; and how we've taken the whole marketing value chain, from the brand and communications to field marketing, industry specialization, product marketing and then all the resources in the field to basically take that industry-specific, value-driven story to the customer. And we've aligned that with our services organization and an expansive ecosystem, with all the big partners betting long on ServiceNow, setting up global practices with ServiceNow. So Alex, I've been in this business for 20 years. I've never seen an opportunity like this in my career, and I actually think we are just getting started."

And Kash, thank you very much for the question because it's a very important one. Somehow, some way, I actually think some people have this illusion that ServiceNow was advantaged because of COVID; and the truth is that is not the case. The truth is that we leaned into vaccine management on an emergency response, return-to-work and vaccine management level. It was great for our brand. It was the right thing for our purpose. And it was wonderful in terms of expanding the inspiration of ServiceNow in the global economy. On a financial level, we, like everyone else, had to figure out a new way of connecting with customers. And in that environment, you'll always do better, with your existing customers that already really like you and are loyal to you, in terms of expanding your portfolio across your base. What you're going to see now is net new logos, net new ACV really kick up into high gear at ServiceNow, which makes this such an exciting story, because our sales force is a largely go-to-market direct sales force. And now they will be able to utilize all of those skills that have been built into that culture and are wired for perfection, really wired for perfection geographically, by industry and by persona. And that will now be a new tailwind for the investors to enjoy as we progress in 2021.
Lead generation, I tried to cover that earlier too, Kash, because I want to really make this clear. We have really refined the company in the context of generating leads. And what I mean by that is we took the brand. We ran a campaign today, if you care to see it. You can look at The Wall Street Journal. And you'll see the Wonka campaign because we're letting the world know that the workflow revolution is on and even the Willy Wonka chocolate factory can run better on the backbone of the ServiceNow platform. And we're educating a whole new generation around what workflow is really all about. And we've taken the brand, the communications, the field, the product, marketing; and align that to the industry, the geo, the persona, the inside sales, the direct sales. And we're managing that funnel with a meticulous level of detail around machine learning and AI. That manifests itself ultimately in a CEO dashboard, but we manage the whole company on a CRM level that is really, really world class. In fact, I've never seen it anywhere at the depth of analytics we're running the business on now. So the leads are not all equal. You have to understand how to manage the pipeline. You have to manage the noise in the pipeline. And as the economy opens up, those processes have been built now for industrial mass scale. So I want to let you know: Watch net new ACV. Watch net new logos. And watch this machine kick into high gear on the back of Knowledge21 and an already robust and swelling pipeline. We're really in great shape."

And they're trying to drive it across a mix of legacy and, of course, modern applications. And when you think about RPA, it's not a particularly differentiating technology, but it's particularly important for integrating with legacy applications that don't support API-based integrations. So what Intellibot does is -- it has a very strong experience in developing RPA solutions and has existing product capabilities and technical talent that will help us accelerate and enhance our automation efforts. So think about it this way: Our focus is on delivering world-class automation in a platform we call the Now Platform, and what we want to do is accelerate digital transformation. And RPA is a piece of that strategy. So RPA will extend our core ServiceNow workflows. And it'll automate certain repetitive tasks and it'll integrate with these legacy systems for basically intelligent end-to-end automation. And this is strengthened with our existing technologies such as AI and ML.
And as it relates to our participation in the open market, I can tell you that customers tell me that they feel like RPA has left them with islands of automation. And it's getting harder for them to manage as they scale. They're kind of hitting a wall, so what they're looking for is what we are providing, which is a single platform where workflow is the core engine that drives the process. And then they have a choice of the right automation technology for the use case based on integrations, RPA, decision management or artificial intelligence. So what we'll give them is we'll give them something that's natively integrated into the Now Platform, but for example, if -- UiPath or any other well-known RPA technology out there such as Automation Anywhere, if they're looking to work with them, that simply integrates into the Now Platform. And they support us and we support them because we're all on the side of the customer, and that's what really matters. And I really think this is a breakthrough moment in this Q&A because we have taken that position with all participants in the market, that we don't need anyone to lose for us to win. What we do is we workflow end-to-end business processes, and we're automating work to make it work better for people. And if the customer has a certain vendor that they're working with, it integrates seamlessly within the Now Platform, it's okay, but there's a lot more of them that is saying, ""Give it to me on one platform. Make my life simple. I don't want islands of automation. I want a platform that really manages my business in a smart way."" Either way the customer wants to work with us, we're happy to work with them."

When you think about what's going on -- like I talked about [ Discover ] in the prepared remarks, right? They were an early adopter of the Quebec release, and what they're doing is trying to give value back to the business. So this -- they shared that it's a better time to be a developer on the ServiceNow platform than ever before because they use the new user interface builder. And this capability has allowed them to basically create modern and data-rich applications at an incredible pace. And then at the same time, what you see happening is innovation at the edge of the enterprise. Like I'm the executive sponsor for one of the biggest banking customers in the world. They've got to modernize 5,000 applications. So [ they're saying to me is ], ""How can I, for my business people, modernize an application really quick or build a net new application?"" So what you're seeing is this convergence now between the developers and the business people demanding innovation change swiftly coming together on the Now Platform. This business, I would not be surprised if it ends up being the biggest business we have. I see the money going to the cloud, whether it's multi-cloud platforms. It's SaaS platforms or it's app innovation at the edge of the enterprise; and we are right there.

And we are at the kind of epicenter, I will say, of secular tailwinds which are forming around the convergence of IT and business, which I said earlier. So app modernization, operational transformation, IT in the business, they're all moving as quickly as possible to drive greater efficiency and more agility. This is a product already today where we have a very capable leader in engineering, Josh Kahn, who's been with us now for some time. And when I first came in here, the first thing he said to me is, ""Hey, I'm raising my hand. This could be big."" And I said, ""Well, we're going to get all behind you.""
So we already have specialist sales force that complements the general line to make sure that we capitalize on this opportunity.

The other thing we probably could have covered in greater detail, but I think you already all know this, is this one architecture, one data model and one platform, is really coming through strong now because most companies out there are either best of breed where they do one thing particularly well but not many things or they have many different platforms that aren't so well integrated. In our case, even as we put new innovation on the Now Platform, it's all integrated and it all works.

Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our second quarter 2021 financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the third quarter of 2021 and full year 2021. 
Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call, particularly our guidance, is based on information as of July 28, 2021, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. The guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating. Those assumptions are based on the facts we know today. Many of these assumptions relate to matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly, including, but not limited to, the time frames for and severity of social distancing and other mitigation requirements; the continued impact of COVID-19 on customers' purchasing decisions; and the length of our sales cycle, particularly for customers in certain industries. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and MD&A sections of our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and our 10-K filed for fiscal year 2020, for information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. 
We'd also like to point out that the company presents non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, remaining performance obligations or RPO and current RPO or CRPO. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today in our investor presentation. These and all prior press releases and investor presentations are posted at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill."

Welcome to our Q2 earnings call. Our team delivered an outstanding quarter, significantly exceeding the high end of our guidance across all metrics. Subscription revenues were up 31%. Subscription billings",1240,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q2 earnings call. 
Our team delivered an outstanding quarter, significantly exceeding the high end of our guidance across all metrics. Subscription revenues were up 31%. Subscription billings were up 30%. Operating margin was 25%. And the number of deals greater than $1 million was 51, up 28% year-over-year. Free cash flow for the first half of the year was up 34% year-over-year. An incredible performance by our team, an exceptional first half, and we have unstoppable momentum. And we reflected this in our strong full year guidance raise across the board. Gina will review the details with you in a few moments. 
The global economy is recovering at the fastest pace in 80 years. The enterprise digital transformation market is expected to grow nearly 3x faster than GDP in 2021. Business leaders worldwide are facing do or die moments. Business models have changed forever. The pandemic has accelerated the digital imperative. We are in a leading position to capitalize on this unprecedented tailwind. We are giving customers the innovative solutions they need to solve the greatest challenges of our time. The world's biggest challenges are ServiceNow's biggest opportunities. From vaccine management to ESG, to the new world of hybrid work. 
Whatever the challenge, work flows with ServiceNow. We've created a new market, one that respects the billions and billions of dollars of investment that customers have put into their systems of record. We make those investments work for today's digital business demands. The Now Platform, the platform of platforms, delivers workflow automation with a consumer-grade user experience that inspires our customers, enabling siloed systems across an enterprise to work together, creating more efficient, more productive ways to get work done. ServiceNow is the control tower for digital transformation for every business in every industry serving every persona. The power of the Now Platform makes this possible with one data model, one architecture and one platform to workflow a better world. 
For example, a premium German auto manufacturer faces huge logistical challenges in maintaining on-target production. Every 30 million parts are processed daily and have dispatched to more than 4,000 supplier locations to production centers in Europe and Mexico. To manage the complexity, ServiceNow provides a single connected supply chain technology platform. ServiceNow analyzes 300,000 data points per month, optimizing the performance of each aspect of the value chain. This is just one example of the power of the Now Platform. I'd like to share an overview of our success across ServiceNow's portfolio. 
Let's begin with our IT workflows. We are the standard for optimizing all IT services and operations. Our core IT workflows remained very strong. ICS was in 16 of our top 20 deals with 14 deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 15 of our top 20 deals with 6 deals over $1 million. Our AI-powered service operations is resonating big time with customers. We saw great wins with leading companies, including travelers and Walgreens Boots Alliance and more. They're working with ServiceNow to support their digital transformation of their enterprises. And we're honored that Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is working with ServiceNow to accelerate its digital transformation efforts as it looks to make Singapore a leading global port and international maritime center. NPA will leverage the Now Platform to drive automation and to improve productivity and employee experience. 
With employee workflows, we make work better by driving outstanding employee experience that enhance productivity for employees anytime, anywhere while also developing company loyalty, which is particularly important in this environment. The Now Platform provides employees the system of action for key events including onboarding, parental leave, moving and many more moments that matter for people. Employee workflows were in 13 of our top 20 deals with 6 deals over $1 million. 
Asahi, for example, is focused on expanding growth while reinforcing ESG initiatives that support sustainable value creation. They chose the Now Platform to improve the employee experience by providing a single point of contact for employees to improve productivity. They wanted service catalogs so they could standardize HR processes, and they wanted integrations to connect all their siloed workflows. With customer workflows, we're creating a new service paradigm by delivering connected experiences that redefine customer operations for greater speed, agility, transparency and convenience, all while working with existing systems. Customer workflows were in 10 of our top 20 deals, with 4 deals over $1 million. We now have over 2,000 customers running customer service management. 
Deutsche Telecom is leveraging ServiceNow's telecommunication solution to streamline order management to become the leading B2B telco provider. The Now Platform will be at the heart of the order management process, enabling a 360-degree view of orders, inventory and infrastructure, creating a seamless, connected experience for DT's employees and customers. 
With creative workflows, we're accelerating software development across the entire enterprise by giving everyone the low-code tools to quickly create applications and beautiful experiences. IDC predicts that more than 500 million apps will be developed by 2023. This is equivalent to the total number of apps that were developed in the past 40 years. For example, Airbus built an innovative tracking application in less than 3 months using ServiceNow's low-code app engine. Now Airbus employees can scan barcodes of any piece of factory equipment to see the relevant information they need in real time. Manufacturing transportation incidents have dropped 20%. In Q2, creative workflows were in 18 of our top 20 deals. 
Nokia picked ServiceNow's creative workflows to develop custom apps in significantly less time at a fraction of the cost of alternative platforms. These examples show how the combined capabilities of the workflows on the Now Platform are better together. They deliver even more value than the sum of their parts. Our introduction of the Now Buying Program has helped customers realize those synergies more quickly by simplifying the buying process, providing greater usage flexibility, all while improving business impact. 
Continuing to build a strong client and alliance ecosystem, we established an enterprise agreement through the Now Buying Program with Deloitte, who will take advantage of our full product suite to facilitate great experiences for their employees and clients while enhancing efficiencies and compliance management for the business. 
Also in our partner ecosystem, we recently announced our integration with Microsoft Windows 365. This will enable users to easily access cloud PCs directly through Microsoft Teams regardless of the employees' location and the hybrid work environment. 
In closing, I am incredibly proud of our team's passion for solving the world's greatest challenges. Our engineering team is second to none. Our go-to-market organization is the best in the business, and our purpose to make work better for people is resonating. It's been an honor to help turn vaccines into vaccinations for millions and millions of people. It's a privilege to help the world reopen and safely return to the workplace. We are engaging leaders on how we can solve society's biggest problems, improve the lives of people and help deliver better services to citizens everywhere. 
We are better than we were yesterday, not as good as we'll be tomorrow. This is a special company with unbridled energy and unprecedented opportunity. We are well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company in the 21st century, and I look forward to taking your questions. But first, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gina. Gina, over to you."

Q2 was a tremendous quarter with strong leads across our top line and profitability guidance metrics. The team demonstrated exceptional execution, and we saw strong demand across all regions and workflows. Q2 subscription revenues were",959,"Thank you, Bill. Q2 was a tremendous quarter with strong leads across our top line and profitability guidance metrics. The team demonstrated exceptional execution, and we saw strong demand across all regions and workflows. 
Q2 subscription revenues were $1.33 billion, $35 million above the high end of our guidance range and growing 31% year-over-year inclusive of the 40-basis-point tailwind from FX. Remaining performance obligations or RPO ended the quarter at approximately $9.5 billion, representing 35% year-over-year growth. Current RPO was approximately $4.7 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth and a 4-point beat versus our guidance. Currency was a 300 basis point tailwind year-over-year. Q2 subscription billings were $1.328 billion, representing 30% year-over-year growth and a $73 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. FX and duration were 500 basis points tailwind year-over-year. 
We saw growth across all our industry categories. Financial services and manufacturing were particularly strong across the globe, driven by investments in business continuity. Industries impacted by COVID, including retail and hospitality, also showed signs of recovery with strong net new ACV growth in the quarter. 
The Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations, reflected by our strong 97% renewal rate. The stickiness of our customer base has served as a solid foundation for us to build upon with our land-and-expand growth strategy. This is evident with the continued growth in our average customer spend this quarter. As of the end of Q2, we had 1,201 customers' payment over $1 million in ACV, up 25% year-over-year. This included 62 customers paying us over $10 million in ACV. Overall, we closed 51 deals greater than 1 million net new ACV in the quarter. We're also seeing robust net new ACV growth from new customers, with the average deal size growing over 50% year-over-year. Going to market with a solution sales approach to deliver the full capabilities of the portfolio instead of selling point products continue to drive more multiproduct fields. In Q2, 18 of our top 20 deals included 3 or more products. 
Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 25%, 3 points above our guidance, driven by the strong revenue beat, cost savings and some marketing spend that was pushed into the second half of the year. Our free cash flow margin was 19%. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. 
To navigate the post-COVID economy and the new era of work, businesses are investing in digital transformation to unlock new levels of innovation, agility and productivity. As you heard from Bill, the macro trends driving digital transformation are a significant opportunity for ServiceNow. 
Our Knowledge 2021 event in May included 2 amazing weeks of keynotes, panels and discussions that brought together experts and thought leaders of every industry across 141 countries to focus on these topics. This year, we released new solutions, including our manufacturing and health care industry products and showcase the power and endless possibilities achievable to ServiceNow workflow. The response from customers has been fantastic. The pipeline generated per attending account was up 45% year-over-year. 
Together, the macro tailwinds and interest generated from knowledge has accelerated pipeline growth for the second half of 2021. Furthermore, our coverage ratio today continues to remain ahead of a year ago. As a result, we are raising guidance for the full year. We are raising our subscription revenue outlook by $73 million at the midpoint to a range of $5.53 billion to $5.54 billion, representing 29% year-over-year growth, including 250 basis points of FX tailwind. We are raising our subscription billings outlet by $123 million at the midpoint to a range of $6.315 billion to $6.325 billion, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook for the year would be 31% at the midpoint. Growth includes the net tailwinds in FX and duration of 200 basis points. We continue to expect 2021 subscription gross margin at 85%, and we are raising our full year 2021 operating margin from 23.5% to 24.5%. This reflects the increase in our top line growth, more efficient marketing spend and saving some continued lower T&E expenses related to COVID. We are raising our full year 2021 free cash flow margin by 1 point from 30% to 31%. I'd note that from a seasonality perspective, we're expecting 40% of our total free cash flow in Q4. And lastly, we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 202 million. 
For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $1.4 billion and $1.405 billion, representing 28% to 29% year-over-year growth, including the 10-basis-point FX tailwind. We expect CRPO growth of 30% year-over-year, including 10-basis-point FX tailwind. We expect subscription billings between $1.32 billion and $1.325 billion, representing 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Growth includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 50 basis points. As a reminder, looking at billings from a 4 quarter rolling basis will help normalize the quarterly seasonality and changes in customer invoicing terms. On that basis, our Q3 subscription billings guidance would represent 31% year-over-year growth. We expect an operating margin of 23%. It's 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. 
In conclusion, digital transformation is accelerating across the globe, and ServiceNow is at the epicenter of that opportunity. ServiceNow is the digital fabric that stitches together existing systems of record, collapsing silos to connect fragmented processes. We are the platform company for digital business, and we are well on our way to becoming a $15 billion revenue company. I'm extremely proud of our team's performance this quarter, and Bill and I can't thank our employees enough for their hard work and incredible dedication. 
And with that, I'll open it up for Q&A."

First, I'd like to recognize our outstanding IT leadership as well as our incredible focus on analytics in the company because we really run the company on the ServiceNow platform. And whatever other systems even exist in the company, I couldn't pick them out of a lineup because the only thing we look at is now, ServiceNow. And I have real-time data on every single account and every single deal that's moving in the global economy, and I can tell you that the pipeline is incredibly robust. And it has substantially grown, and the lights are all green. Our sales leader is extremely positive on the second half of the year, as is our engineering leader, and the unity in the company around performing right now is really strong. So you can take Gina's guide and the raise that she just put in front of the capital markets to heart because we looked at every detail and everywhere we could with our own information, and it's very, very strong. 
In terms of the sales cycles, I think the sales cycles are moving quicker. The notoriety of the brand is resonating as the digital transformation control tower, as I said. IT has a strong hold on so many things now because if you want to give the employees a great experience, you want to provide the customers an unmatched service or you want to unify IT and business around creating these new workflows, which are necessary because there's not enough developers to develop all the applications that are required, everybody can agree on the Now Platform, and that seems to be unifying organizations between IT and business and accelerating our sales cycles and enlarging our deal sizes."

And I want you to rest assured that from finance to legal, to the way we execute the sales motions in the field and also enable our ecosystem, that whole value chain is right now pedal to the metal. So when you think about the Now Buying Program, we're looking at larger, rapidly expanding customers and making it easier for them to grow with us. So that includes simplifying the buying process, as you rightfully point out, using flexibility so they can easily upgrade to higher tiers of product innovation. Our innovators are just so amazing here. Every time you turn around, and the next release is a new breakthrough. I just can't thank them enough. ITSM Pro and Enterprise are doing terrific. And this is enabling customers to try things as well and exchange or adopt products that there will, and it's giving them a forward look at where we're going with our road maps. And when they see the innovation power of ServiceNow, that actually buys them in very quickly. 
And finally, I would just like to say we've done a really good job on the industry domain expertise in the company, but also on aligning all the value that we have to the platform and making sure the customer understands the value they realize. So as they step into bigger relationships with us, we can predict those expansions and those pricing tiers and the integrated customer success, support and value and maybe carry that into the boardroom with great confidence and say this is what ServiceNow is doing to deliver for you. I was really excited when I saw the Telia article that went out today, where they were talking about retiring 75 legacy systems as they standardize on the Now Platform. So it's just really good for the customer, and it's good for our folks, too, to get the customer to value fast."

I really appreciate it. 
In terms of the core business, the core is becoming more and more relevant as these enterprises try to separate away from the old world of islands of automation and point solution buying and dealing with fragmented systems, processes and silos. So the core of the core, of course, is our ITX portfolio, and that is really resonating with our customers because they can do all the things they want to do on one platform. And to the extent they want to leverage other technologies that they've already invested in, of course, we're so accommodating to that because our great engineers have built all out-of-the-box integrations to the biggest systems in the world. So it's kind of started with the core, and now it's moving across the enterprise with great speed. And all the businesses have done great. And in fact, all the geos are ahead of their operating plans. And they're all doing really, really well in every geography and every industry remain. 
So I would just like to give you a feel for this, Kash, by just saying like we have seen the immediate impact of our innovation in the core as we expand the perimeter to employee and customer service management and now creator, our great sales leadership sees the opportunity. And they see the hockey stick building in the pipeline, and we're trying to get out in front of that with the coverage model. And what I think you made a great sage comment on is that's a high-class situation because most companies are complaining about the war on talent, and they're actually suffering because they don't have enough talented people to do the job. We're only hiring 1% of the applicants that are highly qualified to come into ServiceNow, and the hardest part our recruiting team is doing right now is just keeping up with the inflow of all the resumes.

So the upside for this initiative and this way of thinking is quite dramatic because if you think about enterprise solution selling and you do that in all the geos and all the industries and you really establish a relationship plan with the customers at the C level that's quite convincing, you could do a lot. And what we could also do is get customers resonating with this and really lock them into the idea of a future road map. So they become a design partner, and that's really what we want. We don't want sales, we want partnerships. So if we have designed partnerships that go 3 or 5 years, we're buying into the road map, and we're doing that, giving the customer all the benefits of scale and innovation that they deserve from ServiceNow. And at the same time, we're investing less calories in selling things and more calories on building relationships that last a lifetime."

But if you remember, on a quarterly basis, there's a lot of seasonality built into billings. And so as we shared in the past, there's a couple of drivers impacting the growth rate, which is really a function of renewal and invoice timing and not a function of business performance. So one particular item this quarter for Q3 is as some of our customers are becoming larger, they've requested a change in annual to semiannual billing, and this is much more pronounced in Q3 of this year as we had 2 large customers that were previously invoiced annually in Q3 2020 that are now being invoiced semi and annual. So that's actually resulting in a 2-point headwind to the year-over-year growth. It's one of the reasons why I talked about the fourth quarter rolling number. And if you look at fourth quarter rolling for Q3 with this guide, it implies 31% year-over-year growth. So we absolutely expect a strong federal quarter. We absolutely expect continued acceleration in net new, and we are feeling really good about both the Q3 as well as the full year increase in billings guidance."

What we're seeing is ServiceNow has hired some of the best people in the world in creative workflows, in customer service management, in employee experience. And we have built big businesses within our company in these categories, so it's not at all unusual to see a customer begin with us on the employee experience side. There are many customers out there today that have systems of record that frankly can't accommodate a one-stop shop for all the hybrid work needs of a workforce that's going to be everywhere, and we uniquely serve that need with that consumer-grade UX on the mobile. And now you see us with amazing partnerships with Microsoft and others, and I think that really is creating a lot of interest in the marketplace, and yes, new deals beginning with employee experience. 
The same thing on customer service management. We're now in a direct-to-consumer, digital-first world and the Now Platform is uniquely advantaged for customer service, and that is our focus. And there's many companies, especially in telecommunications and banking not limited to that, that have come to us and started with us there. 
And I really want to stress this creative workflow situation. If you think about the 500 million apps that are going to have to be developed and the shortage of developers to do it, what you're going to see is a groundswell of new business opportunities with ServiceNow starting there because what's happening is they have to start with the low code, but they also want the resiliency and the security of tying into a unified platform like ServiceNow's. And ServiceNow is friendly to everybody in the market, and that's what customers want. They want somebody that breaks them out of the islands of automation. So we've seen new deals of creator and customer and employee, not just starting with IT. And yes, that is kind of a new frontier, and it's one of the reasons why we're very bullish on the company."

And that's why the Now Platform is a uniquely competitive advantage for us and for our customers on our ecosystem because it actually ties the front and the back together, and that's the big hop. So many enterprise participants, and I've been in the enterprise for a while, made their success out of being good in functional domains. We shrink wrap software and then pushing it out globally and getting standards built on it, and then ecosystems evolve on top of that. But what happened, especially in this hybrid work from anywhere world and with the digital transformation era, these are do or die moments now. And the executives in these companies need to have that resilient IT core that's absolutely Fort Knox in terms of its security, its resilience and its performance, and it has to serve the business. And then the business is pulling an IT to service. But even as the business wants to get innovative and do its own thing in this world, the silos are an impediment to progress. So I think having a great front office employee experience and having a great front office customer service management and a great career workflow tied to that resilient core, it's really resonating so big time. And the other thing is it's really nice to speak well of all the market participants because we just want to make them all better and we want to make all the customers successful.

And that is what I represented and Gina represented at our Capital Markets Day when we said we'd be a $15 billion-plus revenue company. 
Having said that, RPA and some of the other items that you mentioned, you shouldn't expect us to make acquisitions in that space, but you should expect us to build our functionality and our capabilities, but also being open and willing partner for the customers because it's really about solving their problems. And the biggest thing I hear from them is they've got lots of good point solutions all over the place. And that, in effect, is the root cause of a lot of the miss that's been created in these enterprises. And more and more, when I talk to leaders of companies, and spent quite a bit of time doing that this year, they tell me that they're looking for that control tower, that clear pane of glass that can move their workloads, enable their workflows, tighten up their systems, their siloed operations and enable their people to serve their customers. And really, that's what we're doing. So I'll always keep bringing it back to we can get where we said we'd go organically. We're always on our tippy toes looking at what's best for our customers and our shareholders. And we always look at that. But right now, the plan is ever steady, and there are no plans to acquire in the spaces that you mentioned."

Because as you know, every country in Europe has its own unique culture, its own unique business motions and you have to be strong with leadership in all of the geographies. And we're able to attract and retain the very best people in the enterprise software industry, and I think that's one of the root causes of our success. 
The second would be our C-level relationships. We have upped our game. And instead of dealing with only the CIO, which is an incredibly important executive to us, we have also created relationship plans across the C-suite and really enable the platform strategy for our customers, and I think that's the big evolution of ServiceNow in EMEA. We've become a platform company there as well. So it's kind of exciting when you consider how top Europe has had it with COVID and the travel restrictions to do as well as we are. And can you imagine when things do loosen up and open up a little bit, just how big this is going to get in Europe for us? So we're very excited. The business is going great. And EMEA, just so you know, is ahead of the first half operating plan, the internal operating plan, and that's a really good sign."

And the big organizations are going to insist on enterprise coherence and security and business process alignment, and the CEOs are very involved in digital transformation. These CEOs that are out there, some of the greatest leaders I've ever seen, and they're very focused on digital first, and they're not going to let these enterprises do whatever they want to do.

During today's call, we will review our second quarter 2021 financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the third quarter of 2021 and full year 2021. 
Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call, particularly our guidance, is based on information as of July 28, 2021, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. The guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating. Those assumptions are based on the facts we know today. Many of these assumptions relate to matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly, including, but not limited to, the time frames for and severity of social distancing and other mitigation requirements; the continued impact of COVID-19 on customers' purchasing decisions; and the length of our sales cycle, particularly for customers in certain industries. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and MD&A sections of our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and our 10-K filed for fiscal year 2020, for information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. 
We'd also like to point out that the company presents non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues; remaining performance obligations, or RPO; and current RPO, or CRPO. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today in our investor presentation. These and all prior press releases and investor presentations are posted at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill."

Our team delivered an outstanding quarter, significantly exceeding the high end of our guidance across all metrics. Subscription revenues were up 31%. Subscription billings were up 30%. Operating margin was 25%. And the number of deals greater than $1 million was 51, up 28% year-over-year. Free cash flow for the first half of the year was up 34% year-over-year. An incredible performance by our team, an exceptional first half and we have unstoppable momentum. And we reflected this in our strong full year guidance raise across the board. Gina will review the details with you in a few moments. 
The global economy is recovering at the fastest pace in 80 years. The enterprise digital transformation market is expected to grow nearly 3x faster than GDP in 2021. Business leaders worldwide are facing do-or-die moments. Business models have changed forever. The pandemic has accelerated the digital imperative. We are in a leading position to capitalize on this unprecedented tailwind. We are giving customers the innovative solutions they need to solve the greatest challenges of our time. The world's biggest challenges are ServiceNow's biggest opportunities: from vaccine management, to ESG, to the new world of hybrid work. 
Whatever the challenge, work flows with ServiceNow. We've created a new market, one that respects the billions and billions of dollars of investment that customers have put into their systems of record. We make those investments work for today's digital business demands. The Now Platform, the platform of platforms, delivers workflow automation with a consumer-grade user experience that inspires our customers, enabling siloed systems across an enterprise to work together, creating more efficient, more productive ways to get work done. ServiceNow is the control tower for digital transformation for every business, in every industry, serving every persona. The power of the Now Platform makes this possible with one data model, one architecture and one platform to workflow a better world. 
For example, a premium German auto manufacturer faces huge logistical challenges in maintaining on-target production. Every 30 million parts are processed daily and are dispatched to more than 4,000 supplier locations to production centers in Europe and Mexico. To manage the complexity, ServiceNow provides a single connected supply chain technology platform. ServiceNow analyzes 300,000 data points per month, optimizing the performance of each aspect of the value chain. This is just one example of the power of the Now Platform. 
I'd like to share an overview of our success across ServiceNow's portfolio. Let's begin with our IT workflows. We are the standard for optimizing all IT services and operations. Our core IT workflows remained very strong. ITSM was in 16 of our top 20 deals, with 14 deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 15 of our top 20 deals, with 6 deals over $1 million. 
Our AI-powered Service Operations is resonating big time with customers. We saw great wins with leading companies, including Travelers and Walgreens Boots Alliance and more. They're working with ServiceNow to support their digital transformation of their enterprises. And we're honored that Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is working with ServiceNow to accelerate its digital transformation efforts as it looks to make Singapore a leading global port and international maritime center. MPA will leverage the Now Platform to drive automation and to improve productivity and employee experience. 
With Employee Workflows, we make work better by driving outstanding employee experiences that enhance productivity for employees anytime, anywhere while also developing company loyalty, which is particularly important in this environment. The Now Platform provides employees the system of action for key events, including onboarding, parental leave, moving and many more moments that matter for people. Employee Workflows were in 13 of our top 20 deals, with 6 deals over $1 million. Asahi, for example, is focused on expanding growth while reinforcing ESG initiatives that support sustainable value creation. They chose the Now Platform to improve the employee experience by providing a single point of contact for employees to improve productivity. They wanted service catalogs so they could standardize HR processes, and they wanted integrations to connect all their siloed workflows. 
With Customer Workflows, we're creating a new service paradigm by delivering connected experiences that redefine customer operations for greater speed, agility, transparency and convenience, all while working with existing systems. Customer Workflows were in 10 of our top 20 deals, with 4 deals over $1 million. We now have over 2,000 customers running customer service management. Deutsche Telekom is leveraging ServiceNow's telecommunication solution to streamline order management to become the leading B2B telco provider. The Now Platform will be at the heart of the order management process, enabling a 360-degree view of orders, inventory and infrastructure, creating a seamless, connected experience for DT's employees and customers. 
With Creator Workflows, we're accelerating software development across the entire enterprise by giving everyone the low-code tools to quickly create applications and beautiful experiences. IDC predicts that more than 500 million apps will be developed by 2023. This is equivalent to the total number of apps that were developed in the past 40 years. For example, Airbus built an innovative tracking application in less than 3 months using ServiceNow's low-code app engine. Now Airbus employees can scan barcodes of any piece of factory equipment to see the relevant information they need in real time. Manufacturing transportation incidents have dropped 20%. In Q2, Creator Workflows were in 18 of our top 20 deals. Nokia picked ServiceNow's Creator Workflows to develop custom apps in significantly less time at a fraction of the cost of alternative platforms. 
These examples show how the combined capabilities of the workflows on the Now Platform are better together. They deliver even more value than the sum of their parts. Our introduction of the Now Buying Program has helped customers realize those synergies more quickly by simplifying the buying process, providing greater usage flexibility, all while improving business impact. Continuing to build a strong client and alliance ecosystem, we established an enterprise agreement through the Now Buying Program with Deloitte who will take advantage of our full product suite to facilitate great experiences for their employees and clients while enhancing efficiencies and compliance management for the business. 
Also in our partner ecosystem, we recently announced our integration with Microsoft Windows 365. This will enable users to easily access cloud PCs directly through Microsoft Teams regardless of the employees' location in the hybrid work environment. 
In closing, I am incredibly proud of our team's passion for solving the world's greatest challenges. Our engineering team is second to none. Our go-to-market organization is the best in the business, and our purpose to make work better for people is resonating. It's been an honor to help turn vaccines into vaccinations for millions and millions of people. It's a privilege to help the world reopen and safely return to the workplace. We are engaging leaders on how we can solve society's biggest problems, improve the lives of people and help deliver better services to citizens everywhere. 
We are better than we were yesterday, not as good as we'll be tomorrow. This is a special company with unbridled energy and unprecedented opportunity. We are well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. And I look forward to taking your questions. 
But first, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gina. Gina, over to you."

Q2 was a tremendous quarter with strong leads across our top line and profitability guidance metrics. The team demonstrated exceptional execution, and we saw strong demand across all regions and workflows. 
Q2 subscription revenues were $1.33 billion, $35 million above the high end of our guidance range and growing 31% year-over-year, inclusive of a 450 basis point tailwind from FX. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $9.5 billion, representing 35% year-over-year growth. Current RPO was approximately $4.7 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth and a 4-point beat versus our guidance. Currency was a 300 basis point tailwind year-over-year. Q2 subscription billings were $1.328 billion, representing 30% year-over-year growth and a $73 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. FX and duration were a 500 basis points tailwind year-over-year. 
We saw growth across all our industry categories. Financial services and manufacturing were particularly strong across the globe driven by investments in business continuity. Industries impacted by COVID, including retail and hospitality, also showed signs of recovery with strong net new ACV growth in the quarter. 
The Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations, reflected by our strong 97% renewal rate. The stickiness of our customer base has served as a solid foundation for us to build upon with our land-and-expand growth strategy. This is evident with the continued growth in our average customer spend this quarter. As of the end of Q2, we had 1,201 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 25% year-over-year. This included 62 customers paying us over $10 million in ACV. Overall, we closed 51 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV in the quarter. We're also seeing robust net new ACV growth from new customers, with the average deal size growing over 50% year-over-year. Going to market with a solution sales approach to deliver the full capabilities of the portfolio instead of selling point products continues to drive more multiproduct deals. In Q2, 18 of our top 20 deals included 3 or more products. 
Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 25%, 3 points above our guidance, driven by the strong revenue beat, cost savings and some marketing spend that was pushed into the second half of the year. Our free cash flow margin was 19%. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. 
To navigate the post-COVID economy and the new era of work, businesses are investing in digital transformation to unlock new levels of innovation, agility and productivity. As you heard from Bill, the macro trends driving digital transformation are a significant opportunity for ServiceNow. Our Knowledge 2021 event in May included 2 amazing weeks of keynotes, panels and discussions that brought together experts and thought leaders of every industry across 141 countries to focus on these topics. This year, we released new solutions, including our manufacturing and health care industry products, and showcased the power and endless possibilities achievable through ServiceNow workflows. The response from customers has been fantastic. The pipeline generated per attending account was up 45% year-over-year. Together, the macro tailwinds and interest generated from Knowledge has accelerated pipeline growth for the second half of 2021. 
Furthermore, our coverage ratio today continues to remain ahead of a year ago. As a result, we are raising guidance for the full year. We are raising our subscription revenue outlook by $73 million at the midpoint to a range of $5.53 billion to $5.54 billion, representing 29% year-over-year growth, including 250 basis points of FX tailwind. We are raising our subscription billings outlook by $123 million at the midpoint to a range of $6.315 billion to $6.325 billion, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook for the year would be 31% at the midpoint. Growth includes the net tailwinds in FX and duration of 200 basis points. 
We continue to expect 2021 subscription gross margin at 85%, and we are raising our full year 2021 operating margin from 23.5% to 24.5%. This reflects the increase in our top line growth, more efficient marketing spend and savings from some continued lower T&E expenses related to COVID. We are raising our full year 2021 free cash flow margin by 1 point from 30% to 31%. I'd note that from a seasonality perspective, we're expecting 40% of our total free cash flow in Q4. And lastly, we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 202 million. 
For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $1.4 billion and $1.405 billion, representing 28% to 29% year-over-year growth, including the 150 basis point FX tailwind. We expect CRPO growth of 30% year-over-year, including 150 basis point FX tailwind. We expect subscription billings between $1.32 billion and $1.325 billion, representing 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Growth includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 50 basis points. As a reminder, looking at billings from a 4-quarter rolling basis will help normalize the quarterly seasonality and changes in customer invoicing terms. On that basis, our Q3 subscription billings guidance would represent 31% year-over-year growth. We expect an operating margin of 23%. There's 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. 
In conclusion, digital transformation is accelerating across the globe, and ServiceNow is at the epicenter of that opportunity. ServiceNow is the digital fabric that stitches together existing systems of record, collapsing silos to connect fragmented processes. We are the platform company for digital business, and we are well on our way to becoming a $15 billion revenue company. I'm extremely proud of our team's performance this quarter, and Bill and I can't thank our employees enough for their hard work and incredible dedication. 
And with that, I'll open it up for Q&A."

First, I'd like to recognize our outstanding IT leadership as well as our incredible focus on analytics in the company because we really run the company on the ServiceNow platform. And whatever other systems even exist in the company, I couldn't pick them out of a lineup because the only thing we look at is Now, ServiceNow. And I have real-time data on every single account and every single deal that's moving in the global economy. And I can tell you that the pipeline is incredibly robust, and it has substantially grown and the lights are all green. 
Our sales leader is extremely positive on the second half of the year, as is our engineering leader, and the unity in the company around performing right now is really strong. So you can take Gina's guide and the raise that she just put in front of the capital markets to heart because we looked at every detail and everywhere we could with our own information, and it's very, very strong. 
In terms of the sales cycles, I think the sales cycles are moving quicker. The notoriety of the brand is resonating as the digital transformation control tower, as I said. IT has a stronghold on so many things now because if you want to give the employees a great experience, you want to provide the customers an unmatched service or you want to unify IT and business around creating these new workflows, which are necessary because there's not enough developers to develop all the applications that are required, everybody can agree on the Now Platform, and that seems to be unifying organizations between IT and business and accelerating our sales cycles and enlarging our deal sizes."

And I think what differentiates us uniquely is this is one pane of glass, it's one user experience and it is not just the developer operations, you'll also see business executives align on this as well. And to us, that's going to really help organizations seamlessly connect their digital experiences across the enterprise. Again, the platform, I can't stress this enough, the digital platform, the Now Platform, is the glue that's tying it all together."

We're in a market that is very robust, digital transformation is really hot, and we are that signature brand. So the more quickly we can evolve the upgrade process and the net new deals to get customers live, that's really what it's all about. And I want you to rest assured that from finance to legal, to the way we execute the sales motions in the field and also enable our ecosystem, that whole value chain is right now pedal to the metal. 
So when you think about the Now Buying Program, we're looking at larger, rapidly expanding customers and making it easier for them to grow with us. So that includes simplifying the buying process, as you rightfully point out, using flexibility so they can easily upgrade to higher tiers of product innovation. Our innovators are just so amazing here. Every time you turn around, in the next release there's a new breakthrough. I just can't thank them enough. ITSM Pro and Enterprise are doing terrific. And this is enabling customers to try things as well and exchange or adopt products at their will, and it's giving them a forward look at where we're going with our road maps. And when they see the innovation power of ServiceNow, that actually buys them in very quickly. 
And finally, I would just like to say we've done a really good job on the industry domain expertise in the company but also on aligning all the value that we have to the platform and making sure the customer understands the value they realize. So as they step into bigger relationships with us, we can predict those expansions and those pricing tiers and the integrated customer success, support and value and maybe carry that into the boardroom with great confidence and say this is what ServiceNow is doing to deliver for you. I was really excited when I saw the Telia article that went out today where they were talking about retiring 75 legacy systems as they standardize on the Now Platform. So it's just really good for the customer, and it's good for our folks, too, to get the customer value fast."

I really appreciate it. In terms of the core business, the core is becoming more and more relevant as these enterprises try to separate away from the old world of islands of automation and point solution buying and dealing with fragmented systems, processes and silos. So the core of the core, of course, is our ITX portfolio, and that is really resonating with our customers because they can do all the things they want to do on one platform. And to the extent they want to leverage other technologies that they've already invested in, of course, we're so accommodating to that because our great engineers have built all out-of-the-box integrations to the biggest systems in the world. So it's kind of started with the core, and now it's moving across the enterprise with great speed. 
And all the businesses have done great. And in fact, all the geos are ahead of their operating plans. And they're all doing really, really well in every geography and every industry. It's amazing. So I would just like to give you a feel for this, Kash, by just saying like we have seen the immediate impact of our innovation in the core as we expand the perimeter to Employee and Customer Service Management and now Creator. Our great sales leadership sees the opportunity. And they see the hockey stick building in the pipeline, and we're trying to get out in front of that with the coverage model. 
And what I think you made a great sage comment on is that's a high-class situation because most companies are complaining about the war on talent, and they're actually suffering because they don't have enough talented people to do the job. We're only hiring 1% of the applicants that are highly qualified to come into ServiceNow, and the hardest part our recruiting team is doing right now is just keeping up with the inflow of all the resumes. So I think it's great that we're actually hiring ahead. We see a great hockey stick in the pipeline, and I have tremendous confidence in our sales leadership all over the world."

But if you remember, on a quarterly basis, there's a lot of seasonality built into billings. And so as we shared in the past, there's a couple of drivers impacting the growth rate, which is really a function of renewal and invoice timing and not a function of business performance. So one particular item this quarter for Q3 is, as some of our customers are becoming larger, they've requested a change in annual to semiannual billing, and this is much more pronounced in Q3 of this year as we had 2 large customers that were previously invoiced annually in Q3 2020 that are now being invoiced semiannual. So that's actually resulting in a 2-point headwind to the year-over-year growth. 
It's one of the reasons why I talked about the 4-quarter rolling number. And if you look at 4-quarter rolling for Q3 with this guide, it implies 31% year-over-year growth. So we absolutely expect a strong federal quarter. We absolutely expect continued acceleration in net new, and we are feeling really good about both the Q3 as well as the full year increase in billings guidance."

And as you can tell, they'll likely need to be readministering things regularly and managing that process. We're front and center in that.

What we're seeing is ServiceNow has hired some of the best people in the world in Creator Workflows, in Customer Service Management, in Employee Experience. And we have built big businesses within our company in these categories. So it's not at all unusual to see a customer begin with us on the Employee Experience side. There are many customers out there today that have systems of record that, frankly, can't accommodate a one-stop shop for all the hybrid work needs of a workforce that's going to be everywhere. And we uniquely serve that need with that consumer-grade UX on the mobile. And now you see us with amazing partnerships with Microsoft and others, and I think that really is creating a lot of interest in the marketplace, and yes, new deals beginning with Employee Experience. 
The same thing on Customer Service Management. We're now in a direct-to-consumer, digital-first world. And the Now Platform is uniquely advantaged for customer service, and that is our focus. And there's many companies, especially in telecommunications and banking, not limited to that, that have come to us and started with us there. And I really want to stress this Creator Workflow situation. If you think about the 500 million apps that are going to have to be developed and the shortage of developers to do it, what you're going to see is a groundswell of new business opportunities with ServiceNow starting there because what's happening is they have to start with the low code, but they also want the resiliency and the security of tying into a unified platform like ServiceNow's. And ServiceNow is friendly to everybody in the market, and that's what customers want. They want somebody that breaks them out of the islands of automation.

It actually is both, and that's the big change in the enterprise. And that's why the Now Platform is a uniquely competitive advantage for us and for our customers on our ecosystem because it actually ties the front and the back together, and that's the big aha. So many enterprise participants, and I've been in the enterprise for a while, made their success out of being good in functional domains. We shrinkwrap software and then pushing it out globally and getting standards built on it, and then ecosystems evolve on top of that. 
But what happened, especially in this hybrid work-from-anywhere world and with the digital transformation era, these are do-or-die moments now. And the executives in these companies need to have that resilient IT core that's absolutely Fort Knox in terms of its security, its resilience and its performance, and it has to serve the business. And then the business is pulling an IT to serve it. But even as the business wants to get innovative and do its own thing, in this world, the silos are an impediment to progress. 
So I think having a great front-office Employee Experience and having a great front-office Customer Service Management and a great Creator Workflow tied to that resilient core, it's really resonating so big time. And the other thing is it's really nice to speak well of all the market participants because we just want to make them all better and we want to make all the customers successful. So that Now Platform is really sinking in as the platform for digital business, and that's really what we dreamed of, and it's happening."

I will tell you that there are many customers that absolutely tell us that we want ServiceNow to be that digital transformation platform, that backbone for all of our functions.

But at the same time, if there's others in their installed base that they want to amplify, we're happy to do that.

And that is what I represented and Gina represented at our Capital Markets Day when we said we'd be a $15 billion-plus revenue company. 
Having said that, RPA and some of the other items that you mentioned, you shouldn't expect us to make acquisitions in that space, but you should expect us to build our functionality and our capabilities, but also being open and willing partner for the customers because it's really about solving their problems. And the biggest thing I hear from them is they've got lots of good point solutions all over the place. And that, in effect, is the root cause of a lot of the mess that's been created in these enterprises. And more and more, when I talk to leaders of companies, and spent quite a bit of time doing that this year, they tell me that they're looking for that control tower, that clear pane of glass that can move their workloads, enable their workflows, tighten up their systems, their siloed operations and enable their people to serve their customers. And really, that's what we're doing. 
So I'll always keep bringing it back to we can get where we said we'd go organically. We're always on our tippy toes, looking at what's best for our customers and our shareholders.

Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our second quarter 2021 financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the third quarter of 2021 and full year 2021. 
Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call, particularly our guidance, is based on information as of July 28, 2021, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. The guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating. 
Those assumptions are based on the facts we know today. Many of these assumptions relate to matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly, including, but not limited to, the time frames for and severity of social distancing and other mitigation requirements; the continued impact of COVID-19 on customers' purchasing decisions; and the length of our sales cycle, particularly for customers in certain industries. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and MD&A sections of our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and our 10-K filed for fiscal year 2020, for information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. 
We'd also like to point out that the company presents non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues; remaining performance obligations, or RPO; and current RPO, or CRPO. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today in our investor presentation. These and all prior press releases and investor presentations are posted at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill."

Our team delivered an outstanding quarter, significantly exceeding the high end of our guidance across all metrics. Subscription revenues were up 31%. Subscription billings were up 30%. Operating margin was 25%. And the number of deals greater than $1 million was 51, up 28% year-over-year. Free cash flow for the first half of the year was up 34% year-over-year. An incredible performance by our team, an exceptional first half and we have unstoppable momentum. And we reflected this in our strong full year guidance raise across the board. Gina will review the details with you in a few moments. 
The global economy is recovering at the fastest pace in 80 years. The enterprise digital transformation market is expected to grow nearly 3x faster than GDP in 2021. Business leaders worldwide are facing do-or-die moments. Business models have changed forever. The pandemic has accelerated the digital imperative. We are in a leading position to capitalize on this unprecedented tailwind. We are giving customers the innovative solutions they need to solve the greatest challenges of our time. The world's biggest challenges are ServiceNow's biggest opportunities: from vaccine management, to ESG, to the new world of hybrid work. 
Whatever the challenge, work flows with ServiceNow. We've created a new market, one that respects the billions and billions of dollars of investment that customers have put into their systems of record. We make those investments work for today's digital business demands. The Now Platform, the platform of platforms, delivers workflow automation with a consumer-grade user experience that inspires our customers, enabling siloed systems across an enterprise to work together, creating more efficient, more productive ways to get work done. ServiceNow is the control tower for digital transformation for every business, in every industry, serving every persona. The power of the Now Platform makes this possible with one data model, one architecture and one platform to workflow a better world. 
For example, a premium German auto manufacturer faces huge logistical challenges in maintaining on-target production. Every 30 million parts are processed daily and are dispatched to more than 4,000 supplier locations to production centers in Europe and Mexico. To manage the complexity, ServiceNow provides a single connected supply chain technology platform. ServiceNow analyzes 300,000 data points per month, optimizing the performance of each aspect of the value chain. This is just one example of the power of the Now Platform. 
I'd like to share an overview of our success across ServiceNow's portfolio. Let's begin with our IT workflows. We are the standard for optimizing all IT services and operations. Our core IT workflows remained very strong. ITSM was in 16 of our top 20 deals, with 14 deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 15 of our top 20 deals, with 6 deals over $1 million. 
Our AI-powered Service Operations is resonating big time with customers. We saw great wins with leading companies, including Travelers and Walgreens Boots Alliance and more. They're working with ServiceNow to support their digital transformation of their enterprises. And we're honored that Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is working with ServiceNow to accelerate its digital transformation efforts as it looks to make Singapore a leading global port and international maritime center. MPA will leverage the Now Platform to drive automation and to improve productivity and employee experience. 
With Employee Workflows, we make work better by driving outstanding employee experiences that enhance productivity for employees anytime, anywhere while also developing company loyalty, which is particularly important in this environment. The Now Platform provides employees the system of action for key events, including onboarding, parental leave, moving and many more moments that matter for people. Employee Workflows were in 13 of our top 20 deals, with 6 deals over $1 million. Asahi, for example, is focused on expanding growth while reinforcing ESG initiatives that support sustainable value creation. They chose the Now Platform to improve the employee experience by providing a single point of contact for employees to improve productivity. They wanted service catalogs so they could standardize HR processes, and they wanted integrations to connect all their siloed workflows. 
With Customer Workflows, we're creating a new service paradigm by delivering connected experiences that redefine customer operations for greater speed, agility, transparency and convenience, all while working with existing systems. Customer Workflows were in 10 of our top 20 deals, with 4 deals over $1 million. We now have over 2,000 customers running customer service management. Deutsche Telekom is leveraging ServiceNow's telecommunication solution to streamline order management to become the leading B2B telco provider. The Now Platform will be at the heart of the order management process, enabling a 360-degree view of orders, inventory and infrastructure, creating a seamless, connected experience for DT's employees and customers. 
With Creator Workflows, we're accelerating software development across the entire enterprise by giving everyone the low-code tools to quickly create applications and beautiful experiences. IDC predicts that more than 500 million apps will be developed by 2023. This is equivalent to the total number of apps that were developed in the past 40 years. For example, Airbus built an innovative tracking application in less than 3 months using ServiceNow's low-code app engine. Now Airbus employees can scan barcodes of any piece of factory equipment to see the relevant information they need in real time. Manufacturing transportation incidents have dropped 20%. In Q2, Creator Workflows were in 18 of our top 20 deals. Nokia picked ServiceNow's Creator Workflows to develop custom apps in significantly less time at a fraction of the cost of alternative platforms. 
These examples show how the combined capabilities of the workflows on the Now Platform are better together. They deliver even more value than the sum of their parts. Our introduction of the Now Buying Program has helped customers realize those synergies more quickly by simplifying the buying process, providing greater usage flexibility, all while improving business impact. Continuing to build a strong client and alliance ecosystem, we established an enterprise agreement through the Now Buying Program with Deloitte who will take advantage of our full product suite to facilitate great experiences for their employees and clients while enhancing efficiencies and compliance management for the business. 
Also in our partner ecosystem, we recently announced our integration with Microsoft Windows 365. This will enable users to easily access cloud PCs directly through Microsoft Teams regardless of the employees' location in the hybrid work environment. 
In closing, I am incredibly proud of our team's passion for solving the world's greatest challenges. Our engineering team is second to none. Our go-to-market organization is the best in the business, and our purpose to make work better for people is resonating. It's been an honor to help turn vaccines into vaccinations for millions and millions of people. It's a privilege to help the world reopen and safely return to the workplace. We are engaging leaders on how we can solve society's biggest problems, improve the lives of people and help deliver better services to citizens everywhere. 
We are better than we were yesterday, not as good as we'll be tomorrow. This is a special company with unbridled energy and unprecedented opportunity. We are well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. And I look forward to taking your questions. 
But first, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gina. Gina, over to you."
22967487,1673275047,2389855,"ServiceNow, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","ServiceNow, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Q2 was a tremendous quarter with strong beats across our top line and profitability guidance metrics.

Q2 was a tremendous quarter with strong beats across our top line and profitability guidance metrics. The team demonstrated exceptional execution, and we saw strong demand across all regions and workflows. 
Q2 subscription revenues were $1.33 billion, $35 million above the high end of our guidance range and growing 31% year-over-year, inclusive of a 450 basis point tailwind from FX. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $9.5 billion, representing 35% year-over-year growth. Current RPO was approximately $4.7 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth and a 4-point beat versus our guidance. Currency was a 300 basis point tailwind year-over-year. Q2 subscription billings were $1.328 billion, representing 30% year-over-year growth and a $73 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. FX and duration were a 500 basis points tailwind year-over-year. 
We saw growth across all our industry categories. Financial services and manufacturing were particularly strong across the globe driven by investments in business continuity. Industries impacted by COVID, including retail and hospitality, also showed signs of recovery with strong net new ACV growth in the quarter. 
The Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations, reflected by our strong 97% renewal rate. The stickiness of our customer base has served as a solid foundation for us to build upon with our land-and-expand growth strategy. This is evident with the continued growth in our average customer spend this quarter. As of the end of Q2, we had 1,201 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 25% year-over-year. This included 62 customers paying us over $10 million in ACV. Overall, we closed 51 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV in the quarter. We're also seeing robust net new ACV growth from new customers, with the average deal size growing over 50% year-over-year. Going to market with a solution sales approach to deliver the full capabilities of the portfolio instead of selling point products continues to drive more multiproduct deals. In Q2, 18 of our top 20 deals included 3 or more products. 
Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 25%, 3 points above our guidance, driven by the strong revenue beat, T&E cost savings and some marketing spend that was pushed into the second half of the year. Our free cash flow margin was 19%. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. 
To navigate the post-COVID economy and the new era of work, businesses are investing in digital transformation to unlock new levels of innovation, agility and productivity. As you heard from Bill, the macro trends driving digital transformation are a significant opportunity for ServiceNow. Our Knowledge 2021 event in May included 2 amazing weeks of keynotes, panels and discussions that brought together experts and thought leaders of every industry across 141 countries to focus on these topics. This year, we released new solutions, including our manufacturing and health care industry products, and showcased the power and endless possibilities achievable through ServiceNow workflows. The response from customers has been fantastic. The pipeline generated per attending account was up 45% year-over-year. Together, the macro tailwinds and interest generated from Knowledge has accelerated pipeline growth for the second half of 2021. 
Furthermore, our coverage ratio today continues to remain ahead of a year ago. As a result, we are raising guidance for the full year. We are raising our subscription revenue outlook by $73 million at the midpoint to a range of $5.53 billion to $5.54 billion, representing 29% year-over-year growth, including 250 basis points of FX tailwind. We are raising our subscription billings outlook by $123 million at the midpoint to a range of $6.315 billion to $6.325 billion, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook for the year would be 31% at the midpoint. Growth includes the net tailwinds in FX and duration of 200 basis points. 
We continue to expect 2021 subscription gross margin at 85%, and we are raising our full year 2021 operating margin from 23.5% to 24.5%. This reflects the increase in our top line growth, more efficient marketing spend and savings from some continued lower T&E expenses related to COVID. We are raising our full year 2021 free cash flow margin by 1 point from 30% to 31%. I'd note that from a seasonality perspective, we're expecting 40% of our total free cash flow in Q4. And lastly, we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 202 million. 
For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $1.4 billion and $1.405 billion, representing 28% to 29% year-over-year growth, including the 150 basis point FX tailwind. We expect CRPO growth of 30% year-over-year, including 150 basis point FX tailwind. We expect subscription billings between $1.32 billion and $1.325 billion, representing 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Growth includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 50 basis points. As a reminder, looking at billings from a 4-quarter rolling basis will help normalize the quarterly seasonality and changes in customer invoicing terms. On that basis, our Q3 subscription billings guidance would represent 31% year-over-year growth. We expect an operating margin of 23%. There's 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. 
In conclusion, digital transformation is accelerating across the globe, and ServiceNow is at the epicenter of that opportunity. ServiceNow is the digital fabric that stitches together existing systems of record, collapsing silos to connect fragmented processes. We are the platform company for digital business, and we are well on our way to becoming a $15 billion revenue company. I'm extremely proud of our team's performance this quarter, and Bill and I can't thank our employees enough for their hard work and incredible dedication. 
And with that, I'll open it up for Q&A."

First, I'd like to recognize our outstanding IT leadership as well as our incredible focus on analytics in the company because we really run the company on the ServiceNow platform. And whatever other systems even exist in the company, I couldn't pick them out of a lineup because the only thing we look at is Now, ServiceNow. And I have real-time data on every single account and every single deal that's moving in the global economy. And I can tell you that the pipeline is incredibly robust, and it has substantially grown and the lights are all green. 
Our sales leader is extremely positive on the second half of the year, as is our engineering leader, and the unity in the company around performing right now is really strong. So you can take Gina's guide and the raise that she just put in front of the capital markets to heart because we looked at every detail and everywhere we could with our own information, and it's very, very strong. 
In terms of the sales cycles, I think the sales cycles are moving quicker. The notoriety of the brand is resonating as the digital transformation control tower, as I said. IT has a stronghold on so many things now because if you want to give the employees a great experience, you want to provide the customers an unmatched service or you want to unify IT and business around creating these new workflows, which are necessary because there's not enough developers to develop all the applications that are required, everybody can agree on the Now Platform, and that seems to be unifying organizations between IT and business and accelerating our sales cycles and enlarging our deal sizes."

And I want you to rest assured that from finance to legal, to the way we execute the sales motions in the field and also enable our ecosystem, that whole value chain is right now pedal to the metal. 
So when you think about the Now Buying Program, we're looking at larger, rapidly expanding customers and making it easier for them to grow with us. So that includes simplifying the buying process, as you rightfully point out, using flexibility so they can easily upgrade to higher tiers of product innovation. Our innovators are just so amazing here. Every time you turn around, in the next release there's a new breakthrough. I just can't thank them enough. ITSM Pro and Enterprise are doing terrific. And this is enabling customers to try things as well and exchange or adopt products at their will, and it's giving them a forward look at where we're going with our road maps. And when they see the innovation power of ServiceNow, that actually buys them in very quickly. 
And finally, I would just like to say we've done a really good job on the industry domain expertise in the company but also on aligning all the value that we have to the platform and making sure the customer understands the value they realize. So as they step into bigger relationships with us, we can predict those expansions and those pricing tiers and the integrated customer success, support and value and maybe carry that into the boardroom with great confidence and say this is what ServiceNow is doing to deliver for you. I was really excited when I saw the Telia article that went out today where they were talking about retiring 75 legacy systems as they standardize on the Now Platform. So it's just really good for the customer, and it's good for our folks, too, to get the customer value fast."

I really appreciate it. In terms of the core business, the core is becoming more and more relevant as these enterprises try to separate away from the old world of islands of automation and point solution buying and dealing with fragmented systems, processes and silos. So the core of the core, of course, is our ITX portfolio, and that is really resonating with our customers because they can do all the things they want to do on one platform. And to the extent they want to leverage other technologies that they've already invested in, of course, we're so accommodating to that because our great engineers have built all out-of-the-box integrations to the biggest systems in the world. So it's kind of started with the core, and now it's moving across the enterprise with great speed. 
And all the businesses have done great. And in fact, all the geos are ahead of their operating plans. And they're all doing really, really well in every geography and every industry. It's amazing. So I would just like to give you a feel for this, Kash, by just saying like we have seen the immediate impact of our innovation in the core as we expand the perimeter to Employee and Customer Service Management and now Creator. Our great sales leadership sees the opportunity. And they see the hockey stick building in the pipeline, and we're trying to get out in front of that with the coverage model. 
And what I think you made a great sage comment on is that's a high-class situation because most companies are complaining about the war on talent, and they're actually suffering because they don't have enough talented people to do the job. We're only hiring 1% of the applicants that are highly qualified to come into ServiceNow, and the hardest part our recruiting team is doing right now is just keeping up with the inflow of all the resumes.

So the upside for this initiative and this way of thinking is quite dramatic because if you think about enterprise solution selling and you do that in all the geos and all the industries and you really establish a relationship plan with the customers at the C level that's quite convincing, you could do a lot. And what we could also do is get customers resonating with this and really lock them into the idea of a future road map. So they become a design partner, and that's really what we want. We don't want sales, we want partnerships. 
So if we have designed partnerships that go 3 or 5 years, we're buying into the road map, and we're doing that, giving the customer all the benefits of scale and innovation that they deserve from ServiceNow. And at the same time, we're investing less calories in selling things and more calories on building relationships that last a lifetime."

But if you remember, on a quarterly basis, there's a lot of seasonality built into billings. And so as we shared in the past, there's a couple of drivers impacting the growth rate, which is really a function of renewal and invoice timing and not a function of business performance. So one particular item this quarter for Q3 is, as some of our customers are becoming larger, they've requested a change in annual to semiannual billing, and this is much more pronounced in Q3 of this year as we had 2 large customers that were previously invoiced annually in Q3 2020 that are now being invoiced semiannual. So that's actually resulting in a 2-point headwind to the year-over-year growth. 
It's one of the reasons why I talked about the 4-quarter rolling number. And if you look at 4-quarter rolling for Q3 with this guide, it implies 31% year-over-year growth. So we absolutely expect a strong federal quarter. We absolutely expect continued acceleration in net new, and we are feeling really good about both the Q3 as well as the full year increase in billings guidance."

Cybersecurity is on the top of many lists and programs that we're involved in and vaccine management. Vaccine management is one of the greatest workflow challenges the government faces. And as you can tell, they'll likely need to be readministering things regularly and managing that process. We're front and center in that. 
And of course, I'm really proud actually of the way the government is looking at digital transformation. They really are looking at this as a way to help government run like business.

What we're seeing is ServiceNow has hired some of the best people in the world in Creator Workflows, in Customer Service Management, in Employee Experience. And we have built big businesses within our company in these categories. So it's not at all unusual to see a customer begin with us on the Employee Experience side. There are many customers out there today that have systems of record that, frankly, can't accommodate a one-stop shop for all the hybrid work needs of a workforce that's going to be everywhere. And we uniquely serve that need with that consumer-grade UX on the mobile. And now you see us with amazing partnerships with Microsoft and others, and I think that really is creating a lot of interest in the marketplace, and yes, new deals beginning with Employee Experience. 
The same thing on Customer Service Management. We're now in a direct-to-consumer, digital-first world. And the Now Platform is uniquely advantaged for customer service, and that is our focus. And there's many companies, especially in telecommunications and banking, not limited to that, that have come to us and started with us there. And I really want to stress this Creator Workflow situation. If you think about the 500 million apps that are going to have to be developed and the shortage of developers to do it, what you're going to see is a groundswell of new business opportunities with ServiceNow starting there because what's happening is they have to start with the low code, but they also want the resiliency and the security of tying into a unified platform like ServiceNow's. And ServiceNow is friendly to everybody in the market, and that's what customers want. They want somebody that breaks them out of the islands of automation. 
So we've seen new deals in Creator, in Customer and Employee, not just starting with IT. And yes, that is kind of a new frontier, and it's one of the reasons why we're very bullish on the company."

It actually is both, and that's the big change in the enterprise. And that's why the Now Platform is a uniquely competitive advantage for us and for our customers and our ecosystem because it actually ties the front and the back together, and that's the big aha. So many enterprise participants, and I've been in the enterprise for a while, made their success out of being good in functional domains. We shrinkwrap software and then pushing it out globally and getting standards built on it, and then ecosystems evolve on top of that. 
But what happened, especially in this hybrid work-from-anywhere world and with the digital transformation era, these are do-or-die moments now. And the executives in these companies need to have that resilient IT core that's absolutely Fort Knox in terms of its security, its resilience and its performance, and it has to serve the business. And then the business is pulling at IT to serve it. But even as the business wants to get innovative and do its own thing, in this world, the silos are an impediment to progress. 
So I think having a great front-office Employee Experience and having a great front-office Customer Service Management and a great Creator Workflow tied to that resilient core, it's really resonating so big time. And the other thing is it's really nice to speak well of all the market participants because we just want to make them all better and we want to make all the customers successful.

Look, the reality is we're the only born in the cloud software company to have eclipsed $5 billion in revenue with our large M&A. We're highly aware of that. But we're also aware that this is a very unique culture and -- our engineers is really in a league of its own, and we continue to run the playbook -- innovation. And that is what I represented and Gina represented at our Capital Markets Day when we said we'd be a $15 billion-plus revenue company. 
Having said that, RPA and some of the other items that you mentioned, you shouldn't expect us to make acquisitions in that space, but you should expect us to build our functionality and our capabilities, but also be an open and willing partner for the customers because it's really about solving their problems. And the biggest thing I hear from them is they've got lots of good point solutions all over the place. And that, in effect, is the root cause of a lot of the mess that's been created in these enterprises. And more and more, when I talk to leaders of companies, and spent quite a bit of time doing that this year, they tell me that they're looking for that control tower, that clear pane of glass that can move their workloads, enable their workflows, tighten up their systems, their siloed operations and enable their people to serve their customers. And really, that's what we're doing. 
So I'll always keep bringing it back to we can get where we said we'd go organically. We're always on our tippy toes, looking at what's best for our customers and our shareholders. And we always look at that. But right now, the plan is ever steady, and there are no plans to acquire in the spaces that you mentioned."

And one of the big changes that we've made in EMEA was obviously the proper leadership, not just at the EMEA head level, which is obviously working extremely well, I'm very proud of that, but also in significant countries within EMEA. Because as you know, every country in Europe has its own unique culture, its own unique business motions and you have to be strong with leadership in all of the geographies. And we're able to attract and retain the very best people in the enterprise software industry, and I think that's one of the root causes of our success. 
The second would be our C-level relationships. We have upped our game. And instead of dealing with only the CIO, which is an incredibly important executive to us, we have also created relationship plans across the C-suite and really enable the platform strategy for our customers, and I think that's the big evolution of ServiceNow in EMEA. We've become a platform company there as well. So it's kind of exciting when you consider how tough Europe has had it with COVID and the travel restrictions to do as well as we are. And can you imagine when things do loosen up and open up a little bit, just how big this is going to get in Europe for us? So we're very excited. The business is going great. And EMEA, just so you know, is ahead of the first half operating plan, the internal operating plan, and that's a really good sign."

And I truly believe that the new motion in the enterprise is not going to be separate endeavors of innovation. It's going to be the unification of innovation. And the big organizations are going to insist on enterprise coherence and security and business process alignment, and the CEOs are very involved in digital transformation. 
These CEOs that are out there are some of the greatest leaders I've ever seen, and they're very focused on digital first. And they're not going to let these enterprises do whatever they want to do. So the companies that have true platforms that are acknowledged in the strategy room of the Board of Directors of given companies are going to do very well now.

Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our second quarter 2021 financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the third quarter of 2021 and full year 2021. 
Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call, particularly our guidance, is based on information as of July 28, 2021, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. The guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating. 
Those assumptions are based on the facts we know today. Many of these assumptions relate to matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly, including, but not limited to, the time frames for and severity of social distancing and other mitigation requirements; the continued impact of COVID-19 on customers' purchasing decisions; and the length of our sales cycle, particularly for customers in certain industries. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and MD&A sections of our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and our 10-K filed for fiscal year 2020, for information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. 
We'd also like to point out that the company presents non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues; remaining performance obligations, or RPO; and current RPO, or CRPO. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today in our investor presentation. These and all prior press releases and investor presentations are posted at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill."

Our team delivered an outstanding quarter, significantly exceeding the high end of our guidance across all metrics. Subscription revenues were up 31%. Subscription billings were up 30%. Operating margin was 25%. And the number of deals greater than $1 million was 51, up 28% year-over-year. Free cash flow for the first half of the year was up 34% year-over-year. An incredible performance by our team, an exceptional first half and we have unstoppable momentum. And we reflected this in our strong full year guidance raise across the board. Gina will review the details with you in a few moments. 
The global economy is recovering at the fastest pace in 80 years. The enterprise digital transformation market is expected to grow nearly 3x faster than GDP in 2021. Business leaders worldwide are facing do-or-die moments. Business models have changed forever. The pandemic has accelerated the digital imperative. We are in a leading position to capitalize on this unprecedented tailwind. We are giving customers the innovative solutions they need to solve the greatest challenges of our time. The world's biggest challenges are ServiceNow's biggest opportunities: from vaccine management, to ESG, to the new world of hybrid work. 
Whatever the challenge, work flows with ServiceNow. We've created a new market, one that respects the billions and billions of dollars of investment that customers have put into their systems of record. We make those investments work for today's digital business demands. The Now Platform, the platform of platforms, delivers workflow automation with a consumer-grade user experience that inspires our customers, enabling siloed systems across an enterprise to work together, creating more efficient, more productive ways to get work done. ServiceNow is the control tower for digital transformation for every business, in every industry, serving every persona. The power of the Now Platform makes this possible with one data model, one architecture and one platform to workflow a better world. 
For example, a premium German auto manufacturer faces huge logistical challenges in maintaining on-target production. Every 30 million parts are processed daily and are dispatched to more than 4,000 supplier locations to production centers in Europe and Mexico. To manage the complexity, ServiceNow provides a single connected supply chain technology platform. ServiceNow analyzes 300,000 data points per month, optimizing the performance of each aspect of the value chain. This is just one example of the power of the Now Platform. 
I'd like to share an overview of our success across ServiceNow's portfolio. Let's begin with our IT workflows. We are the standard for optimizing all IT services and operations. Our core IT workflows remained very strong. ITSM was in 16 of our top 20 deals, with 14 deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 15 of our top 20 deals, with 6 deals over $1 million. 
Our AI-powered Service Operations is resonating big time with customers. We saw great wins with leading companies, including Travelers and Walgreens Boots Alliance and more. They're working with ServiceNow to support their digital transformation of their enterprises. And we're honored that Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is working with ServiceNow to accelerate its digital transformation efforts as it looks to make Singapore a leading global port and international maritime center. MPA will leverage the Now Platform to drive automation and to improve productivity and employee experience. 
With Employee Workflows, we make work better by driving outstanding employee experiences that enhance productivity for employees anytime, anywhere while also developing company loyalty, which is particularly important in this environment. The Now Platform provides employees the system of action for key events, including onboarding, parental leave, moving and many more moments that matter for people. Employee Workflows were in 13 of our top 20 deals, with 6 deals over $1 million. Asahi, for example, is focused on expanding growth while reinforcing ESG initiatives that support sustainable value creation. They chose the Now Platform to improve the employee experience by providing a single point of contact for employees to improve productivity. They wanted service catalogs so they could standardize HR processes, and they wanted integrations to connect all their siloed workflows. 
With Customer Workflows, we're creating a new service paradigm by delivering connected experiences that redefine customer operations for greater speed, agility, transparency and convenience, all while working with existing systems. Customer Workflows were in 10 of our top 20 deals, with 4 deals over $1 million. We now have over 2,000 customers running customer service management. Deutsche Telekom is leveraging ServiceNow's telecommunication solution to streamline order management to become the leading B2B telco provider. The Now Platform will be at the heart of the order management process, enabling a 360-degree view of orders, inventory and infrastructure, creating a seamless, connected experience for DT's employees and customers. 
With Creator Workflows, we're accelerating software development across the entire enterprise by giving everyone the low-code tools to quickly create applications and beautiful experiences. IDC predicts that more than 500 million apps will be developed by 2023. This is equivalent to the total number of apps that were developed in the past 40 years. For example, Airbus built an innovative tracking application in less than 3 months using ServiceNow's low-code app engine. Now Airbus employees can scan barcodes of any piece of factory equipment to see the relevant information they need in real time. Manufacturing transportation incidents have dropped 20%. In Q2, Creator Workflows were in 18 of our top 20 deals. Nokia picked ServiceNow's Creator Workflows to develop custom apps in significantly less time at a fraction of the cost of alternative platforms. 
These examples show how the combined capabilities of the workflows on the Now Platform are better together. They deliver even more value than the sum of their parts. Our introduction of the Now Buying Program has helped customers realize those synergies more quickly by simplifying the buying process, providing greater usage flexibility, all while improving business impact. Continuing to build a strong client and alliance ecosystem, we established an enterprise agreement through the Now Buying Program with Deloitte who will take advantage of our full product suite to facilitate great experiences for their employees and clients while enhancing efficiencies and compliance management for the business. 
Also in our partner ecosystem, we recently announced our integration with Microsoft Windows 365. This will enable users to easily access cloud PCs directly through Microsoft Teams regardless of the employees' location in the hybrid work environment. 
In closing, I am incredibly proud of our team's passion for solving the world's greatest challenges. Our engineering team is second to none. Our go-to-market organization is the best in the business, and our purpose to make work better for people is resonating. It's been an honor to help turn vaccines into vaccinations for millions and millions of people. It's a privilege to help the world reopen and safely return to the workplace. We are engaging leaders on how we can solve society's biggest problems, improve the lives of people and help deliver better services to citizens everywhere. 
We are better than we were yesterday, not as good as we'll be tomorrow. This is a special company with unbridled energy and unprecedented opportunity. We are well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. And I look forward to taking your questions. 
But first, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gina. Gina, over to you."

Q2 was a tremendous quarter with strong beats across our top line and profitability guidance metrics.

Q2 was a tremendous quarter with strong beats across our top line and profitability guidance metrics. The team demonstrated exceptional execution, and we saw strong demand across all regions and workflows. 
Q2 subscription revenues were $1.33 billion, $35 million above the high end of our guidance range and growing 31% year-over-year, inclusive of a 450 basis point tailwind from FX. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $9.5 billion, representing 35% year-over-year growth. Current RPO was approximately $4.7 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth and a 4-point beat versus our guidance. Currency was a 300 basis point tailwind year-over-year. Q2 subscription billings were $1.328 billion, representing 30% year-over-year growth and a $73 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. FX and duration were a 500 basis points tailwind year-over-year. 
We saw growth across all our industry categories. Financial services and manufacturing were particularly strong across the globe driven by investments in business continuity. Industries impacted by COVID, including retail and hospitality, also showed signs of recovery with strong net new ACV growth in the quarter. 
The Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations, reflected by our strong 97% renewal rate. The stickiness of our customer base has served as a solid foundation for us to build upon with our land-and-expand growth strategy. This is evident with the continued growth in our average customer spend this quarter. As of the end of Q2, we had 1,201 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 25% year-over-year. This included 62 customers paying us over $10 million in ACV. Overall, we closed 51 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV in the quarter. We're also seeing robust net new ACV growth from new customers, with the average deal size growing over 50% year-over-year. Going to market with a solution sales approach to deliver the full capabilities of the portfolio instead of selling point products continues to drive more multiproduct deals. In Q2, 18 of our top 20 deals included 3 or more products. 
Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 25%, 3 points above our guidance, driven by the strong revenue beat, T&E cost savings and some marketing spend that was pushed into the second half of the year. Our free cash flow margin was 19%. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. 
To navigate the post-COVID economy and the new era of work, businesses are investing in digital transformation to unlock new levels of innovation, agility and productivity. As you heard from Bill, the macro trends driving digital transformation are a significant opportunity for ServiceNow. Our Knowledge 2021 event in May included 2 amazing weeks of keynotes, panels and discussions that brought together experts and thought leaders of every industry across 141 countries to focus on these topics. This year, we released new solutions, including our manufacturing and health care industry products, and showcased the power and endless possibilities achievable through ServiceNow workflows. The response from customers has been fantastic. The pipeline generated per attending account was up 45% year-over-year. Together, the macro tailwinds and interest generated from Knowledge has accelerated pipeline growth for the second half of 2021. 
Furthermore, our coverage ratio today continues to remain ahead of a year ago. As a result, we are raising guidance for the full year. We are raising our subscription revenue outlook by $73 million at the midpoint to a range of $5.53 billion to $5.54 billion, representing 29% year-over-year growth, including 250 basis points of FX tailwind. We are raising our subscription billings outlook by $123 million at the midpoint to a range of $6.315 billion to $6.325 billion, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook for the year would be 31% at the midpoint. Growth includes the net tailwinds in FX and duration of 200 basis points. 
We continue to expect 2021 subscription gross margin at 85%, and we are raising our full year 2021 operating margin from 23.5% to 24.5%. This reflects the increase in our top line growth, more efficient marketing spend and savings from some continued lower T&E expenses related to COVID. We are raising our full year 2021 free cash flow margin by 1 point from 30% to 31%. I'd note that from a seasonality perspective, we're expecting 40% of our total free cash flow in Q4. And lastly, we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 202 million. 
For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $1.4 billion and $1.405 billion, representing 28% to 29% year-over-year growth, including the 150 basis point FX tailwind. We expect CRPO growth of 30% year-over-year, including 150 basis point FX tailwind. We expect subscription billings between $1.32 billion and $1.325 billion, representing 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Growth includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 50 basis points. As a reminder, looking at billings from a 4-quarter rolling basis will help normalize the quarterly seasonality and changes in customer invoicing terms. On that basis, our Q3 subscription billings guidance would represent 31% year-over-year growth. We expect an operating margin of 23%. There's 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. 
In conclusion, digital transformation is accelerating across the globe, and ServiceNow is at the epicenter of that opportunity. ServiceNow is the digital fabric that stitches together existing systems of record, collapsing silos to connect fragmented processes. We are the platform company for digital business, and we are well on our way to becoming a $15 billion revenue company. I'm extremely proud of our team's performance this quarter, and Bill and I can't thank our employees enough for their hard work and incredible dedication.

First, I'd like to recognize our outstanding IT leadership as well as our incredible focus on analytics in the company because we really run the company on the ServiceNow platform. And whatever other systems even exist in the company, I couldn't pick them out of a lineup because the only thing we look at is Now, ServiceNow. And I have real-time data on every single account and every single deal that's moving in the global economy. And I can tell you that the pipeline is incredibly robust, and it has substantially grown and the lights are all green. 
Our sales leader is extremely positive on the second half of the year, as is our engineering leader, and the unity in the company around performing right now is really strong. So you can take Gina's guide and the raise that she just put in front of the capital markets to heart because we looked at every detail and everywhere we could with our own information, and it's very, very strong. 
In terms of the sales cycles, I think the sales cycles are moving quicker. The notoriety of the brand is resonating as the digital transformation control tower, as I said. IT has a stronghold on so many things now because if you want to give the employees a great experience, you want to provide the customers an unmatched service or you want to unify IT and business around creating these new workflows, which are necessary because there's not enough developers to develop all the applications that are required, everybody can agree on the Now Platform, and that seems to be unifying organizations between IT and business and accelerating our sales cycles and enlarging our deal sizes."

And I think what differentiates us uniquely is this is one pane of glass, it's one user experience and it is not just the developer operations, you'll also see business executives align on this as well. And to us, that's going to really help organizations seamlessly connect their digital experiences across the enterprise. Again, the platform, I can't stress this enough, the digital platform, the Now Platform, is the glue that's tying it all together."

We're in a market that is very robust, digital transformation is really hot, and we are that signature brand. So the more quickly we can evolve the upgrade process and the net new deals to get customers live, that's really what it's all about. And I want you to rest assured that from finance to legal, to the way we execute the sales motions in the field and also enable our ecosystem, that whole value chain is right now pedal to the metal. 
So when you think about the Now Buying Program, we're looking at larger, rapidly expanding customers and making it easier for them to grow with us. So that includes simplifying the buying process, as you rightfully point out, using flexibility so they can easily upgrade to higher tiers of product innovation. Our innovators are just so amazing here. Every time you turn around, in the next release there's a new breakthrough. I just can't thank them enough. ITSM Pro and Enterprise are doing terrific. And this is enabling customers to try things as well and exchange or adopt products at their will, and it's giving them a forward look at where we're going with our road maps. And when they see the innovation power of ServiceNow, that actually buys them in very quickly. 
And finally, I would just like to say we've done a really good job on the industry domain expertise in the company but also on aligning all the value that we have to the platform and making sure the customer understands the value they realize. So as they step into bigger relationships with us, we can predict those expansions and those pricing tiers and the integrated customer success, support and value and maybe carry that into the boardroom with great confidence and say this is what ServiceNow is doing to deliver for you. I was really excited when I saw the Telia article that went out today where they were talking about retiring 75 legacy systems as they standardize on the Now Platform. So it's just really good for the customer, and it's good for our folks, too, to get the customer value fast."

I really appreciate it. In terms of the core business, the core is becoming more and more relevant as these enterprises try to separate away from the old world of islands of automation and point solution buying and dealing with fragmented systems, processes and silos. So the core of the core, of course, is our ITX portfolio, and that is really resonating with our customers because they can do all the things they want to do on one platform. And to the extent they want to leverage other technologies that they've already invested in, of course, we're so accommodating to that because our great engineers have built all out-of-the-box integrations to the biggest systems in the world. So it's kind of started with the core, and now it's moving across the enterprise with great speed. 
And all the businesses have done great. And in fact, all the geos are ahead of their operating plans. And they're all doing really, really well in every geography and every industry. It's amazing. So I would just like to give you a feel for this, Kash, by just saying like we have seen the immediate impact of our innovation in the core as we expand the perimeter to Employee and Customer Service Management and now Creator. Our great sales leadership sees the opportunity. And they see the hockey stick building in the pipeline, and we're trying to get out in front of that with the coverage model. 
And what I think you made a great sage comment on is that's a high-class situation because most companies are complaining about the war on talent, and they're actually suffering because they don't have enough talented people to do the job. We're only hiring 1% of the applicants that are highly qualified to come into ServiceNow, and the hardest part our recruiting team is doing right now is just keeping up with the inflow of all the resumes. So I think it's great that we're actually hiring ahead. We see a great hockey stick in the pipeline, and I have tremendous confidence in our sales leadership all over the world."

But if you remember, on a quarterly basis, there's a lot of seasonality built into billings. And so as we shared in the past, there's a couple of drivers impacting the growth rate, which is really a function of renewal and invoice timing and not a function of business performance. So one particular item this quarter for Q3 is, as some of our customers are becoming larger, they've requested a change in annual to semiannual billing, and this is much more pronounced in Q3 of this year as we had 2 large customers that were previously invoiced annually in Q3 2020 that are now being invoiced semiannual. So that's actually resulting in a 2-point headwind to the year-over-year growth. 
It's one of the reasons why I talked about the 4-quarter rolling number. And if you look at 4-quarter rolling for Q3 with this guide, it implies 31% year-over-year growth. So we absolutely expect a strong federal quarter. We absolutely expect continued acceleration in net new, and we are feeling really good about both the Q3 as well as the full year increase in billings guidance."

Cybersecurity is on the top of many lists and programs that we're involved in and vaccine management. Vaccine management is one of the greatest workflow challenges the government faces. And as you can tell, they'll likely need to be readministering things regularly and managing that process. We're front and center in that. 
And of course, I'm really proud actually of the way the government is looking at digital transformation. They really are looking at this as a way to help government run like business.

What we're seeing is ServiceNow has hired some of the best people in the world in Creator Workflows, in Customer Service Management, in Employee Experience. And we have built big businesses within our company in these categories. So it's not at all unusual to see a customer begin with us on the Employee Experience side. There are many customers out there today that have systems of record that, frankly, can't accommodate a one-stop shop for all the hybrid work needs of a workforce that's going to be everywhere. And we uniquely serve that need with that consumer-grade UX on the mobile. And now you see us with amazing partnerships with Microsoft and others, and I think that really is creating a lot of interest in the marketplace, and yes, new deals beginning with Employee Experience. 
The same thing on Customer Service Management. We're now in a direct-to-consumer, digital-first world. And the Now Platform is uniquely advantaged for customer service, and that is our focus. And there's many companies, especially in telecommunications and banking, not limited to that, that have come to us and started with us there. And I really want to stress this Creator Workflow situation. If you think about the 500 million apps that are going to have to be developed and the shortage of developers to do it, what you're going to see is a groundswell of new business opportunities with ServiceNow starting there because what's happening is they have to start with the low code, but they also want the resiliency and the security of tying into a unified platform like ServiceNow's. And ServiceNow is friendly to everybody in the market, and that's what customers want. They want somebody that breaks them out of the islands of automation. 
So we've seen new deals in Creator, in Customer and Employee, not just starting with IT. And yes, that is kind of a new frontier, and it's one of the reasons why we're very bullish on the company."

It actually is both, and that's the big change in the enterprise. And that's why the Now Platform is a uniquely competitive advantage for us and for our customers and our ecosystem because it actually ties the front and the back together, and that's the big aha. So many enterprise participants, and I've been in the enterprise for a while, made their success out of being good in functional domains. We shrinkwrap software and then pushing it out globally and getting standards built on it, and then ecosystems evolve on top of that. 
But what happened, especially in this hybrid work-from-anywhere world and with the digital transformation era, these are do-or-die moments now. And the executives in these companies need to have that resilient IT core that's absolutely Fort Knox in terms of its security, its resilience and its performance, and it has to serve the business. And then the business is pulling at IT to serve it. But even as the business wants to get innovative and do its own thing, in this world, the silos are an impediment to progress. 
So I think having a great front-office Employee Experience and having a great front-office Customer Service Management and a great Creator Workflow tied to that resilient core, it's really resonating so big time. And the other thing is it's really nice to speak well of all the market participants because we just want to make them all better and we want to make all the customers successful. So that Now Platform is really sinking in as the platform for digital business, and that's really what we dreamed of, and it's happening."

I will tell you that there are many customers that absolutely tell us that we want ServiceNow to be that digital transformation platform, that backbone for all of our functions.

But at the same time, if there's others in their installed base that they want to amplify, we're happy to do that.

And that is what I represented and Gina represented at our Capital Markets Day when we said we'd be a $15 billion-plus revenue company. 
Having said that, RPA and some of the other items that you mentioned, you shouldn't expect us to make acquisitions in that space, but you should expect us to build our functionality and our capabilities, but also be an open and willing partner for the customers because it's really about solving their problems. And the biggest thing I hear from them is they've got lots of good point solutions all over the place. And that, in effect, is the root cause of a lot of the mess that's been created in these enterprises. And more and more, when I talk to leaders of companies, and spent quite a bit of time doing that this year, they tell me that they're looking for that control tower, that clear pane of glass that can move their workloads, enable their workflows, tighten up their systems, their siloed operations and enable their people to serve their customers. And really, that's what we're doing. 
So I'll always keep bringing it back to we can get where we said we'd go organically. We're always on our tippy toes, looking at what's best for our customers and our shareholders.

While a beat-and-raise headline from ServiceNow is familiar, it is no less extraordinary. Our team delivered another outstanding quarter, yet again significantly exceeding the high end of our guidance across all metrics. Subscription revenues were up 31% organically. This is unprecedented in our industry. CRPO was up 32%, subscription billings were up 28%, operating margin was 26%. We again have raised our guidance for the full year, strengthening our clear path to $15 billion-plus in revenue by 2026. 
I was introduced as ServiceNow's CEO more than 2 years ago. We've all seen a lot since then. What we've never seen is such consistent innovation and execution at global scale. Thanks to our customers, employees and partners, we're well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. And we're only getting started. 
Before Gina gives you a complete report, let's talk about this dramatic structural incline at ServiceNow. The pace of digital investment is accelerating. IDC has consistently sized this opportunity at $7.8 trillion over a 4-year period. With this massive addressable market, ServiceNow is at the intersection of 2 generational opportunities: first, the need for a new technology foundation is supercharging our close partnership with CIOs. A recent Wall Street Journal report highlighted the role of CIOs as the architects of digital business. 
Ongoing advances in public cloud and machine learning are forging a new era of software innovation. Technology teams want a fully integrated software cycle: planning, development, deployment, operations and service. ServiceNow is leading this 20th to 21st century migration for our customers. The Now Platform, with its immense versatility and scalability, has become the control tower for digital transformation. 
The second dimension fueling ServiceNow is the reordering of the enterprise application platforms for hyperautomation. Leaders today recognize their technology architecture is their business architecture. Over several decades, enterprise has invested trillions into on-premise and first-generation SaaS applications. These applications satisfy the business process needs of the 20th century. Today, new business models require a fully connected value chain. Legacy environments are not adaptive enough to enable this change. 
As the pioneer of modern digital workflows, ServiceNow is leading the renaissance. The Now Platform connects different applications and data sources to create intuitive mobile experiences, all at a consumer grade. We don't ask businesses to bet everything on a single system or collaboration tool. We give choice, which not only unlocks value from our platform but from other platform investments as well. 
ServiceNow also empowers anyone to build applications on our platform. In its Low-code Development Technologies Report, Gartner estimates that 70% of new applications developed by 2025 will use low-code or no-code technologies. Gartner also named ServiceNow as a leader in its Magic Quadrant. These tailwinds are driving fast organic growth across our entire solutions portfolio. The number of deals greater than $1 million was 63, up 50% year-over-year, signaling substantial adoption of our platform strategy. 
In Q3, IT workflows remained very strong. ITSM was in 18 of our top 20 deals while IT Operations Management had 10 deals over $1 million. For example, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service is in a multiyear digital transformation effort and Q3 [indiscernible] shows ServiceNow to consolidate 12 complex systems into a single platform to support the agency's mission-critical operations. Demand for our entire IT portfolio is strong. And with the launch of Lightstep Incident Response in Q3, we are unlocking a new wave of product-led growth in application monitoring and observability. 
Employee Workflows also had a fantastic quarter with HR in 13 of our top 20 deals. In Q3, NTT Data will leverage the Now Platform to create an employee experience portal, enhancing productivity for hybrid work and managing vaccine administration for its entire workforce. Momentum continues for Customer Workflows with CSM in 12 of our top 20 deals and 8 deals over $1 million. Industry vertical solutions are leading the way with major brands. Verizon is adopting our telco solution, American Century, our financial services solution, and Sunbelt Health, our health care solution. 
Creator Workflows, which helps businesses build their own applications, was exceptional in Q3 in 18 of our top 20 deals. We're partnering with Stanley Black & Decker to bring ServiceNow's new manufacturing vertical solution with App Engine to change how they serve their customers. Together, we're maximizing facility uptime and delivering great experiences for distributors, dealers and end consumers. 
Fujitsu will also expand its use of the Now Platform to drive its own digital transformation. We couldn't be prouder that Uber, Honeywell, Telia and many others all chose ServiceNow in Q3. This is a complete performance for the company, strong growth across the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific/Japan. 
As we look to a strong finish in 2021 and beyond, here are a few of the many factors giving us great confidence in this business. First, while the of talent is raging out there, we're highly encouraged by the colleagues choosing ServiceNow in record numbers. Our new joiners, together with our amazing global workforce, are building a uniquely inclusive, driven and happy culture. 
We're also seeing major developments in our partner ecosystem. Just 3 weeks ago, we announced a new partnership with Celonis. Celonis will deliver process mining insights, ServiceNow will build better workflows, our customers will gain from the integrated approach. We also deepened our long-standing partnership with Microsoft. ServiceNow's Employee Center can now be directly embedded in Microsoft Teams, reaching 250 million monthly users. Together with our expanding partner community, we will reduce complexity to make work better for people. 
Finally, innovation without disruption is a hallmark of our best-in-class engineering tradition. When we say without disruption, we mean invisible, a seamless upgrade experience for our customers. In our Now Platform Rome Release, we delivered countless new features to customers, including Mobile App Builder, an Automation Discovery Tool, Employee Journey Management and new customer service playbooks. Every business leader in the world is looking at the future of work. These new features give the Now Platform even more capability to build that hybrid future. 
I'll defer to a comment made by industry analyst Josh Bersin, who said our Rome Platform Release. ""This company seems to be able to build and deploy enterprise software faster than almost any I've ever seen, and that's why they're a juggernaut."" Josh, naturally, I agree. In closing, the company is firing on all cylinders. The quarter speaks for itself. We beat again, we raised again. The secular tailwinds are at our back. Our customer base is expanding just as our customer NPS is increasing. 
Our partner ecosystem is fired up. We accelerated our time line to be net zero. We help businesses drive their own ESG initiatives on our platform with a major release. The list goes on and on. Overall, our message to the market couldn't be any clearer. Whatever systems, challenges or opportunities you have, however fast you need to move, you have a trusted innovator in ServiceNow. We want to make the world work better for everyone, and we'll never lose our focus on the privilege that comes with saying, the world works with ServiceNow. I look forward to your questions. Gina, over to you."
22967487,1684496113,2414694,"ServiceNow, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","ServiceNow, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill.

Q3 was another fantastic quarter with continued outperformance across all of our growth and profitability guidance metrics. Demand was strong globally across all 3 of our geos. The consistency of our results quarter after quarter exemplifies the strength of our product portfolio and the team's focus on building deep customer relationships. 
Q3 subscription revenues were $1.43 billion, $22 million above the high end of our guidance range and growing 31% year-over-year, inclusive of 100 basis points tailwind from FX. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $9.7 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth. Current RPO was approximately $5 billion, representing 32% year-over-year growth and a 2-point beat versus our guidance. Currency did not have an impact on year-over-year growth. 
Q3 subscription billings were $1.38 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth and a $55 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. FX and duration were 150 basis points tailwind year-over-year. We saw broad-based strength across the industries we serve, with transportation and logistics and business services seeing particularly robust net new ACV growth. Our renewal rate was a healthy 98% in Q3, a testament to the value ServiceNow delivers to our customers. 
We view our relationships with customers as long-term partnerships, and we continually innovate to provide new solutions to address their evolving business needs. That land-and-expand motion has manifested into a base of 1,266 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 25% year-over-year. As the breadth of our portfolio and the addressable opportunities have expanded, so too have our deal sizes. We closed 63 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV in the quarter, up over 50% year-over-year. And in Q3, all of our top 20 deals included 4 or more products. 
Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 26%, 3 points above our guidance, primarily driven by the strong revenue beat. We also saw savings from the delay in return to work and lower travel. Our free cash flow margin was 15%. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. 
We're delivering great experiences that drive powerful employee engagement, fierce customer loyalty and significant productivity gains. By delivering more intelligent automation that provides even better experiences, we are well positioned as the workflow standard on our journey to becoming a $15 billion-plus revenue company. 
Turning to guidance. We're raising our guidance for the full year. We're raising our subscription revenue outlook by $32 million at the midpoint to a range of $5.565 billion to $5.57 billion, representing 30% year-over-year growth, including 200 basis points of FX tailwinds. We are raising our subscription billings outlook by $61 million at the midpoint to a range of $6.379 billion to $6.384 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth. 
Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 32% year-over-year at the midpoint. Growth includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 200 basis points. We continue to expect 2021 subscription gross margin of 85%, and we're raising our full year 2021 operating margin from 24.5% to 25%. This reflects the increase in our top line growth and savings from the delay in return to work and lower travel. 
We're also raising our full year 2021 free cash flow margin by 50 basis points from 31% to 31.5%. And we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 202 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $1.515 billion and $1.52 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth, including a negligible impact from FX. We expect CRPO growth of 27% year-over-year. This includes a 150 basis point FX headwind due to sharp movements recently in the euro and pound. On a constant currency basis, we expect CRPO growth to be 28.5%. 
We expect subscription billings between $2.305 billion and $2.31 billion, representing 26% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in Q4 of 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 32% year-over-year at the midpoint. Growth includes a net headwind from FX and duration of 50 basis points. We expect an operating margin of 22%, which includes accelerated demand generation spend in the quarter to set us up for a strong start in 2022, and we expect 203 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. 
In summary, the pace of digital investment is accelerating, and ServiceNow is rising up to seize the opportunities before us. The team has never been more engaged and focused on serving the enormous needs of our customers. And as ServiceNow becomes the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century, we are also remaining steadfast in our goal to create positive impact in the world. I'm happy to announce that in September, we committed to reaching our net zero emissions goal by 2030, 2 decades earlier than our previous goal. 
We've never been prouder of our employees and their continued focus on serving our customers, partners and communities as we make not only work, work better but the world work better, too. Our hungry and humble culture is stronger than ever. We can't thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication. And with that, I'll open it up for Q&A."

Bill, I wanted to just get your high-level thoughts, coming as we did after a spectacular quarter and listening to your compadre, Satya Nadella, on his call yesterday, talked about tech as a percentage of global GDP going from [ 5% to 10% ]. I think he said that before, which leaves us with the inescapable conclusion that tech density, enterprise tech density is just going higher. It's not the world from 10 years back where a couple of ERP systems and that's it. Now it's thousands and thousands of SaaS applications and the whatnot. So where does that leave ServiceNow in terms of business prospects for spreading horizontally, vertically with your ITOM, IPS and the Workflow Engine, obviously, given that enterprise tech density is just set to go from higher or even higher levels. 
And 1 for you, Gina. When you look at this year, this year has been fascinating. Net new business has been accelerating for a few quarters. I know that you've not given us thoughts on '22 yet, but how do you feel qualitatively stepping into 2022 with a renewal base that looks very solid? Your net new business trends are getting better. Curious to get your thoughts."

Congratulations to you. You had it nailed. A couple of things, Kash. If you look at the geographies around the world, every single geography not only beat expectations but they actually beat their internal plan handily. So every geography is expanding with ServiceNow at a record clip. 
If you look at our expansion in industry, we saw a growth across all of our industry categories this quarter. It's amazing. Industries that were COVID-impacted like transportation, logistics, business services, telecom, media, technology, financial services, government, education, every single 1 of them was an unbelievable success story this quarter. And we have expanded dramatically in manufacturing, health care, life sciences, telecommunications and banking, just to name a few. So think geo, think industry. 
Also think persona. This Employee Workflow business of ours is unstoppable because the employee experience is unstoppable, especially in a labor market that requires talent. And as you pointed out, Satya's remarks are absolutely right. The GDP growth in tech is inescapable because it's the only way out in a hybrid world to manage a competitive company, especially when you're competing for talent and you have to give them a great experience, example, onboarding experience connecting all of their training tools, really making them a part of the culture when they might not even be in your buildings. 
Customer Workflows. We announced a partnership with Twilio, dealing with WhatsApp and various messaging techniques because all the old school waves are going away quickly. So with our CSM, our Employee Workflows, the experiences we're giving to people is just unreal. And don't forget the Creator Workflows. 500 million net new applications will be developed in the next 2-plus years and that will be developed for companies by companies in their own technology departments, and there's not enough engineers to do that in the world, so the Now Platform is a growth sensation. 
All of these forces are coming together at once. And that is why I could not be more confident in the bullish stance on ServiceNow not just in the short term. We run our business with clear messaging, clear facts. We could see the pipeline way into 2022 and, in some cases, beyond. It is a fantastic situation right now, Kash."

When you look at our Q4 results and our Q4 guide, you have to remember last year Q4. We had that $80 million of early payments that were brought forward that really drove a higher growth number in Q4. And if you normalize that, it's why I called out pretty transparently in the script. If you normalize for that, we're seeing 32% growth in Q4 billings.

We had a very, very strong federal quarter. 15 deals over $1 million. 14 federal agencies are now paying us more than $10 million. Key strategic wins included the IRS, which I talked about already but it's certainly not limited to that. It's pretty amazing how the government is rethinking strategies in terms of communication and providing services digitally to the citizens, which is incredible because as you know, that's all about the user experience and it's a workflow challenge. 
For example, look at how difficult it was for the government to get money out to small businesses during COVID. There are also some big opportunities with new initiatives in the administration, including resiliency, business continuity, outages, terrorism, COVID, cybersecurity on top of many lists. The White House actually put out an executive order on improving the nation's cybersecurity after recent ransom attacks. So that's all workflow related, leveraging existing systems that don't talk to each other very well. You're certainly not going to rip and replace them, right? So that's where the Now Platform comes in. 
And then just think about vaccine management. It remains one of the greatest workflow challenges the government faces. And boosters now will likely need to be re-administered on a regular basis. This, again, is a workflow challenge to distribute, administer and monitor vaccines. So we're in the mix on all of that. And what we're seeing is the connection of federal state and cities that are all implementing the Now Platform to engage with citizens. So they're using products like Customer Service Management to help digitize these workflows that can no longer be processed in person because the offices are still closed due to the pandemic. 
So overall, take this as a strong, aggressive, bullish, confident reply that the public sector is embracing the Now Platform as its transformational opportunity at federal, state, local, university and all public entities that are quickly embracing us because our Net Promoter Score is so high and at word of mouth, they're saying this is the way to go, go now."

So what's happening here is ServiceNow and Celonis will help customer map those elements in real-time and then build digital workflows to more efficiently automate work. So we're going to create a seamless product experience for customers that's going to make it easy and simple for them to get insight into their processes across multiple enterprise systems. You'll be able to use Celonis' EMS platform and convert that insight, the X-ray, into action, automation and remediation on the ServiceNow workflow platform. 
So think about bringing together process mining, automation, machine learning, RPA and low-code app development into a seamless combined product experience that customers will be enabled to quickly and continuously improve the flow of work. So shorter answer is the Creative Workflow platform, but what's happening is Celonis gets the X-ray, especially in the non-ServiceNow environments. And then we use all the power of the Now Platform, including process mining in the ServiceNow environments, to give them a fast automation platform to make that business process home and really drive business outcomes. So I think this 1 is going to be really exciting. And I think my good partners, Alex and Bastion and Martin, I know our engineers are very committed to each other and we're going to nail it."

We literally had a review of this business just yesterday and our outstanding leader just took us through it. And what we're basically saying is the Now Platform is integrated with all systems of record, right? So customers can build applications fast. And we really are the platform of all the other platforms. I've been saying platform of platforms for a long time. 
And I want to make it clear, like we respect all those other platforms, all those other excellent brands. Our job is to make all of them even better by moving into the action layer or the hyperautomation layer on the Now Platform. And the trend we're seeing is the younger generation of workers, they're not going to submit tickets. They want action. So enterprises are creating these centers of excellence, and they're letting citizen developers build a solution to solve for the business challenges. 
So I believe that hyperautomation is a key differentiator. And because we have this 1 platform that does it all, RPA, low-code, process mining all on a single platform and now with Celonis, we get process mining in the non-ServiceNow environments, we bring everything together so customers can completely rethink their business model. 
Example I gave in the script is Stanley Blacker -- they're based -- Stanley Black & Decker. They're combining their new manufacturing vertical solution with the App Engine to build over 70 custom applications. This is all being done on the Now low-code Application platform. And Fujitsu also is an example where they're using App Engine to drive digital transformation and sustainability across the company, moving the green line, not just the top and bottom line."

And that's really a sustaining part of our success. I'll give you an example. You take somebody like Erica Volini, who joined from Deloitte. She had a fantastic career at Deloitte, and she wanted to come in and help us transform the service experience for our customers. 
We're collapsing the pre- and post-sale conversation. Everything here is about business impact and we're rethinking the whole services model. That's why our customer satisfaction and our Net Promoter Score is soaring. Not just our retention, we're focused on the in-process measures. That's why Jon Sigler came to us after a great career at Apple, Microsoft and Salesforce and said he believed that the Now Platform was the future of business. 
And what we have been able to do is hire thousands of people even in a pandemic because the Now Platform enables us to create these seamless hiring, onboarding, immediately skilling people up to our culture and their training needs and then managing them in a hybrid world in a way that gives them the experience of our culture. And the word gets out there quickly. We are literally harder to get into than Stanford statistically, even as you see thousands joining. 
So we are not opportunity constrained. And that's what I've been saying the whole time, why are we organically growing? Why are we committed to our engineering? Why are we fiercely committed to our market leadership? Because we can be. This is the platform of this generation, and we're investing primarily in great engineers and great go-to-market, especially quota-bearing, where we can deliver for our shareholders, our customers and our partners. 
The other thing I want to underscore is we have really expanded the ecosystem. So as you even see us hiring thousands, just think, the ecosystem is hiring even more thousands and thousands to get around this Now Platform and get their piece of the action in geos, in industries and personas. This is a growth story."

So this is starting to flow out of Q4 of this year, right, which because it won't include the future renewals until they renew within 2022. And so that deceleration is really what's driving that -- it's the seasonality of the cohort that's driving that deceleration.

But I don't think that, that increase is going to be linear, right?

I'm not actually in a position at this point to guide to 2022, but we are 100% committed to, over that 3-year period, getting to 26.5% because we absolutely believe that we'll have savings that we'll be able to take from these learnings and efficiencies from the pandemic and redeploy them on growth opportunities that we see absolutely in front of us today."

And this is all going to create the extended supply chain opportunity for the Now Platform. 
You might have noticed, for example, we acquired Gekkobrain, which is a small company in Denmark because we are in so many different ERP-related conversations where we're helping our great ERP friends. Instead of doing mass customization through consultants that would take years and years, with the Now Platform, you can do it in days.

So let me start with Lightstep, first of all, because I want to give a big shout-out to Ben and his great team. We love Ben, we love this team and they're just going to be a sensation here. We are continually impressed by the depth of engineering talent at Lightstep and the observability solution. We're still in the early innings of integrating the business, as you know, but we've had strong upsells from existing customers, and we're seeing that as a testament to how they value Lightstep's product, and it's already delivering to organizations. 
It's currently being sold on a stand-alone basis, but we expect that to be going to market solidly with ServiceNow at an enterprise level in 2022. We're also doing some product direct sales with the Lightstep product in the Internet channel, and I think that is also a potential elixir that markets may not be expecting from ServiceNow. It's kind of a new play in the playbook and we're pretty excited about it. 
On CSM, I'm really excited about our leadership in CSM. We have a fantastic leader in CSM with industry-renowned experience. And we're winning in verticals everywhere. Whether it's financial services, telecom, health care and life sciences, it's pretty incredible. What you're seeing here, and I actually went through this business review yesterday as well, you're seeing CSM completely rethink direct-to-consumer, you're rethinking customer service management and you're thinking about messaging, you're thinking about WhatsApp differently, you're thinking about Twilio and ServiceNow embedding these really swift solutions to the customer experience. 
Think about field service management, think about the connected experience for the ultimate consumer. Yes, other CRM companies have done a very good job on the engagement layer. Unfortunately, the customer experience doesn't end with the engagement layer. It begins with the engagement layer. So the operations layer of the company and the back office IT capability of the company has to be tethered to that engagement layer, which is giving us net new opportunities, including IoT opportunities with field service and fleets of products, fleets of trucks, fleets of cars, EV marketplaces that we've never seen the likes of. 
And then you combine that with the Creator Workflow where it's kind of like, ""Hey, I can have it my way? You mean, I could customize that?"" Yes. And guess what, when you do the upgrade with ServiceNow, you don't have to get the consulting team in to rethink the whole implementation with us, it's invisible. It's like driving a Tesla. You press a button, the next day, you have a new Tesla. That's what ServiceNow is doing, incredible innovation."

We moved the X-ray into the action layer and together, we offer the customers something they never got before, a great X-ray and an unbelievable immediate value to action process on the Now Platform. 
And I really think this is a perfect example of trust being the ultimate human currency. I would have never done the partnership with Alex and Bastion and Martin and their terrific team. I might add [indiscernible] one of my great friends and the world knows how much I love Germany as a second home. So it's really fun to work with them. They all went to the Technical University of Munich, by the way, where I have great relationships. And just think about all the customers in Germany that are going to hear this news, that they're going to be like, ""Wow, I'm trying to modernize my architecture. Can you give me an X-ray and then you can move all the innovation on to an action layer, and then I can start to drive business outcomes in days, weeks and months as opposed to multiple years? I think I'd sign now."""

Because what you're seeing now is a purely digital motion to the marketplace. The great news is CEOs, management teams and leaders of all kinds and companies, both in the public and the private sector, have accepted this new way of communication, which I believe has expedited collaboration and has expedited decision-making because you don't have the clunkiness and the clumsiness of the heavy travel to get something done in a few minutes as opposed to a few weeks, especially in a global company, is a blessing. 
However, there is nothing that will ever replace humans being in the same room, ideating, collaborating, dreaming, thinking about the next frontier. And that's why it's all upside for us because we're going to combine everything we're doing now in the playbook with the direct motions, and we're going to leverage the hybrid world, both for ourselves, our customers and our partners. So I actually think the tailwind going into an economy that's opening up is probably underestimated by everybody on the call today."

Or are we still at this phase where there's still so much work to be done on legacy on-prem systems so you're not seeing those modern applications kind of fold into your platform?"

What I'm seeing is there's still a massive set of customers out there with legacy. And what you're also seeing, and Gina, as an example, is our internal champion on ESG, beautifully with the engineering team when we announced one of the greatest ESG-in-a-box solutions in the world, actually, I think it's the only 1 in the world. 
But what's amazing is, there's all these islands of automation. Everybody is doing something good that's a modern system or a modern product or a modern tool. That's fine, but it doesn't necessarily unify on a common architecture where there is security, there's enterprise coherence, there's business operations, there's 1 end-to-end process that includes all the people, all the processes and all the technology and that's where the Now Platform comes in. 
And it's especially true in the world of 20th century architectures because even if you move them to a cloud, just think about the cost, the time, the risk and the companies that are dealing with do-or-die moments today, they just don't want to wait. So to have an action platform that can absolutely simulate the perfect enterprise at record speed, and I might add, with a gorgeous consumer-grade UX, is a sensational business case. And that's why you're seeing the deals get bigger, you've seen us go into a platform company model, and you now see that ServiceNow is a clear sensation. It's because we're giving the customer what they want. 
And what I also learned and I think it's an important attribute of our engineering culture and our great engineering leader and all of his leaders, we always say here at ServiceNow that our strategy is informed by our customers' strategy and deeply understanding their issues and their opportunities. And we are so quick to be able to innovate and get new releases out to market at excellent quality. And then even the ones that we didn't get out in the release can be handled by the Creator Workflow platform. 
We also built something inside of ServiceNow called NowX, where we have a series of on-deck organic innovations that are going to hit the market and take it by storm. I had an earlier question on supply chain. That's one of the major areas where we're focused on. So there's such an opportunity with legacy. There's still such an opportunity to unify these enterprises on common platforms. There's such an opportunity for hyperautomation to automate what people thought they already automated, that I just can't see any constraint to the growth agenda of ServiceNow."

While a beat-and-raise headline from ServiceNow is familiar, it is no less extraordinary. Our team delivered another outstanding quarter, yet again significantly exceeding the high end of our guidance across all metrics. Subscription revenues were up 31% organically. This is unprecedented in our industry. CRPO was up 32%, subscription billings were up 28%, operating margin was 26%. We again have raised our guidance for the full year, strengthening our clear path to $15 billion-plus in revenue by 2026. 
I was introduced as ServiceNow's CEO more than 2 years ago. We've all seen a lot since then. What we've never seen is such consistent innovation and execution at global scale. Thanks to our customers, employees and partners, we're well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. And we're only getting started. 
Before Gina gives you a complete report, let's talk about this dramatic structural incline at ServiceNow. The pace of digital investment is accelerating. IDC has consistently sized this opportunity at $7.8 trillion over a 4-year period. With this massive addressable market, ServiceNow is at the intersection of 2 generational opportunities: First, the need for a new technology foundation is supercharging our close partnership with CIOs. A recent Wall Street Journal report highlighted the role of CIOs as the architects of digital business. 
Ongoing advances in public cloud and machine learning are forging a new era of software innovation. Technology teams want a fully integrated software cycle: planning, development, deployment, operations and service. ServiceNow is leading this 20th to 21st century migration for our customers. The Now Platform, with its immense versatility and scalability, has become the control tower for digital transformation. 
The second dimension fueling ServiceNow is the reordering of the enterprise application platforms for hyperautomation. Leaders today recognize their technology architecture is their business architecture. Over several decades, enterprise has invested trillions into on-premise and first-generation SaaS applications. These applications satisfy the business process needs of the 20th century. Today, new business models require a fully connected value chain. Legacy environments are not adaptive enough to enable this change. 
As the pioneer of modern digital workflows, ServiceNow is leading the renaissance. The Now Platform connects different applications and data sources to create intuitive mobile experiences, all at a consumer grade. We don't ask businesses to bet everything on a single system or collaboration tool. We give choice, which not only unlocks value from our platform but from other platform investments as well. 
ServiceNow also empowers anyone to build applications on our platform. In its low-code development technologies report, Gartner estimates that 70% of new applications developed by 2025 will use low-code or no-code technologies. Gartner also named ServiceNow as a leader in its Magic Quadrant. These tailwinds are driving fast organic growth across our entire solutions portfolio. The number of deals greater than $1 million was 63, up 50% year-over-year, signaling substantial adoption of our platform strategy. 
In Q3, IT workflows remained very strong. ITSM was in 18 of our top 20 deals while IT Operations Management had 10 deals over $1 million. For example, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service is in a multiyear digital transformation effort. In Q3, they chose ServiceNow to consolidate 12 complex systems into a single platform to support the agency's mission-critical operations. Demand for our entire IT portfolio is strong. And with the launch of Lightstep Incident Response in Q3, we are unlocking a new wave of product-led growth in application monitoring and observability. 
Employee Workflows also had a fantastic quarter with HR in 13 of our top 20 deals. In Q3, NTT Data will leverage the Now Platform to create an employee experience portal, enhancing productivity for hybrid work and managing vaccine administration for its entire workforce. Momentum continues for Customer Workflows with CSM in 12 of our top 20 deals and 8 deals over $1 million. Industry vertical solutions are leading the way with major brands. Verizon is adopting our telco solution, American Century, our financial services solution, and Sunbelt Health, our health care solution. 
Creator Workflows, which helps businesses build their own applications, was exceptional in Q3 in 18 of our top 20 deals. We're partnering with Stanley Black & Decker to bring ServiceNow's new manufacturing vertical solution with App Engine to change how they serve their customers. Together, we're maximizing facility uptime and delivering great experiences for distributors, dealers and end consumers. 
Fujitsu will also expand its use of the Now Platform to drive its own digital transformation. We couldn't be prouder that Uber, Honeywell, Telia and many others all chose ServiceNow in Q3. This is a complete performance for the company, strong growth across the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific/Japan. 
As we look to a strong finish in 2021 and beyond, here are a few of the many factors giving us great confidence in this business. First, while lots of talent is raging out there, we're highly encouraged by the colleagues choosing ServiceNow in record numbers. Our new joiners, together with our amazing global workforce, are building a uniquely inclusive, driven and happy culture. 
We're also seeing major developments in our partner ecosystem. Just 3 weeks ago, we announced a new partnership with Celonis. Celonis will deliver process mining insights, ServiceNow will build better workflows, our customers will gain from the integrated approach. We also deepened our long-standing partnership with Microsoft. ServiceNow's Employee Center can now be directly embedded in Microsoft Teams, reaching 250 million monthly users. Together with our expanding partner community, we will reduce complexity to make work better for people. 
Finally, innovation without disruption is a hallmark of our best-in-class engineering tradition. When we say without disruption, we mean invisible, a seamless upgrade experience for our customers. In our Now Platform Rome release, we delivered countless new features to customers, including Mobile App Builder, an Automation Discovery tool, Employee Journey Management and new Customer Service Playbooks. Every business leader in the world is looking at the future of work. These new features give the Now Platform even more capability to build that hybrid future. 
I'll defer to a comment made by industry analyst Josh Bersin, who said on our Rome Platform release. ""This company seems to be able to build and deploy enterprise software faster than almost any I've ever seen, and that's why they're a juggernaut."" Josh, naturally, I agree. 
In closing, the company is firing on all cylinders. The quarter speaks for itself. We beat again, we raised again. The secular tailwinds are at our back. Our customer base is expanding just as our customer NPS is increasing. Our partner ecosystem is fired up. We accelerated our time line to be net zero. We help businesses drive their own ESG initiatives on our platform with a major release. The list goes on and on. 
Overall, our message to the market couldn't be any clearer. Whatever systems, challenges or opportunities you have, however fast you need to move, you have a trusted innovator in ServiceNow. We want to make the world work better for everyone, and we'll never lose our focus on the privilege that comes with saying, the world works with ServiceNow. 
I look forward to your questions. Gina, over to you."

Q3 was another fantastic quarter with continued outperformance across all of our growth and profitability guidance metrics. Demand was strong globally across all 3 of our geos. The consistency of our results quarter after quarter exemplifies the strength of our product portfolio and the team's focus on building deep customer relationships. 
Q3 subscription revenues were $1.43 billion, $22 million above the high end of our guidance range and growing 31% year-over-year, inclusive of 100 basis points tailwind from FX. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $9.7 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth. Current RPO was approximately $5 billion, representing 32% year-over-year growth and a 2-point beat versus our guidance. Currency did not have an impact on year-over-year growth. 
Q3 subscription billings were $1.38 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth and a $55 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. FX and duration were 150 basis points tailwind year-over-year. We saw broad-based strength across the industries we serve, with transportation and logistics and business services seeing particularly robust net new ACV growth. Our renewal rate was a healthy 98% in Q3, a testament to the value ServiceNow delivers to our customers. 
We view our relationships with customers as long-term partnerships, and we continually innovate to provide new solutions to address their evolving business needs. That land-and-expand motion has manifested into a base of 1,266 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 25% year-over-year. As the breadth of our portfolio and the addressable opportunities have expanded, so too have our deal sizes. We closed 63 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV in the quarter, up over 50% year-over-year. And in Q3, all of our top 20 deals included 4 or more products. 
Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 26%, 3 points above our guidance, primarily driven by the strong revenue beat. We also saw savings from the delay in return to work and lower travel. Our free cash flow margin was 15%. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. 
We're delivering great experiences that drive powerful employee engagement, fierce customer loyalty and significant productivity gains. By delivering more intelligent automation that provides even better experiences, we are well positioned as the workflow standard on our journey to becoming a $15 billion-plus revenue company. 
Turning to guidance. We're raising our guidance for the full year. We're raising our subscription revenue outlook by $32 million at the midpoint to a range of $5.565 billion to $5.57 billion, representing 30% year-over-year growth, including 200 basis points of FX tailwinds. We are raising our subscription billings outlook by $61 million at the midpoint to a range of $6.379 billion to $6.384 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth. 
Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 32% year-over-year at the midpoint. Growth includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 200 basis points. We continue to expect 2021 subscription gross margin of 85%, and we're raising our full year 2021 operating margin from 24.5% to 25%. This reflects the increase in our top line growth and savings from the delay in return to work and lower travel. 
We're also raising our full year 2021 free cash flow margin by 50 basis points from 31% to 31.5%. And we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 202 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $1.515 billion and $1.52 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth, including a negligible impact from FX. We expect CRPO growth of 27% year-over-year. This includes a 150 basis point FX headwind due to sharp movements recently in the euro and pound. On a constant currency basis, we expect CRPO growth to be 28.5%. 
We expect subscription billings between $2.305 billion and $2.31 billion, representing 26% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in Q4 of 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 32% year-over-year at the midpoint. Growth includes a net headwind from FX and duration of 50 basis points. We expect an operating margin of 22%, which includes accelerated demand generation spend in the quarter to set us up for a strong start in 2022, and we expect 203 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. 
In summary, the pace of digital investment is accelerating, and ServiceNow is rising up to seize the opportunities before us. The team has never been more engaged and focused on serving the enormous needs of our customers. And as ServiceNow becomes the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century, we are also remaining steadfast in our goal to create positive impact in the world. I'm happy to announce that in September, we committed to reaching our net zero emissions goal by 2030, 2 decades earlier than our previous goal. 
We've never been prouder of our employees and their continued focus on serving our customers, partners and communities as we make not only work, work better but the world work better, too. Our hungry and humble culture is stronger than ever. We can't thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication. 
And with that, I'll open it up for Q&A."

Bill, I wanted to just get your high-level thoughts, coming as we did -- after a spectacular quarter and listening to your compadre, Satya Nadella, on his call yesterday, who talked about tech as a percentage of global GDP going from 5% to 10%. I think he said that before, which leaves us with the inescapable conclusion that tech density, enterprise tech density is just going higher. It's not the world from 10 years back where a couple of ERP systems and that's it. Now it's thousands and thousands of SaaS applications and the whatnot. So where does that leave ServiceNow in terms of business prospects for spreading horizontally, vertically with your ITOM, IPS and the Workflow Engine, obviously, given that enterprise tech density is just set to go from higher or even higher levels. 
And 1 for you, Gina. When you look at this year, this year has been fascinating. Net new business has been accelerating for a few quarters. I know that you've not given us thoughts on '22 yet, but how do you feel qualitatively stepping into 2022 with a renewal base that looks very solid? Your net new business trends are getting better.

Congratulations to you. You had it nailed. A couple of things, Kash. If you look at the geographies around the world, every single geography not only beat expectations but they actually beat their internal plan handily. So every geography is expanding with ServiceNow at a record clip. 
If you look at our expansion in industry, we saw a growth across all of our industry categories this quarter. It's amazing. Industries that were COVID-impacted like transportation, logistics, business services, telecom, media, technology, financial services, government, education, every single one of them was an unbelievable success story this quarter. And we have expanded dramatically in manufacturing, health care, life sciences, telecommunications and banking, just to name a few. So think geo, think industry. 
Also think persona. This Employee Workflow business of ours is unstoppable because the employee experience is unstoppable, especially in a labor market that requires talent. And as you pointed out, Satya's remarks are absolutely right. The GDP growth in tech is inescapable because it's the only way out in a hybrid world to manage a competitive company, especially when you're competing for talent and you have to give them a great experience, example, onboarding experience, connecting all of their training tools, really making them a part of the culture when they might not even be in your buildings. 
Customer Workflows. We announced a partnership with Twilio, dealing with WhatsApp and various messaging techniques because all the old school ways are going away quickly. So with our CSM, our Employee Workflows, the experiences we're giving to people is just unreal. And don't forget the Creator Workflows. 500 million net new applications will be developed in the next 2-plus years and that will be developed for companies by companies in their own technology departments, and there's not enough engineers to do that in the world, so the Now Platform is a growth sensation. 
All of these forces are coming together at once. And that is why I could not be more confident in the bullish stance on ServiceNow not just in the short term. We run our business with clear messaging, clear facts. We could see the pipeline way into 2022 and, in some cases, beyond. It is a fantastic situation right now, Kash."

We absolutely continue to see more business back half weighted to Q4. That is going to be a trend that we continue to see. When you look at our Q4 results and our Q4 guide, you have to remember last year Q4. We had that $80 million of early payments that were brought forward that really drove a higher growth number in Q4. And if you normalize that, it's why I called out pretty transparently in the script, if you normalize for that, we're seeing 32% growth in Q4 billings. And so a really strong guide, given our scale and our base."

We had a very, very strong federal quarter. 15 deals over $1 million. 14 federal agencies are now paying us more than $10 million. Key strategic wins included the IRS, which I talked about already, but it's certainly not limited to that. It's pretty amazing how the government is rethinking strategies in terms of communication and providing services digitally to the citizens, which is incredible because as you know, that's all about the user experience and it's a workflow challenge. 
For example, look at how difficult it was for the government to get money out to small businesses during COVID. There are also some big opportunities with new initiatives in the administration, including resiliency, business continuity, outages, terrorism, COVID, cybersecurity on top of many lists. The White House actually put out an executive order on improving the nation's cybersecurity after recent ransom attacks. So that's all workflow related, leveraging existing systems that don't talk to each other very well. You're certainly not going to rip and replace them, right? So that's where the Now Platform comes in. 
And then just think about vaccine management. It remains one of the greatest workflow challenges the government faces. And boosters now will likely need to be re-administered on a regular basis. This, again, is a workflow challenge to distribute, administer and monitor vaccines. So we're in the mix on all of that. And what we're seeing is the connection of federal, state and cities that are all implementing the Now Platform to engage with citizens. So they're using products like Customer Service Management to help digitize these workflows that can no longer be processed in person because the offices are still closed due to the pandemic. 
So overall, take this as a strong, aggressive, bullish, confident reply that the public sector is embracing the Now Platform as its transformational opportunity at federal, state, local, university and all public entities that are quickly embracing us because our Net Promoter Score is so high and at word of mouth, they're saying this is the way to go, go now."

What I would also call out is last year, Q4 saw tremendous growth even when you normalize for those $80 million in collections. 
And so we are basically a 32% growth in Q4 this year normalized on top of a 32% growth last year, so strong growth upon strong growth. I will say also that not only did we raise the guide for Q4 by our Q3 beat, but we increased it by another $13 million in billings. We are seeing headwinds in Q4 for FX, but excluding that, constant currency, constant duration growth is really strong."

I mean, the quick answer, right, is the Creator Workflow platform. But what you're seeing out there is many businesses really have not maximized the value of their digital investments because they lack insight into the inefficiency of their processes, and that's what's holding back their business operations. So if you want to move the needle, organizations are going to need to understand how work is done across people, processes and systems. 
So what's happening here is ServiceNow and Celonis will help customer map those elements in real-time and then build digital workflows to more efficiently automate work. So we're going to create a seamless product experience for customers that's going to make it easy and simple for them to get insight into their processes across multiple enterprise systems. You'll be able to use Celonis' EMS platform and convert that insight, the x-ray, into action, automation and remediation on the ServiceNow workflow platform. 
So think about bringing together process mining, automation, machine learning, RPA and low-code app development into a seamless combined product experience that customers will be enabled to quickly and continuously improve the flow of work. So shorter answer is the Creative Workflow platform, but what's happening is Celonis gets the x-ray, especially in the non-ServiceNow environments. And then we use all the power of the Now Platform, including process mining in the ServiceNow environment, to give them a fast automation platform to make that business process home and really drive business outcomes. So I think this one is going to be really exciting. And I think my good partners, Alex and Bastian and Martin, I know our engineers are very committed to each other and we're going to nail it."

We literally had a review of this business just yesterday and our outstanding leader just took us through it. And what we're basically saying is the Now Platform is integrated with all systems of record, right? So customers can build applications fast. And we really are the platform of all the other platforms. I've been saying platform of platforms for a long time. 
And I want to make it clear, like we respect all those other platforms, all those other excellent brands. Our job is to make all of them even better by moving into the action layer or the hyperautomation layer on the Now Platform. And the trend we're seeing is the younger generation of workers, they're not going to submit tickets. They want action. So enterprises are creating these centers of excellence, and they're letting citizen developers build a solution to solve for the business challenges. 
So I believe that hyperautomation is a key differentiator. And because we have this one platform that does it all, RPA, low-code, process mining all on a single platform and now with Celonis, we get process mining in the non-ServiceNow environments, we bring everything together so customers can completely rethink their business model. 
Example I gave in the script is Stanley Blacker -- they're based -- Stanley Black & Decker. They're combining their new manufacturing vertical solution with the App Engine to build over 70 custom applications. This is all being done on the Now low-code Application platform. And Fujitsu also is an example where they're using App Engine to drive digital transformation and sustainability across the company, moving the green line, not just the top and bottom line."

And that's really a sustaining part of our success. I'll give you an example. You take somebody like Erica Volini, who joined from Deloitte. She had a fantastic career at Deloitte, and she wanted to come in and help us transform the service experience for our customers. 
We're collapsing the pre- and post-sale conversation. Everything here is about business impact and we're rethinking the whole services model. That's why our customer satisfaction and our Net Promoter Score is soaring. Not just our retention, we're focused on the in-process measures. That's why Jon Sigler came to us after a great career at Apple, Microsoft and Salesforce and said he believed that the Now Platform was the future of business. 
And what we have been able to do is hire thousands of people even in a pandemic because the Now Platform enables us to create these seamless hiring, onboarding, immediately skilling people up to our culture and their training needs and then managing them in a hybrid world in a way that gives them the experience of our culture. And the word gets out there quickly. We are literally harder to get into than Stanford statistically, even as you see thousands joining. 
So we are not opportunity constrained. And that's what I've been saying the whole time, why are we organically growing? Why are we committed to our engineering? Why are we fiercely committed to our market leadership? Because we can be. This is the platform of this generation, and we're investing primarily in great engineers and great go-to-market, especially quota-bearing, where we can deliver for our shareholders, our customers and our partners. 
The other thing I want to underscore is we have really expanded the ecosystem. So as you even see us hiring thousands, just think, the ecosystem is hiring even more thousands and thousands to get around this Now Platform and get their piece of the action in geos, in industries and personas. This is a growth story."

I came in a couple of years ago now, and we've really seen the transformation of the company to full-scale enterprise software company. And we took the strength that we had in IT, and we have made it really our hallmark because it's very clear now in this world, as the world is dealing with digital transformation, everybody understands that the technology architecture is the business architecture. 
And that has given us enormous responsibility but also permission to expand the perimeter into the employee experience, into customer service management, including direct-to-consumer, field service management. This Creator Workflow business, which is just an absolute sensation, ties together so many of these disjointed processes, systems and silos and enterprises today and really puts together an enterprise software market-leading approach from ServiceNow. So think of us as an enterprise player on a platform that is unstoppable."

And Bill, you mentioned earlier that transportation and logistics were particularly strong on net new ACV. And was just curious kind of on the angle of supply chain constraints that a lot of industries are facing. Are you finding that, that's kind of a catalyst for a conversation around digitizing and kind of creating more efficient workloads? And just help us understand the balance of that versus potential challenges, closing deals, just given the supply chain constraints."

Actually, it's a great question, Tyler, because I know in some industries, they talk about the supply chain dilemma and boats off the port with a lot of things in them.

Actually, it's a great question, Tyler, because I know in some industries, they talk about the supply chain dilemma and boats off the port with a lot of things in them. But this is actually an opportunity for us because what's happening now is companies have to reorient their business models. They have to think about their extended supply chain. They have to rewire who their partners are actually going to be and who they're not going to be. How they're going to source things from different places in the world that they've never even worked with before. And this is all going to create the extended supply chain opportunity for the Now Platform. 
You might have noticed, for example, we acquired [ Gekkobrain ], which is a small company in Denmark because we are in so many different ERP-related conversations where we're helping our great ERP friends. Instead of doing mass customization through consultants that would take years and years, with the Now Platform, you can do it in days. So this is creating a groundswell of opportunity on the ERP level, on the supply chain level, on the finance level, on the procurement level. It's just unbelievable. I mean, I've never seen an opportunity like this in my entire career."

I really appreciate it. So let me start with Lightstep, first of all, because I want to give a big shout-out to Ben and his great team.

So let me start with Lightstep, first of all, because I want to give a big shout-out to Ben and his great team. We love Ben, we love his team and they're just going to be a sensation here. We are continually impressed by the depth of engineering talent at Lightstep and the observability solution. We're still in the early innings of integrating the business, as you know, but we've had strong upsells from existing customers, and we're seeing that as a testament to how they value Lightstep's product, and it's already delivering to organizations. 
It's currently being sold on a stand-alone basis, but we expect that to be going to market solidly with ServiceNow at an enterprise level in 2022. We're also doing some product direct sales with the Lightstep product in the Internet channel, and I think that is also a potential elixir that markets may not be expecting from ServiceNow. It's kind of a new play in the playbook and we're pretty excited about it. 
On CSM, I'm really excited about our leadership in CSM. We have a fantastic leader in CSM with industry-renowned experience. And we're winning in verticals everywhere. Whether it's financial services, telecom, health care and life sciences, it's pretty incredible. What you're seeing here, and I actually went through this business review yesterday as well, you're seeing CSM completely rethink direct-to-consumer, you're rethinking customer service management and you're thinking about messaging, you're thinking about WhatsApp differently, you're thinking about Twilio and ServiceNow embedding these really swift solutions to the customer experience. 
Think about field service management, think about the connected experience for the ultimate consumer. Yes, other CRM companies have done a very good job on the engagement layer. Unfortunately, the customer experience doesn't end with the engagement layer. It begins with the engagement layer. So the operations layer of the company and the back-office IT capability of the company has to be tethered to that engagement layer, which is giving us net new opportunities, including IoT opportunities with field service and fleets of products, fleets of trucks, fleets of cars, EV marketplaces that we've never seen the likes of. 
And then you combine that with the Creator Workflow where it's kind of like, ""Hey, I can have it my way? You mean, I could customize that?"" Yes. And guess what, when you do the upgrade with ServiceNow, you don't have to get the consulting team in to rethink the whole implementation with us, it's invisible. It's like driving a Tesla. You press a button, the next day, you have a new Tesla. That's what ServiceNow is doing, incredible innovation."

Again, as I said, ServiceNow's platform has process mining. We have RPA, we have machine learning. We have AI ops. We have all the predictive technologies based on the moves we made, as you know, built in. But there are non-ServiceNow environments, especially if you think about large-scale ERP environments as just 1 example, where business processes are fragmented. There are multiple instances of multiple participants. 
And the customer really needs an x-ray, what's going on around here. And we combine that knowledge of all the non-ServiceNow environments that require process mining x-ray with what we do ourselves to get a force multiplier effect. And as a result, Celonis is here. There's no doubt the gold standard for workflow automation in the enterprise is ServiceNow. Why would we want to spend our time building the gold standard? We partner with you. We moved the x-ray into the action layer and together, we offer the customers something they never got before, a great x-ray and an unbelievable immediate value to action process on the Now Platform. 
And I really think this is a perfect example of trust being the ultimate human currency. I would have never done the partnership with Alex and Bastian and Martin and their terrific team. I might add Munich, Germany, one of my great friends and the world knows how much I love Germany as a second home. So it's really fun to work with them. They all went to the Technical University of Munich, by the way, where I have great relationships. And just think about all the customers in Germany that are going to hear this news, that they're going to be like, ""Wow, I'm trying to modernize my architecture. Can you give me an x-ray and then you can move all the innovation on to an action layer, and then I can start to drive business outcomes in days, weeks and months as opposed to multiple years? I think I'd sign now."""

Because what you're seeing now is a purely digital motion to the marketplace. The great news is CEOs, management teams and leaders of all kinds and companies, both in the public and the private sector, have accepted this new way of communication, which I believe has expedited collaboration and has expedited decision-making because you don't have the clunkiness and the clumsiness of the heavy travel to get something done in a few minutes as opposed to a few weeks, especially in a global company, is a blessing. 
However, there is nothing that will ever replace humans being in the same room, ideating, collaborating, dreaming, thinking about the next frontier. And that's why it's all upside for us because we're going to combine everything we're doing now in the playbook with the direct motions, and we're going to leverage the hybrid world, both for ourselves, our customers and our partners. So I actually think the tailwind going into an economy that's opening up is probably underestimated by everybody on the call today."

What I'm seeing is there's still a massive set of customers out there with legacy. And what you're also seeing -- and Gina, as an example, is our internal champion on ESG, works here beautifully with the engineering team when we announced one of the greatest ESG-in-a-box solutions in the world, actually, I think it's the only 1 in the world. 
But what's amazing is, there's all these islands of automation. Everybody is doing something good that's a modern system or a modern product or a modern tool. That's fine, but it doesn't necessarily unify on a common architecture where there is security, there's enterprise coherence, there's business operations, there's 1 end-to-end process that includes all the people, all the processes and all the technology and that's where the Now Platform comes in. 
And it's especially true in the world of 20th century architectures because even if you move them to a cloud, just think about the cost, the time, the risk and the companies that are dealing with do-or-die moments today, they just don't want to wait. So to have an action platform that can absolutely simulate the perfect enterprise at record speed, and I might add, with a gorgeous consumer-grade UX, is a sensational business case. And that's why you're seeing the deals get bigger, you've seen us go into a platform company model, and you now see that ServiceNow is a clear sensation. It's because we're giving the customer what they want. 
And what I also learned, and I think it's an important attribute of our engineering culture and our great engineering leader and all of his leaders, we always say here at ServiceNow that our strategy is informed by our customers' strategy and deeply understanding their issues and their opportunities. And we are so quick to be able to innovate and get new releases out to market at excellent quality. And then even the ones that we didn't get out in the release can be handled by the Creator Workflow platform. 
We also built something inside of ServiceNow called NowX, where we have a series of on-deck organic innovations that are going to hit the market and take it by storm. I had an earlier question on supply chain. That's one of the major areas where we're focused on. So there's such an opportunity with legacy. There's still such an opportunity to unify these enterprises on common platforms. There's such an opportunity for hyperautomation to automate what people thought they already automated, that I just can't see any constraint to the growth agenda of ServiceNow."
