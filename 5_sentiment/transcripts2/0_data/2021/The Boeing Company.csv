Good morning, everyone. 2020 was a historically challenging year for our world, for our industry, for our business and our communities. I hope you are all staying safe. We are managing our operations each and every day the best",3087,"Yes. Thank you, Maurita. Good morning, everyone. 2020 was a historically challenging year for our world, for our industry, for our business and our communities. I hope you are all staying safe. 
We are managing our operations each and every day the best that we can to minimize disruption while always protecting the well-being of our associates. A lot has happened in the last few months. So let me begin by sharing some of the highlights starting with the 737 MAX on the next chart. 
We made significant progress on the 737 program this quarter. The FAA in the United States, ANAC in Brazil, Transport Canada and just this morning, EASA in Europe have approved the resumption of 737 MAX operations, marking important milestones on our return to service journey. I would encourage all of you to read the various reports issued by our regulators regarding the intense scrutiny they put our airplanes through. This is the culmination of a comprehensive effort, including roughly 400,000 engineering hours, 1,400 test and check flights and over 3,000 flight hours completed on the airplane. 
Following one of the most rigorous certification efforts in aviation history, we're confident in the safety of our airplane. We continue to work with global regulators and our customers to safely return the airplane to service worldwide. We've assumed that the remaining non-U.S. regulatory approvals will occur during the first half of 2021, and we will continue to follow their lead in the steps ahead. 
Our first priority is assisting our customers with return to service for their existing parked fleet. Every airline has different operational considerations for returning planes to revenue service and time lines for training their pilots. We're supporting each of them as they go through their process. 
Next, we're focused on safely delivering our 737 MAX airplanes that are in inventory, which began in December of last year. Prior to the delivery, teams are performing all the necessary tests and ensuring each airplane receives customized care and rolls into a delivery stall ready for customer acceptance and FAA review. 
Since the FAA's approval to return the operations on November 18, we've delivered more than 40 737 MAX aircraft to our customers, and 5 airlines have safely returned their fleets to service, safely flying over 2,700 flights and approximately 5,500 flight hours as of January 25. Based on conversations with our customers, passenger load factors to date have been relatively consistent with the airline total fleet averages. 
We're encouraged by the progress to date and also pleased with the confidence our customers have placed in us and the airplane, highlighted most recently by Ryanair and Alaska Air announcement. In addition to our 737 progress, we continue delivering for our defense, space and services customers. Let me highlight a few of these accomplishments. 
Our defense, security and space team achieved first flight of the MQ-25 unmanned aircraft with an aerial refueling store and completed engineering design review for Wideband Global SATCOM-11+ communications satellite. Our global services team was awarded a performance-based logistics contract for the Singapore F-15 SG fleet and selected to provide P-8A training for the Royal New Zealand Air Force. 
Now let's turn to the next slide to discuss the industry environment. Overall, the government services and defense and space businesses remain significant and relatively stable. And we continue to see solid global demand for our major programs. Nevertheless, the scale of government spending on COVID-19 response has the potential to add pressure to global defense spending in the years ahead. 
Broad support for our defense portfolio is underscored by the $5 billion of orders BDS booked in the fourth quarter across key franchise platforms. Just this month, we also received the contract awards for Lot 6 and Lot 7, which include 27 additional KC-46 tankers for the U.S. Air Force. 
Additionally, the fiscal year 2021 Defense Bill includes investments in products and services from across our defense, space and government services business. The diversity of our portfolio will continue to help provide critical stability for us as we move forward. 
In the commercial market, while many of our key long-term fundamentals remain intact, we continue to see near-term market pressure due to COVID-19. Despite solid progress on the vaccine front, the next 6 to 9 months will remain very challenging for our airline customers and the entire industry. COVID-19 case rates continue to be high, and travel restrictions remain in place, putting significant pressure on passenger traffic. 
Similar to the trends we saw last quarter, the domestic market is leading the recovery, albeit a slow pace. Domestic traffic in November improved slightly to 41% below 2019. On the other hand, international operations continued to be depressed, with November traffic still 88% below the prior year. Recovery in the international segment has been weak due in large part to the absence of coordinated global policies on cross-border entry protocols. 
The uncertainty in the international markets has meant that the active fleet is still around 3/4 the size of its precrisis level. Coupled with utilization rates that are below historical averages, airlines are flying just about half of their normal operations at the global level. 
Regionally, we're seeing case rates and government travel restrictions continue to evolve, resulting in different recovery trajectories. China domestic passenger traffic, for example, has rebounded significantly, although it's not without risk. Europe is experiencing a pullback because of the resurgence of COVID-19 and related government restrictions. And then finally, in North America, traffic remains more than 60% below our 2019 levels, and these dynamics continue to drive a very uneven recovery. 
As anticipated, the number of aircraft being retired from the active fleet continues to grow, 1,300 and growing. We expect this trend to continue as our customers focus on retiring their oldest and least efficient airplanes and replacing them with new airplanes that will be as much as 25% to 40% more fuel efficient and better for the environment. The longer it takes to put COVID in the rearview mirror, the more retirements we will see. 
As for the freighter market, we're seeing an interesting dynamic with more freighters flying today than before the pandemic due to the limited belly cargo capacity from passenger airplanes. While overall cargo traffic showed a year-on-year decline, yields have remained elevated. The dramatic growth of e-commerce in the past year has fueled express freighter expansion. This has supported the demand for our cargo aircraft as seen in recent orders from DHL for 8 777 freighters and for -- and from Atlas Air for 4 747 freighters. 
We also added incremental freighter conversion orders to our global services backlog. And over the long run, cargo demand will continue to be driven by global trade and GDP growth and recovery. 
We're encouraged by the speed of vaccine development and efficacy rates. These trends bolster our medium-term outlook and support our belief in the long-term trend strength of the market. Consistent with what we've shared previously as well as IATA and other industry groups, we expect it will take around 3 years for travel to return to the 2019 levels and a few years beyond that to return to our long-term growth trends. 
Again, we see the recovery in 3 phases. First, we're seeing domestic traffic improving in places like Brazil, the United States, India and other large domestic markets. Next, regional markets should begin to recover such as intra-Asia, intra-Europe and intra-Americas flights. And then finally, long-haul international routes, which require the most coordination, will be the last to bounce back. Therefore, demand for narrowbody aircraft is expected to recover quite a bit faster while widebody demand will remain challenged for a longer period. 
As we move forward, testing mechanisms, progress on vaccine distribution and coordinated government interactions will be key drivers of the recovery. We will continue working with the industry through our Confident Travel initiative. Industry and academic studies continue to demonstrate that with multiple layers of protection, including HEPA filters, enhanced cleaning procedures and the use of personal face coverings that the risk of transmission while flying is quite low. Collaboration between governments is an important element for implementing new screening protocols, which can even further reduce the risk of transmission. 
In the commercial services market, we saw modest incremental demand improvement in the fourth quarter. Although we are starting to see some stability, the recovery has been slow, and we continue to anticipate will take multiple years to reach our previous demand levels. 
Accelerated retirements will also result in newer fleets when we emerge from the pandemic. That will reduce service demand and prolong their recovery. 
Given the challenging environment, managing liquidity continues to be vital to the aerospace industry to bridge us to recovery. Despite the unprecedented situation, there generally continues to be liquidity in the market for our customers and for Boeing. 
Financiers and investors understand the long-term value proposition of aircraft and the fundamental need to connect the world. And this has been demonstrated by the broad global interest in the space and the new entrants into the market over the past several years. 
We supported the COVID relief and stimulus packages passed by Congress last year and similar efforts underway globally. These relief programs, including access to financing, have been helpful to our customers as well as a number of our suppliers. And we believe that support will help enable a faster recover -- recovery for the industry as we are navigating the pandemic. 
As we see airlines adapt to these market realities, product differentiation and versatility will be key. Our product lineup remains well positioned to meet our customer needs and support airline plans to gain efficiencies and reach emission goals. 
For example, our digital solutions continue to provide important capabilities to our customers, as highlighted by Frontier Airlines' recent decision to sign a 10-year digital services agreement with us for their fleet. Our attractive portfolio and the diversity of our backlog provide a strong foundation as we prepare to recover and grow in the future. 
Now let's turn to commercial airplane production rates on Slide 4. We're closely coordinating with our customers to understand their fleet needs while monitoring the broader market environment to ensure we're aligning supply with demand. Let me provide some key updates across our programs. 
Starting with the 787 program. As we've shared, we're conducting comprehensive inspections on undelivered airplanes, both in Everett and in South Carolina. Since last quarter, we've expanded the scope of those inspections, including work done at our supplier partners. Our assessment shows that none of the issues identified represent safety of flight concerns. Nevertheless, we remain committed to taking the time to ensure each airplane meets our rigorous engineering specifications. And although this work has a near-term impact for us, in terms of both schedule and cost, it is the right thing to do. And we continue to be in coordination with the FAA and our customers throughout the process. 
Transparency is clear. Through our analysis, we've been able to determine the resolution for the majority of previously identified areas, including our major join sections. In some cases, this requires inspections and rework, while in other areas, no further action is required. We've made good progress and are now completing analysis on a few remaining areas to validate the next steps. As we see it today, this work may take a few more weeks, but we will provide our engineers the time they need to complete that analysis. 
We are implementing changes in the production process to ensure newly built airplanes meet our specifications and do not require further inspection. This is consistent with our determination to eliminate rework from our production system to position us on stronger footing when the market recovers. 
We're looking forward to resuming 787 deliveries to our customers. But as I discussed, there's still work to be done. Based on what we know today, we expect 787 deliveries to resume later this quarter. However, it will be back-end loaded with no delivery this month and most likely very few, if any, in February. 
Also, based on what we know today, we still expect to deliver the vast majority of the 787 aircraft inventory by the end of the year. We will keep you updated on the progress. As we've previously shared, given the widebody market environment, we're in the process of transitioning to a rate of 5 per month in March, at which point, 787 final assembly will be consolidated to Boeing South Carolina. 
On the 777, 777X programs, we now anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. This schedule and the financial impact to the program this quarter reflect a number of factors, including an updated assessment of global certification requirements, the latest assessment of COVID-19 impacts on market demand and discussions with our customers with respect to delivery timing. 
We're working closely with global regulators on all aspects of the 777X development. This involves listening to all their feedback and applying lessons learned from our experiences on the 737 MAX program recertification and applying to our 777X certification plan. It also involves making prudent design modifications as necessary to meet the various global regulators' expectations. 
As part of our assessment, we've made the decision to implement certain modifications to the aircraft design. Our decision to make these modifications, which will involve firmware and hardware changes to the actuator control electronics, reflects our current judgment of global regulators' compliance expectations. This decision has led to these revised schedule assumptions. 
COVID-19 has had a significant impact on passenger traffic, particularly international long-haul routes serviced by large widebodies such as the 777X, which has shifted the anticipated replacement wave and overall demand for widebody airplanes to the right. Additionally, the challenging business climate is impacting our 777X customers. 
These broader market factors, coupled with our conversations with our customers about preferred delivery timing, informed our current assumptions. As a result of these updated program assumptions, we booked a $6.5 billion pretax charge in the quarter, a significant component of which is driven by a reduction in the program's initial accounting quantity. Greg will go through the financial impact in greater detail a little later. 
Despite the challenges we and the industry are facing, we are confident in the 777X airplane and the unmatched capability it will offer our customers. With the most payload capacity and lowest operating cost per seat of any widebody, the 777X completes our market-leading widebody family with a distinct competitive advantage. 
Across the total widebody market of more than 8,000 projected deliveries over the next 2 decades, we see replacement demand for over 1,500 large widebody airplanes, which are well suited for the 777X. We also continue to see strong freighter demand and good delivery pace for our current 777 freighter. 
Our production rate expectations for the combined 777, 777X program remains at 2 per month in 2021. We continue to assess our production plans to efficiently transition to the 777X. 
Turning now to the 737 program. We're currently producing at a low rate and expect to gradually increase the rate to 31 per month in early 2022. And we expect further gradual increases to correspond with market demand. We will continue to assess the delivery profile for 2021 as it will help inform our 737 production ramp, our ramp plan, and we will continue to communicate transparently with our supply chain to ensure stability. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 3,300 aircraft in our 737 backlog. There's no change to our production rate plan for the 747 or the 767. 
The market continues to be dynamic, and we will monitor closely as we prudently balance supply and demand across all of our programs. Although this remains an unprecedented and uncertain time, we are confident air travel will return. And when it does, we will be ready to support our customers with a well-positioned family of airplanes. 
Now let's quickly look at our 2021 priorities on Slide 5. As you'll see, our priorities remain consistent. Navigating through this global pandemic and rebuilding stronger on the other side continues to be a key focus, along with safely returning the 737 to service worldwide, building on our efforts over the past 2 years. 
We remain committed to working closely with all of our stakeholders to rebuild trust 1 day at a time, one airplane at a time. And we'll do that by living our values, demonstrating transparency every step of the way and delivering on our commitments. As part of our continued commitment to safety, we recently announced our first Chief Aerospace Safety Officer. 
Consistent with these values is our focus on sustainability. We continue to make great strides in our efforts, innovating and operating to make the world better. We achieved net carbon -- net 0 carbon emissions at our manufacturing and work sites in 2020 by expanding conservation and renewable energy use while tapping into responsible offsets for the remaining greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, we've committed that our commercial airplanes will be capable and certified to fly on 100% sustainable aviation fuels by 2030. 
Operational excellence is about how we work to deliver safe products and services to our customers while continuously striving for first-time quality. We are also taking steps to restore the health of our production system. As we calibrate our production rates to the market impacts of COVID-19, we're taking the opportunity to implement quality, workplace safety and productivity improvement projects to bring stability to our factories. And as Greg will cover later, this also extends to our engagement with suppliers. 
And last but not least, we will not lose sight of our future and the innovations that will reshape air travel. We continue to invest in our areas that are critical to our business, focusing on design practices and manufacturing technology that will position us for growth. 
We're also continuing to invest in our people. We recently announced that we will be providing most of our employees a onetime stock grant that will vest in 3 years as we recover and grow the business. 
To close, our guiding principle here is that every decision we must -- that we make must help us navigate through this difficult period while not diminishing our future competitiveness. We will take action to protect our business and our people by closely managing liquidity and driving lasting transformational change to make our business stronger and more resilient than ever. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Greg. Greg?"
370857,700364866,2182244,"The Boeing Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","The Boeing Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn now to Slide 6. Our revenue of $58.2 billion and core earnings per share of negative $23.25 reflected lower commercial delivery and service volume primarily due to COVID-19 as well as 787 product",2897,"Great. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn now to Slide 6. Our revenue of $58.2 billion and core earnings per share of negative $23.25 reflected lower commercial delivery and service volume primarily due to COVID-19 as well as 787 production issues, partially offset by lower 737 MAX customer consideration charges when compared to 2019. 
Full year earnings were also impacted by the $6.5 billion pretax charge on the 777X program, additional tax valuation allowance and abnormal production costs related to the 737 MAX program. Operating cash flow of negative $18.4 billion reflected lower commercial deliveries and service volume as well as timing of receipts and expenditures. 
With that, let's turn to Slide 7 for our fourth quarter results. Consistent with the full year results, revenue of $15.3 billion reflected lower commercial airplane deliveries and commercial service volume, partially offset by a lower 737 MAX customer consideration charge. Earnings in the quarter were also impacted by the charge on the 777X program, a $744 million charge related to the previously announced agreement between Boeing and the U.S. Department of Justice and 737 abnormal production costs. 
Income tax in the quarter reflected the impact of an additional valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets, partially offset by the 5-year net operating loss carryback provision in the CARES Act. The $2.5 billion of noncash valuation allowance booked in the quarter was based on the required accounting analysis to assess recoverability of our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income. This is an accounting assessment, which places a lot of weight on our recent losses leading to the charge this quarter. 
Important to note that this valuation allowance does not limit our ability to utilize deferred tax assets in the future periods. It does not change our outlook on future company results and has no impact on cash flows or future tax returns. When income generation returns to more normal levels, we can expect to see the allowance reverse and increase reported earnings. 
Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 8. Revenue was $4.7 billion driven by lower widebody delivery volume, partially offset by higher 737 deliveries and a lower 737 MAX customer consideration charge in the quarter compared to the same period last year. Operating margins declined driven by the charge on the 777X program, lower delivery volume and a $468 million of abnormal production costs related to the 737 program, again, partially offset by lower 737 MAX customer consideration charge. 
As Dave mentioned, we began to receive regulatory approvals to resume 737 MAX operations in the fourth quarter, and we restarted 737 MAX deliveries in December last year. Last quarter, we shared with you that we had about 450 737 MAX aircraft built and stored in inventory. With deliveries of 27 aircraft in December and now 40 to date, this number has been reduced to approximately 410 aircraft in inventory. 
As we previously communicated, we expect to have to remarket some of these aircraft and potentially reconfigure them. Deliveries from storage will continue to be our priority after assisting our customers with their return to service as we continue to work closely with our customers based on their fleet needs. 
Our estimated timing of 737 deliveries from storage has not changed since last quarter. That said, we expect delivery timing and production rate ramp-up profile to continue to be dynamic given the pandemic. 
There are no material change to our estimate total of abnormal costs of $5 billion. During the fourth quarter, we expensed $468 million of abnormal production costs, which brought the cumulative abnormal cost expensed to date to $2.6 billion. We expect the remainder of this cost to be expensed as incurred largely in 2021. 
Our assessment of the liability for estimated 737 MAX potential concessions and other considerations to customers and the expected cash impact timing did not change significantly in the fourth quarter from our previous assessment. Cumulatively, we've accrued a $9.6 billion liability for the estimated potential concessions and other considerations. 
To date, we've made $3.7 billion of payments to customers in cash and other forms of compensation, including $600 million we paid this quarter. We have settlement agreements covering approximately $3 billion of the remaining liability balance of $5 billion. 
Turning now to 787. As we've discussed, we continue to complete the inspections on our 787 program in our factories and in our supply chain. We have approximately 80 undelivered 787 aircraft in inventory. Based on what we know today, we anticipate that we will unwind the vast majority of these aircraft during '21 and are working with our customers to facilitate this. 
But as Dave mentioned, we still have some work ahead of us on this, and we will keep you posted on the progress. Our latest assessment of the financial impact of this effort and delivery delays have been included in our fourth quarter closing position. 
As we've previously disclosed, the 787 program has near breakeven gross margins due to the previously announced reductions in production rates and program accounting quantity. If we are required to further reduce the accounting quantity and/or production rates or experience other factors that could result in lower margin, the program could reach forward loss in future periods. However, on a cash basis, the 787 unit margin has held up relatively well even with these lower production rates and many of the underlying productivity and profitability drivers remain in place. 
As Dave mentioned, we expect first delivery of the 777X to now occur in late 2023, and we recorded a $6.5 billion reach forward loss on the program. Our decision to implement certain modifications to the aircraft design has added time to the schedule and result in additional costs. 
In addition to that factor, other key elements contributing to the reach forward loss include the following: one, an updated assessment of the market demand and customers' preferences on delivery timing based on continued dialogue with our customers; two, resulting adjustments to planned production rates and reduction in program accounting quantity to 350 aircraft. 
As a reminder, initial accounting quantity doesn't represent the long-term potential size of the program. We see replacement demand for over 1,500 larger widebody aircraft, which will be well suited to the 777X. The approach we used to establish the accounting quantity is consistent with what we've used on other programs. And as part of our closing process, we always evaluate the initial accounting quantity on a quarterly basis even in program development to test that the program is not in a reach forward loss position. 
And lastly, other cost elements include increased change in corporation costs along with associated customer and supply chain impacts. The combination of these factors created significant pressure on the 777X program's revenue and cost estimates, resulting in the reach forward loss for the program. 
We still expect peak use of cash for the 777X program to be in 2020. The changes to the 777X program time line will result in some cash flow headwinds in '21 and '22. But we expect cash flow to improve as we get closer to EIS and begin deliveries in late '23. We anticipate the program to turn cash flow positive approximately 1 to 2 years after starting initial deliveries. 
Commercial Airplanes backlog included more than 4,000 aircraft valued at $282 billion. The decline in backlog in the fourth quarter reflected aircraft order cancellations and removal of aircraft orders from our backlog due to ASC 606 accounting standard, including our most recent assessment of 777X backlog due to the revised schedule. 
Given the significant headwinds that remain in the market, BCA margin progression will be highly dependent upon future production rates and will take time. However, we are taking action today to make foundational lasting change through our business transformation efforts in order to help offset those headwinds as much as possible. 
Let's now move to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 9. Fourth quarter revenue increased to $6.8 billion primarily driven by higher volume as well as a charge on the Commercial Crew program in the fourth quarter of 2019. Fourth quarter operating margins of 7.4% include $275 million pretax charge on the KC-46A tanker program primarily due to production inefficiencies, including the impacts of COVID-19 disruption. We received $5 billion in orders in the quarter, including a contract for 2 KC-46A aircraft from Japan, AEW&C upgrades for the Republic of Korea Air Force and key proprietary space programs, bringing the backlog now to $61 billion. 
Let's now turn to Global Services results on Slide 10. In the fourth quarter, Global Services revenue declined to $3.7 billion driven by lower commercial services volume due to COVID-19. Operating margins decreased to 3.8% due to lower commercial service volume and $290 million of pretax charges related to asset impairments primarily to reflect the updated fleet retirement assumptions driven by COVID. 
During the quarter, BGS won key contracts worth approximately $7 billion, which brings its backlog now to $21 billion. Although we saw a slight uptick in commercial service demand in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect the recovery to take multiple years. 
We continue to position our services business for the future, taking actions to rightsize our operations. In addition, we are shaping our portfolio to ensure that we have the right solutions to help our customers and industry navigate the downturn and prepare for market recovery. The result of our efforts have already started to positively impact our operating margin performance. 
Let's now turn to cash flow on Slide 11. The disruption caused by COVID-19 on our airlines and global economy continues to put significant pressure on our cash receipts. Operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $4 billion driven by lower commercial airplane delivery volume, advanced payment timing and commercial service volume. 
Let's now move to Slide 12 to discuss our liquidity position. We continue to proactively manage our cash position and assess our liquidity throughout this pandemic. We ended the fourth quarter with strong liquidity, including $25.6 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet and have access to our $9.5 billion bank credit facility, which remains undrawn as well continued access to capital markets. Our debt balance at the end of the quarter was $63.6 billion, reflecting our $4.9 billion bond issuance as well as debt repayments in the quarter. 
As we've discussed previously, we've been taking many actions to enhance liquidity, including suspending our dividend, reducing discretionary spending, matching 401(k) contributions in stock, prefunding pension with stock and most recently, awarding most of our employees a onetime stock grant that will vest in 3 years in lieu of merit increases this year. These actions reflect our continued derisking strategy and are part of our balanced approach to ensuring we're proactively meeting our obligations. 
We worked hard in the past to maintain disciplined cash management while seeking opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet, and we will continue to do so. Once cash flow generation returns to more normal levels, reducing our debt levels will be a key focus area. 
We believe we currently have sufficient liquidity and are not planning to increase our debt levels. However, we will continue to actively manage our balance sheet, including refinancing debt maturities. Our investment-grade credit rating is important to us, and we'll continue to consider all aspects of our capital structure to strengthen our balance sheet. 
Let's turn to the next slide. As we look forward into '21, I'd like to provide you with some insight into some of the key drivers, which are informed by the current market recovery expectations and customer discussions to date. 2021 will continue to be a challenging year. That said, we expect upward trends from 2020. 
Based on what we know, we'd expect to see 2021 revenue improve from 2020. This will be driven mainly by higher 737 and 787 deliveries as we plan to unwind inventory and deliver from the production lines. 
We expect BDS to generate low to single-digit growth in '21 revenue compared to 2020. Excluding onetime events, we anticipate modest revenue growth. 
As for BGS, while we anticipate solid growth in our government services business in '21, our commercial services will continue to be challenged due to COVID-19 impacts. [ We expect ] BGS revenue to be relatively stable '21 versus 2020. 
On the P&L side, we also expect improvement in '21 primarily driven by higher commercial deliveries, absence of 2020 charges, improved performance and benefits from continued business transformation efforts. These impacts will be primarily offset by higher interest expense. Also in [indiscernible] ECA will continue to book significant abnormal production costs for the 737 program in 2021. 
Moving to cash flow. We continue to expect 2021 operating cash to be much improved from 2020 driven mainly by inventory burn down associated with 737 and 787 programs. While higher deliveries will be a tailwind, the timing of advanced payments and burn down of excess advance payments, along with 737 customer settlement payments and higher interest payments, will continue to be headwinds. The revised 777X schedule also creates headwind to our current cash profile versus our prior assumptions. 
Bringing this all together, based on what we know today, we continue to expect 2021 to still be a use of cash and to be cash flow positive in 2022. We expect cash improvements from '21 to '22 to be driven by continued improvement on the 737 program due to lower customer considerations and higher delivery payments as well as commercial services. 
And as I just outlined, our commercial delivery volume is a key driver for improvements from 2020 to 2021. Therefore, the drivers clearly hinge on the pace of commercial market recovery. Given the dynamic environment, we will continue to diligently work opportunities and monitor risk factors and keep you posted on further developments. 
Now let's move to the last slide. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken prudent and decisive action to get ahead, [ to preserve ] cash so that we can navigate this crisis and also reshape our business so that we can emerge as a sharper, resilient, leaner enterprise. In addition to taking actions to derisk our portfolio and bolster liquidity, we have also made operational changes to lower our production rates and adjust our workforce to align with the new market reality. 
We have taken production rates for the 787 and 777 programs down by approximately half due to COVID impact and also moderated the ramp of the 737 production rate. We continue to take steps to reach our previously shared plan to bring our overall staffing levels to approximately 130,000 by the end of '21. 
As you know, we are progressing through extensive business transformation efforts that are introduced [ some ] quarters ago. The financial objectives we've established are measured in billions of dollars, and we expect them to be executed over a multiyear period. 
We expect the majority of our efforts will result in enduring lasting changes that will enable us to be more efficient in the long term, laying the foundation for recovery, future margin expansion and cash flow generation as the market recovers. A combination of all of our actions in 2020 helped us generate more than $10 billion of liquidity, which was [indiscernible] as we navigate this very challenging environment. Approximately half of our transformation efforts are focused on reducing structural costs versus variable. 
We continue to make progress across all 5 pillars as we utilize a low production environment to transform and improve our business processes. Projects to improve operational stability, implement first-time quality initiatives, shape our portfolio with core markets, simplify our organizational structure and reduce bureaucracy are all examples of efforts meant to create meaningful and lasting change to how we operate as well as our cost structure. 
Through our portfolio and investment prioritization, we reduced R&D and CapEx by [ $1.3 billion in '20 ] from prior year. We also took out over $1 billion of indirects [indiscernible] reducing expenditures in areas such as freight logistics, purchased services. 
And as part of our footprint optimization, we sold or closed over 240,000 square [indiscernible] over the next year. There are a number of other initiatives [indiscernible]. 
We talk often about our transformation at the operational production level. Every support organization in our company is on this journey. Our team, the human resources, finance, IT and more are all recalibrating their structures and operating models to simplify processes, eliminate unnecessary spending, reduce bureaucracy and improve long-term performance and competitiveness. 
For example, we have been [indiscernible] providing opportunities to form or expand strategic partnerships with vendors that allow us to simplify and optimize our operations and reduce overall costs. We're also evolving the way we work with our [ 12,000 ] suppliers. This began with our Boeing [ supplier ], which expanded [indiscernible] can strengthen the yield improvement in quality, affordability, on-time delivery. These principles built on success, feedback and [indiscernible] throughout our supply chain. 
And as we take action, we're ensuring that every step only further drives key [indiscernible] efforts in safety, quality and delivery on -- building on our commitments. We've got the right team in place, and we're confident that we have the right actions put together, all supporting our future and our competitiveness. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Dave for some closing comments."

In addition to navigating COVID-19, we also made important progress on the 737 as we engage transparently and comprehensively with regulators, government leaders, customers, suppliers and our teams. Having done that, we'll be that much more prepared for airplane certification efforts going forward. 
The return to service of the 737 was a key step for us as we make fundamental changes to how we operate and rebuild trust one airplane, one interaction, 1 day at a time. I'm proud of our team, and I thank them for the resilience and dedication that they've demonstrated as we've navigated through this really difficult moment together. 
2021 is an inflection point for our industry and certainly for Boeing. We have been through tough times before. We know how to overcome challenges and to adapt, and we will stand by our customers throughout this process. Driven by our values and with a focus on quality, safety, integrity and transparency, we will emerge from this moment stronger, more competitive for the long term. 
And with that, Greg and I will be happy to take a few questions. Thank you."

On the 787, as I mentioned, even at these low rates on a unit basis, [ cash ] is pretty good. And that's the efforts of the past for sure and having a good product mix between 8s, 9s and 10s. And again, that's going to go up with volume. And that obviously not taken into consideration the advances that will come with that increased volume on both of those programs. But by far, those are the 2 single drivers to the cash flow positive and particularly in '22 and beyond. 
And then beyond that, it's the 777X as we talked about, getting out of use of cash and into positive cash as I just mentioned. Those 3 elements, again, are going to be key to the cash trajectory between now and '23 and '24 and beyond."

I think on the delivery profile, certainly, we've got a delivery profile laid out in detail for the balance of the year and going into '22 and '23. We don't see any reduction taking place there, as Dave indicated, on the production rates that we've established, not only delivering out of inventory which, as you know, is our priority 1, but also increasing those rates as we go forward. 
So that profile continues and delivering off, like I said, the backlog, but also delivering off the inventory that we've got in the ramp. And I don't know whether it was picked up earlier or not, but all the deliveries we've had to date, the 40 aircraft have all come out of inventory. 
So again, it will be a combination, but the priority will continue to be on those inventory aircraft. So we see strong demand for the aircraft and again, tied to the recovery.

Right now, you talked about the competitiveness of the MAX versus the competition, the A320neo. And certainly, you can see that certainly at the MAX 8, if you look for TransCon flights, very competitive airplane. But Airbus has been very successful with the 321 XLR, which can do a lot of the 757 missions. And can't really see how the MAX can compete up on those missions. So when you look forward, are you ready to see that market now? How do you think of these sort of narrow transatlantic routes, situations like that? How will you approach that over the long term?"

And again, I think about a portfolio of airplanes, not just any one. And while we take all of the face offs that we go through in order and in those routes that you described for the 321, we -- I get it completely, so does our team. 
Broadly speaking, and on balance across the portfolio, we like where our portfolio plays with a MAX at the lower end and the 87 at the higher end and very, very successful airplane. So that just said -- all that means is we're going to take our time. 
I'm pretty sure you're in the right space, although I'm not going to point design today. I think you're pretty much in the right space with respect to where next development efforts lean. But I don't want to call it out just yet. 
And I'll go right back to the comment I made in the beginning. We are really progressing well on our engineering and manufacturing forward technology development so that we're ready when that moment comes to offer a really differentiated product. So I'm sure it's not a lot of rocket science for you to add up and guess where things end up. But we're not going to call out that point design. This isn't the moment. 
We're going to take a little time, and we don't feel significantly disadvantaged with our portfolio versus their portfolio. So anyway, that's how we think about it. And we are thinking long term, that's for sure."

I don't think they're going to play into it anywhere near the extent to which they used to simply because the demands on that propulsion system in the next go around I don't think are going to be as significant. And now I'm just -- I'm going to, I think, speak to the industry and what I know they are capable of doing or not. 
So therefore, differentiation at the airframe level itself is really, really important in the next run, which means that these technologies that we are working with and trying to demonstrate to ourselves at scale with determinant assembly, those are the things that will differentiate. And believe it or not, that becomes the most important criteria for us with respect to announcing that next airplane. 
It's got to depend on these advanced technologies, and it will. So -- and I don't feel in any way, shape or form that 1 year or 2 years more in the market to learn more is going to hold us back in any way, shape or form or hurt The Boeing Company in any way, shape or form. So that's the perspective I'd put on it. 
Right now, we're getting no pressure, as you might imagine, from airlines to run forward as fast as we can. And that's a bit of a luxury on this subject. But the most important thing for me and the Boeing team is to get these underlying technologies proven, demonstrated at scale so that when we call that point design, we're ready and we'll deliver."

And to your point, I mean, we've taken that into consideration with the current rates that Dave talked about through that period. So the advanced time line associated with that tied rate to how we see at least near term those production rates. So obviously, if we modify those in any way, it will have an impact on advances. But I would say separate from that, the delivery profile of 87 and 737 are going to be the biggest contributors to the growth of cash flow. 
Now certainly, advances will help as we get lead time away on rate increases, but delivery profile alone will be one of the more significant drivers. So as I said before, looking from the outside, watch the delivery profile on both of those programs in particular, and they'll align rate to our cash flow profiles and projections we've had going forward. 
And then advances will be a little further out from this time period just because of the rate increases, particularly on the 37, as we burn off some of the access advances. And then the advances on the 87 will be, again, tied to the rate increases beyond the '21, '22 frame."

And the agreements are in place. It's just a question of whether the posture changes in any way that allows for that Phase 1 deal to move forward.

And that's the best guidance we can talk about because we do think there is pressure that will ultimately come down as a result of all the COVID spending here in the United States. 
But a large part of our business now is international markets, and the order activity in those international markets has pushed to the right somewhat and almost entirely because of COVID-related stuff, not because of any competitive issue one way or the other. So we still like our position because we have an awful lot of ongoing programs that the military and of course, our Defense Bills have been kind to in each and every one of their moments. And this last bill was a good one for us in pretty much every respect. So it's hard to commit to a big uptick in any way on growth rates anytime soon in light of what I think are the pressures. 
The only other comment I would make is there's a big segment of work that we do in the classified world that is incredibly encouraging and incredibly important to us. And anyway, I believe not just for our defense world, but also ultimately derivative technologies for the commercial world that, that's going to be a big source of competitive advantage for Boeing. So we're high on it, but I'm very reticent to want to suggest the market is going to get any better or that we're going to differentiate ourselves any further than what we have been."

We are managing our operations each and every day the best that we can to minimize disruption while always protecting the well-being of our associates. A lot has happened in the last few months. So let me begin by sharing some of the highlights starting with the 737 MAX on the next chart.  
We made significant progress on the 737 program this quarter. The FAA in the United States, ANAC in Brazil, Transport Canada and just this morning, EASA in Europe have approved the resumption of 737 MAX operations, marking important milestones on our return to service journey. I would encourage all of you to read the various reports issued by our regulators regarding the intense scrutiny they put our airplanes through. This is the culmination of a comprehensive effort, including roughly 400,000 engineering hours, 1,400 test and check flights and over 3,000 flight hours completed on the airplane. Following one of the most rigorous certification efforts in aviation history, we're confident in the safety of our airplane. 
We continue to work with global regulators and our customers to safely return the airplane to service worldwide. We've assumed that the remaining non-U.S. regulatory approvals will occur during the first half of 2021, and we will continue to follow their lead in the steps ahead.  
Our first priority is assisting our customers with return to service for their existing parked fleet. Every airline has different operational considerations for returning planes to revenue service and time lines for training their pilots. We're supporting each of them as they go through their process.  
Next, we're focused on safely delivering our 737 MAX airplanes that are in inventory, which began in December of last year. Prior to the delivery, teams are performing all the necessary tests and ensuring each airplane receives customized care and rolls into a delivery stall ready for customer acceptance and FAA review.  
Since the FAA's approval to return the operations on November 18, we've delivered more than 40 737 MAX aircraft to our customers, and 5 airlines have safely returned their fleets to service, safely flying over 2,700 flights and approximately 5,500 flight hours as of January 25. Based on conversations with our customers, passenger load factors to date have been relatively consistent with the airline total fleet averages.  
We're encouraged by the progress to date and also pleased with the confidence our customers have placed in us and the airplane, highlighted most recently by Ryanair and Alaska Air announcements. 
In addition to our 737 progress, we continue delivering for our defense, space and services customers. Let me highlight a few of these accomplishments.  
Our defense, security and space team achieved first flight of the MQ-25 unmanned aircraft with an aerial refueling store and completed engineering design review for Wideband Global SATCOM-11+ communications satellite. Our global services team was awarded a performance-based logistics contract for the Singapore F-15SG fleet and selected to provide P-8A training for the Royal New Zealand Air Force.  
Now let's turn to the next slide to discuss the industry environment. Overall, the government services and defense and space businesses remain significant and relatively stable. And we continue   to see solid global demand for our major programs. Nevertheless, the scale of government spending on COVID-19 response has the potential to add pressure to global defense spending in the years ahead.  
Broad support for our defense portfolio is underscored by the $5 billion of orders BDS booked in the fourth quarter across key franchise platforms. Just this month, we also received the contract awards for Lot 6 and Lot 7, which include 27 additional KC-46 Tankers for the U.S. Air Force.  
Additionally, the fiscal year 2021 defense bill includes investments in products and services from across our defense, space and government services business. The diversity of our portfolio will continue to help provide critical stability for us as we move forward.  
In the commercial market, while many of our key long-term fundamentals remain intact, we continue to see near-term market pressure due to COVID-19. Despite solid progress on the vaccine front, the next 6 to 9 months will remain very challenging for our airline customers and the entire industry. COVID-19 case rates continue to be high and travel restrictions remain in place, putting significant pressure on passenger traffic.  
Similar to the trends we saw last quarter, the domestic market is leading the recovery, albeit a slow pace. Domestic traffic in November improved slightly to 41% below 2019. On the other hand, international operations continued to be depressed, with November traffic still 88% below the prior year. Recovery in the international segment has been weak due in large part to the absence of coordinated global policies on cross-border entry protocols.  
The uncertainty in the international markets has meant that the active fleet is still around 3/4 the size of its precrisis level. Coupled with utilization rates that are below historical averages, airlines are flying just about half of their normal operations at the global level.  
Regionally, we're seeing case rates and government travel restrictions continue to evolve, resulting in different recovery trajectories. China domestic passenger traffic, for example, has rebounded significantly, although it's not without risk. Europe is experiencing a pullback because of the resurgence of COVID-19 and related government restrictions. And then finally, in North America, traffic remains more than 60% below our 2019 levels, and these dynamics continue to drive a very uneven recovery.  
As anticipated, the number of aircraft being retired from the active fleet continues to grow, 1,300 and growing. We expect this trend to continue as our customers focus on retiring their oldest and least efficient airplanes and replacing them with new airplanes that will be as much as 25% to 40% more fuel efficient and better for the environment. The longer it takes to put COVID in the rearview mirror, the more retirements we will see.  
As for the freighter market, we're seeing an interesting dynamic with more freighters flying today than before the pandemic due to the limited belly cargo capacity from passenger airplanes. While overall cargo traffic showed a year-on-year decline, yields have remained elevated. The dramatic growth of e-commerce in the past year has fueled express freighter expansion. This has supported the demand for our cargo aircraft as seen in recent orders from DHL for 8 777 freighters and for -- and from Atlas Air for 4 747 freighters.  
We also added incremental freighter conversion orders to our global services backlog. And over the long run, cargo demand will continue to be driven by global trade and GDP growth and recovery.  
We're encouraged by the speed of vaccine development and efficacy rates. These trends bolster our medium-term outlook and support our belief in the long-term trend -- strength of the market. Consistent with what we've shared previously as well as IATA and other industry groups, we expect it will take around 3 years for travel to return to the 2019 levels and a few years beyond that to return to our long-term growth trends.  
Again, we see the recovery in 3 phases. First, we're seeing domestic traffic improving in places like Brazil, the United States, India and other large domestic markets. Next, regional markets should begin to recover such as intra-Asia, intra-Europe and intra-Americas flights. And then finally, long-haul international routes, which require the most coordination, will be the last to bounce back. Therefore, demand for narrowbody aircraft is expected to recover quite a bit faster while widebody demand will remain challenged for a longer period.  
As we move forward, testing mechanisms, progress on vaccine distribution and coordinated government interactions will be key drivers of the recovery. We will continue working with the industry through our Confident Travel Initiative. Industry and academic studies continue to demonstrate that with multiple layers of protection, including HEPA filters, enhanced cleaning procedures and the use of personal face coverings, that the risk of transmission while flying is quite low.  
Collaboration between governments is an important element for implementing new screening protocols, which can even further reduce the risk of transmission.  
In the commercial services market, we saw modest incremental demand improvement in the fourth quarter. Although we are starting to see some stability, the recovery has been slow and we continue to anticipate will take multiple years to reach our previous demand levels. Accelerated retirements will also result in newer fleets when we emerge from the pandemic. That will reduce service demand and prolong their recovery.  
Given the challenging environment, managing liquidity continues to be vital to the aerospace industry to bridge us to recovery. Despite the unprecedented situation, there generally continues to be liquidity in the market for our customers and for Boeing.  
Financiers and investors understand the long-term value proposition of aircraft and the fundamental need to connect the world. And this has been demonstrated by the broad global interest in the space and the new entrants into the market over the past several years.  
We supported the COVID relief and stimulus packages passed by Congress last year and similar efforts underway globally. These relief programs, including access to financing, have been helpful to our customers as well as a number of our suppliers. And we believe that support will help enable a faster recover -- recovery for the industry as we are navigating the pandemic.  
As we see airlines adapt to these market realities, product differentiation and versatility will be key. Our product lineup remains well positioned to meet our customer needs and support airline plans to gain efficiencies and reach emission goals.  
For example, our digital solutions continue to provide important capabilities to our customers, as highlighted by Frontier Airlines' recent decision to sign a 10-year digital services agreement with us for their fleet. Our attractive portfolio and the diversity of our backlog provide a strong foundation as we prepare to recover and grow in the future.  
Now let's turn to commercial airplane production rates on Slide 4. We're closely coordinating with our customers to understand their fleet needs while monitoring the broader market environment to ensure we're aligning supply with demand. Let me provide some key updates across our programs.  
Starting with the 787 program. As we've shared, we're conducting comprehensive inspections on undelivered airplanes, both in Everett and in South Carolina. Since last quarter, we've expanded the scope of those inspections, including work done at our supplier partners. Our assessment shows that none of the issues identified represent safety of flight concerns. Nevertheless, we remain committed to taking the time to ensure each airplane meets our rigorous engineering specifications. And although this work has a near-term impact for us, in terms of both schedule and cost, it is the right thing to do. And we continue to be in coordination with the FAA and our customers throughout the process.  
Transparency is clear. Through our analysis, we've been able to determine the resolution for the majority of previously identified areas, including our major join sections. In some cases, this requires inspections and rework, while in other areas, no further action is required. We've made good progress and are now completing analysis on a few remaining areas to validate the next steps.  
As we see it today, this work may take a few more weeks, but we will provide our engineers the time they need to complete that analysis. We are implementing changes in the production process to ensure newly built airplanes meet our specifications and do not require further inspection. This is consistent with our determination to eliminate rework from our production system to position us on stronger footing when the market recovers.  
We're looking forward to resuming 787 deliveries to our customers. But as I discussed, there's still work to be done. Based on what we know today, we expect 787 deliveries to resume later this quarter. However, it will be back-end loaded with no delivery this month and most likely very few, if any, in February.  
Also, based on what we know today, we still expect to deliver the vast majority of the 787 aircraft inventory by the end of the year. We will keep you updated on the progress.  
As we've previously shared, given the widebody market environment, we're in the process of transitioning to a rate of 5 per month in March, at which point, 787 final assembly will be consolidated to Boeing South Carolina.  
On the 777, 777X programs, we now anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. This schedule and the financial impact to the program this quarter reflect a number of factors, including an updated assessment of global certification requirements, the latest assessment of COVID-19 impacts on market demand and discussions with our customers with respect to delivery timing.  
We're working closely with global regulators on all aspects of the 777X development. This involves listening to all their feedback and applying lessons learned from our experiences on the 737 MAX program recertification and applying to our 777X certification plan. It also involves making prudent design modifications as necessary to meet the various global regulators' expectations.  
As part of our assessment, we've made the decision to implement certain modifications to the aircraft design. Our decision to make these modifications, which will involve firmware and hardware changes to the actuator control electronics, reflects our current judgment of global regulators' compliance expectations. This decision has led to these revised schedule assumptions.  
COVID-19 has had a significant impact on passenger traffic, particularly international long-haul routes serviced by large widebodies such as the 777X, which has shifted the anticipated replacement wave and overall demand for widebody airplanes to the right. Additionally, the challenging business climate is impacting our 777X customers.  
These broader market factors, coupled with our conversations with our customers about preferred delivery timing, informed our current assumptions. As a result of these updated program assumptions, we booked a $6.5 billion pretax charge in the quarter, a significant component of which is driven by a reduction in the program's initial accounting quantity. Greg will go through the financial impact in greater detail a little later.  
Despite the challenges we and the industry are facing, we are confident in the 777X airplane and the unmatched capability it will offer our customers. With the most payload capacity and lowest operating cost per seat of any widebody, the 777X completes our market-leading widebody family with a distinct competitive advantage.  
Across the total widebody market of more than 8,000 projected deliveries over the next 2 decades, we see replacement demand for over 1,500 large widebody airplanes, which are well suited for the 777X. We also continue to see strong freighter demand and good delivery pace for our current 777 freighter.  Our production rate expectations for the combined 777, 777X program remains at 2 per month in 2021. We continue to assess our production plans to efficiently transition to the 777X.  
Turning now to the 737 program. We're currently producing at a low rate and expect to gradually increase the rate to 31 per month in early 2022. And we expect further gradual increases to correspond with market demand. We will continue to assess the delivery profile for 2021 as it will help inform our 737 production ramp -- our ramp plan, and we will continue to communicate transparently with our supply chain to ensure stability. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 3,300 aircraft in our 737 backlog. There's no change to our production rate plan for the 747 or the 767.  
The market continues to be dynamic, and we will monitor closely as we prudently balance supply and demand across all of our programs. Although this remains an unprecedented and uncertain time, we are confident air travel will return. And when it does, we will be ready to support our customers with a well-positioned family of airplanes.  
Now let's quickly look at our 2021 priorities on Slide 5. As you'll see, our priorities remain consistent. Navigating through this global pandemic and rebuilding stronger on the other side continues to be a key focus, along with safely returning the 737 to service worldwide, building on our efforts over the past 2 years.  
We remain committed to working closely with all of our stakeholders to rebuild trust one day at a time, one airplane at a time. And we'll do that by living our values, demonstrating transparency every step of the way and delivering on our commitments. As part of our continued commitment to safety, we recently announced our first Chief Aerospace Safety Officer. 
Consistent with these values is our focus on sustainability. We continue to make great strides in our efforts, innovating and operating to make the world better. We achieved net carbon -- net 0 carbon emissions at our manufacturing and work sites in 2020 by expanding conservation and renewable energy use while tapping into responsible offsets for the remaining greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, we've committed that our commercial airplanes will be capable and certified to fly on 100% sustainable aviation fuels by 2030.  
Operational excellence is about how we work to deliver safe products and services to our customers while continuously striving for first-time quality. We are also taking steps to restore the health of our production system. As we calibrate our production rates to the market impacts of COVID-19, we're taking the opportunity to implement quality, workplace safety and productivity improvement projects to bring stability to our factories. And as Greg will cover later, this also extends to our engagement with suppliers.  
And last but not least, we will not lose sight of our future and the innovations that will reshape air travel. We continue to invest in our areas that are critical to our business, focusing on design practices and manufacturing technology that will position us for growth.  
We're also continuing to invest in our people. We recently announced that we will be providing most of our employees a onetime stock grant that will vest in 3 years as we recover and grow the business.  
To close, our guiding principle here is that every decision we must -- that we make must help us navigate through this difficult period while not diminishing our future competitiveness. We will take action to protect our business and our people by closely managing liquidity and driving lasting transformational change to make our business stronger and more resilient than ever.  
And with that, let me turn it over to Greg. Greg?"
370857,700364866,2182400,"The Boeing Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","The Boeing Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn now to Slide 6. Our revenue of $58.2 billion and core earnings per share of negative $23.25 reflected lower commercial delivery and service volume primarily due to COVID-19 as well as 787 product",2897,"Great. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn now to Slide 6. Our revenue of $58.2 billion and core earnings per share of negative $23.25 reflected lower commercial delivery and service volume primarily due to COVID-19 as well as 787 production issues, partially offset by lower 737 MAX customer consideration charges when compared to 2019.  
Full year earnings were also impacted by the $6.5 billion pretax charge on the 777X program, additional tax valuation allowance and abnormal production costs related to the 737 MAX program. Operating cash flow of negative $18.4 billion reflected lower commercial deliveries and service volume as well as timing of receipts and expenditures.  
With that, let's turn to Slide 7 for our fourth quarter results. Consistent with the full year results, revenue of $15.3 billion reflected lower commercial airplane deliveries and commercial service volume, partially offset by a lower 737 MAX customer consideration charge. Earnings in the quarter were also impacted by the charge on the 777X program, a $744 million charge related to the previously announced agreement between Boeing and the U.S. Department of Justice and 737 abnormal production costs.  
Income tax in the quarter reflected the impact of an additional valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets, partially offset by the 5-year net operating loss carryback provision in the CARES Act. The $2.5 billion of noncash valuation allowance booked in the quarter was based on the required accounting analysis to assess recoverability of our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income. This is an accounting assessment, which places a lot of weight on our recent losses leading to the charge this quarter.  
Important to note that this valuation allowance does not limit our ability to utilize deferred tax assets in the future periods. It does not change our outlook on future company results and has no impact on cash flows or future tax returns. When income generation returns to more normal levels, we can expect to see the allowance reverse and increase reported earnings.  
Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 8. Revenue was $4.7 billion driven by lower widebody delivery volume, partially offset by higher 737 deliveries and a lower 737 MAX customer consideration charge in the quarter compared to the same period last year. Operating margins declined driven by the charge on the 777X program, lower delivery volume and a $468 million of abnormal production costs related to the 737 program, again, partially offset by lower 737 MAX customer consideration charge.
As Dave mentioned, we began to receive regulatory approvals to resume 737 MAX operations in the fourth quarter, and we restarted 737 MAX deliveries in December last year. Last quarter, we shared with you that we had about 450 737 MAX aircraft built and stored in inventory. With deliveries of 27 aircraft in December and now 40 to date, this number has been reduced to approximately 410 aircraft in inventory. 
As we previously communicated, we expect to have to remarket some of these aircraft and potentially reconfigure them. Deliveries from storage will continue to be our priority after assisting our customers with their return to service as we continue to work closely with our customers based on their fleet needs. 
Our estimated timing of 737 deliveries from storage has not changed since last quarter. That said, we expect delivery timing and production rate ramp-up profile to continue to be dynamic given the pandemic. 
There are no material change to our estimate total abnormal costs of $5 billion. During the fourth quarter, we expensed $468 million of abnormal production costs, which brought the cumulative abnormal cost expensed to date to $2.6 billion. We expect the remainder of this cost to be expensed as incurred largely in 2021. 
Our assessment of the liability for estimated 737 MAX potential concessions and other considerations to customers and the expected cash impact timing did not change significantly in the fourth quarter from our previous assessment. Cumulatively, we've accrued a $9.6 billion liability for the estimated potential concessions and other considerations. 
To date, we've made $3.7 billion of payments to customers in cash and other forms of compensation, including $600 million we paid this quarter. We have settlement agreements covering approximately $3 billion of the remaining liability balance of $5 billion.  
Turning now to 787. As we've discussed, we continue to complete the inspections on our 787 program in our factories and in our supply chain. We have approximately 80 undelivered 787 aircraft in inventory. Based on what we know today, we anticipate that we will unwind the vast majority of these aircraft during '21 and are working with our customers to facilitate this.  
But as Dave mentioned, we still have some work ahead of us on this, and we will keep you posted on the progress. Our latest assessment of the financial impact of this effort and delivery delays have been included in our fourth quarter closing position.  
As we've previously disclosed, the 787 program has near breakeven gross margins due to the previously announced reductions in production rates and program accounting quantity. If we are required to further reduce the accounting quantity and/or production rates or experience other factors that could result in lower margin, the program could reach forward loss in future periods. However, on a cash basis, the 787 unit margin has held up relatively well even with these lower production rates, and many of the underlying productivity and profitability drivers remain in place.  
As Dave mentioned, we expect first delivery of the 777X to now occur in late 2023, and we recorded a $6.5 billion reach-forward loss on the program. Our decision to implement certain modifications to the aircraft design has added time to the schedule and result in additional costs.  
In addition to that factor, other key elements contributing to the reach-forward loss include the following: one, an updated assessment of the market demand and customers' preferences on delivery timing based on continued dialogue with our customers; two, resulting adjustments to planned production rates and reduction in program accounting quantity to 350 aircraft.  
As a reminder, initial accounting quantity doesn't represent the long-term potential size of the program. We see replacement demand for over 1,500 larger widebody aircraft, which will be well suited to the 777X. The approach we used to establish the accounting quantity is consistent with what we've used on other programs. And as part of our closing process, we always evaluate the initial accounting quantity on a quarterly basis even in program development to test that the program is not in a reach-forward loss position.  
And lastly, other cost elements include increased change in corporation costs along with associated customer and supply chain impacts. The combination of these factors created significant pressure on the 777X program's revenue and cost estimates, resulting in the reach-forward loss for the program.  
We still expect peak use of cash for the 777X program to be in 2020. The changes to the 777X program time line will result in some cash flow headwinds in '21 and '22. But we expect cash flow to improve as we get closer to EIS and begin deliveries in late '23. We anticipate the program to turn cash flow positive approximately 1 to 2 years after starting initial deliveries.  
Commercial Airplanes backlog included more than 4,000 aircraft valued at $282 billion. The decline in backlog in the fourth quarter reflected aircraft order cancellations and removal of aircraft orders from our backlog due to ASC 606 accounting standard, including our most recent assessment of 777X backlog due to the revised schedule.  
Given the significant headwinds that remain in the market, BCA margin progression will be highly dependent upon future production rates and will take time. However, we are taking action today to make foundational lasting change through our business transformation efforts in order to help offset those headwinds as much as possible.  
Let's now move to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 9. Fourth quarter revenue increased to $6.8 billion primarily driven by higher volume as well as a charge on the Commercial Crew program in the fourth quarter of 2019. Fourth quarter operating margins of 7.4% include $275 million pretax charge on the KC-46A Tanker program primarily due to production inefficiencies, including the impacts of COVID-19 disruption. We received $5 billion in orders in the quarter, including a contract for 2 KC-46A aircraft from Japan, AEW&C upgrades for the Republic of Korea Air Force and key proprietary space programs, bringing the backlog now to $61 billion.  
Let's now turn to Global Services results on Slide 10. In the fourth quarter, Global Services revenue declined to $3.7 billion driven by lower commercial services volume due to COVID-19. Operating margins decreased to 3.8% due to lower commercial service volume and $290 million of pretax charges related to asset impairments primarily to reflect the updated fleet retirement assumptions driven by COVID.  
During the quarter, BGS won key contracts worth approximately $7 billion, which brings its backlog now to $21 billion. Although we saw a slight uptick in commercial service demand in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect the recovery to take multiple years.  
We continue to position our services business for the future, taking actions to rightsize our operations. In addition, we are shaping our portfolio to ensure that we have the right solutions to help our customers and industry navigate the downturn and prepare for market recovery. The result of our efforts have already started to positively impact our operating margin performance.  
Let's now turn to cash flow on Slide 11. The disruption caused by COVID-19 on our airlines and global economy continues to put significant pressure on our cash receipts. Operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $4 billion driven by lower commercial airplane delivery volume, advanced payment timing and commercial service volume.  
Let's now move to Slide 12 to discuss our liquidity position. We continue to proactively manage our cash position and assess our liquidity throughout this pandemic. We ended the fourth quarter with strong liquidity, including $25.6 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet and have access to our $9.5 billion bank credit facility, which remains undrawn as well continued access to capital markets. Our debt balance at the end of the quarter was $63.6 billion, reflecting our $4.9 billion bond issuance as well as debt repayments in the quarter.  
As we've discussed previously, we've been taking many actions to enhance liquidity, including suspending our dividend; reducing discretionary spending; matching 401(k) contributions in stock, prefunding pension with stock; and most recently, awarding most of our employees a onetime stock grant that will vest in 3 years in lieu of merit increases this year. These actions reflect our continued derisking strategy and are part of our balanced approach to ensuring we're proactively meeting our obligations.  
We worked hard in the past to maintain disciplined cash management while seeking opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet, and we will continue to do so. Once cash flow generation returns to more normal levels, reducing our debt levels will be a key focus area.  
We believe we currently have sufficient liquidity and are not planning to increase our debt levels. However, we will continue to actively manage our balance sheet, including refinancing debt maturities. 
Our investment-grade credit rating is important to us, and we'll continue to consider all aspects of our capital structure to strengthen our balance sheet.  
Let's turn to the next slide. As we look forward into '21, I'd like to provide you with some insight into some of the key drivers, which are informed by the current market recovery expectations and customer discussions to date. 2021 will continue to be a challenging year. That said, we expect upward trends from 2020.  
Based on what we know, we'd expect to see 2021 revenue improve from 2020. This will be driven mainly by higher 737 and 787 deliveries as we plan to unwind inventory and deliver from the production lines.  
We expect BDS to generate low to single-digit growth in '21 revenue compared to 2020. Excluding onetime events, we anticipate modest revenue growth.  
As for BGS, while we anticipate solid growth in our government services business in '21, our commercial services will continue to be challenged due to COVID-19 impacts. [ We expect ] BGS revenue to be relatively stable '21 versus 2020.  
On the P&L side, we also expect improvement in '21 primarily driven by higher commercial deliveries, absence of 2020 charges, improved performance and benefits from continued business transformation efforts. These impacts will be primarily offset by higher interest expense. Also [indiscernible] BCA will continue to book significant abnormal production costs for the 737 program in 2021.  
Moving to cash flow. We continue to expect 2021 operating cash to be much improved from 2020 driven mainly by inventory burn down associated with 737 and 787 programs. While higher deliveries will be a tailwind, the timing of advanced payments and burn down of excess advance payments, along with 737 customer settlement payments and higher interest payments, will continue to be headwinds. The revised 777X schedule also creates headwind to our current cash profile versus our prior assumptions.  
Bringing this all together, based on what we know today, we continue to expect 2021 to still be a use of cash and to be cash flow positive in 2022. We expect cash improvements from '21 to '22 to be driven by continued improvement on the 737 program due to lower customer considerations and higher delivery payments as well as commercial services. 
And as I just outlined, our commercial delivery volume is a key driver for improvements from 2020 to 2021. Therefore, the drivers clearly hinge on the pace of commercial market recovery. Given the dynamic environment, we will continue to diligently work opportunities and monitor risk factors and keep you posted on further developments. 
Now let's move to the last slide. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken prudent and decisive action to get ahead, to preserve cash so that we can navigate this crisis and also reshape our business so that we can emerge as a sharper, resilient, leaner enterprise. In addition to taking actions to derisk our portfolio and bolster liquidity, we have also made operational changes to lower our production rates and adjust our workforce to align with the new market reality. 
We have taken production rates for the 787 and 777 programs down by approximately half due to COVID impact and also moderated the ramp of the 737 production rate. We continue to take steps to reach our previously shared plan to bring our overall staffing levels to approximately 130,000 by the end of '21. 
As you know, we are progressing through extensive business transformation efforts that are introduced [ some ] quarters ago. The financial objectives we've established are measured in billions of dollars, and we expect them to be executed over a multiyear period. 
We expect the majority of our efforts will result in enduring lasting changes that will enable us to be more efficient in the long term, laying the foundation for recovery, future margin expansion and cash flow generation as the market recovers. A combination of all of our actions in 2020 helped us generate more than $10 billion of liquidity, which was [indiscernible] as we navigate this very challenging environment. Approximately half of our transformation efforts are focused on reducing structural costs versus variable. 
We continue to make progress across all 5 pillars as we utilize a low production rate environment to transform and improve our business processes. Projects to improve operational stability, implement first-time quality initiatives shape our portfolio with core markets, simplify our organizational structure and reduce bureaucracy are all examples of efforts meant to create meaningful and lasting change to how we operate as well as our cost structure. 
Through our portfolio and investment prioritization, we reduced R&D and CapEx by $1.3 billion in '20  from prior year. We also took out over $1 billion of indirect [indiscernible] reducing expenditures in areas such as freight logistics, purchase, services [indiscernible]. 
And as part of our footprint optimization, we sold or closed over 240,000 square [indiscernible] [ over the next year ]. There are a number of other initiatives [indiscernible]. 
While we talk often about our transformation at the operational production level, every support organization in our company is on this journey. Our team, the human resources, finance, IT and more are all recalibrating their structures and operating models to simplify processes, eliminate unnecessary spending, reduce bureaucracy and improve long-term performance and competitiveness. 
For example, we have been [indiscernible] providing opportunities to form or expand strategic partnerships with vendors that allow us to simplify and optimize our operations and reduce overall costs. We're also evolving the way we work with our [ 12,000 ] suppliers. This began with our Boeing supplier [indiscernible], which expanded [indiscernible] can strengthen the relationship, yield improvement in quality, affordability, performance, on-time delivery.

Our world, our industry, our business and our communities were facing unprecedented challenges, and we're still in the midst of it. 
In addition to navigating COVID-19, we also made important progress on the 737 as we engage transparently and comprehensively with regulators, government leaders, customers, suppliers and our teams. Having done that, we'll be that much more prepared for airplane certification efforts going forward. 
The return to service of the 737 was a key step for us as we make fundamental changes to how we operate and rebuild trust one airplane, one interaction, one day at a time. I'm proud of our team, and I thank them for the resilience and dedication that they've demonstrated as we've navigated through this really difficult moment together. 
2021 is an inflection point for our industry and certainly for Boeing. We have been through tough times before. We know how to overcome challenges and to adapt, and we will stand by our customers throughout this process. Driven by our values and with a focus on quality, safety, integrity and transparency, we will emerge from this moment stronger, more competitive for the long term. 
And with that, Greg and I will be happy to take a few questions. Thank you."

And then, of course, we talked about change in corp costs for the aircraft that are currently built as well as we'll have the rate much lower through this period between now and '23 and the change in corp associated with those.

On the 787, as I mentioned, even at these low rates on a unit basis, cash is pretty good. And that's the efforts of the past for sure and having a good product mix between 8s, 9s and 10s. And again, that's going to go up with volume. And that's obviously not taken into consideration the advances that will come with that increased volume on both of those programs. But by far, those are the 2 single drivers to the cash flow positive and particularly in '22 and beyond. 
And then beyond that, it's the 777X as we talked about, getting out of use of cash and into positive cash as I just mentioned. Those 3 elements, again, are going to be key to the cash trajectory between now and '23 and '24 and beyond."

I think on the delivery profile, certainly, we've got a delivery profile laid out in detail for the balance of the year and going into '22 and '23. We don't see any reduction taking place there, as Dave indicated, on the production rates that we've established, not only delivering out of inventory which, as you know, is our priority 1, but also increasing those rates as we go forward. 
So that profile continues in delivering off, like I said, the backlog, but also delivering off the inventory that we've got in the ramp. And I don't know whether it was picked up earlier or not, but all the deliveries we've had to date, the 40 aircraft have all come out of inventory. 
So again, it will be a combination, but the priority will continue to be on those inventory aircraft. So we see strong demand for the aircraft and again, tied to the recovery.

I don't think they're going to play into it anywhere near the extent to which they used to simply because the demands on that propulsion system in the next go around I don't think are going to be as significant. And",267,"Yes. Well, engines always play into it. I don't think they're going to play into it anywhere near the extent to which they used to simply because the demands on that propulsion system in the next go around I don't think are going to be as significant. And now I'm just -- I'm going to, I think, speak to the industry and what I know they are capable of doing or not. 
So therefore, differentiation at the airframe level itself is really, really important in the next run, which means that these technologies that we are working with and trying to demonstrate to ourselves at scale with determinant assembly, those are the things that we'll differentiate. And believe it or not, that becomes the most important criteria for us with respect to announcing that next airplane. 
It's got to depend on these advanced technologies, and it will. So -- and I don't feel in any way, shape or form that 1 year or 2 years more in the market to learn more is going to hold us back in any way, shape or form or hurt The Boeing Company in any way, shape or form. So that's the perspective I'd put on it. 
Right now, we're getting no pressure, as you might imagine, from airlines to run forward as fast as we can. And that's a bit of a luxury on this subject. But the most important thing for me and the Boeing team is to get these underlying technologies proven, demonstrated at scale so that when we call that point design, we're ready and we'll deliver."

And to your point, I mean, we've taken that into consideration with the current rates that Dave talked about through that period. So the advanced time line associated with that is tied rate to how we see at least near term those production rates. So obviously, if we modify those in any way, it will have an impact on advances. But I would say separate from that, the delivery profile of 87 and 737 are going to be the biggest contributors to the growth of cash flow. 
Now certainly, advances will help as we get lead time away on rate increases, but delivery profile alone will be one of the more significant drivers. So as I said before, looking from the outside, watch the delivery profile on both of those programs in particular, and they'll align right to our cash flow profiles and projections we've had going forward. 
And then advances will be a little further out from this time period just because of the rate increases, particularly on the 37, as we burn off some of the X's advances. And then the advances on the 87 will be, again, tied to the rate increases beyond the '21, '22 frame."

And then when you get to the 87, the only wildcard that is more upside than downside is if there is a [ date, time ] if you will, with respect to the trade agreements between the United States and China. And the agreements are in place. It's just a question of whether the posture changes in any way that allows for that Phase 1 deal to move forward. 
It's a big plus for any administration in light of the number of jobs it supports in the United States, and so we're optimistic on that front. But if that panned out and panned out reasonably quickly, that's more up than down."

So it has been, and we continue to believe that we're going to have stable growth and admittedly at the lower end of the single digits. And that's the best guidance we can talk about because we do think there is pressure that will ultimately come down as a result of all the COVID spending here in the United States. 
But a large part of our business now is international markets. And the order activity in those international markets has pushed to the right somewhat and almost entirely because of COVID-related stuff, not because of any competitive issue one way or the other. 
So we still like our position because we have an awful lot of ongoing programs that the military and, of course, our defense bills have been kind to in each and every one of their moments. And this last bill was a good one for us in pretty much every respect. So it's hard to commit to a big uptick in any way on growth rates anytime soon in light of what I think are the pressures. 
The only other comment I would make is there's a big segment of work that we do in the classified world that is incredibly encouraging and incredibly important to us. And anyway, I believe not just for our defense world, but also ultimately derivative technologies for the commercial world that, that's going to be a big source of competitive advantage for Boeing. So we're high on it, but I'm very reticent to want to suggest the market is going to get any better or that we're going to differentiate ourselves any further than what we have been."

I hope you're all staying safe and healthy as we navigate this global pandemic. On behalf of Boeing, I want to share our heartfelt thoughts and support for those in India, who are coping with the devastating and deadly impact of this most recent COVID-19 surge. If we think back to where we were a year ago as the impact of COVID-19 began to unfold, it's been quite a year. 
While it has been challenging, we saw the U.S. industry and government come together to support one another like never before. And thankfully, we view 2021 as a critical inflection point for our industry and a proof point for those public investments. While a full recovery is still likely a few years away, we're seeing encouraging signs, including progress on vaccine distribution in many countries and domestic travel recovery in certain markets. I remind everyone at the outset, we never imagine vaccines would be developed and distributed this early in the pandemic. 
We continue to adapt to new ways of conducting our business and remain dedicated to supporting our teammates and their families as well as our customers and the communities where we operate. So let me start with an update on the business on the next chart. Starting with the 737 program. As all of you know, we have identified electrical issues in certain locations in the flight deck of select 737 MAX airplanes. We are finalizing the plans and documentation with the FAA to outline the process required for operators to return their airplanes to service. Upon approval by the FAA, we expect the work to take a few days per airplane. Approximately 100 in-service airplanes are impacted. We will complete this same work on airplanes in our inventory. We have also paused deliveries while we address these issues. which will make our April deliveries very light. At this time, we expect to catch up on deliveries over the balance of the year. 
We recognize and regret the impact this has had on our customers' operations and are focused on ensuring that their airplanes are ready for the summer season. More broadly, in the last several months, we've made important progress in safely returning the MAX to service worldwide. Since the FAA is ungrounding late last year, more than 165 countries have now approved the resumption of MAX operations. We've delivered more 85 MAX airplanes to customers. 21 airlines have returned their fleets to service, and we've safely flown more than 26,000 commercial flights, totaling more than 58,000 flight hours. We also recently received regulatory approval for the 8-200 variant of the 737, an important aircraft for our valued customer, Ryanair. We now assume that the remaining non-U.S. regulatory approvals will occur this year with approval in China, most likely now in the second half of the year. As always, we will continue to work with the global regulators and follow their lead in the steps ahead. 
Our first priority remains assisting our customers with returning their parked fleet to service. More than 1/3 of the previously parked fleet is now flying revenue-generating flights. We're also honored and encouraged by the orders from Southwest Airlines, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines in the quarter, along with an order last week from Dubai Aerospace Enterprise and the trust our customers are placing in Boeing and in the 737 family. These orders underscore our customers' commitment to continued modernization of their fleets with 737 airplanes that enable operational efficiencies, such as improved fuel burn, which reduces carbon emissions, quieter engines that benefit the communities they serve and excellent dispatch reliability to support on-time operations. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 3,200 aircraft in our 737 backlog. We're currently producing at a low rate and expect to gradually increase the rate to 31 per month in early 2022, with further gradual increases corresponding with market demand. We will continue to assess the production rate plan as we monitor the market environment and engage in customer discussions. The timing of remaining regulatory approvals will also determine our delivery plans and shape our production ramp-up. We will continue to communicate transparently with our supply chain to ensure readiness and stability. 
Turning to the 787 program. We resumed deliveries in March following rigorous testing and analysis and are closely coordinating with our customers. We will follow the FAA -- or the FAA has been involved every step of the way in this process. We've delivered a total of 9 787s since restarting deliveries last month with potentially a couple more by the end of this week. Based on what we know today, we still expect to deliver the majority of the 787 aircraft currently in inventory by the end of the year. We will closely monitor the market environment and keep you updated on delivery progress. 
As we previously communicated, in March, we consolidated the 787 final assembly to Boeing South Carolina, which went smoothly. Also, we transitioned to a low production rate of 5 by the end of the quarter. On the 777X program, we're working closely with global regulators on all aspects of development, including our rigorous test program. Our team remains focused on executing this comprehensive series of tests to demonstrate the safety and the reliability of the airplanes design, and we're pleased with the progress that we've made to date. We're also providing regular updates to our customers and still anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur late in 2023. 
As planned, we are transitioning the combined 777, 777X production rate to 2 per month. We also continue to see strong freighter demand and are assessing our production plans to efficiently transition to the 777X. In addition to our commercial programs, we continue to deliver for our defense, space and services customers. As we reach these program milestones, we're firmly grounded and guided by our core values: safety, quality and integrity. 
Let me highlight a few of these accomplishments. Our defense, security and space team began production of the 7(a) Red Hawk Advanced trader and achieved first flight and delivery of the F-15 EX to the U.S. Air Force, with the second aircraft delivering just last week. On the KC-46A Tanker program, the U.S. Air Force has begun demonstrating limited operational use for air refueling as well as cargo and passenger airlift operations and has safely conducted over 1,400 missions over the last 6 months. We also successfully completed hot fire testing for NASA's space launch system, SLS ROCCAT. Additionally, our global services team delivered the 50th 737-800 Boeing converted freighter and inducted our first EA-18G Growler for the U.S. Navy modifications. We also continue to manage the COVID-19 disruption on our programs, including impacts to the VC-25B program, where employee clearance constraints impedes our ability to exchange mechanics when quarantines are required. 
In addition to operational and programmatic highlights, we've also maintained significant emphasis on sustainability across the company and are making great strides. We're enhancing our sustainability disclosures and planning to release our first-ever global equity diversity and inclusion report and our first integrated sustainability report later this year. Underscoring our commitment to the environment for the 11th year in a row, we're proud to have received the ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year award for sustained excellence and recognition of our company's successful energy conservation practices. 
Now let's turn to the next slide to discuss the industry environment. Our government services, defense and space businesses remain significant and relatively stable. While increased government spending on COVID-19 response is adding pressure to defense budgets in some countries, others are increasing spending on their security. Overall, the global defense market remains strong, and we continue to see solid global demand for our major programs. The strength of our defense portfolio is underscored by another strong quarter of BDS orders totaling $7 billion. The diversity of our portfolio will continue to help provide critical stability for us as we move forward. In the commercial market, we continue to see near-term market pressure due to COVID-19. However, many of our key long-term fundamentals remain intact. The recovery is gaining traction but remains uneven. We continue to anticipate the next 6 months will be very challenging for our airline customers and the entire industry. COVID-19 case rates are still high in many areas around the world and travel restrictions remain in place, putting significant pressure on passenger traffic, especially in those affected markets. We're seeing some positive momentum, particularly in domestic travel. Consistent with what we discussed in prior quarters, the domestic market is leading the recovery. And in some cases, it has slightly outpaced our expectations. February domestic traffic was 51% below 2019 levels. Since then, it has picked up in some regions, including the United States and China, and we anticipate continued momentum this spring. On the other hand, international operations remains extremely low, with February traffic still 89% below 2019, slightly behind our earlier expectations. 
Ongoing virus concerns and the absence of coordinated global policies on cross-border entry protocols have hindered the recovery in the international segment. Vaccine distribution remains the critical hurdle to a broad reopening. The active fleet is still around 3/4 of its previous size with single-aisle activity levels slightly above twin aisle. And although utilization rates and load factors are increasing in some areas, they are still below historic levels, which means airlines are flying less than 60% of their normal capacity at the global level. Regional dynamics such as case rates, government travel policies continue to influence passenger traffic and drive an uneven recovery profiles all around the world. 
The U.S. and China domestic markets are showing resilience with pent-up demand. U.S. airlines are seeing a significant increase in bookings for domestic and leisure routes. TSA throughput in April has been the highest we've seen since the onset of the pandemic with daily averages of approximately 1.4 million passengers, around 60% of 2019 levels. However, passenger traffic in other parts of the world, such as Europe and parts of Latin America, remains significantly lower due to new strains of the virus, lower vaccine penetration and uncertainty about government reopening plans. As expected, the number of aircraft being retired from the active fleet keeps growing, with around 1,500 airplanes retired or announced to be removed since the onset of the pandemic. We anticipate this trend will continue as our customers focus on retiring their oldest and least efficient airplanes and replacing them with new airplanes that will be as much as 25% to 40% more fuel-efficient with commensurate emission improvements. 
The freighter market remains another bright spot with cargo traffic in February, 9% higher than 2019. Yields have remained very high and more freighters are flying than before the pandemic due to limited belly cargo capacity from passenger airplanes. Over the long run, cargo demand will continue to be driven by global trade and GDP growth. Progress on vaccine dissemination and domestic passenger traffic in many countries continue to support our medium-term outlook and our belief in the long-term strength of the market. As we've shared previously and consistent with IATA and other industry groups, we expect passenger traffic to return to 2019 levels in 2023 to 2024. We still see the recovery in 3 phases. First, domestic traffic; then, regional markets such as intra-Asia, intra-Europe and intra Americas flights; and then finally, long-haul international routes. Therefore, demand for narrow-body aircraft is expected to recover faster while widebody demand will remain challenged for a longer period. As we start to see positive signs in the resumption of domestic and international air travel, our confident travel initiative has continued to partner with airlines regulators, leading universities and medical experts around the world to demonstrate the safety of air travel. Our confidence in air travel has been substantiated by science testing and analysis based on the multilayered approach to keep our air crews and passengers safe no matter where they're seated in the aircraft cabin. 
We've also -- we're also working with governments and industry associations to help ensure when people decide to travel, they know what to expect. We encourage any new protocols that use data-driven risk-based approaches to minimize disease transmission risks between countries. Standardized and secure methods to verify traveler information should be part of any solution to safely expand the international travel. As we move forward testing mechanisms, progress on vaccine distribution and coordinated global interactions will be the key drivers of the recovery. We're also monitoring the global trade environment, in particular, U.S.-China relations, given the importance of the Chinese market to our near-term delivery profile as well as future orders, which influence future production rates. 
We will continue to engage with leaders in both countries to urge a productive dialogue, reiterating the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry. China represents 25% of the global growth in our industry over the next decade. In the commercial services market, we saw stable demand in the first quarter. We're seeing some rebound from the bottom, and we expect to see increased activity as airlines are preparing for the summer season. That said, we continue to anticipate it will take multiple years to reach previous demand levels and the recovery trajectory may be uneven. Additionally, accelerated retirements are lowering the age of the fleet, reducing services demand and prolonging the recovery for commercial services. On the liquidity front, managing liquidity continues to be vital for the aerospace industry until the market recovers. Despite the challenges And as we noted in our recently released current aircraft finance market outlook, there generally continues to be liquidity in the market for our customers to acquire new airplanes. In fact, 100% of Boeing deliveries in 2020 were financed by third parties. Financiers and investors understand the long-term value proposition of aircraft and the fundamental need to connect the world. As we see airlines adapt to these market realities, product differentiation and versatility will be key. Our product lineup is well positioned to meet our customer needs. 
As we navigate this difficult time, we're not losing sight of our future. We've taken great care to ensure we have the team, the resources and the investments necessary to meet our customer commitments, to drive our improvement initiatives and innovate for the long term. In addition to our work on our current programs, we're also advancing technology that will define our next chapter. We anticipate that our investments will lead to next-generation aircraft that offer higher performance while being more fuel-efficient and easier to maintain and easier to reconfigure. We will continue to take the right action to adapt to the market impact of COVID-19 and position our business for the future by closely managing our liquidity and while driving long-lasting change to make our business leaner, sharper and more sustainable. So with that, let me turn it over to Greg."
370857,710567395,2260865,"The Boeing Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","The Boeing Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's please turn to Slide 4. First quarter revenue decreased to $15.2 billion, primarily due to lower 787 deliveries and commercial services volume. This was partially offset by higher 737 deliveries and h",2349,"Great. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's please turn to Slide 4. First quarter revenue decreased to $15.2 billion, primarily due to lower 787 deliveries and commercial services volume. This was partially offset by higher 737 deliveries and higher KC-46A tanker revenue. Earnings in the quarter were also impacted by lower commercial airplane period costs, partially offset by lower tax benefits and higher interest expense. Income tax in the quarter primarily reflects a benefit from the impact of the pretax losses, largely offset by the adjustments to the valuation allowance and true-ups to the tax benefits recorded in 2020. 
Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. Revenue was $4.3 billion, driven by lower 787 deliveries, partially offset by higher 737 volume. Although Commercial Airplanes operating margin continued to be under pressure. They performed in the quarter -- they improved in the quarter, excuse me, due to higher 737 deliveries, lower abnormal production costs compared to the same period in prior year and the absence of the first quarter 2020 charge related to the 737 NG Pickle Fork repair costs. 
We delivered 58 737 MAX airplanes in the first quarter. We currently have approximately 400 737 MAX aircraft built and stored in inventory. As we  previously  communicated, we expect to have to remarket some of these aircraft and potentially reconfigure them. As you've seen by the recent orders, we are making good, steady progress on the remarketing effort. You may also recall right before the 737 MAX return to service we estimated that around half of the approximate 450 aircraft we had in storage would be delivered by the end of '21 and the majority of the remaining by the end of the following year. That estimate is unchanged. 
Through the first quarter, we have delivered 85 737 aircraft from storage. And as Dave mentioned, the recent delivery pause will impact our April deliveries. We expect delivery timing and the production rate ramp-up profile remained dynamic, given the market environment, customer discussions and the remaining global regulatory approvals. There is no material change in our estimated for total 737 abnormal costs of $5 billion. 
During the first quarter, we expensed $568 million of abnormal production costs, which brought the cumulative abnormal cost expense to date to $3.1 billion. We expect the remainder of these costs to be expensed as incurred largely in 2021. Our assessment of the liability for estimated 737 MAX potential concessions and other considerations to customers as well as the expected cash impact timing did not change significantly in the first quarter from our prior assessment. Cumulatively, we've accrued a $9.3 billion liability for the estimated potential concessions and other considerations. To date, we've reduced the liability by $4.9 billion through cash payments to customers and other forms of compensation, including $1.2 billion we paid this quarter. We have settlement agreements covering approximately $2.5 billion of the remaining liability balance of $4.4 billion. 
Turning now to 787. As we discussed, we resumed deliveries in March. We currently have approximately 100 787 airplanes and inventory. Based on what we know today, we still anticipate that we will deliver the majority of these airplanes during 2021. We are working with our customers to facilitate deliveries and continue to monitor the international long-haul recovery as we assess our delivery plans. Our latest assessment of the financial impact related to the inspections and the delivery delays has been included in our first quarter closing position. As we've previously disclosed, the 787 program has near breakeven gross margins due to previously announced reductions in production rates and program accounting quantity. If we are required to further reduce the accounting quantity and/or production rates or experience other factors that result in lower margins, the program could record a reach forward loss in future periods. 
However, on a cash basis, the 787 unit margin has held up relatively well, even at lower production rates as many underlying profitability drivers remain intact. 
Moving now to 777X. As Dave mentioned, we still expect first delivery of the 777X to occur in late 2023, and we are making good progress on our flight test efforts. We still expect that peak use of cash for 777X program was in 2020 and that cash flow will improve as we get closer to EIS and begin deliveries in late '23. We anticipate the program to turn cash flow positive approximately 1 to 2 years after the first delivery. Given the significant headwinds that remain in the market, BCA margin progression will be highly dependent upon future production rates and will take time. However, we continue to take appropriate action to make foundational lasting change through our business transformation efforts in order to help offset those headwinds as much as possible. 
Let's now move to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 6. First quarter revenue increased to $7.2 billion and first quarter operating margins increased to 5.6%, primarily driven by higher KC-46A tanker revenue and the absence of charges related to the program in prior period, partially offset by a pretax charge of $318 million on the VC-25B program, which was largely due to COVID impact and performance issues at our supplier. We received $7 billion in orders in the quarter, including contracts for 27 KC-46A tanker aircraft to the U.S. Air Force, 11 P8 Poseidon aircraft to the U.S. Navy and Royal Australian Air Force and 6 Bell Boeing V-22 OSP rotorcraft to the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force holding the backlog steady at $61 billion. 
Let's now turn to Global Services results on Slide 7. In the first quarter, Global Services revenue declined to $3.47 billion and operating margins decreased to 11.8%, both driven by lower commercial services volume due to COVID-19. No notable asset impairments were booked in the quarter. 
During the quarter, BGS won key contracts worth approximately $3 billion, resulting in backlog of approximately $20 billion. While services demand was relatively flat in comparison to fourth quarter 2020, we expect the quarterly revenue trend to improve as we support increased airline operations and more airplanes are flying as travel recovers. That said, given the dynamic environment, we can expect to see revenue trajectory vary from quarter-to-quarter. Despite the challenging environment, we continue to position our services business for the future and are evaluating our portfolio to ensure that we have the right solutions to help our customers and industry navigate the downturn and prepare for market recovery. These efforts are starting to take hold and positively impact our operating margin performance. 
Let's now turn to cash flow on Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the quarter improved to negative $3.4 billion, reflecting the timing of receipts and expenditures and higher 737 deliveries, partially offset by lower 787 deliveries and lower advanced payments. 
Let's move now to Slide 9, discuss our liquidity position. We continue to proactively manage our cash position and assess our liquidity through the pandemic. We ended the first quarter with strong liquidity, including $21.9 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet and access to $14.8 billion from our newly increased bank credit facilities, which remain undrawn. We also continue to have access to the capital markets. Our debt balance remained stable at $63.6 billion at the end of the quarter. As part of our ongoing prudent liquidity actions, we refinanced $9.8 billion of our delayed draw term loan, that was due in early '22 and expanded our revolving credit facility by $5.3 billion. These liquidity-enhancing activities are in addition to the many actions we have discussed before, including suspending our dividend, reducing discretionary spending, matching 401(k) contributions in stock, pre-funding pension with stock and awarding most of our employees a onetime stock grant that will best in 3 years in lieu of a merit increase. These actions reflect our continued derisking strategy and are part of our balanced approach to ensure we proactively meet future obligations. We worked hard in the past to maintain disciplined cash management while seeking opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet, and we will continue these efforts. 
Once cash flow generation returns to more normal levels, reducing our debt level will be our top priority. We believe we currently have sufficient liquidity and are not planning to increase our debt levels. However, we will continue to actively manage our balance sheet. Our investment-grade credit rating is important to us, and we will continue to consider all aspects of our capital structure to strengthen our balance sheet. 
Let's turn now to the next slide to summarize. Our business environment remains dynamic. And while the commercial market recovery is gaining some traction and has been uneven and the path ahead is far from certain. We will continue to diligently work opportunities and monitor risk factors, including vaccination pace and case rates along with passenger traffic recovery and remaining 737 MAX regulatory approvals, and U.S.-China relations. As Dave mentioned, we're still awaiting 737 MAX regulatory approval from China, and the timing of it will affect our 737 delivery plan. China is an important market for our commercial airplanes and order activity from China will affect our future production rates. 
As we've discussed, even as our industry begins to recover, we anticipate '21 will be another challenging year. However, based on what we know today, we still expect revenue, earnings and operating cash to improve from 2020. Commercial deliveries will continue to be the single biggest driver across all financial metrics. 
Revenue improvement from 2020 to 2021 will be driven mainly by higher 737 and 787 deliveries as we plan to unwind inventory and deliver from the production lines. Consistent with what we shared last quarter, we also expect improvement to our bottom line from 2020 to '21, primarily driven by higher commercial deliveries, absent of 2020 charges improved performance and benefits from continued business transformation actions. These impacts will be partially offset by higher interest expense. Also, bear in mind that our commercial business will continue to book significant abnormal production costs for the 737 program in '21. Similar to our revenue and earnings trajectories, we continue to expect 2021 operating cash flow to be much improved from 2020, driven by -- mainly by inventory burn down associated with 737 and 787 programs. While higher deliveries will be a tailwind, the timing of advanced payments and the burn down of access advanced payments along with 737 customer settlement payments and higher interest payments will continue to be headwinds. We expect the first quarter was the most challenging quarter from a cash perspective, and we expect the trend improve for the remainder of the year as we ramp up 87 and 737 deliveries in subsequent periods. However, there could be some timing variation quarter-over-quarter, so quarterly trajectory could be uneven. As discussed, our cash flow profile is heavily dependent upon obtaining the remaining 737 MAX regulatory approvals, the commercial market recovery and ongoing discussions with our customers on their fleet planning needs. In aggregate, we continue to expect 2021 to be a use of cash. We expect that continued improvement on the 737 MAX program due to lower customer considerations and higher delivery payments as well as recovery in commercial services will enable us to turn positive cash flow in 2022. The key watch items that I highlighted earlier will be the differentiator in our outlook trajectory. Given the dynamic environment, we continue to monitor the risks and opportunities to ensure we're well positioned for the future. Over the past year, we've been keeping you updated on our extensive business transformation effort. We're continuing to closely examine all aspects of our operations to simplify and streamline everything we do and take billions of dollars out of our operating costs while driving our key efforts in safety, quality and performance. 
We're doing this now so that we can emerge a leaner, sharper and more resilient company as the market recovers and production rate increases in the future. We'll continue to execute a widespread set of changes over a multiyear period. I'm pleased with the strong progress we have shown in 2020 that is carried into '21 and is gaining momentum. We expect the majority of our efforts will result in lasting change that will drive long-term productivity, future margin expansion and cash flow generation as our market continues to recover. And as we take action, we're ensuring that every step only further drives key efforts in safety, quality and delivering on our commitments. We have a dedicated team focused on these efforts embedded in every business unit function to ensure we're continually improving every aspect of our operations. This is an enduring effort that our entire leadership team is committed to driving forward in the future. 
And finally, as you know, last week, I shared my intent to retire from Boeing in July. I want to take a moment to thank the 140,000 great people at Boeing and all of our partners who have made my 30 years at the company, so special. It has been a true honor and a privilege to work alongside all of you. I will cherish the relationships that I've been very fortunate to have here and over the years, and those include all of you in the financial community that had the opportunity to get to know so well over the last decade and beyond. 
At Boeing, I've been inspired every day by the incredible technology, products and services we bring to the world. And while it's our products and our mission to get you excited, it's the great people at Boeing that make it all possible, and it is the people that I will miss the most. 
Over the next few months, I will be solely focused on a smooth transition of my responsibilities and then on to the next chapter in my career. I will always be cheering on Dave and the entire Boeing team from the sidelines. I'm confident in the long-term market opportunity ahead, the Boeing Company itself and the team behind it. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dave for some closing comments."

Thanks to Greg's efforts, Boeing has also has had the benefit of very solid teams across the function that he oversees. People have gotten to know quite well. As we build on Greg's legacy, we're not searching for a new strategic direction. We will engage in a comprehensive and thoughtful search process for a world-class executive with the talent and skills commensurate with the high level Greg has set. This process will encompass executives within Boeing and across the external market. We're well positioned for the future, and we will continue to transform our business to not just navigate through this pandemic, but to ensure that we emerge stronger and more resilient for the long term. While there's no question that COVID-19 has had a profound impact on our industry, we view this year as a key inflection point and as positive signs begin to emerge. As governments around the world accelerate vaccine distribution, people are getting back to work and global economies are beginning to get back to business. And as they do, we are proud of our role in enabling travel to connect people, to connect businesses and importantly, to connect cultures. As we face into the challenges at hand, we remain steadfast in our commitment to quality, safety, integrity and transparency. Through it all, I am proud of how our team continues to stay focused on our customers and their important missions, and I'm confident in our future. With that, Greg and I will be happy to take your questions."

But also as we've talked about, under the umbrella business transformation, we've been really -- as we've been in this period, we've been challenging all aspects of the business and looking for opportunities to streamline, but at the same time, never lose inside the future. So as you've seen from as what we posted last year, we continue to make significant investments in the business, and we will. But at the same time, we're going to still stay very focused on the business transformation efforts that should help continue to help that trajectory as we see the market improve and then our ability to increase production rates associated with that improved market.

And it's been particularly true on narrowbodies. 
So when you look at the situation today, The MAX, obviously has been held back. There's still a large market for it. But Airbus has been delivering a lot of neos. They have a big backlog. On the last call, we talked a little bit about the 321 XLR So when you look forward now, how important is market share? Do you think about that? Is that number for narrowbodies important?

I'm simply from this point forward, going to try to hold our own with respect to what I think is our rightful share.

So It's all a question over what period of time do you want to measure it? I'm confident that over a longer period of time, we'll get back to where we need to get to. And I'm confident in the product line always have been and continue to be. And I think some of the recent activity suggests that. When you look at the applications that were actually put in our airplanes to work for, I think we're in a pretty decent place. So it's a great question, though."

And I'm confident that it will and that we will get over those gaps. But it's uncertain in a lot of countries around the world. And then the final and very important strides is we've got to reinstate our trade relationship in aerospace with China. That's a big part of the market long term. It's important that we get our share -- our fair share of that market, which historically has always been at 50%, a little more when you consider all the wide-body activity. And we need to get back to that stage. I believe that will happen, but it's going to take a little time."

Outside of that, like I said, cash -- unit cash basis, programs really doing a great job and really holding up well at a very low rate. And again, that's a testament to all the hard work that's gone on over the years on stabilizing the factory and the operations and the productivity initiatives. So you're seeing the benefit of that.

As far as you're measuring this in days as far as the amount of rework required, but we're taking whatever time it takes to get the work done in station and completed per our spec.

And we're going to hold that rate for as long as we can depending on customers and their ability to get in and take deliveries. It's -- again, as I said before, the trick in this one is the logistics of all of the customers coming in and out and then how we move these planes through position. The applied work itself, that's pretty clear, and it's getting more productive every day. So we're in a pretty good place on that front."

So it's, again, laid out in detail, but it's not exactly the same month over month or quarter-over-quarter. So all that's going to play in. But look, everybody is working extremely hard, obviously, to meet our commitments to our customers get these aircraft reworked appropriately and then, of course, get to continue the delivery and the same thing on the 737. And that's what's going to get us to a better profile by the end of the year. But I'd expect it to be lumpy quarter-over-quarter between and particularly the second and third quarter and then some, I think, on a better trajectory in the fourth quarter."

Dave, a question for you. So I just want to follow up on Myles' question. You've talked a lot about business transformation. What's the end state? And ultimately, how does engineering fit into that vision? Because to be fair, 73 had issues, 78 had issues, 777X had issues, 747-8 had issues, KC-46 has issues. Air Force 1 now has issues and the Star Liner has issues. So how does business transformation fix that?"

So the idea that we fix everything, I'm not sure I can sign up for that. The idea that we're going to be a whole lot better, I can sign up for it. And the work we've done to align our engineering function broadly, everybody inside the company has signed up for that endeavor and feels great about it. The work we've done with respect to the safety management system that surrounds that engineering function and which they lead into half of the company. It avails  itself to new data to a faster cycle time with respect to how our company processes that data and ultimately makes decisions around that data. And a reinvestment in the fundamental design practices of the company that will instill disciplines that we just need to get better and better at. And Everybody in the company signed up to do this, and we're making real investments in that process. So I feel very, very, very good about all of that. And it will -- it does not mean that in a flight test somewhere along the way, we don't run into an issue that needs to get resolved. And so it is the nature of our industry to do big things and do them very well. 
So anyway, I'm confident that these transformation efforts are significant. I'm also confident on this production stability, which goes hand-in-hand with engineering. We've taken actions over this really hard actions over this course of this year to stop things when we see an issue and get them fixed once and for all. And the 87 in Q1 was a glaring example of that. These fit and finish issues with respect to the joints in our fuselages were just nagging problems, difficult problems. And we applied real engineering talent and expertise to that, new process controls, new lines of communication with our supply side. So we're not surprised by that stuff anymore, and we can eliminate rework loops that ultimately travel with the product. I could go on and on and on and on and on. But I think some of the signs should be very apparent to you and to our customers."

And what would be the implications of doing that. And as I said on the call that as we see it today, we don't see a need for additional liquidity.

So there's a lot that goes into this, but I think it's important that everyone understand, most often, when a new airplane is developed by either side, it is usually developed around a propulsion package that offers 15% to 20% improvement with respect to efficiency versus the one it's displacing. That's the way it's happened over a long period of time. I don't believe the next generation of engine can deliver that kind of performance. And then, therefore, whatever cost efficiency ultimately and whatever performance advantages are derived from the next airplane, in my view, we're going to come from the way it's engineered and the way it's manufactured, all with a focus on a lower cost per seat when we get it out to the marketplace. And yes, a more sustainable package with respect to environment. So that's what we all have to be focused on. I like the pressure that puts on the manufacturers. That means the technologies we deploy are our technologies. 
We've done an awful lot of fantastic work in our defense programs with respect to using engineering modeling and then manufacturing processes that tap that engineering modeling directly create parts that can be assembled in one motion with great efficiency. Secondly, we've invested, as you know, in composites in our platforms for a very, very long time the learning curves associated with getting efficient at composite development are significant. I believe Boeing has a huge advantage on that front. And so how we bring that engineering modeling, the composite development work that we've done over these years. And then quick, simple assembly like we've demonstrated with the trainer airplane and other defense programs. We have to do it at scale, and we have to prove to ourselves we can do it at scale. But in my view, those are going to be the advantages to that next airplane that gets developed. And I just love where Boeing is positioned on that front when the time comes."

I hope you're all staying safe and healthy as we navigate this global pandemic. On behalf of Boeing, I want to share our heartfelt thoughts and support for those in India, who are coping with the devastating and deadly impact of this most recent COVID-19 surge. 
If we think back to where we were a year ago as the impact of COVID-19 began to unfold, it's been quite a year. While it has been challenging, we saw the U.S. industry and government come together to support one another like never before. And thankfully, we view 2021 as a critical inflection point for our industry and a proof point for those public investments. While a full recovery is still likely a few years away, we're seeing encouraging signs, including progress on vaccine distribution in many countries and domestic travel recovery in certain markets. I remind everyone at the outset, we never imagine vaccines would be developed and distributed this early in the pandemic.
We continue to adapt to new ways of conducting our business and remain dedicated to supporting our teammates and their families as well as our customers and the communities where we operate. So let me start with an update on the business on the next chart. Starting with the 737 program. As all of you know, we have identified electrical issues in certain locations in the flight deck of select 737 MAX airplanes. We are finalizing the plans and documentation with the FAA to outline the process required for operators to return their airplanes to service. Upon approval by the FAA, we expect the work to take a few days per airplane. Approximately 100 in-service airplanes are impacted. We will complete this same work on airplanes in our inventory.
We have also paused deliveries while we address these issues. which will make our April deliveries very light. At this time, we expect to catch up on deliveries over the balance of the year. We recognize and regret the impact this has had on our customers' operations and are focused on ensuring that their airplanes are ready for the summer season. More broadly, in the last several months, we've made important progress in safely returning the MAX to service worldwide. Since the FAA's ungrounding late last year, more than 165 countries have now approved the resumption of MAX operations. We've delivered more -- 85 MAX airplanes to customers, 21 airlines have returned their fleets to service and we've safely flown more than 26,000 commercial flights, totaling more than 58,000 flight hours.
We also recently received regulatory approval for the 8-200 variant of the 737, an important aircraft for our valued customer, Ryanair. We now assume that the remaining non-U.S. regulatory approvals will occur this year, with approval in China most likely now in the second half of the year. As always, we will continue to work with the global regulators and follow their lead in the steps ahead.
Our first priority remains assisting our customers with returning their parked fleet to service. More than 1/3 of the previously parked fleet is now flying revenue-generating flights. We're also honored and encouraged by the orders from Southwest Airlines, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines in the quarter, along with an order last week from Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, and the trust our customers are placing in Boeing and in the 737 family. These orders underscore our customers' commitment to continued modernization of their fleet with 737 airplanes that enable operational efficiencies, such as improved fuel burn, which reduced carbon emissions; quieter engines that benefit the communities they serve; and excellent dispatch reliability to support on-time operations. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 3,200 aircraft in our 737 backlog.
We're currently producing at a low rate and expect to gradually increase the rate to 31 per month in early 2022, with further gradual increases corresponding with marker demand. We will continue to assess the production rate plan as we monitor the market environment and engage in customer discussions. The timing of remaining regulatory approvals will also determine our delivery plans and shape our production ramp up. We will continue to communicate transparently with our supply chain to ensure readiness and stability.
Turning to the 787 program. We resumed deliveries in March following rigorous testing and analysis and are closely coordinating with our customers. We will follow the FAA -- or the FAA has been involved every step of the way in this process. We've delivered a total of 9 787s since restarting deliveries last month with potentially a couple more by the end of this week. Based on what we know today, we still expect to deliver the majority of the 787 aircraft currently in inventory by the end of the year. We will closely monitor the market environment and keep you updated on delivery progress. As we've previously communicated in March, we consolidated the 787 final assembly to Boeing South Carolina, which went smoothly. Also, we transitioned to a low production rate of 5 by the end of the quarter. 
On the 777X program, we're working closely with global regulators on all aspects of development, including our rigorous test program. Our team remains focused on executing this comprehensive series of tests to demonstrate the safety and the reliability of the airplane's design, and we're pleased with the progress that we've made to date. We're also providing regular updates to our customers and still anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur late in 2023. As planned, we are transitioning the combined 777, 777X production rate to 2 per month. We also continue to see strong freighter demand and are assessing out production plans to efficiently transition to the 777X.
In addition to our commercial programs, we've continued to deliver for our Defense, Space and Services customers. As we reach these program milestones, we're firmly grounded and guided by our core values: safety, quality and integrity. Let me highlight a few of these accomplishments. Our Defense, Security & Space team began production of the T-7A Red Hawk advance trainer and achieved first flight and delivery of the F-15EX to the U.S. Air Force with the second aircraft delivering just last week.
On the KC-46A Tanker program, the U.S. Air Force has began demonstrating limited operational use for air refueling as well as cargo and passenger airlift operations, and has safely conducted over 1,400 missions over the last 6 months. We also successfully completed hot fire testing for NASA's Space Launch System, SLS, rocket. Additionally, our global services team delivered the 50th 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighter and inducted our first EA-18G Growler for the U.S. Navy modifications.
We also continue to manage the COVID-19 disruption on our programs, including impacts to the VC-25B program, where employee clearance constraints impedes our ability to exchange mechanics when quarantines are required. In addition to operational and programmatic highlights, we've also maintained significant emphasis on sustainability across the company and are making great strides. We're enhancing our sustainability disclosures and planning to release our first ever global equity, diversity and inclusion report, and our first integrated sustainability report later this year. Underscoring our commitment to the environment for the 11th year in a row, we're proud that we've received the ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award for Sustained Excellence in recognition of our company's successful energy conservation practices.
Now let's turn to the next slide to discuss the industry environment. Our government services, defense and space businesses remain significant and relatively stable. While increased government spending on COVID-19 response is adding pressure to defense budgets in some countries, others are increasing spending on their security. Overall, the global defense market remains strong, and we continue to see solid global demand for our major programs. The strength of our defense portfolio is underscored by another strong quarter of BDS orders totaling $7 billion. The diversity of our portfolio will continue to help provide critical stability for us as we move forward.
In the commercial market, we continue to see near-term market pressure due to COVID-19. However, many of our key long-term fundamentals remain intact. The recovery is gaining traction but remains uneven. We continue to anticipate the next 6 months will be very challenging for our airline customers and the entire industry. COVID-19 case rates are still high in many areas around the world and travel restrictions remain in place, putting significant pressure on passenger traffic, especially in those affected markets. We're seeing some positive momentum, particularly in domestic travel. Consistent with what we've discussed in prior quarters, the domestic market is leading the recovery and in some cases, it has slightly outpaced our expectations. February domestic traffic was 51% below 2019 levels. Since then, it has picked up in some regions, including the United States and China, and we anticipate continued momentum this spring. 
On the other hand, international operations remains extremely low, with February traffic still 89% below 2019, slightly behind our earlier expectations. Ongoing virus concerns and the absence of coordinated global policies on cross-border entry protocols have hindered the recovery in the international segment. Vaccine distribution remains the critical hurdle to a broad reopening. The active fleet is still around 3/4 of its previous size with single-aisle activity levels slightly above twin-aisle. And although utilization rates and load factors are increasing in some areas, they are still below historic levels, which means airlines are flying less than 60% of their normal capacity at the global level. Regional dynamics such as case rates, government travel policies continue to influence passenger traffic and drive an uneven recovery profiles all around the world.
The U.S. and China domestic markets are showing resilience with pent-up demand. U.S. airlines are seeing a significant increase in bookings for domestic and leisure routes. TSA throughput in April has been the highest we've seen since the onset of the pandemic with daily averages of approximately 1.4 million passengers, around 60% of 2019 levels. However, passenger traffic in other parts of the world, such as Europe and parts of Latin America, remain significantly lower due to new strains of the virus, lower vaccine penetration and uncertainty about government reopening plans. 
As expected, the number of aircraft being retired from the active fleet keeps growing, with around 1,500 airplanes retired or announced to be removed since the onset of the pandemic. We anticipate this trend will continue as our customers focus on retiring their oldest and least efficient airplanes and replacing them with new airplanes that will be as much as 25% to 40% more fuel-efficient with commensurate emission improvements.
The freighter market remains another bright spot with cargo traffic in February 9% higher than 2019. Yields have remained very high and more freighters are flying than before the pandemic due to limited belly cargo capacity from passenger airplanes. Over the long run, cargo demand will continue to be driven by global trade and GDP growth. Progress on vaccine dissemination and domestic passenger traffic in many countries continue to support our medium-term outlook and our belief in the long-term strength of the market. 
As we've shared previously and consistent with IATA and other industry groups, we expect passenger traffic to return to 2019 levels in 2023 to 2024. We still see the recovery in 3 phases. First, domestic traffic; then, regional markets such as intra-Asia, intra-Europe and intra-Americas flights; and then finally, long-haul international routes. Therefore, demand for narrow-body aircraft is expected to recover faster while widebody demand will remain challenged for a longer period. 
As we start to see positive signs in the resumption of domestic and international air travel, our Confident Travel Initiative has continued to partner with airlines, regulators, leading universities and medical experts around the world to demonstrate the safety of air travel. Our confidence in air travel has been substantiated by science, testing and analysis based on the multilayered approach to keep our air crews and passengers safe no matter where they're seated in the aircraft cabin. We've also -- we're also working with governments and industry associations to help ensure when people decide to travel, they know what to expect. 
We encourage any new protocols that use data-driven risk-based approaches to minimize disease transmission risks between countries. Standardized and secure methods to verify traveler information should be part of any solution to safely expand the international travel. As we move forward, testing mechanisms, progress on vaccine distribution and coordinated global interactions will be the key drivers of the recovery. 
We're also monitoring the global trade environment, in particular, U.S.-China relations, given the importance of the Chinese market to our near-term delivery profile as well as future orders, which influence future production rates. We will continue to engage with leaders in both countries to urge a productive dialogue, reiterating the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry. China represents 25% of the global growth in our industry over the next decade.
In the commercial services market, we saw stable demand in the first quarter. We're seeing some rebound from the bottom, and we expect to see increased activity as airlines are preparing for the summer season. That said, we continue to anticipate it will take multiple years to reach previous demand levels and the recovery trajectory may be uneven. Additionally, accelerated retirements are lowering the age of the fleet, reducing services demand and prolonging the recovery for commercial services.
On the liquidity front, managing the liquidity continues to be vital for the aerospace industry until the market recovers. Despite the challenges, and as we noted in our recently released current aircraft finance market outlook, there generally continues to be liquidity in the market for our customers to acquire new airplanes. In fact, 100% of Boeing deliveries in 2020 were financed by third parties. Financiers and investors understand the long-term value proposition of aircraft and the fundamental need to connect the world.
As we see airlines adapt to these market realities, product differentiation and versatility will be key. Our product lineup is well positioned to meet our customer needs. As we navigate this difficult time, we're not losing sight of our future. We've taken great care to ensure we have the team, the resources and the investments necessary to meet our customer commitments, to drive our improvement initiatives and innovate for the long term.
In addition to our work on our current programs, we're also advancing technology that will define our next chapter. We anticipate that our investments will lead to next-generation aircraft that offer a higher performance while being more fuel-efficient and easier to maintain and easier to reconfigure. We will continue to take the right action to adapt to the market impact of COVID-19 and position our business for the future by closely managing our liquidity and while driving long-lasting change to make our business leaner, sharper and more sustainable.
So with that, let me turn it over to Greg."
370857,710567395,2260997,"The Boeing Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","The Boeing Company","Executives","Great. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's please turn to Slide 4. First quarter revenue decreased to $15.2 billion, primarily due to lower 787 deliveries and commercial services volume. This was partially offset by higher 737 deliveries and h",2353,"Great. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's please turn to Slide 4. First quarter revenue decreased to $15.2 billion, primarily due to lower 787 deliveries and commercial services volume. This was partially offset by higher 737 deliveries and higher KC-46A Tanker revenue. Earnings in the quarter were also impacted by lower commercial airplane period costs, partially offset by lower tax benefits and higher interest expense. Income tax in the quarter primarily reflects a benefit from the impact of the pretax losses, largely offset by the adjustments to the valuation allowance and true-ups to the tax benefits recorded in 2020.
Let's now move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. Revenue was $4.3 billion, driven by lower 787 deliveries, partially offset by higher 737 volume. Although Commercial Airplanes' operating margin continued to be under pressure, they performed in the quarter -- they improved in the quarter, excuse me, due to higher 737 deliveries, lower abnormal production costs compared to the same period in prior year and the absence of the first quarter 2020 charge related to the 737NG pickle fork repair costs.
We delivered 58 737 MAX airplanes in the first quarter. We currently have approximately 400 737 MAX aircraft built and stored in inventory. As we've previously communicated, we expect to have to remarket some of these aircraft and potentially reconfigure them. As you've seen by the recent orders, we are making good, steady progress on the remarketing effort. You may also recall right before the 737 MAX return to service, we estimated that around half of the approximate 450 aircraft we had in storage would be delivered by the end of '21 and the majority of the remaining by the end of the following year. That estimate is unchanged. Through the first quarter, we have delivered 85 737 aircraft from storage, and as Dave mentioned, the recent delivery pause will impact our April deliveries. We expect delivery timing and the production rate ramp-up profile remain dynamic, given the market environment, customer discussions and the remaining global regulatory approvals. 
There is no material change in our estimated for total 737 abnormal costs of $5 billion. During the first quarter, we expensed $568 million of abnormal production costs, which brought the cumulative abnormal cost expense to date to $3.1 billion. We expect the remainder of these costs to be expensed as incurred largely in 2021. Our assessment of the liability for estimated 737 MAX potential concessions and other considerations to customers as well as the expected cash impact timing did not change significantly in the first quarter from our prior assessment.
Cumulatively, we've accrued a $9.3 billion liability for the estimated potential concessions and other considerations. To date, we've reduced the liability by $4.9 billion through cash payments to customers and other forms of compensation, including $1.2 billion we paid this quarter. We have settlement agreements covering approximately $2.5 billion of the remaining liability balance of $4.4 billion. 
Turning now to 787. As we discussed, we resumed deliveries in March. We currently have approximately 100 787 airplanes in inventory. Based on what we know today, we still anticipate that we will deliver the majority of these airplanes during 2021. We are working with our customers to facilitate deliveries and continue to monitor the international long-haul recovery as we assess our delivery plans.
Our latest assessment of the financial impact related to the inspections and the delivery delays has been included in our first quarter closing position. As we've previously disclosed, the 787 program has near breakeven gross margins due to previously announced reductions in production rates and program accounting quantity. If we are required to further reduce the accounting quantity and/or production rates or experience other factors that result in lower margins, the program could record a reach forward loss in future periods. However, on a cash basis, the 787 unit margin has held up relatively well, even at lower production rates as many underlying profitability drivers remain intact. 
Moving now to 777X. As Dave mentioned, we still expect first delivery of the 777X to occur in late 2023, and we are making good progress on our flight test efforts. We still expect that peak use of cash for 777X program was in 2020 and that cash flow will improve as we get closer to EIS and begin deliveries in late '23. We anticipate the program to turn cash flow positive approximately 1 to 2 years after the first delivery. Given the significant headwinds that remain in the market, BCA margin progression will be highly dependent upon future production rates and will take time. However, we continue to take appropriate action to make foundational lasting change through our business transformation efforts in order to help offset those headwinds as much as possible.
Let's now move to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 6. First quarter revenue increased to $7.2 billion and first quarter operating margins increased to 5.6%, primarily driven by higher KC-46A Tanker revenue and the absence of charges related to the program in prior period, partially offset by a pretax charge of $318 million on the VC-25B program, which was largely due to COVID impact and performance issues at our supplier. We received $7 billion in orders in the quarter, including contracts for 27 KC-46A Tanker aircraft to the U.S. Air Force, 11 P-8A Poseidon aircraft to the U.S. Navy and Royal Australian Air Force and 6 Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey rotorcraft to the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force, holding the backlog steady at $61 billion.
Let's now turn to Global Services results on Slide 7. In the first quarter, Global Services revenue declined to 3.4 -- $3.7 billion and operating margins decreased to 11.8%, both driven by lower commercial services volume due to COVID-19. No notable asset impairments were booked in the quarter. During the quarter, BGS won key contracts worth approximately $3 billion, resulting in backlog of approximately $20 billion. While services demand was relatively flat in comparison to fourth quarter 2020, we expect the quarterly revenue trend to improve as we support increased airline operations and more airplanes are flying as travel recovers. That said, given the dynamic environment, we can expect to see revenue trajectory vary from quarter-to-quarter.
Despite the challenging environment, we continue to position our services business for the future and are evaluating our portfolio to ensure that we have the right solutions to help our customers and industry navigate the downturn and prepare for market recovery. These efforts are starting to take hold and positively impact our operating margin performance.
Let's now turn to cash flow on Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the quarter improved to negative $3.4 billion, reflecting the timing of receipts and expenditures and higher 737 deliveries, partially offset by lower 787 deliveries and lower advanced payments.
Let's move now to Slide 9, to discuss our liquidity position. We continue to proactively manage our cash position and assess our liquidity through the pandemic. We ended the first quarter with strong liquidity, including $21.9 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet and access to $14.8 billion from our newly increased bank credit facilities, which remain undrawn. We also continue to have access to the capital markets. Our debt balance remained stable at $63.6 billion at the end of the quarter. As part of our ongoing prudent liquidity actions, we refinanced $9.8 billion of our delayed draw term loan that was due in early '22 and expanded our revolving credit facility by $5.3 billion.
These liquidity-enhancing activities are in addition to the many actions we have discussed before, including suspending our dividend, reducing discretionary spending, matching 401(k) contributions in stock, pre-funding pension with stock and awarding most of our employees a onetime stock grant that will best in 3 years in lieu of a merit increase. These actions reflect our continued derisking strategy and are part of our balanced approach to ensure we proactively meet future obligations. We worked hard in the past to maintain disciplined cash management while seeking opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet, and we will continue these efforts.
Once cash flow generation returns to more normal levels, reducing our debt level will be our top priority. We believe we currently have sufficient liquidity and are not planning to increase our debt levels. However, we will continue to actively manage our balance sheet. Our investment-grade credit rating is important to us, and we will continue to consider all aspects of our capital structure to strengthen our balance sheet.
Let's turn now to the next slide to summarize. Our business environment remains dynamic. And while the commercial market recovery is gaining some traction and has been uneven and the path ahead is far from certain, we will continue to diligently work opportunities and monitor risk factors, including vaccination pace and case rates along with passenger traffic recovery and remaining 737 MAX regulatory approvals and U.S.-China relations. As Dave mentioned, we're still awaiting 737 MAX regulatory approval from China, and the timing of it will affect our 737 delivery plan. China is an important market for our commercial airplanes and order activity from China will affect our future production rates.
As we've discussed, even as our industry begins to recover, we anticipate '21 will be another challenging year. However, based on what we know today, we still expect revenue, earnings and operating cash to improve from 2020. Commercial deliveries will continue to be the single biggest driver across all financial metrics.
Revenue improvement from 2020 to 2021 will be driven mainly by higher 737 and 787 deliveries as we plan to unwind inventory and deliver from the production lines. Consistent with what we shared last quarter, we also expect improvement to our bottom line from 2020 to '21, primarily driven by higher commercial deliveries, absent of 2020 charges, improved performance and benefits from continued business transformation actions. These impacts will be partially offset by higher interest expense. Also, bear in mind that our commercial business will continue to book significant abnormal production costs for the 737 program in '21.
Similar to our revenue and earnings trajectories, we continue to expect 2021 operating cash flow to be much improved from 2020, driven by -- mainly by inventory burn down associated with 737 and 787 programs. While higher deliveries will be a tailwind, the timing of advanced payments and the burn down of access advanced payments along with 737 customer settlement payment and higher interest payments will continue to be headwinds. We expect the first quarter was the most challenging quarter from a cash perspective, and we expect the trend improve for the remainder of the year as we ramp up 87 and 737 deliveries in subsequent periods. However, there could be some timing variation quarter-over-quarter, so quarterly trajectory could be uneven.
As discussed, our cash flow profile is heavily dependent upon obtaining the remaining 737 MAX regulatory approvals, the commercial market recovery and ongoing discussions with our customers on their fleet planning needs. In aggregate, we continue to expect 2021 to be a use of cash. We expect that continued improvement on the 737 MAX program due to lower customer considerations and higher delivery payments as well as recovery in commercial services will enable us to turn positive cash flow in 2022. The key watch items that I highlighted earlier will be the differentiator in our outlook trajectory.
Given the dynamic environment, we continue to monitor the risks and opportunities to ensure we're well positioned for the future. Over the past year, we've been keeping you updated on our extensive business transformation effort. We're continuing to closely examine all aspects of our operations to simplify and streamline everything we do and take billions of dollars out of our operating costs while driving our key efforts in safety, quality and performance.
We're doing this now so that we can emerge a leaner, sharper and more resilient company as the market recovers and production rate increases in the future. We'll continue to execute a widespread set of changes over a multiyear period. I'm pleased with the strong progress we have shown in 2020 that is carried into '21 and is gaining momentum. We expect the majority of our efforts will result in lasting change that will drive long-term productivity, future margin expansion and cash flow generation as our market continues to recover. And as we take action, we're ensuring that every step only further drives key efforts in safety, quality and delivering on our commitments. We have a dedicated team focused on these efforts embedded in every business unit function to ensure we're continually improving in every aspect of our operations. This is an enduring effort that our entire leadership team is committed to driving forward in the future.
And finally, as you know, last week, I shared my intent to retire from Boeing in July. I want to take a moment to thank the 140,000 great people at Boeing and all of our partners who have made my 30 years at the company so special. It has been a true honor and a privilege to work alongside all of you. I will cherish the relationships that I've been very fortunate to have here and over the years, and those include all of you in the financial community that I've had the opportunity to get to know so well over the last decade and beyond. At Boeing, I've been inspired every day by the incredible technology, products and services we bring to the world. And while it's our products and our mission to get you excited, it's the great people at Boeing that make it all possible, and it is the people that I will miss the most.
Over the next few months, I will be solely focused on a smooth transition of my responsibilities and then on to the next chapter in my career. I will always be cheering on Dave and the entire Boeing team from the sidelines. I'm confident in the long-term market opportunity ahead, the Boeing Company itself and the team behind it.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dave for some closing comments."

On behalf of the Board and the entire Boeing team, I want to thank Greg for his incredible contributions and his dedication to Boeing and its people. His remarkable leadership has made a significant and lasting impact for our company, for our customers and for our stakeholders. Thanks to Greg's efforts, Boeing has -- also has had the benefit of very solid teams across the function that he oversees, people I've gotten to know quite well. As we build on Greg's legacy, we're not searching for a new strategic direction. We will engage in a comprehensive and thoughtful search process for a world-class executive with the talent and skills commensurate with the high level Greg has set. This process will encompass executives within Boeing and across the external market.
We're well positioned for the future, and we will continue to transform our business to not just navigate through this pandemic, but to ensure that we emerge stronger and more resilient for the long term. While there's no question that COVID-19 has had a profound impact on our industry, we view this year as a key inflection point and as positive signs begin to emerge. As governments around the world accelerate vaccine distribution, people are getting back to work and global economies are beginning to get back to business. And as they do, we are proud of our role in enabling travel to connect people, to connect businesses and importantly, to connect cultures. As we face into the challenges at hand, we remain steadfast in our commitment to quality, safety, integrity and transparency. Through it all, I am proud of how our team continues to stay focused on our customers and their important missions, and I'm confident in our future.
With that, Greg and I will be happy to take your questions."

But also as we've talked about, under the umbrella business transformation, we've been really -- as we've been in this period, we've been challenging all aspects of the business and looking for opportunities to streamline, but at the same time, never losing sight of the future.
So as you've seen from as what we posted last year, we continue to make significant investments in the business, and we will. But at the same time, we're going to still stay very focused on the business transformation efforts that should help continue to help that trajectory as we see the market improve and then our ability to increase production rates associated with that improved market.

There is enormous productivity attached to that track. So I agree with all the comments that Greg made, I would just add that commentary."

Actually, Dave, I have a question for you that also goes over a long time, I think, and you're involved in the industry. If you think back over the years, Airbus and Boeing historically have always had kind of an ongoing battle about market share. They talk about it against each other, that sort of thing. And it's been particularly true on narrowbodies. So when you look at the situation today, the MAX, obviously, has been held back. There's still a large market for it. But Airbus has been delivering a lot of neos. They have a big backlog. On the last call, we talked a little bit about the 321XLR. So when you look forward now, how important is market share? Do you think about that? Is that number for narrowbodies important? And is there something that -- is there a level that you would want to make sure that Boeing is at?"

What I will say about this is I can't make up for the production gap that we created on our own right for that entire year. I can't make up to that. And so I'm not going to try to regain that ground. I'm simply, from this point forward, going to try to hold our own with respect to what I think is our rightful share. 
I will also bring the rates back in the most stable fashion I can conceivably bring them. So I will pace that. And I think that is good for Boeing, I think that is really good for shareholders. So it's all a question over what period of time do you want to measure it? I'm confident that over a longer period of time, we'll get back to where we need to get to. And I'm confident in the product line, always have been and I continue to be. And I think some of the recent activity suggests that.

And then the final and very important strides is we've got to reinstate our trade relationship in aerospace with China. That's a big part of the market long term.

These are orders with known customers and known destinations. And there was no -- we're not playing games with our language. We -- whether we put the word vast in front of it or not, we'll see. But that's not going to be because of a lack of willingness to take airplanes. It's just going to be because of logistical timing with respect to when crews can get in and take delivery and move them out Anyway, that would be my commentary. Greg, anything you want to add?"

So like I said, before long, you'll see that back at a normalized, I'll say, level of burn. Outside of that, like I said, cash -- unit cash basis programs really doing a great job and really holding up well at a very low rate. And again, that's a testament to all the hard work that's gone on over the years on stabilizing the factory and the operations and the productivity initiatives. So you're seeing the benefit of that. So as the rate kind of stabilizes and goes up, and we certainly deliver those inventoried aircraft, that's going to be a big driver, as I mentioned, on cash flow between the balance of this year and then going into '22."

It's time for us to just point out the economic implications of a trade with China in the aerospace industry and commercial aviation specifically. They're significant. You all know that.
And so we're just hoping to get everybody incentivized and lobby both sides. We have great relationships in China. We have firm orders on the books with China. But we need to get the order stream going again. And I'm confident that, that will happen. But this just happens to be the moment to begin to talk about that broadly, and that's why you saw me talk about it on the call this morning and in this discussion. We're just going to make sure that our administration knows the importance of getting those relationships straight. I think trade is good for everybody.

They represent that we put time and we put more cost into these programs. We didn't make -- take less.
So I'm actually very confident. I think we have removed an awful lot of duplication of effort. And Greg can give you that in living color, especially with respect to overlapping technology development programs between our BDS and our commercial world. So anyway, I'm confident in our future, and I think the level of investment we put into our research and development differentiators compared to our competitors, I feel great about.

So we have not been short on investment by any means. And you saw even last year in the middle of the pandemic, we continue to make the appropriate investments in the right area of the business. And I'd say even in some cases, we've made more investment like on the 737 line in order to capture stability on the other end, as Dave indicated. It's ultimately going to be great for our company, but great for our industry and our partners.
So in a lot of cases, we've moved money or shifted money or even added money in some cases because we're playing a long game here. And we're looking for areas where we have constraints or where, as Dave said, we have duplication of effort. And we're just challenging ourselves also in what's best-in-class even down to program levels of layers and spans around leadership and what constraints they have down at a program level and how can we remove those constraints. So -- but not losing sight of the future.
And quite frankly, making some of these moves that are going to provide even more stability going forward, as Dave indicated, and that's the whole idea. That as 37 rate comes up, we see better stability coming out of this than we did going in, and it's no different on any of the other programs. So -- and yes, there's lots being done here and there are going to be -- continue to be lots being done.

That's not going to -- how it's going to work, and that's not how it is working, but it's progressing well as you can see by the increase in the deliveries so far to date. 
As far as -- you're measuring this in days as far as the amount of rework required, but we're taking whatever time it takes to get the work done in station and completed per our spec. But it is improving aircraft over aircraft. So as the teams are completing the rework, they are actually coming down a learning curve. So we anticipate that overall cycle time to improve. And like we said, look, we're -- right now, we've got a schedule lined up with -- by tail number, by month, by customer that gets the majority of the 100 inventoried aircraft delivered by the end of the year.
And as Dave indicated, that could move around from customer to customer and so on, but we're trying to stay ahead of that and staying very engaged with our customers around specific time frames of which we'll be making our delivery and all that aligned up with how we do the rework and how we stabilize the ramp and complete the final deliveries.

But look, everybody is working extremely hard, obviously, to meet our commitments to our customers, get these aircraft reworked appropriately and then, of course, get -- continue the delivery.

So the idea that we fix everything, I'm not sure I can sign up for that. The idea that we're going to be a whole lot better, I can sign up for it. And the work we've done to align our engineering function broadly, everybody inside the company has signed up for that endeavor and feels great about it. The work we've done with respect to the safety management system that surrounds that engineering function and which they lead into half of the company. It avails  itself to new data to a faster cycle time with respect to how our company processes that data and ultimately makes decisions around that data. 
And a reinvestment in the fundamental design practices of the company that will instill disciplines that we just need to get better and better at. And everybody in the company signed up to do this, and we're making real investments in that process. So I feel very, very, very good about all of that. And it will -- it does not mean that in a flight test somewhere along the way, we don't run into an issue that needs to get resolved. And so it is the nature of our industry to do big things and do them very well. So anyway, I'm confident that these transformation efforts are significant. 
I'm also confident on this production stability, which goes hand-in-hand with engineering. We've taken actions over this -- really hard actions over this course of this year to stop things when we see an issue and get them fixed once and for all. And the 87 in Q1 was a glaring example of that. These fit and finish issues with respect to the joints in our fuselages were just nagging problems, difficult problems. And we applied real engineering talent and expertise to that, new process controls, new lines of communication with our supply side. So that we're not surprised by that stuff anymore, and we can eliminate rework loops that ultimately travel with the product. I could go on and on and on and on and on. But I think some of the signs should be very apparent to you and to our customers."

So I think the big takeaway should be that we're going to constantly review the capital structure and the strategy and the long-term strength of the balance sheet. And with that, we're going to keep all our options open and on the table. 
But how we think about it is, again, not just as a base case, but we just -- as we have, just keep looking around corners and understanding what levers would we pull and when would we need to pull them and what would be the implications of doing that. And as I said on the call that as we see it today, we don't see a need for additional liquidity. But also, as you've seen how we've handled the bank line and extended our credit facility. We're making sure that we've got all the right things in place if we need to go there. And if we do, we'll be prepared to do so."

So there's a lot that goes into this, but I think it's important that everyone understand. Most often, when a new airplane is developed by either side, it is usually developed around a propulsion package that offers 15% to 20% improvement with respect to efficiency versus the one it's displacing. That's the way it's happened over a long period of time. I don't believe the next generation of engine can deliver that kind of performance. And then, therefore, whatever cost efficiency ultimately and whatever performance advantages are derived from the next airplane, in my view, we're going to come from the way it's engineered and the way it's manufactured, all with a focus on a lower cost per seat when we get it out to the marketplace. And yes, a more sustainable package with respect to environment. So that's what we all have to be focused on. I like the pressure that puts on the manufacturers. That means the technologies we deploy are our technologies.
We've done an awful lot of fantastic work in our defense programs with respect to using engineering modeling and then manufacturing processes that tap that engineering modeling directly, create parts that can be assembled in one motion with great efficiency. Secondly, we've invested, as you know, in composites in our platforms for a very, very long time. The learning curves associated with getting efficient at composite development are significant. I believe Boeing has a huge advantage on that front. And so how we bring that engineering modeling, the composite development work that we've done over these years and then quick, simple assembly like we've demonstrated with the trainer airplane and other defense programs. We have to do it at scale and we have to prove to ourselves we can do it at scale. But in my view, those are going to be the advantages to that next airplane that gets developed. And I just love where Boeing is positioned on that front when the time comes."

And please encourage everyone you know to get the vaccine, if they haven't already. 
With the onset of COVID-19 roughly 1.5 years ago, our worlds were turned upside down. As an industry, we faced it head-on and work together every step of the way. While there are still ways to go before a full recovery, we're encouraged by the continued progress on vaccine distribution and the uptick in domestic travel. We're also looking forward to further progress on coordinated international travel policies and protocols. 
I've said before that we view this year as a critical inflection point, and it's proving to be just that. We are turning a corner, and the recovery is gaining momentum. Throughout all of this, we are continuously learning and adapting how we operate to best serve our customers, our suppliers, our teammates, our communities and other stakeholders, and I'm proud of how our team has remained focused on our mission. 
Before I go through our business update, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and thank Dave Dohnalek for serving as our interim CFO. Dave is a proven well-respected leader here at Boeing, and I'm grateful for his partnership as we transition. And as you know, we have appointed Brian West to serve as Boeing's next CFO. It's effective August 27. Brian is an exceptional leader with significant financial management and long-term strategic planning experience in complex global organizations across the aerospace, manufacturing and services industries. And thanks to Greg Smith's legacy, he's inheriting a world-class finance team here at Boeing. I've worked directly with Brian previously in my professional career. He has broad operational expertise and will bring great perspective to our business transformation journey and post-pandemic recovery as he joins the team this month. With that, let's start with an update on our business on the next chart. 
Overall, we've made important progress in the quarter as our transformation actions began to take -- or get traction. when we focused on improving our performance and driving stability across all of our operations. Let's start with the 737 program where we've made significant headway. 
We resumed 737 MAX deliveries in May and have continued to support our airline customer efforts to return those fleets to service. Excuse me, I'll keep going?"
370857,1673275055,2352920,"The Boeing Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","The Boeing Company","Executives","Yes.",1,"Yes."

The 737 MAX 10 also completed its first flight in June, marking an important milestone for the largest member of the 737 family. As you may r",3148,"In the second quarter, we delivered 47 737 MAX airplanes, including our first [ 737-8200 ] delivery to Ryanair. The 737 MAX 10 also completed its first flight in June, marking an important milestone for the largest member of the 737 family. 
As you may recall, roughly 9 months ago, we had approximately 450 airplanes in inventory, and we are awaiting approval from the FAA to begin returning the 737 MAX to service. Fast forward to today, and the progress is noteworthy. 
175 countries have now approved the resumption of 737 MAX operations. We've delivered more than [ 130 ] airplanes. Our airline customers have returned more than 190 previously grounded airplanes to revenue service. 30 airlines have returned their fleets to service. And those airlines have safely flown nearly 95,000 commercial flights, totaling more than 218,000 flight hours. Importantly, the fleet has an impressive schedule reliability rate of more than 99%. 
Airlines are operating over 1,000 revenue flights daily and just last week, added nearly 3 million 737 MAX seats in the second half 2021 scheduled operations, a testament to the value proposition the airplane family offers. And as domestic traffic recovers, we believe we have started to turn a corner from an overall demand perspective. This is reinforced by 5 straight months of positive net commercial airplane orders, driven primarily by the 737 MAX. 
We are honored by the more than 280 additional orders during the quarter, including those from United Airlines and Southwest Airlines. And we appreciate the trust our customers are placing in Boeing and the 737 family. These orders underscore our customers' commitment to continued fleet modernization as well as the accelerating demand for air travel. These new 737 airplanes are designed to improve the customer experience while significantly lowering carbon emissions per seat. At the end of the quarter, we had over 3,300 aircraft in our 737 backlog. 
We're currently producing 16 airplanes per month and continue to expect to gradually increase the rate to 31 a month in early '22, with further gradual increases to correspond with market demand and importantly, supply chain capacity. We will continue to assess the production rate plan as we monitor the market environment and engage in customer discussions. 
As we previously communicated, the timing of remaining regulatory approvals will shape our delivery plans and our production ramp -- our rate ramp. We continue to work with global regulators and still anticipate that the remaining regulatory approvals will occur this year, including China. And as always, we will follow global regulators' lead in the steps ahead. 
Now I'd like to spend a bit of time on our business transformation efforts. As we've discussed before, our activities in this area are organized around 5 pillars: infrastructure, overhead and organization, supply chain health, portfolio and investment and operational excellence. We've put rigor around each pillar and have detailed projects supporting each one. We are implementing these projects to create long-lasting change, which will improve our competitiveness, help us grow our cash flow and create a foundation to enable us to return to healthy margins even at lower production rates. 
Many of the projects that we're executing have been shared previously and are widely visible, such as consolidating the 787 final assembly in Charleston; optimizing our facilities footprint to reduce nearly 6 million square feet of real estate; and forming strategic partnerships with IT vendors, accelerating our migration to the cloud. Other projects may be less visible externally, but they're improving our productivity, simplifying our operations, reducing bureaucracy and driving first-time quality. 
Through our business transformation efforts over the past year, we've reduced billions of dollars of costs. And our objective is that the majority of the savings is long-lasting, even when volume returns. At the same time, we remain focused on identifying new opportunities to further streamline how we operate. We've started to see the benefits of these efforts in our quarterly financial results, which Dave will go through in more detail. 
As we've discussed previously, we've been adjusting the size of our workforce to align with the commercial market environment reality and lower production rates. We now plan to keep our overall workforce size roughly consistent with where we are today at approximately 140,000. This will allow us to support the encouraging trends we've seen in the commercial market recovery; the growth opportunities in our defense and government services business; and increased investments to strengthen engineering and drive quality and stability into our production system, where the payback is large. 
Going forward, the pace of the commercial market recovery, trade relations with China, production rates and our own performance, our execution will be key factors of our overall employment levels. 
Turning to our efforts to drive stability. With every action we are driving toward engineering excellence, production system stability and first-time quality and delivery predictability, which holding ourselves accountable to the highest standards. We're implementing comprehensive quality and productivity initiatives in our factories and strengthening our quality reviews within our supply chain. We conduct regular audits internally with suppliers to ensure adherence to approve processes and practices ranging from production methods to documentation standards. And as part of our process, we proactively and transparently keep the FAA fully aware of our efforts. 
This enhanced rigor has helped identify areas that we can improve. And by identifying and correcting any issue at the source, while our rates are still relatively low, we can strengthen first-time quality, eliminate traveled work and drive stability and predictability as demand returns. These efforts played a key role in supporting a healthy and stable rate ramp on the 737 MAX, and we're applying this same approach to the 787. 
Now specifically on the 787 program, I understand the difficulties we have caused by the inconsistency in both our production rate and our delivery cadence. The impacts are felt by our suppliers and by our customers. I also recognize these uncertainties create challenges for the investment community to forecast our performance. We are determined to address these issues and will work tirelessly to do so, just like we have and continue to do on the 737 MAX. We're fully committed to this methodical approach to driving first-time quality and stability in our operations. The issues that our engineering teams have identified, and we are now addressing, are part of this purposeful process, and we have transparently communicated with our regulators and customers every step of the way. We're progressing through these inspections and rework, including the additional work we shared earlier this month. We continue to engage in detailed discussions with the FAA on verification methodologies for the 787. And based on our assessment of the time required, we're reprioritizing production resources for a few weeks to support the inspection and rework. 
As that work is performed, the 787 production rate is now lower than 5 per month and will gradually return to that rate. Exact timing of returning to a rate of 5 per month will depend upon our progress on production stability and delivering airplanes from inventory. 
Of the approximately 100 787s currently in inventory, we expect to deliver fewer than half of them this year. While this has a near-term impact to our operations, I'm confident it's the right course of action, and we will continue to take the time necessary to ensure the highest levels of quality. Although it's been a long journey, we believe we're closer to the end than the beginning. 
Let me touch on the 777, 777X program, before I move to other segments. The combined 777, 777X production rate is 2 per month. We continue to see strong Freighter demand as evidenced by orders for 13 777 Freighters in the quarter, providing a solid bridge to the 777X. 
On the 777X program, we are subjecting the airplane to a comprehensive test program, designed to demonstrate safety and reliability as well as meet all applicable requirements. We continue to communicate transparently with the FAA and other global regulators about certification. And like any development program, we learn every step of the way. We incorporate feedback from our regulators, and we mature and advance our product with every conversation, every engagement, every test, every review. 
We continue to make progress to the previously shared schedule, including certification work with regulators and conducting Boeing flight tests. The performance data we've collected to date suggests the airplane is performing as we expected and to our customer commitments. We will be validating these results in the near future, along with continuing to work with the FAA to ensure we meet their requirements prior to beginning certification flight test. 
We continue to expect that we will deliver the first 777X in late 2023, as we shared previously. Meanwhile, we continue delivering for our defense, space and services customers. Dave will go through the financials in more detail in his remarks. But as you can see from the results, both our Defense and Services businesses had strong financial performance in the quarter. Let me highlight a few accomplishments. 
Our Defense space and security team made history as our MQ-25 test asset completed the first-ever unmanned aerial refueling of another aircraft, the F-18. We also joined the front fuselage of the first production T-7A with its app section in less than 30 minutes, a testament to the digital advancements of the U.S. Air Force first E-Series aircraft and a demonstration of our model-based engineering and 3D design benefits. 
Earlier this month, the U.S. Air Force approved the KC-46A Tanker for joint forces operational use of the center line hose and drove refueling system, which provides more daily operational capabilities. KC-46A tanker is of critical importance to our customer. 
Moving to Space. We began stacking the core stage of NASA's space launch system Rocket, with other Artemis I elements at Kennedy Space Center. And of course, we're looking forward to the uncrewed orbital flight test of our commercial cruise, Starliner vehicle, later this week. 
Additionally, in our Global Services business, we announced that we will be opening 2 new Boeing-converted Freighter lines in 2022. We also signed a parts agreement with Turkish [ Technik ] and received a key contract to support C-17 training from the U.K. Royal Air Force. 
In addition to program milestones, we made key progress on our sustainability, innovation and technology efforts. Just this week, we published Boeing's first integrated sustainability report, which is an important step in our continued efforts to reinforce our environmental, social and governance principles. 
Also, we recently announced that we're collaborating with Alaska Airlines to fly an Alaska 737-9 aircraft in our ecoDemonstrator program. In fact, today, our ecoDemonstrator aircraft is at Reagan National Airport, demonstrating the key leaders in many of the new technologies and improvements we're making to enhance safety and support a more sustainable future. 
Earlier this month, we also announced a partnership with Sky NRG, focused on advancing the availability and use of sustainable aviation fuels, or SAF, globally. As part of this commitment, we will invest in Sky NRG, America's first dedicated U.S. production facility for SAF, to help establish SAF supply for airports and airline customers largely on the West Coast. 
Now let's turn to the next slide to discuss the industry environment. Our government Services, Defense and Space businesses remain significant and relatively stable. While increased government spending on COVID-19 response is adding pressure to defense budgets in some countries, others are increasing spending on their security. Overall, the global defense market remains strong, and we continue to see solid global demand for our major programs. The diversity of our portfolio will continue to help provide critical stability for us as we move forward. 
Congress has kicked off the annual authorization and appropriation cycle for fiscal year 2022. The President's budget proposal called for strategic investments in Boeing products and services from across the BDS and our BGS portfolios. The budget proposal demonstrates confidence in the capabilities of Boeing's F-15Ex and Apache as well as key commercial derivative programs such as the KC-46 Tanker and space programs like the Space Launch System, SLS, among other platforms. 
The FA-18 and the Chinook Block 2 remain critical capabilities for the war fire, both domestically and for non-U.S. customers. We will continue to work with the administration and work with Congress to ensure the necessary support for these key programs are in place. 
In the commercial market, while near-term pressure due to COVID-19 remains, the recovery is accelerating in many of the key long-term fundamentals remain intact. In June, we saw global departures approach 70% of 2019 levels, up from less than 60% in the first quarter. We've seen encouraging signs in some markets, although the recovery continues to be uneven. In the near term, we expect that the environment will remain very challenged for many of our airline customers and the industry as a whole as they adapt to this rapidly evolving travel demand. 
While vaccine dissemination is broadening and some travel restrictions are loosening, others are still in place and some even tightening, which keeps significant pressure on passenger traffic. 
Continuing the positive momentum we saw in the first quarter, domestic traffic is leading the recovery. May domestic traffic was 24% below 2019 levels compared to 50% a quarter before. Since then, it continues to pick up in regions like the U.S. and Europe, and we anticipate continued improvement this summer. 
The U.S. domestic market is showing remarkable recovery, with summer bookings consistent with 2019 levels according to several airlines. TSA average daily throughput has already reached over 2 million passengers, around 80% of 2019 levels. Additionally, some regions such as Europe, India, Latin America are recently seeing double-digit monthly improvements in operations as vaccine rates improve and travel restrictions begin to loosen. 
While the recovery in China has wavered at times due to case rates, it remains robust with operations above 80% of pre-pandemic levels. However, passenger traffic in other parts of the world, such as Southeast Asia, remained significantly lower due to travel restriction, uncertainty and new strains of the virus. 
International operations remain extremely low and May traffic still 85% [ to ] 2019. And concerns about virus variants and limited coordination on cross-border entry protocols are still significantly hindering recovery in the international segment. Nevertheless, on average, roughly 100 aircraft per week have returned to service over the past 4 months, making the active fleet now approximately 80% of its previous size with single-aisle activity levels slightly above twin-isle. And although utilization rates and load factors are increasing in some areas, they are still below historic levels, which means airlines are flying around 70% of their normal capacity at the global level. 
With the toughest impacts appearing to be in the rearview mirror, airlines are shifting their focus to medium-term fleet planning. The number of aircraft being retired from the active fleet is significant, with around 1,500 airplanes and growing, retired or announced, to be removed since the onset of the pandemic. We anticipate this trend will continue as our customers focus on replacing the oldest, least efficient airplanes with new airplanes that will be as much as 25% to 40% more fuel efficient with commensurate reductions in emissions. 
The freighter market continues to be strong with cargo traffic year-to-date through May at 8% higher than 2019. Limited belly cargo capacity from passenger airplanes has resulted in more freighters flying with high load factors. In fact, 72% of air cargo is now being carried on dedicated freighters. That compares to 48% pre-pandemic. This demand is evidenced by orders in the quarter for 31 additional freighter airplanes and strong demand for Boeing-converted freighters. Longer term, cargo demand will continue to be driven by global trade and GDP growth, both of which experienced improvement in the second quarter. 
And we've shared previously, and consistent with IATA and other industry groups, we expect passenger traffic to return to 2019 levels in 2023 to 2024 and then a few years beyond that to return to long-term trend growth. We still see recovery in 3 phases. First, domestic; then regional markets, such as intra-Asia, intra-Europe intra-Americas; and finally, long-haul international routes. Therefore, we expect demand for narrow-body aircraft to recover faster. -- as evidenced by our year-to-date orders for 737 MAX airplanes and demand for wide-body aircraft to remain challenged for a longer period. 
On the global trade environment, we welcome the agreement between European Union and United States that all future government support for the development or production of commercial aircraft must be provided on market terms. We will fully support the U.S. government's efforts to enforce this agreement. 
We are also monitoring U.S. trade -- U.S.-China trade relations, given the importance of the China market to our economy and our industry's recovery as well as our near-term delivery profile and future orders, all of which influence future production rates. We remain in active discussions with our Chinese customers on their fleet planning needs and will continue to engage with leaders in both countries to urge a productive dialogue, reiterating the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry. 
Ultimately, America's leadership in aerospace, as well as the health and stability of millions of commercial aerospace jobs, rely on free and fair trade. And we're confident our leaders understand the importance of this area, not just for our business but for the overall health of our economy and competitiveness. 
Turning to the commercial services market. We saw improved demand in the second quarter as we are rebounding from the trough and as airlines prepared for the summer season. We expect this trend to continue near term, slightly ahead of our expectations. That said, we still anticipate a multiyear recovery that may be uneven. 
Overall industry liquidity, which remains critical for our industry and our industry's bridge to full recovery, it's been improving. Product differentiation and versatility will also be key as airlines adapt to the evolving market realities. I'm confident our product lineup is well positioned, and we're focused on executing to meet our customers' needs. 
The impact of COVID-19 has been significant and a number of challenges remain, but we are seeing signs of recovery. More broadly across the economy, we're now seeing positive indicators for economic growth. We believe bipartisan agreements on infrastructure investment can further support growth across the economy, not just for airports and highways, but also for the tens of thousands of small businesses and suppliers that contribute to industries like ours all across the country. With economic activities picking up, labor availability within our supply chain is a watch item. 
As we position for a market recovery, we're taking the right actions to manage liquidity and drive long-lasting change to make our business leaner, sharper, more sustainable. We remain committed to safety, quality, transparency, and I'm confident in our path forward. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Dave Dohnalek."

It's good to be reconnecting with many of you that I know from my time in Investor Relations and throughout my career at Boeing. I'm honored to be in the role of interim CFO and to help facilitate a smooth transition for Brian. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4, please. Second quarter revenue increased to $17 billion, primarily due to higher commercial deliveries and commercial services volume. Positive earnings in the quarter also benefited from lower period costs. Additionally, several nonrecurring items favorably contributed to the quarter. Income tax in the quarter primarily reflects benefits from a lower valuation allowance. 
Now let's turn to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. Revenue was $6 billion, reflecting higher commercial airplane deliveries. The improvement from the prior year was also due to a $551 million 737 MAX customer consideration impact in the second quarter of last year. Although Commercial Airplanes operating margin continued to be under pressure, it improved in the quarter due to higher commercial airplane deliveries and lower period costs. We delivered 47 MAX airplanes in the second quarter. We currently have approximately 390 MAX aircraft built and stored in inventory. We have made significant progress in our efforts to remarket some of our inventory airplanes and have now largely addressed that issue and put it behind us. Just prior to the 737 MAX return to service in the U.S., we estimated that around half of the approximately 450 aircraft we had in storage would be delivered by the end of 2021 and the majority of the remaining aircraft by the end of 2022. That expectation has not changed. We expect delivery timing in the production rate ramp profile to remain dynamic given the market environment, customer discussions and the remaining global regulatory approvals. 
There is no material change in our assumption for 737 [ abnormal ] costs or our assessment of the liability for estimated 737 MAX potential concessions and other considerations to customers. 
Turning to 787. Second quarter deliveries were light as we worked through the activities that Dave just mentioned. Our later -- or our latest assessment of the financial impact of inspections, rework, temporary production rate adjustment and delivery delays has been included in our second quarter closing position. The 787 program margin remains near breakeven. On a cash basis, these additional costs will create a headwind in the near term. However, we still expect overall unit margins to hold up relatively well. 
Moving now to 777X. As Dave mentioned, we still expect first delivery of the 777X to occur in late 2023. We are making progress in our flight test activities. We still expect that the peak use of cash for the 777X program occurred in 2020, and that cash flow will improve as we get closer to EIS and begin deliveries in late 2023. We anticipate the program will turn cash flow positive, approximately 1 to 2 years after first delivery. 
We are starting to see improvements in Commercial Airplanes' financial performance due to increasing 737 MAX deliveries and great efforts by the BCA team to manage costs through our business transformation activities. We also captured strong orders in the quarter, which is a testament to the value of our products and our customers' focus shifting now to fleet planning. Although the commercial recovery will take time and we still have work to do, we're on a positive path, and we remain -- and we will remain focused on driving stability on the 787 program and across the business. 
Let's now move to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue increased to $6.9 billion, primarily due to higher volume on the KC-46A Tanker program and the P-8A program. We posted a strong operating margin of 13.9% in the second quarter. The margin increase was driven by lack of a charge on the Tanker program as compared to second quarter of 2020 as well as a favorable adjustment on a non-U.S. contract. We received $4 billion in orders during the quarter, including an award for 14 Chinook helicopters for the U.K. Royal Air Force. We also reached an agreement with Germany for 5 P-8A aircraft. BDS backlog is currently valued at $59 billion. 
Now let's turn to Global Services on Slide 7. In the second quarter, Global Services revenue increased to $4.1 billion and operating margin grew to 13.1%, driven by higher commercial services as the market continues recovering from the impact of COVID-19. Operating margin was also helped by lower asset impairments, lower severance costs and a favorable mix of products and services. During the quarter, BGS won key contracts worth approximately $3 billion, resulting in a total backlog now of $19 billion. We saw incremental improvement in commercial services during the second quarter, and we expect the quarterly revenue trend to improve as we support increasing airline flight operations. That said, given the dynamic environment, we can expect to see variability in the revenue and margin trajectory from quarter-to-quarter at BGS. 
Now let's take a look at cash flow on Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the quarter improved significantly to negative $0.5 billion, reflecting higher commercial deliveries, higher order receipts, reduced expenditures on lower wide-body production rates and benefits from our business transformation efforts. While we saw a cash flow benefit from order activity in the second quarter, keep in mind that we continue to expect advanced payment burn-down to be a headwind for the rest of this year and into next. 
Now let's move to Slide 9 and discuss our liquidity position. We ended the second quarter with strong liquidity, including $21.3 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet and access to $14.8 billion from our bank credit facilities, which remain undrawn. Our debt balance remained stable at $63.6 billion at the end of the quarter. We expect to have lower total debt at the end of the year due to the paydown of maturing bonds and potential early paydown of our delayed draw term loan. Given the dynamic environment, we maintain vigilance in managing our cash. Thanks to actions taken throughout the business to enhance our cash balance, we believe we currently have sufficient liquidity. We remain focused on reducing our debt levels and actively managing our balance sheet. Our investment-grade credit rating is important to us, and we will continue to consider all aspects of our capital structure to strengthen our balance sheet. 
Moving to the next slide. In summary, we operate in a dynamic business environment. We are seeing the commercial market recovery accelerating. However, it continues to be uneven across different regions, and the near-term path remains challenging. Given this backdrop, we will continue to diligently cultivate opportunities and monitor risks. Our key enablers include vaccine distribution and travel protocols, U.S.-China trade relations, remaining 737 MAX regulatory approvals and resumption of 787 deliveries. Our financial performance in the second half of this year will largely be driven by these key enablers. 
On cash flow, we still expect full year 2021 to be a use of cash. Despite additional pressure from the updated 787 delivery schedule, our expectations for cash flow this year have not deteriorated due to timing of advanced payment burn-down and favorable order activity. With respect to the quarterly trajectory for the remainder of this year, we expect continued variability in cash flow quarter-over-quarter due to timing of deliveries as well as receipts and expenditures such as expected cash tax benefits and MAX customer settlement payments. We still expect to turn cash flow positive in 2022. 
The key drivers of cash flow in 2022 as compared to this year include continued improvement on the 737 program due to lower customer considerations in higher delivery payments as well as recovery in commercial services. However, advanced payments will still be a headwind in 2022. While our delivery expectations are now higher next year due to some 787 deliveries moving from this year into 2022, the related additional cash flow will be largely offset by the burn down of advanced payments next year. 
To close, while focusing on safety, quality and operational excellence, our team continues to closely examine all aspects of our business, simplify and streamline everything we do, drive stability in our operations and make long-lasting change. 
I'm honored to be a part of such a strong team and look forward to our bright future. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave Calhoun for closing comments."

Is there any way to quantify what you're gaining in the aircraft business, whether it's a structural cost out or where the MAX and 87 production rates need to be to achieve the margins they had the last cycle or anything along those lines?

And I think you saw some significant progress towards that this quarter to 13.1%. So I think that will depend from quarter-to-quarter on mix. There's variability in many, many programs in BGS, but I think we're seeing positive trajectory there. And we see a path to getting back towards those mid-teen margins over time. 
In BDS, strong quarter on margins with 13.9%. Now some of that was due to, as we mentioned, a higher -- or a benefit from a non-U.S. program adjustment that benefited the quarter. Even if you sort of stripped that out, BDS performed well and in the kind of the low double-digit margin territory that they've been in good times when we're not taking charges. So clearly, the fact that we didn't take any significant charges in the quarter and performed well across the programs, that turned out very well. 
And so then back to BCA, clearly, we're still in negative margin territory, although much better than we've been certainly in recent quarters and compared to the same quarter last year. I think a lot there will be driven by rate. We are ramping up in the 737 MAX program at 16 per month now, moving to 31 per month at the beginning of next year. And we intend to go higher, obviously driven by what we see in the market beyond early next year. And some of that, the key enablers that we just talked about, China being one, are important in that, in addition to just overall traffic trends. So I think for BCA, it's going to be production rate-driven in addition to getting additional traction on the business transformation efforts we've had cutting costs; and then, of course, as Dave mentioned, achieving stability, especially in the 787 program as we work through our final issues there."

No, I don't view this as opportunistic, either on my side or on the customer side.

No, I don't view this as opportunistic, either on my side or on the customer side. When you make decisions to order 270 airplanes and expand your capacity and get aggressive in the marketplace, that is his fundamental decision as it gets, and there's very little with respect to opportunism. 
The good news, when I just evaluate the United order, is they have to consider all of their routes, all of their operations. And then they, as you know, solve for the lowest cost, most efficient delivery of a passenger and a route of a passenger. And then they make choices around the airplanes. The good news is they have history with both manufacturers. So I like the way our product line competed with our competitor. I mean, it was straight up. Out of the 270, we got 200. The models and the routes that they're intended to satisfy, they're optimal for United. And anyway, so I'm quite pleased with how that went and was quite, in my view, strategic and long term. 
And in the case of Southwest, it's the same. Southwest, we benefit from it being a Boeing fleet and they benefit from it being all Boeing. But on the other hand, they're doing the same thing as United. These are 2 very strong airlines who are staking out the future and making big strategic decisions to do so. They're extending their reach. They're improving their route structures, et cetera. So I can't see these in any way as being opportunistic. I do think and expect as domestic markets return, recovery is robust. The retirements stay retired, and I believe most of them will, that we're going to end up in that same real estate play going forward, meaning airlines who get aggressive and have balance sheets that are strong, who want to improve their route structures and grow into the market, they'll be the first one to play. 
I can't predict exactly when that happens, just like I couldn't predict when United would step forward or Southwest. But I think these 2 are as strategic as it gets. And we held our ground in posture, and we let the airplanes perform it sell itself. That's really the way it happened."

Certainly, the tailwinds you see are expected higher airplane deliveries, certainly 737 MAXs; and as we work through 787, higher deliveries there, too, once we complete the work and are able to deliver again. 
I think while we're not predicting which quarter this year might be cash flow positive, I think it will be variable. We certainly made a lot of progress from Q1 with the Q2 cash flow performance. I think the rest of the year, I think it will be a balance of higher deliveries and some headwinds from advanced payments, but also benefits from, as Dave mentioned, continued work on the business transformation efforts and also on the expectation that we should be receiving a cash tax benefit sometime in the second half, could be in Q3. It could be in Q4. So that would be a benefit to the year as well on cash. But we're not predicting, Kristine, not giving guidance on a quarter for cash flow level.

So anyway, I'm very encouraged about the constructive nature of that -- of how that's going. And anyway, hopefully, bigger trade issues don't get in the way, and I don't believe they will. Both sides are incented for this industry to move forward."

So let me start by saying this is not the FAA getting tough on Boeing. This is Boeing getting tough on Boeing. We launched a program to inspect. Because we did find some issues by way of notice of escape out of the supply chain, early on, we decided we would do a nose-to-tail inspection of all of it, Tier 1, Tier 2. And we did exactly all the things you're describing. Are specs too tight? Are the process controls at our suppliers where they need to be? Is the rework operations that we've now put into our operations in Charleston, are they necessary? And are they getting the job done? And in every case, we look for even the smaller, smallest exception to the tolerances that we've designed. And in every case, we then take a step to, one, identify it. We immediately talk to the FDA about it. Two, we fix it. Three, we make sure it won't happen again. How do you do it? Well, you have teams inside our suppliers working on process control development, understanding of exactly why that spec is necessary and where it is. And on our side, we start putting disciplines in place that make it clear to the supply chain that we're not going to keep our line running if we get one that isn't right. That's a little bit of what's going on here. 
Here's the good news. If we ever had a window to get this behind us once and for all, it's now. We're producing at the lowest rate ever. Customers are not knocking down our door to get their airplanes in light of the COVID impact on international traffic. And so we're very determined to see our way through this. 
Good news, the inspections are done, right, toe to tail. So those inspections are done. It doesn't mean somewhere along the way, a supplier is not going to raise their hand and tell us there's an escape somewhere along the way. But it's not going to be as a result of this big effort that we've put forward here. And each and every 1 of these issues that we find, we always have a decision to make with respect to compliance, which is that each and every part and every airplane is built precisely to the drawings that we've created, and it's our job to rework the issue. And that is what we're going through. 
I view this as a courageous moment for Boeing. My hats off to our team, believe it or not. All of these conditions were preexisting, my leadership team. So the work they're taking on and the readiness that we're getting in place for what I think is a second half recovery in the wide-body world of next year, that's when I believe that border protocols are going to begin to get understood and predictability will return to the market. When that happens and orders come, we will have to be able to respond to rate increases in a very stable form and fashion. And I think the actions we're taking right now are the most important part of that puzzle. So I really do apologize to investors, and I apologize for guessing that the last issue was our last but we're getting close. And most importantly, the underlying causes are getting understood and resolved."

So again, we don't have like a big inspection program from here forward. This one is, for the most part, complete. And I expect things to change dramatically. But most importantly, the amount of rework we'll eliminate in our factory and the predictability of our supply chain on all these fronts is that much better off. 
Doug, one other comment I want to make, just to make sure everyone knows how important the 87 is. During this COVID period, during this COVID period, no wide-body passenger airplane has been flown more aggressively than the 87. It's everywhere. 90% of that fleet is up and active and being worked as hard as it can be worked. So despite the low numbers with respect to all this international traffic, et cetera, the 87 is the prized asset that's getting worked hard."

You've got orders coming in. So you've got adding and subtracting at the same time. 
So the bottom line for you to think about is that we still do see these PDPs or advances as a headwind through the second half of this year and into next year. It's a headwind we think we will more than overcome because we're predicting or expecting cash flow to be positive  in 2022. But just so it's not off your radar screen, this will be with us for the next number of quarters as we work through these deliveries out of inventory and apply advanced payments case by case, customer by customer. So it's really hard to predict or give guidance there. But net-net, again, 2022, we expect to be positive cash flow, and we would have tailwinds more than offsetting that headwind."

I mean we are -- my view is we are fully funded on the important R&D efforts that will support BCA broadly. I want to separate that from development funding, which is the ongoing certification work associated with the MAX-10, the 777X. And I hope in the relatively near term, a freighter version of that airplane.  
So we are going to be very busy and have been very busy on the development front and spending a fair amount of money on it. I don't expect that number to go up significantly at any different -- at any point in time and even in a relatively near term, not because we're not going to take on new stuff just because.  
And the next comment I would make on just the research front and what is the likely technologies that will surround that next airplane. It's not going to be dramatically different than with one exception, and that is everything sustainability. That next airplane will have to meet some serious sustainability tests. I do think that sustainable aviation fuel is going to be a big part of that and our propulsion suppliers with respect to the packages that they're now promoting. You may have seen the CFM package most recently with the fan. Anyway, I think it's going to be a fight between sustainability, propulsion packages and meeting that spec. And then for Boeing, it's to make this the most efficient airplane it can possibly be.  
And you may have heard me say, our investments in the underlying modeling technologies that have to be deployed, applying the digital thread that we have in our defense programs to the commercial programs, that is critically important to this next development. It will shorten the cycle on development. It will improve the productivity on the program itself. And that's critical.  
And then finally, just our production system will be quite different as we think about it. And we have very active programs on both the modeling and production system to be ready for that moment. So that's a lot. But I'm quite -- I'm actually quite confident that our R&D budgets are what they ought to be and quite robust relative to the needs of our BCA business."

We have derisked our year largely for China. So they become next year's risk with respect to delivery. So we'll run that play and that ramp as hard as we can. We will have signals with respect to where China is well before that. And if we have to make adjustments, we will. But I do think we are prepared for that delivery rate. And I think we're close to have already demonstrated. I think we delivered over 30, I don't think I know, over 30 in the month of June.  
We've got big teams. They know how to do it. The FAA has granted us our authorities, and we are -- we're running full speed. So -- and as I said, the performance of the airplane has been fantastic.

And so we just have some additional benefits on the cost side and -- that are offsetting enough so that we don't find ourselves in an RFL position. And obviously, as Dave said, it's all about achieving stability and starting to march back up that margin."

Your comments about current freight demand, I would think, drive an improvement in your long-term outlook and wondering if that's the case, second, am I correct that there are new emission standards coming that might impact the 67 and 777 freighters. I was wondering if you could comment on how you're going to address and meet those standards. And then finally, Airbus is talking about A350 freighter. Any plans to address this threat? Dave, I'm just trying to get to your overall product strategy here for freighters. Yes. I am quite confident in the freighter market. I think some secular things have happened there that are going to continue to make that a very important market. As you know, we are significant in that market and have long-standing customer relationships. And especially in the next couple of years, prior to the ICAO standards being implemented. I'm confident it will drive some additional 7.6 and additional 777 demands, et cetera. We need to develop a new ICAO compliant freighter version opportunity. I circled the 777X is the logical place for that and a smart place to do that. So as I said, without suggesting that we've already launched and/or that we have one planned by the day, we're confident, and I'm confident that, that might be the next of our programs. And it will be an incredible freighter with incredible long-term advantages for our major customers. So anyway, that's where we stand. And in the meantime, there are exemptions that exist within the IT language that have to be accommodated by our U.S. government in some way, shape or form, that allow for a transition strategy to that new kind of opportunity that is ITO compliant. Because you'll recall -- or maybe no or don't know the 7.6 when it moves into like a FedEx or a UPS opportunity, it displaces airplanes that are 40% plus less efficient and most importantly, 40% plus less efficient and most importantly, 40% less environmental friendly. So there is, I think, some transition strategies that can and should be implemented that will help us in that. But we need to step forward on an airplane itself. And yes, so I don't mind tipping my hand. That's what's got my greatest interest."

So there's no -- there's nothing written that says, ""You can't do it."" I mean -- so there's nothing that prevents it. 
And our government fully understands and appreciates the fact that our industry is a leader in the world. And that leadership in China is critical to that and the employment that it, of course, holds. So without them having to sort of launched, this is some big new opening to a structural agreement. We're just going to stay on course and continue to support free trade between these 2 players, both of whom understand the importance. 
And there are plenty of trade partners that exist between China and the United States. And all I have to do is look at all the sort of import numbers in this country and vice versa. It's a big corridor. We just want to be part of that. We want to do it the right way and support our customers. And things have been constructive. If they weren't, I would tell you.

And please encourage everyone you know to get the vaccine, if they haven't already.  
With the onset of COVID-19 roughly 1.5 years ago, our worlds were turned upside down. As an industry, we faced it head-on and work together every step of the way. While there are still ways to go before a full recovery, we're encouraged by the continued progress on vaccine distribution and the uptick in domestic travel. We're also looking forward to further progress on coordinated international travel policies and protocols.  
I've said before that we view this year as a critical inflection point, and it's proving to be just that. We are turning a corner, and the recovery is gaining momentum. Throughout all of this, we are continuously learning and adapting how we operate to best serve our customers, our suppliers, our teammates, our communities and other stakeholders, and I'm proud of how our team has remained focused on our mission.  
Before I go through our business update, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and thank Dave Dohnalek for serving as our interim CFO. Dave is a proven well-respected leader here at Boeing, and I'm grateful for his partnership as we transition. And as you know, we have appointed Brian West to serve as Boeing's next CFO. It's effective August 27. Brian is an exceptional leader with significant financial management and long-term strategic planning experience in complex global organizations across the aerospace, manufacturing and services industries. And thanks to Greg Smith's legacy, he's inheriting a world-class finance team here at Boeing. I've worked directly with Brian previously in my professional career. He has broad operational expertise and will bring great perspective to our business transformation journey and post-pandemic recovery as he joins the team this month. 
With that, let's start with an update on our business on the next chart.  
Overall, we've made important progress in the quarter as our transformation actions began to take -- or get traction. And we focused on improving our performance and driving stability across all of our operations. Let's start with the 737 program where we've made significant headway.  
We resumed 737 MAX deliveries in May and have continued to support our airline customer efforts to return those fleets to service. Excuse me, I'll keep going? Yes.
In the second quarter, we delivered 47 737 MAX airplanes, including our first 737-8200 delivery to Ryanair. The 737 MAX 10 also completed its first flight in June, marking an important milestone for the largest member of the 737 family.  
As you may recall, roughly 9 months ago, we had approximately 450 airplanes in inventory, and we are awaiting approval from the FAA to begin returning the 737 MAX to service. Fast forward to today, and the progress is noteworthy.  
175 countries have now approved the resumption of 737 MAX operations. We've delivered more than 130 airplanes. Our airline customers have returned more than 190 previously grounded airplanes to revenue service. 30 airlines have returned their fleets to service. And those airlines have safely flown nearly 95,000 commercial flights, totaling more than 218,000 flight hours. Importantly, the fleet has an impressive schedule reliability rate of more than 99%.  
Airlines are operating over 1,000 revenue flights daily and just last week, added nearly 3 million 737 MAX seats in the second half 2021 scheduled operations, a testament to the value proposition the airplane family offers. And as domestic traffic recovers, we believe we have started to turn a corner from an overall demand perspective. This is reinforced by 5 straight months of positive net commercial airplane orders, driven primarily by the 737 MAX.  
We are honored by the more than 280 additional orders during the quarter, including those from United Airlines and Southwest Airlines. And we appreciate the trust our customers are placing in Boeing and the 737 family. These orders underscore our customers' commitment to continued fleet modernization as well as the accelerating demand for air travel. These new 737 airplanes are designed to improve the customer experience while significantly lowering carbon emissions per seat. At the end of the quarter, we had over 3,300 aircraft in our 737 backlog.  
We're currently producing 16 airplanes per month and continue to expect to gradually increase the rate to 31 a month in early '22, with further gradual increases to correspond with market demand and importantly, supply chain capacity. We will continue to assess the production rate plan as we monitor the market environment and engage in customer discussions.  
As we previously communicated, the timing of remaining regulatory approvals will shape our delivery plans and our production ramp -- our rate ramp. We continue to work with global regulators and still anticipate that the remaining regulatory approvals will occur this year, including China. And as always, we will follow global regulators' lead in the steps ahead.  
Now I'd like to spend a bit of time on our business transformation efforts. As we've discussed before, our activities in this area are organized around 5 pillars: infrastructure, overhead and organization, supply chain health, portfolio and investment and operational excellence. We've put rigor around each pillar and have detailed projects supporting each one. We are implementing these projects to create long-lasting change, which will improve our competitiveness, help us grow our cash flow and create a foundation to enable us to return to healthy margins even at lower production rates.  
Many of the projects that we're executing have been shared previously and are widely visible, such as consolidating the 787 final assembly in Charleston; optimizing our facilities footprint to reduce nearly 6 million square feet of real estate; and forming strategic partnerships with IT vendors, accelerating our migration to the cloud. Other projects may be less visible externally, but they're improving our productivity, simplifying our operations, reducing bureaucracy and driving first-time quality.  
Through our business transformation efforts over the past year, we've reduced billions of dollars of costs. And our objective is that the majority of the savings is long-lasting, even when volume returns. At the same time, we remain focused on identifying new opportunities to further streamline how we operate. We've started to see the benefits of these efforts in our quarterly financial results, which Dave will go through in more detail.  
As we've discussed previously, we've been adjusting the size of our workforce to align with the commercial market environment reality and lower production rates. We now plan to keep our overall workforce size roughly consistent with where we are today at approximately 140,000. This will allow us to support the encouraging trends we've seen in the commercial market recovery; the growth opportunities in our defense and government services business; and increased investments to strengthen engineering and drive quality and stability into our production system, where the payback is large.  
Going forward, the pace of the commercial market recovery, trade relations with China, production rates and our own performance, our execution will be key factors of our overall employment levels.  
Turning to our efforts to drive stability. With every action we are driving toward engineering excellence, production system stability and first-time quality and delivery predictability, which holding ourselves accountable to the highest standards. We're implementing comprehensive quality and productivity initiatives in our factories and strengthening our quality reviews within our supply chain. We conduct regular audits internally with suppliers to ensure adherence to approve processes and practices ranging from production methods to documentation standards. And as part of our process, we proactively and transparently keep the FAA fully aware of our efforts.  
This enhanced rigor has helped identify areas that we can improve. And by identifying and correcting any issue at the source, while our rates are still relatively low, we can strengthen first-time quality, eliminate traveled work and drive stability and predictability as demand returns. These efforts have played a key role in supporting a healthy and stable rate ramp on the 737 MAX, and we're applying this same approach to the 787.  
Now specifically on the 787 program, I understand the difficulties we have caused by the inconsistency in both our production rate and our delivery cadence. The impacts are felt by our suppliers and by our customers. I also recognize these uncertainties create challenges for the investment community to forecast our performance. We are determined to address these issues and will work tirelessly to do so, just like we have and continue to do on the 737 MAX. We're fully committed to this methodical approach to driving first-time quality and stability in our operations. The issues that our engineering teams have identified, and we are now addressing, are part of this purposeful process, and we have transparently communicated with our regulators and customers every step of the way. We're progressing through these inspections and rework, including the additional work we shared earlier this month. We continue to engage in detailed discussions with the FAA on verification methodologies for the 787. And based on our assessment of the time required, we're reprioritizing production resources for a few weeks to support the inspection and rework.  
As that work is performed, the 787 production rate is now lower than 5 per month and will gradually return to that rate. Exact timing of returning to a rate of 5 per month will depend upon our progress on production stability and delivering airplanes from inventory.  
Of the approximately 100 787s currently in inventory, we expect to deliver fewer than half of them this year. While this has a near-term impact to our operations, I'm confident it's the right course of action, and we will continue to take the time necessary to ensure the highest levels of quality. Although it's been a long journey, we believe we're closer to the end than the beginning.  
Let me touch on the 777, 777X program, before I move to other segments. The combined 777, 777X production rate is 2 per month. We continue to see strong freighter demand as evidenced by orders for 13 777 freighters in the quarter, providing a solid bridge to the 777X.  
On the 777X program, we are subjecting the airplane to a comprehensive test program, designed to demonstrate safety and reliability as well as meet all applicable requirements. We continue to communicate transparently with the FAA and other global regulators about certification. And like any development program, we learn every step of the way. We incorporate feedback from our regulators, and we mature and advance our product with every conversation, every engagement, every test, every review. 
We continue to make progress to the previously shared schedule, including certification work with regulators and conducting Boeing flight tests. The performance data we've collected to date suggests the airplane is performing as we expected and to our customers' commitments. We will be validating these results in the near future, along with continuing to work with the FAA to ensure we meet their requirements prior to beginning certification flight test.  
We continue to expect that we will deliver the first 777X in late 2023, as we shared previously. Meanwhile, we continue delivering for our defense, space and services customers. Dave will go through the financials in more detail in his remarks. But as you can see from the results, both our defense and services businesses had strong financial performance in the quarter. Let me highlight a few accomplishments.  
Our Defense, Space & Security team made history as our MQ-25 test asset completed the first-ever unmanned aerial refueling of another aircraft, the F-18. We also joined the front fuselage of the first production T-7A with its aft section in less than 30 minutes, a testament to the digital advancements of the U.S. Air Force first eSeries aircraft and a demonstration of our model-based engineering and 3D design benefits.  
Earlier this month, the U.S. Air Force approved the KC-46A Tanker for joint forces operational use of the center line hose and drogue refueling system, which provides more daily operational capabilities. KC-46A Tanker is of critical importance to our customer.  
Moving to space. We began stacking the core stage of NASA's Space Launch System rocket, with other Artemis I elements at Kennedy Space Center. And of course, we're looking forward to the uncrewed orbital flight test of our commercial cruise, Starliner vehicle, later this week.  
Additionally, in our Global Services business, we announced that we will be opening 2 new Boeing-converted freighter lines in 2022. We also signed a parts agreement with Turkish Technic and received a key contract to support C-17 training from the U.K. Royal Air Force.  
In addition to program milestones, we made key progress on our sustainability, innovation and technology efforts. Just this week, we published Boeing's first integrated sustainability report, which is an important step in our continued efforts to reinforce our environmental, social and governance principles.  
Also, we recently announced that we're collaborating with Alaska Airlines to fly an Alaska 737-9 aircraft in our ecoDemonstrator program. In fact, today, our ecoDemonstrator aircraft is at Reagan National Airport, demonstrating the key leaders in many of the new technologies and improvements we're making to enhance safety and support a more sustainable future.  
Earlier this month, we also announced a partnership with SkyNRG, focused on advancing the availability and use of sustainable aviation fuels, or SAF, globally. As part of this commitment, we will invest in SkyNRG, America's first dedicated U.S. production facility for SAF, to help establish SAF supply for airports and airline customers largely on the West Coast.  
Now let's turn to the next slide to discuss the industry environment. Our government services, defense and space businesses remain significant and relatively stable. While increased government spending on COVID-19 response is adding pressure to defense budgets in some countries, others are increasing spending on their security. Overall, the global defense market remains strong, and we continue to see solid global demand for our major programs. The diversity of our portfolio will continue to help provide critical stability for us as we move forward.  
Congress has kicked off the annual authorization and appropriation cycle for fiscal year 2022. The President's budget proposal called for strategic investments in Boeing products and services from across the BDS and our BGS portfolios. The budget proposal demonstrates confidence in the capabilities of Boeing's F-15Ex and Apache as well as key commercial derivative programs such as the KC-46 Tanker and space programs like the Space Launch System, SLS, among other platforms.  
The FA-18 and the Chinook Block II remain critical capabilities for the warfighter, both domestically and for non-U.S. customers. We will continue to work with the administration and work with Congress to ensure the necessary support for these key programs are in place.  
In the commercial market, while near-term pressure due to COVID-19 remains, the recovery is accelerating and many of the key long-term fundamentals remain intact. In June, we saw global departures approach 70% of 2019 levels, up from less than 60% in the first quarter. We've seen encouraging signs in some markets, although the recovery continues to be uneven. In the near term, we expect that the environment will remain very challenged for many of our airline customers and the industry as a whole as they adapt to this rapidly evolving travel demand.  
While vaccine dissemination is broadening and some travel restrictions are loosening, others are still in place and some even tightening, which keeps significant pressure on passenger traffic.  
Continuing the positive momentum we saw in the first quarter, domestic traffic is leading the recovery. May domestic traffic was 24% below 2019 levels compared to 50% a quarter before. Since then, it continues to pick up in regions like the U.S. and Europe, and we anticipate continued improvement this summer.  
The U.S. domestic market is showing remarkable recovery, with summer bookings consistent with 2019 levels according to several airlines. TSA average daily throughput has already reached over 2 million passengers, around 80% of 2019 levels. Additionally, some regions such as Europe, India, Latin America are recently seeing double-digit monthly improvements in operations as vaccine rates improve and travel restrictions begin to loosen.  
While the recovery in China has wavered at times due to case rates, it remains robust with operations above 80% of pre-pandemic levels. However, passenger traffic in other parts of the world, such as Southeast Asia, remained significantly lower due to travel restriction, uncertainty and new strains of the virus.  
International operations remain extremely low and May traffic still 85% 2019. And concerns about virus variants and limited coordination on cross-border entry protocols are still significantly hindering recovery in the international segment. Nevertheless, on average, roughly 100 aircraft per week have returned to service over the past 4 months, making the active fleet now approximately 80% of its previous size with single-aisle activity levels slightly above twin aisle. And although utilization rates and load factors are increasing in some areas, they are still below historic levels, which means airlines are flying around 70% of their normal capacity at the global level.  
With the toughest impacts appearing to be in the rearview mirror, airlines are shifting their focus to medium-term fleet planning. The number of aircraft being retired from the active fleet is significant, with around 1,500 airplanes and growing, retired or announced, to be removed since the onset of the pandemic. We anticipate this trend will continue as our customers focus on replacing the oldest, least efficient airplanes with new airplanes that will be as much as 25% to 40% more fuel efficient with commensurate reductions in emission.  
The freighter market continues to be strong with cargo traffic year-to-date through May at 8% higher than 2019. Limited belly cargo capacity from passenger airplanes has resulted in more freighters flying with high load factors. In fact, 72% of air cargo is now being carried on dedicated freighters. That compares to 48% pre-pandemic. This demand is evidenced by orders in the quarter for 31 additional freighter airplanes and strong demand for Boeing-converted freighters. Longer term, cargo demand will continue to be driven by global trade and GDP growth, both of which experienced improvement in the second quarter.  
And we've shared previously, and consistent with IATA and other industry groups, we expect passenger traffic to return to 2019 levels in 2023 to 2024 and then a few years beyond that to return to long-term trend growth. We still see recovery in 3 phases. First, domestic; then regional markets, such as intra-Asia, intra-Europe intra-Americas; and finally, long-haul international routes. Therefore, we expect demand for narrow-body aircraft to recover faster. -- as evidenced by our year-to-date orders for 737 MAX airplanes and demand for wide-body aircraft to remain challenged for a longer period.  
On the global trade environment, we welcome the agreement between European Union and United States that all future government support for the development or production of commercial aircraft must be provided on market terms. We will fully support the U.S. government's efforts to enforce this agreement.  
We are also monitoring U.S. trade -- U.S.-China trade relations, given the importance of the China market to our economy and our industry's recovery as well as our near-term delivery profile and future orders, all of which influence future production rates. We remain in active discussions with our Chinese customers on their fleet planning needs and will continue to engage with leaders in both countries to urge a productive dialogue, reiterating the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry.  
Ultimately, America's leadership in aerospace, as well as the health and stability of millions of commercial aerospace jobs, rely on free and fair trade. And we're confident our leaders understand the importance of this area, not just for our business but for the overall health of our economy and competitiveness.  
Turning to the commercial services market. We saw improved demand in the second quarter as we are rebounding from the trough and as airlines prepared for the summer season. We expect this trend to continue near term, slightly ahead of our expectations. That said, we still anticipate a multiyear recovery that may be uneven.  
Overall industry liquidity, which remains critical for our industry and our industry's bridge to full recovery, it's been improving. Product differentiation and versatility will also be key as airlines adapt to the evolving market realities. I'm confident our product lineup is well positioned, and we're focused on executing to meet our customers' needs.  
The impact of COVID-19 has been significant and a number of challenges remain, but we are seeing signs of recovery. More broadly across the economy, we're now seeing positive indicators for economic growth. And we believe bipartisan agreements on infrastructure investment can further support growth across the economy, not just for airports and highways, but also for the tens and thousands of small businesses and suppliers that contribute to industries like ours all across the country. With economic activities picking up, labor availability within our supply chain is a watch item.  
As we position for a market recovery, we're taking the right actions to manage liquidity and drive long-lasting change to make our business leaner, sharper, more sustainable. We remain committed to safety, quality, transparency, and I'm confident in our path forward.  
And with that, let me turn it over to Dave Dohnalek."

Positive earnings in the quarter also benefited from lower period costs. Additionally, several nonrecurring items favorably contributed to the quarter.  
Income tax in the quarter primarily reflects benefits from a lower valuation allowance.  
Now let's turn to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. Revenue was $6 billion, reflecting higher commercial airplane deliveries. The improvement from the prior year was also due to a $551 million 737 MAX customer consideration impact in the second quarter of last year. Although Commercial Airplanes operating margin continued to be under pressure, it improved in the quarter due to higher commercial airplane deliveries and lower period costs. We delivered 47 MAX airplanes in the second quarter. We currently have approximately 390 MAX aircraft built and stored in inventory. We have made significant progress in our efforts to remarket some of our inventory airplanes and have now largely addressed that issue and put it behind us. Just prior to the 737 MAX return to service in the U.S., we estimated that around half of the approximately 450 aircraft we had in storage would be delivered by the end of 2021 and the majority of the remaining aircraft by the end of 2022. That expectation has not changed. We expect delivery timing in the production rate ramp profile to remain dynamic given the market environment, customer discussions and the remaining global regulatory approvals.  
There is no material change in our assumption for 737 abnormal costs or our assessment of the liability for estimated 737 MAX potential concessions and other considerations to customers.  
Turning to 787. Second quarter deliveries were light as we worked through the activities that Dave just mentioned. Our later -- or our latest assessment of the financial impact of inspections, rework, temporary production rate adjustment and delivery delays has been included in our second quarter closing position. The 787 program margin remains near breakeven. On a cash basis, these additional costs will create a headwind in the near term. However, we still expect overall unit margins to hold up relatively well.  
Moving now to 777X. As Dave mentioned, we still expect first delivery of the 777X to occur in late 2023. We are making progress in our flight test activities. We still expect that the peak use of cash for the 777X program occurred in 2020, and that cash flow will improve as we get closer to EIS and begin deliveries in late 2023. We anticipate the program will turn cash flow positive approximately 1 to 2 years after first delivery.  
We are starting to see improvements in Commercial Airplanes' financial performance due to increasing 737 MAX deliveries and great efforts by the BCA team to manage costs through our business transformation activities. We also captured strong orders in the quarter, which is a testament to the value of our products and our customers' focus shifting now to fleet planning. Although the commercial recovery will take time and we still have work to do, we're on a positive path, and we remain -- and we will remain focused on driving stability on the 787 program and across the business.  
Let's now move to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue increased to $6.9 billion, primarily due to higher volume on the KC-46A Tanker program and the P-8A program. We posted a strong operating margin of 13.9% in the second quarter. The margin increase was driven by lack of a charge on the tanker program as compared to second quarter of 2020 as well as a favorable adjustment on a non-U.S. contract. We received $4 billion in orders during the quarter, including an award for 14 Chinook helicopters for the U.K. Royal Air Force. We also reached an agreement with Germany for 5 P-8A aircraft. BDS backlog is currently valued at $59 billion.  
Now let's turn to Global Services on Slide 7. In the second quarter, Global Services revenue increased to $4.1 billion and operating margin grew to 13.1%, driven by higher commercial services as the market continues recovering from the impact of COVID-19. Operating margin was also helped by lower asset impairments, lower severance costs and a favorable mix of products and services. During the quarter, BGS won key contracts worth approximately $3 billion, resulting in a total backlog now of $19 billion. We saw incremental improvement in commercial services during the second quarter, and we expect the quarterly revenue trend to improve as we support increasing airline flight operations. That said, given the dynamic environment, we can expect to see variability in the revenue and margin trajectory from quarter-to-quarter at BGS.  
Now let's take a look at cash flow on Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the quarter improved significantly to negative $0.5 billion, reflecting higher commercial deliveries, higher order receipts, reduced expenditures on lower wide-body production rates and benefits from our business transformation efforts. While we saw a cash flow benefit from order activity in the second quarter, keep in mind that we continue to expect advanced payment burn-down to be a headwind for the rest of this year and into next.  
Now let's move to Slide 9 and discuss our liquidity position. We ended the second quarter with strong liquidity, including $21.3 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet and access to $14.8 billion from our bank credit facilities, which remain undrawn. Our debt balance remained stable at $63.6 billion at the end of the quarter. We expect to have lower total debt at the end of the year due to the paydown of maturing bonds and potential early paydown of our delayed draw term loan. Given the dynamic environment, we maintain vigilance in managing our cash. Thanks to actions taken throughout the business to enhance our cash balance, we believe we currently have sufficient liquidity. We remain focused on reducing our debt levels and actively managing our balance sheet. Our investment-grade credit rating is important to us, and we will continue to consider all aspects of our capital structure to strengthen our balance sheet.  
Moving to the next slide. In summary, we operate in a dynamic business environment. We are seeing the commercial market recovery accelerating. However, it continues to be uneven across different regions, and the near-term path remains challenging. Given this backdrop, we will continue to diligently cultivate opportunities and monitor risks. Our key enablers include vaccine distribution and travel protocols, U.S.-China trade relations, remaining 737 MAX regulatory approvals and resumption of 787 deliveries. Our financial performance in the second half of this year will largely be driven by these key enablers.  
On cash flow, we still expect full year 2021 to be a use of cash. Despite additional pressure from the updated 787 delivery schedule, our expectations for cash flow this year have not deteriorated due to timing of advanced payment burn-down and favorable order activity. With respect to the quarterly trajectory for the remainder of this year, we expect continued variability in cash flow quarter-over-quarter due to timing of deliveries as well as receipts and expenditures such as expected cash tax benefits and MAX customer settlement payments. We still expect to turn cash flow positive in 2022.  
The key drivers of cash flow in 2022 as compared to this year include continued improvement on the 737 program due to lower customer considerations and higher delivery payments as well as recovery in commercial services. However, advanced payments will still be a headwind in 2022. While our delivery expectations are now higher next year due to some 787 deliveries moving from this year into 2022, the related additional cash flow will be largely offset by the burn-down of advanced payments next year.  
To close, while focusing on safety, quality and operational excellence, our team continues to closely examine all aspects of our business, simplify and streamline everything we do, drive stability in our operations and make long-lasting change.  
I'm honored to be a part of such a strong team and look forward to our bright future. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave Calhoun for closing comments."

Is there any way to quantify what you're gaining in the aircraft business, whether it's a structural cost out or where the MAX and 87 production rates need to be to achieve the margins they had the last cycle or anything along those lines?

And I think you saw some significant progress towards that this quarter to 13.1%. So I think that will depend from quarter-to-quarter on mix. There's variability in many, many programs in BGS, but I think we're seeing positive trajectory there. And we see a path to getting back towards those mid-teen margins over time. 
In BDS, strong quarter on margins with 13.9%. Now some of that was due to, as we mentioned, a higher -- or a benefit from a non-U.S. program adjustment that benefited the quarter. Even if you sort of stripped that out, BDS performed well and in the kind of the low double-digit margin territory that they've been in good times when we're not taking charges. So clearly, the fact that we didn't take any significant charges in the quarter and performed well across the programs, that turned out very well. 
And so then back to BCA, clearly, we're still in negative margin territory, although much better than we've been certainly in recent quarters and compared to the same quarter last year. I think a lot there will be driven by rate. We are ramping up in the 737 MAX program at 16 per month now, moving to 31 per month at the beginning of next year. And we intend to go higher, obviously driven by what we see in the market beyond early next year. And some of that, the key enablers that we just talked about, China being one, are important in that, in addition to just overall traffic trends. So I think for BCA, it's going to be production rate driven, in addition to getting additional traction on the business transformation efforts we've had cutting costs; and then, of course, as Dave mentioned, achieving stability, especially in the 787 program as we work through our final issues there."

No, I don't view this as opportunistic, either on my side or on the customer side.

No, I don't view this as opportunistic, either on my side or on the customer side. When you make decisions to order 270 airplanes and expand your capacity and get aggressive in the marketplace, that is his fundamental decision as it gets, and there's very little with respect to opportunism. 
The good news, when I just evaluate the United order, is they have to consider all of their routes, all of their operations. And then they, as you know, solve for the lowest cost, most efficient delivery of a passenger and a route of a passenger. And then they make choices around the airplanes. The good news is they have history with both manufacturers. So I like the way our product line competed with our competitor. I mean, it was straight up. Out of the 270, we got 200. The models and the routes that they're intended to satisfy, they're optimal for United. And anyway, so I'm quite pleased with how that went and was quite, in my view, strategic and long term. 
And in the case of Southwest, it's the same. Southwest, we benefit from it being an all-Boeing fleet and they benefit from it being all Boeing. But on the other hand, they're doing the same thing as United. These are 2 very strong airlines who are staking out the future and making big strategic decisions to do so. They're extending their reach. They're improving their route structures, et cetera. So I can't see these in any way as being opportunistic. I do think and expect as domestic markets return, recovery is robust. The retirements stay retired, and I believe most of them will, that we're going to end up in that same real estate play going forward, meaning airlines who get aggressive and have balance sheets that are strong, who want to improve their route structures and grow into the market, they'll be the first one to play. 
I can't predict exactly when that happens, just like I couldn't predict when United would step forward or Southwest. But I think these 2 are as strategic as it gets. And we held our ground in posture, and we let the airplanes perform and sell itself. That's really the way it happened."

Certainly, the tailwinds you see are expected higher airplane deliveries, certainly 737 MAXs. And as we work through 787, higher deliveries there, too, once we complete the work and are able to deliver again. 
I think while we're not predicting which quarter this year might be cash flow positive, I think it will be variable. We certainly made a lot of progress from Q1 with the Q2 cash flow performance. I think the rest of the year, I think it will be a balance of higher deliveries and some headwinds from advanced payments, but also benefits from, as Dave mentioned, continued work on the business transformation efforts and also on the expectation that we should be receiving a cash tax benefit sometime in the second half, could be in Q3, could be in Q4. So that would be a benefit to the year as well on cash. But we're not predicting, Kristine, not giving guidance on a quarter for cash flow level.

So let me start by saying this is not the FAA getting tough on Boeing. This is Boeing getting tough on Boeing. We launched a program to inspect. Because we did find some issues by way of notice of escape out of the supply chain. Early on, we decided we would do a nose-to-tail inspection of all of it, Tier 1, Tier 2. And we did exactly all the things you're describing. Are specs too tight? Are the process controls at our suppliers where they need to be? Is the rework operations that we've now put into our operations in Charleston, are they necessary? And are they getting the job done? And in every case, we look for even the smaller -- smallest exception to the tolerances that we've designed. And in every case, we then take a step to, one, identify it. We immediately talk to the FAA about it. Two, we fix it. Three, we make sure it won't happen again. How do you do it? Well, you have teams inside our suppliers working on process control development, understanding of exactly why that spec is necessary and where it is. And on our side, we start putting disciplines in place that make it clear to the supply chain that we're not going to keep our line running if we get one that isn't right. That's a little bit of what's going on here. 
Here's the good news. If we ever had a window to get this behind us once and for all, it's now. We're producing at the lowest rate ever. Customers are not knocking down our door to get their airplanes in light of the COVID impact on international traffic. And so we're very determined to see our way through this. 
Good news, the inspections are done, right, toe to tail. So those inspections are done. Doesn't mean somewhere along the way, a supplier is not going to raise their hand and tell us there's an escape somewhere along the way. But it's not going to be as a result of this big effort that we've put forward here. And each and every one of these issues that we find, we always have a decision to make with respect to compliance, which is that each and every part and every airplane is built precisely to the drawings that we've created, and it's our job to rework the issue. And that is what we're going through. 
I view this as a courageous moment for Boeing. My hats off to our team, believe it or not. All of these conditions were preexisting, my leadership team. So the work they're taking on and the readiness that we're getting in place for what I think is a second half recovery in the wide-body world of next year, that's when I believe that border protocols are going to begin to get understood and predictability will return to the market. When that happens and orders come, we will have to be able to respond to rate increases in a very stable form and fashion. And I think the actions we're taking right now are the most important part of that puzzle. So I really do apologize to investors, and I apologize for guessing that the last issue was our last but we're getting close. And most importantly, the underlying causes are getting understood and resolved."

So again, we don't have like a big inspection program from here forward. This one is, for the most part, complete. And I expect things to change dramatically. But most importantly, the amount of rework we'll eliminate in our factory and the predictability of our supply chain on all these fronts is that much better off. 
Doug, one other comment I want to make, just to make sure everyone knows how important the 87 is. During this COVID period, during this COVID period, no wide-body passenger airplane has been flown more aggressively than the 87. It's everywhere. 90% of that fleet is up and active and being worked as hard as it can be worked. So despite the low numbers with respect to all this international traffic, et cetera, the 87 is the prized asset that's getting worked hard."

You've got orders coming in. So you've got adding and subtracting at the same time. 
So the bottom line for you to think about is that we still do see these PDPs or advances as a headwind through the second half of this year and into next year. It's a headwind we think we will more than overcome because we're predicting or expecting cash flow to be positive  in 2022. But just so it's not off your radar screen, this will be with us for the next number of quarters as we work through these deliveries out of inventory and apply advanced payments case by case, customer by customer. So it's really hard to predict or give guidance there. But net-net, again, 2022, we expect to be positive cash flow, and we would have tailwinds more than offsetting that headwind."

I mean we are -- my view is we are fully funded on the important R&D efforts that will support BCA broadly. I want to separate that from development funding, which is the ongoing certification work associated with the MAX-10, the 777X. And I hope in the relatively near term, a freighter version of that airplane.  
So we are going to be very busy and have been very busy on the development front and spending a fair amount of money on it. I don't expect that number to go up significantly at any different -- at any point in time and even in a relatively near term, not because we're not going to take on new stuff just because.  
And the next comment I would make on just the research front and what is the likely technologies that will surround that next airplane. It's not going to be dramatically different than -- with one exception and that is everything sustainability. That next airplane will have to meet some serious sustainability tests. I do think that sustainable aviation fuel is going to be a big part of that and our propulsion suppliers with respect to the packages that they're now promoting. You may have seen the CFM package most recently with the fan. Anyway, I think it's going to be a fight between sustainability, propulsion packages and meeting that spec. And then for Boeing, it's to make this the most efficient airplane it can possibly be.  
And you may have heard me say, our investments in the underlying modeling technologies that have to be deployed, applying the digital thread that we have in our defense programs to the commercial programs, that is critically important to this next development. It will shorten the cycle on development. It will improve the productivity on the program itself. And that's critical.  
And then finally, just our production system will be quite different as we think about it. And we have very active programs on both the modeling and production system to be ready for that moment. So that's a lot. But I'm quite -- I'm actually quite confident that our R&D budgets are what they ought to be and quite robust relative to the needs of our BCA business."

And then that begins to make a big dent, and I'm pretty confident we can do that.  
We have derisked our year largely for China. So they become next year's risk with respect to delivery. So we'll run that play and that ramp as hard as we can. We will have signals with respect to where China is well before that. And if we have to make adjustments, we will. But I do think we are prepared for that delivery rate. And I think we're close to have already demonstrated. I think we delivered over 30, I don't think I know, over 30 in the month of June.  
We've got big teams. They know how to do it. The FAA has granted us our authorities, and we are -- we're running full speed. So -- and as I said, the performance of the airplane has been fantastic.

And it will be an incredible freighter with incredible long-term advantages for our major customers. So anyway, that's where we stand. And in the meantime, there are exemptions that exist within the ICAO language that have to be accommodated by our U.S. government in some way, shape or form, that allow for a transition strategy to that new kind of opportunity that is ICAO compliant. Because you'll recall -- or maybe no or don't know the 76, when it moves into like a FedEx or a UPS opportunity, it displaces airplanes that are 40%-plus less efficient and most importantly, 40% less environmentally friendly.

So there's no -- there's nothing written that says, ""You can't do it."" I mean -- so there's nothing that prevents it. 
And our government fully understands and appreciates the fact that our industry is a leader in the world. And that leadership in China is critical to that and the employment that it, of course, holds. So without them having to sort of launch, this is some big new opening to a structural agreement. We're just going to stay on course and continue to support free trade between these 2 players, both of whom understand the importance. 
And there are plenty of trade partners that exist between China and the United States, and all I have to do is look at all the sort of import numbers in this country and vice versa.

I hope you're staying well as we navigate to the other side of this crazy global pandemic.
We continue to work with our customers, our suppliers and our partners to stabilize our industry and chart the path to recovery. While this summer brought us new challenges with the variants, we have seen encouraging signs of increased vaccination rates, further progress on coordinated international travel policies and protocols and ongoing discussions with customers on their fleet planning.
As expected, the recovery has been uneven. However, it continues to gain broader momentum, giving us confidence in the resilience of our market. Vaccines have proven safe and effective, and they're key to personal health and to reopening the global economy, reopening travel routes and businesses. Our customers, both commercial and defense, have implemented vaccine mandates for their employee populations. 
After careful review and consideration and to ensure compliance with President Biden's executive order, we are implementing a requirement for U.S.-based employees to show proof of being fully vaccinated from COVID-19 or have an approved reasonable accommodation. As we have done since the beginning of the pandemic, we will continue to prioritize the health and the safety of our employees.
We are making important progress in transforming our business, driving stability and quality in our operations and investing for the future. I'm proud of our team's continued resiliency and unwavering focus on our mission. 
Before I go through our business update, I'd like to formally welcome Brian West, our new CFO, who is with us here today. In the 2 months since Brian started, he has spent countless hours at our operational sites with the finance and the broader teams, digging into issues, gaining an in-depth understanding of our business. Brian is an exceptional leader and we're grateful to have him on board. 
With that, let's start with an update on the business in the next chart. Beginning with the 737 program, we continue delivering to our customers and supporting their efforts to return their fleets to service. In the third quarter, we delivered 62 737 MAX airplanes, the most we've delivered since the first quarter of 2019. We have made noteworthy progress since receiving approval from the FAA. And today, over 175 countries have approved the resumption of 737 MAX operations. We've delivered more than 195 airplanes, including about 1/3 of the 450 airplanes originally in inventory.
We have largely placed the airplanes that required remarketing. Our airline customers have returned more than 200 previously grounded airplanes to revenue service. 31 airlines have returned their fleets to service. And those airlines have safely flown over 206,000 commercial flights, totaling more than 500,000 flight hours.
Importantly, the fleet has an impressive schedule reliability rate of more than 99%. And as domestic and regional traffic recovers, for example, Intra-Europe, demand for the 737 MAX continues to improve. In September, we saw the eighth straight month of positive net commercial airplane orders, primarily due to the 737 MAX. At the end of the quarter, we had over 3,300 aircraft in our 737 backlog highlighting the airplane's family's value proposition. 
Given this demand during the third quarter, we increased our production rate to 19 airplanes per month and continue to progress toward a production rate of 31 per month in early 2022. While we continue to deliver from inventory, we are balancing the need to increase the production rate to position us to support increasing demand longer term.
We're actively working to ensure the production system, including the supply chain, is stable prior to making decisions to further increase the production rate. Raw materials, logistics and labor availability will also be key watch items for future rate increases.
As we previously communicated, the timing of remaining regulatory approvals will shape our near-term delivery plans and our production rate ramp beyond 31 per month. Following the completion of the 737 MAX flight test in China during the third quarter, we continue to work toward approval by the end of the year, with a resumption of deliveries to follow in the first quarter of next year. We also continue to make progress on the certification of the 737 MAX 7 and the MAX 10. We currently anticipate the first delivery of the MAX 7 in early 2022 and the first delivery of the MAX 10 in 2023. As always, we will follow global regulators lead in the steps ahead on all certification matters.
On the 787 program, we remain fully committed to our methodical approach to driving first-time quality and stability in our operations. The issues that our engineering teams and/or our suppliers have identified and are addressing are part of this purposeful process, and we have transparently communicated with our regulators, our customers and our suppliers every step of the way.
As recently shared, we have also identified quality issues with a sub-tier part supplier. And while our review is ongoing, there are no immediate safety of flight concerns. We are in regular communication with the FAA on these issues and are committed to taking any action required to address them.
As to the 787 generally, we are conducting inspections and rework, and we continue to engage in detailed discussions with the FAA regarding the required actions for resuming deliveries. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to reprioritize production resources to support the inspection and the rework and are currently producing at a rate of approximately 2 airplanes per month. Once deliveries resume, we expect to return to 5 per month over time.
Keep in mind, exact timing of deliveries and future production rates will depend upon inspections and rework, ongoing customer and supplier conversations, production stability and our activities with the FAA. Again, our regulators will make the ultimate determination, but we believe we have a clear line of sight to the steps ahead, and we are continuing to make steady progress to begin delivering airplanes to our customers.
Moving to the 777, the 777X program. The combined production rate is 2 per month. Given continued strength in freighter demand, we have coordinated with our supply chain and our increasing 777 freighter production capacity in the near term. We now expect 2022 777 deliveries to be relatively in line with 2021.
On the 777X program, we continue to subject the airplane to a comprehensive test program to demonstrate its safety, its performance and reliability while working through our rigorous development process to ensure we meet all applicable requirements. We continue to engage with the FAA and global regulators throughout this process. And like any development program, we are learning along the way and incorporating those learnings into our plans.
As we progress in our certification work, we continue to conduct Boeing flight tests and began engine performance flight testing earlier this month. The airplane is performing well and in line with our customer commitments based on the data that we've collected to date. We will validate these results, and we will continue to work with the FAA to ensure we meet their requirements prior to beginning the certification flight test. We still expect that we will deliver the first 777X in late 2023.
Given the continued robust freighter demand and the compelling economics of the 777X, we are currently evaluating the timing of launching a freighter version of our 777X airplane. We will keep you updated as we progress in this evaluation.
In addition, for the 737 MAX, the MAX 10 and the 777X, we are investing in our future laying the foundation for our next commercial airplane development program. This quarter, we stood up an integrated product team to bring together a digital environment where the next commercial new airplane and production system can be designed together. While we have not launched a new airplane, this is an important step in our digitization journey and our development journey to evaluate how we holistically design, build, test, certify and support the airplane and production system. It will build on the invaluable experience of our recent defense programs.
Meanwhile, we continue to execute for our customers across our business. Let me highlight a few key milestones. Our Defense, Space & Security team made progress on key programs. For example, our MQ-25 unmanned test asset completed aerial refueling of a F-35C fighter jet and an E-2D command and control aircraft. We also delivered 37 aircraft in the quarter, including the first CH-47F Chinook to the Royal Australian Army. 
As was recently shared, the NASA and Boeing teams have identified the most probable cause of the valve malfunction on our commercial cruise Starliner, and we are working through corrective and preventative actions. We are currently working toward opportunities for the second orbital flight test launch in 2022, pending hardware readiness to rocket manifest and space station availability. As we have demonstrated, we will continue to prioritize the safety of our employees, crewmembers and spacecraft as we progress.
In our Global Services business, our team continued to perform and demonstrate sustained recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. As cargo demand increases, we announced plans to create additional capacity for the 767-300 Boeing converted freighter. In addition to these program accomplishments, we continue to make progress on our commitment to drive the future of sustainable aviation.
Boeing recently joined a virtual White House event on sustainable aviation, reiterating our commitment to have our commercial airplanes capable of running on 100% sustainable aviation fuels by 2030 and our partnership with Sky NRG to expand the global supply of sustainable aviation fuel. We also hosted a 2-day Boeing Innovation Forum in Glasgow, bringing together partners in the region, customers, aviation experts and STEM students to accelerate efforts to ensure a safe and sustainable aerospace future.
We were also excited to participate in the IATA Annual General Meeting to discuss our path toward a more sustainable future and how we can support the aviation sector's commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In fact, just yesterday, our Chief Technology Officer, along with the CTOs from 6 other leading aerospace manufacturing companies, reaffirmed our commitment to reaching this industry-wide target.
Now let's turn to the next slide to discuss the industry environment. Last month, we released our 2021 Boeing market outlook, which forecasts a total market value of $9 trillion over the next decade. This is up from $8.5 trillion a year ago and from $8.7 trillion in the pre-pandemic 2019 forecast, reflecting the market's continued recovery. The forecast closely aligns to what we laid out last year.
Our government services, defense and space markets remain significant and relatively stable. While increased government spending on COVID-19 response is adding pressure to defense budgets in some countries, others are increasing spending on their security. Overall, the global defense market remains strong and enduring with all of our major programs.
We remain focused on delivering the highest quality, innovative, capable and affordable platforms to the war fighter and maintaining the health of our supplier base. The diversity of our portfolio creates new opportunities and continues to help provide critical stability for us as we move forward. We continue to focus on our customers' needs, expanding capabilities on our trusted platforms, investing in next-generation technologies like autonomy and building on our foundation in model-based engineering to deliver and intelligently support key franchise programs like the T-7A and the MQ-25. 
We see strong continued bipartisan support for U.S. national security, including strategic investments in Boeing products and services as Congress works through its annual budget and authorization process for fiscal year 2022. The FA 18 and the Chinook Block II remain critical capabilities for the warfighter both domestically and for non-U.S. customers. We will continue to work with the administration and with Congress to ensure the necessary support for these key programs is in place.
The commercial market is shaping up largely as we expected. While near-term pressure due to COVID-19 continues, the recovery is broadening and the key long-term fundamentals remain strong. We've seen positive momentum in some markets. However, the recovery continues to be uneven. In the third quarter, we saw global departures increased slightly to an average of 67% of 2019 levels, up from 59% the previous quarter.
Similar to what we saw in the first half of the year, domestic traffic is leading to recovery. However, traffic took a slight step back in the late summer due to the Delta variant and increased travel restrictions, resulting in global August domestic traffic of approximately 30% below 2019 levels. Since then, it has shown signs of improvement, most notably in the domestic China market.
The U.S. domestic market continues to be a bright spot in the recovery with TSA screenings resuming an upward weekly trend since mid-September, and peak travel days are reaching 80% to 85% of 2019 volumes. We are also seeing the recovery accelerate in more parts of the world which reduced travel restrictions and coordinated protocols. Japan's domestic traffic is accelerating after the country recently dropped its COVID state of emergency, and European airlines have seen large booking spikes following the U.S. decision to open the vaccinated foreign travelers in November.
Passenger traffic in other parts of the world, particularly Southeast Asia, remained significantly lower due to continued travel restriction, uncertainty and case rates. Even there, however, there is increasing momentum for air travel as vaccination rates climb. 
International operations are starting to see incremental improvement, with August traffic 69% below 2019, which was an improvement from June and July. And we're seeing promising signs of entry protocols loosening across the transatlantic corridor. Despite this progress, international traffic is still a long way from full recovery. Limited coordination on travel protocols are still significantly hindering traffic in the International segment. 
Yet the active fleet is now approximately 85% of its previous size, with single-aisle activity levels slightly above twin aisle. With utilization rates and load factors still below historic levels, airlines are flying around 60% of their normal global capacity. Recent changes to government policies could accelerate this to 70% by year-end.
However, we have seen continued variability in capacity due to supply chain and logistics challenges our customers are facing. As the recovery continues to expand, airlines are shifting their focus to medium-term fleet planning. As part of this assessment, airlines have retired or announced plans to retire around 1,500 airplanes since the onset of the pandemic. We anticipate this trend will continue as our customers modernize their fleets to reduce carbon emissions and an increased operational efficiency.
With oil prices today approximately 30% higher than at the end of 2019, operating efficiency is top of mind for most of our customers. The new airplanes we deliver will be as much as 25% to 40% more fuel efficient with commensurate reductions in emissions compared to the airplanes they replaced. The freighter market remains robust, with cargo traffic 8% higher year-to-date through August compared to 2019. With limited belly cargo capacity on passenger airlines, more dedicated freighters are being utilized to transport cargo. This is resulting in healthy demand for our freighter offerings, with 24 additional freighter airplanes ordered in the quarter and strong demand for Boeing converted freighters. In fact, our converted and new freighter orders through the first 9 months of this year have already surpassed our highest annual freighter tally in history. 
As we look to the medium and long term, we see our original forecast still holds. We continue to expect passenger traffic to return to 2019 levels in '23 to '24, and then a few years beyond that to return to long-term growth trends. We still see recovery in 3 phases. First, domestic, then regional markets such as intra-Asia, intra-Europe and intra-Americas flights, and finally, long-haul international routes. 
We've seen this phased recovery translate into demand with strong 737 MAX orders this year, which mainly support domestic markets. We anticipate demand for wide-body aircraft to take longer in line with the international traffic recovery. 
Our 10-year commercial airplane market outlook is largely unchanged from what we assumed a year ago, reflecting the impacts of the global pandemic as well as the ongoing market recovery. From now until 2030, we forecast demand for over 14,000 single-aisle airplanes such as the 737 MAX, which equates to roughly 115 to 130 airplanes per month.
From a 20-year perspective, we still see the impact of COVID, but to a lesser extent, as traffic reverts to long-term trends. Through 2040, we project demand for about 43,500 new airplanes, an increase of about 500 planes over last year's forecast. And as air travel grows, we're committed to reaching sustainability goals and future guidelines through government and industry partnerships and a combination of technology, policy and operational advances.
And a significant area of growth, projected demand has increased for dedicated freighters, including new and converted models. With sustained demand for air cargo tied to expanding e-commerce and air freight's speed and reliability, we project the global freighter fleet in 2040 will be 70% larger than the pre-pandemic fleet.
On the global trade front, we continue to support and monitor U.S.-China trade relations, given the importance of the Chinese market to our economy and our industry's recovery as well as our near-term delivery profile and future orders, all of which influence future production rates. We remain in active discussions with our Chinese customers on their fleet planning needs and continue to urge leaders in both countries to resolve trade differences by reiterating the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry.
Ultimately, America's leadership in aerospace as well as the health and stability of millions of commercial aerospace jobs rely on free and fair trade, and we are confident our leaders understand the importance of this area, not just for our business but for the overall health of our economy and competitiveness.
Turning to the commercial services market. We saw demand improve again in the third quarter as we supported airlines during their peak summer season. We expect this trend to continue near term, slightly ahead of our expectations. That said, we still anticipate a multiyear recovery that may be uneven. Liquidity is improving across the industry, and managing liquidity remains critical for the aerospace industry's bridge to full recovery.
As we highlighted previously, product differentiation and versatility will be a key as airlines adapt to evolving market realities. In fact, the 787 has been the most utilized wide-body airplane during the pandemic and demand for the MAX continues to grow. So far this year, we have sold more than 550 737s across each of the models from dash 7 to dash 10, reflecting the value of versatility and commonality. I'm confident our product line is well positioned, and we're focused on executing to meet that customer demand.
Despite the continued challenges our industry is facing due to COVID-19, passenger traffic is increasing. And more broadly, we're seeing incrementally positive indicators for economic growth. With economic activity picking up, labor availability within our supply chain will be the critical watch item.
As we position for a robust recovery, we're focused on delivering for our customers and capturing the opportunities ahead. We're maintaining and in some cases, expanding key investments in strategic processes, technologies and capabilities that will define our future. And whether we're investing in manufacturing technology, digital engineering, technology advances, autonomous solutions, supply chain capability, or platform designs, sustainability will be a key factor in every decision.
We're continuing our transformational efforts to create long-lasting value, which will improve our performance, help us generate positive cash flow and create a foundation to enable us to return to healthy margins. While we do this, we remain committed to safety, quality and transparency, and I'm confident in our future. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brian."

In the short time I've been here, the priorities couldn't be more clear. deliver for our customers, drive the highest levels of safety, quality and stability in all we do, innovate for the future and generate positive, sustainable free cash flow. While we have our share of challenges, I'm impressed with the team and confident in our path forward. 
Let's turn to Slide 4, please. Third quarter revenue increased to $15.3 billion, primarily due to higher commercial deliveries and commercial services volume. We recorded a $0.60 loss per share in the quarter primarily driven by higher commercial volume, partially offset by lower tax benefits. Third quarter 2021 was also impacted by 787 abnormal costs and the Commercial Crew Starliner charge. 
Now let's move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. Revenue was $4.5 billion, reflecting higher 737 deliveries, partially offset by lower 787 deliveries. Although Commercial Airplanes' operating margin continue to be under pressure, it improved in the quarter due to higher commercial airplane deliveries and the BCA backlog is currently valued at $290 billion. 
Moving to the 737 MAX. We delivered 62 airplanes in the quarter. We currently have approximately 370 MAX airplanes built and stored in inventory, including those that we have successfully remarketed. We know where the vast majority of the airplanes are going given the demand, and we anticipate delivering most of these airplanes by the end of 2023. This assumes we resume delivery to our customers in China during the first quarter of 2022.
This delivery timing and the production rate ramp profile remains dynamic, given the market environment, customer discussions, regulatory approvals and supply chain stability. There is no material change to our assumptions for the 737 abnormal costs or our assessment of the liability for estimated 737 MAX potential concessions and other considerations to customers.
Turning to the 787. We did not deliver any 787s in the third quarter while we continue our reviews and work with the FAA as Dave mentioned. In line with our accounting practices, we recorded $183 million of abnormal costs in the third quarter due to the low rate of 787 production as well as inspection and rework costs. These costs will continue in future periods while we complete the rework, and we remain at an abnormally low production rate. We currently anticipate total 787 abnormal costs to be approximately $1 billion. 
Our latest assessment of the financial impact of these abnormal costs and the estimated impacts of delayed deliveries to customers has been included in our third quarter closing position. The 787 program margin remains near breakeven. We still expect overall unit margins to hold up relatively well, and we're confident in the demand and the health of the 787 program over the long term.
As we ended the third quarter, we have approximately 105 787s in inventory. Timing of deliveries will be dependent upon completing necessary inspections and rework, ongoing fleet planning conversations with our customers and closing out our activities with the FAA. While the commercial recovery will take time, we remain focused on driving stability on the 787 program and across the business. As we've bridged to the recovery, we expect improvements in Commercial Airplanes' financial performance due to increasing deliveries and continued efforts by the BCA team to transform for the future.
Let's now move to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 6. Third quarter revenue decreased slightly to $6.6 billion, and operating margin was 6.6%, primarily due to a $185 million earnings charge on our Commercial Crew Starliner program driven by the second uncrewed orbital flight test now anticipated in 2022 and the latest assessment of remaining work.
We received $6 billion in orders during the quarter, including an award for 4 Chinook Block II helicopters to the U.S. Army and a JDM contract for the U.S. Air Force. We also received the award from Germany for 5 P-8A aircraft. The BDS backlog is currently valued at $58 billion.
Let's now turn to Global Services on Slide 7. In the third quarter, Global Services revenue increased to $4.2 billion, and operating margin grew to 15.3% and driven by higher commercial services as the market recovers for the impacts of COVID-19. Operating margin was also favorably impacted by lower severance costs and mix of products and services.
During the quarter, BGS won key contracts worth approximately $4 billion, including 12 additional 737-800 Boeing converted freighters for B ban and an award for performance-based logistics support of the global C-17 fleet. Total backlog remains at $19 billion.
We continue to see incremental improvement in commercial services during the third quarter, and we expect the quarterly revenue trend to improve as we support increasing airline flight operations. Looking ahead, we expect the continued commercial market recovery to drive commercial services to increase as a percentage of total BGS revenue. 
Let's now turn to cash flow on Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $0.3 billion, reflecting higher commercial deliveries, higher order receipts, reduced expenditures on lower wide-body production rates and importantly, benefits from our business transformation efforts. Operating cash flow was favorably impacted by a $1.3 billion income tax refund. While we continue to see a cash flow benefit from order activity, and we saw some advanced payment timing benefit in the third quarter, we still expect advanced payment burn down to be a headwind through next year.
Let's move to Slide 9 and discuss our liquidity position. We ended the third quarter with solid liquidity, including $20 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet. We have access to a total of $14.7 billion across our bank credit facilities, which remain undrawn. Our debt balance decreased by $1.2 billion from last quarter to $62.4 billion, driven by the paydown of bond maturities.
As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to have lower total debt at the end of the year due to the paydown of maturing bonds and early paydown of the remaining $4 billion delayed draw term loan. Given continued uncertainties in our environment, we are vigilantly managing our cash. We've seen our cash balance begin to stabilize due to prudent actions taken across the business and increasing commercial deliveries. Therefore, we believe we currently have sufficient liquidity.
We remain committed to reducing debt levels and actively managing the balance sheet. Our investment-grade credit rating is very important to us, and we will consider all aspects of our capital structure to strengthen our balance sheet. Cash flow expectations are largely unchanged from what we shared last quarter. We still expect full year 2021 to be a use of cash and turn cash flow positive in 2022. As always, cash flow may vary quarter-over-quarter due to timing of deliveries as well as receipts and expenditures, including the potential of further cash tax benefits and MAX customer settlement payments.
The key driver of cash flow in 2022 compared to 2021 is higher 737 and 787 delivery volume. The significant working capital benefit of delivering air plays from inventory will have some offset from the reduction to the devances and progress payments balance. As we previously shared, our advantage balance largely reflects delivery plans from before the pandemic and MAX production pause. While we anticipate a meaningful burn down next year, we expect the balance will normalize by the end of 2022. 
Also keep in mind, there will be an impact to cash flow in 2022 for compensation to customers for delivery delays and some headwind from the strong 2021 order book, which helped fill the near-term skyline and improved cash flow in this calendar year. As we bridge to sustainable free cash flow generation, we continue to proactively manage our liquidity and look to strengthen our balance sheet.
In closing, while our business environment is dynamic, we're confident in the future. The key enablers for our business and our financial performance for the remainder of this year and into 2022 include, vaccine distribution and travel protocols, which will ultimately facilitate the commercial market recovery; remaining 737 MAX regulatory approvals; U.S.-China trade relations; and resumption of 787 deliveries. 
Our team continues to closely examine all aspects of our business, simplify and streamline our work and make long-lasting change. Above all else, we'll stay focused on safety, quality, stability, innovation while generating sustainable free cash flow.
With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for closing comments."

And this is understandably helped with getting deliveries out in a tough demand environment. And I think of it as many of your customers are effectively seeing a discount through compensation. 
But 2 issues around that. First, how complete are your compensation negotiations at this point? In other words, is the remaining $3.4 billion largely spoken for, and it's just a matter of paying it out over time? And then second, how do you work with new customers to see if I'm an airline, I look at others benefiting from these effective discounts and discounts that would not be available to me potentially? And is this an issue that can hold back new MAX orders or put added pressure on pricing?"

No negotiation is complete until it's complete. So I can't be perfectly accurate on this front. But the lion's share are, in fact, in the rearview mirror. And we know where the wiggle room is with respect to the -- we think the final ones.
On the other hand, I'll never say we're done until we're done. I am quite confident that pricing discipline going forward has been and will continue to be sustained and maintained. And I think as we shift from what used to be a demand problem to more of a supply problem in the course of next calendar year, that, in fact, all of the trends are in our favor on that front.
So I really -- I think this has been managed well in the separation of those issues. And I think we're in a pretty good and disciplined place with respect to pricing."

So I wish I could give you a little more clarity. It's going to be when it's going to be with respect to increasing the rates and also beginning deliveries because we really do have to get through these issues that prevent us from getting ticketed. 
While I believe we have clear line of sight on the issues, we've got to give our own teams and then the FAA time to get through all their analytics and agree with everything that we're doing with respect to the rework plans, et cetera. We are well through it, but we're not through it. So until that happens, until we can announce deliveries commenting, it's going to be hard for me to give you guidance. 
With respect to demand, look, if I thought we were going to be at something below 5 a month anytime soon, I would make bigger adjustments and we'd have less of an abnormal cost scenario. Abnormal costs for me are important cost to keep this line up, running fresh and ready when 5 comes back. And so that's where we are. 
And I also just happen to believe on the basis of the testimony from customers and their experience with the airplane. As I said, and I reiterate the irony of the whole story is it's the most utilized wide-body out there. It's delivering on efficiency. It's delivering on everything we promised. It's got cargo capability, which has been an important factor in the way the role that it's played. 
It's just -- I think the demand is going to be quite robust. And I think as we get to the second half of next year, that will begin to play out for all of us. But at this moment in time, I just can't be real definitive until we commence deliveries."

So far, our experience is that there have been pauses that the FAA has taken maintaining the same posture that they did with the MAX. 
Boeing get your house in order before we run this test, Boeing do this before we do that. And we have stuck to that discipline. And that has -- that was all part of the original plan and the timing for fourth quarter of '23. So we're still on that plan.

So that process just takes time. We have, of course, segmented those parts. We believe we're in a good place. We don't believe there's safety ramifications. On the other hand, on the subject of compliance, we have to make sure we're compliant with the material specs that are included in our design.
So that just takes some time. We are working our way through it. We're well past halfway. We're working our way down to the finish line, but that was the one that sort of added some time to this. And then with respect to the workload, it's 90% Boeing. We're the ones that have to satisfy ourselves that we're compliant. And then the FAA has to agree with those set of analytics, and they have to agree with all of our -- ultimately the judgments we make. And that's reasonably well in hand.

I -- the bigger source of variability with respect to completions and deliveries is on the inventoried airplanes that we are bringing back -- that we're bringing into service as opposed to ones coming fresh off the production line. So there's -- of course, as you know, there's a lot of warming up. There's a lot of things that you have to do. And depending on what you find, you've got to do the work to make sure the readiness is what it needs to be.
And we've said to the team, take all the time you need to get that exactly right. We're going to do this one airplane at a time. So we still have more variability in that than I'd like to have -- we are getting a little more stable. I think as we move into next year, we're going to be quite stable on that front. But at any rate, that has been the source of most of our delivery variation on the MAX.
And we got to keep -- we do have to keep that discipline. That is why we're at the reliability rates where at, which is extremely high."

Now remember, international ops for almost all of our customers are still significantly below where they used to be. So when do they want them? How does it melded into their fleet plan?

I hope you're staying well as we navigate through the other side of this crazy global pandemic.We continue to work with our customers, our suppliers and our partners to stabilize our industry and chart the path",3287,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I hope you're staying well as we navigate through the other side of this crazy global pandemic.
We continue to work with our customers, our suppliers and our partners to stabilize our industry and chart the path to recovery. While this summer brought us new challenges with the variants, we have seen encouraging signs of increased vaccination rates, further progress on coordinated international travel policies and protocols and ongoing discussions with customers on their fleet planning.
As expected, the recovery has been uneven. However, it continues to gain broader momentum, giving us confidence in the resilience of our market. Vaccines have proven safe and effective, and they're key to personal health and to reopening the global economy, reopening travel routes and businesses. Our customers, both Commercial and Defense, have implemented vaccine mandates for their employee populations.
After careful review and consideration and to ensure compliance with President Biden's executive order, we are implementing a requirement for U.S.-based employees to show proof of being fully vaccinated from COVID-19 or have an approved reasonable accommodation. As we have done since the beginning of the pandemic, we will continue to prioritize the health and the safety of our employees.
We are making important progress in transforming our business, driving stability and quality in our operations and investing for the future. I'm proud of our team's continued resiliency and unwavering focus on our mission.
Before I go through our business update, I'd like to formally welcome Brian West, our new CFO, who is with us here today. In the 2 months since Brian started, he has spent countless hours at our operational sites with the finance and the broader teams, digging into issues, gaining an in-depth understanding of our business. Brian is an exceptional leader and we're grateful to have him on board.
With that, let's start with an update on the business in the next chart. Beginning with the 737 program, we continue delivering to our customers and supporting their efforts to return their fleets to service. In the third quarter, we delivered 62 737 MAX airplanes, the most we've delivered since the first quarter of 2019. We have made noteworthy progress since receiving approval from the FAA. And today, over 175 countries have approved the resumption of 737 MAX operations. We've delivered more than 195 airplanes, including about 1/3 of the 450 airplanes originally in inventory.
We have largely placed the airplanes that required remarketing. Our airline customers have returned more than 200 previously grounded airplanes to revenue service. 31 airlines have returned their fleets to service and those airlines have safely flown over 206,000 commercial flights, totaling more than 500,000 flight hours.
Importantly, the fleet has an impressive schedule reliability rate of more than 99%. And as domestic and regional traffic recovers, for example, intra-Europe, demand for the 737 MAX continues to improve. In September, we saw the eighth straight month of positive net commercial airplane orders, primarily due to the 737 MAX. At the end of the quarter, we had over 3,300 aircraft in our 737 backlog, highlighting the airplane's families value proposition.
Given this demand during the third quarter, we increased our production rate to 19 airplanes per month and continue to progress toward a production rate of 31 per month in early 2022. While we continue to deliver from inventory, we are balancing the need to increase the production rate to position us to support increasing demand longer term.
We're actively working to ensure the production system, including the supply chain, is stable prior to making decisions to further increase the production rate. Raw materials, logistics and labor availability will also be key watch items for future rate increases.
As we previously communicated, the timing of remaining regulatory approvals will shape our near-term delivery plans and our production rate ramp beyond 31 per month. Following the completion of the 737 MAX flight test in China during the third quarter, we continue to work toward approval by the end of the year, with a resumption of deliveries to follow in the first quarter of next year. We also continue to make progress on the certification of the 737 MAX 7 and the MAX 10. We currently anticipate the first delivery of the MAX 7 in early 2022 and the first delivery of the MAX 10 in 2023. As always, we will follow global regulators' lead in the steps ahead on all certification matters.
On the 787 program, we remain fully committed to our methodical approach to driving first-time quality and stability in our operations. The issues that our engineering teams and/or our suppliers have identified and are addressing are part of this purposeful process, and we have transparently communicated with our regulators, our customers and our suppliers every step of the way.
As recently shared, we have also identified quality issues with a sub-tier parts supplier. And while our review is ongoing, there are no immediate safety of flight concerns. We are in regular communication with the FAA on these issues and are committed to taking any action required to address them.
As to the 787 generally, we are conducting inspections and rework, and we continue to engage in detailed discussions with the FAA regarding the required actions for resuming deliveries. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to reprioritize production resources to support the inspection and the rework, and are currently producing at a rate of approximately 2 airplanes per month. Once deliveries resume, we expect to return to 5 per month over time.
Keep in mind, exact timing of deliveries and future production rates will depend upon inspections and rework, ongoing customer and supplier conversations, production stability and our activities with the FAA. Again, our regulators will make the ultimate determination, but we believe we have a clear line of sight to the steps ahead, and we are continuing to make steady progress to begin delivering airplanes to our customers.
Moving to the 777 and the 777X program. The combined production rate is 2 per month. Given continued strength in freighter demand, we have coordinated with our supply chain and are increasing 777 freighter production capacity in the near term. We now expect 2022 777 deliveries to be relatively in line with 2021.
On the 777X program, we continue to subject the airplane to a comprehensive test program to demonstrate its safety, its performance and reliability while working through our rigorous development process to ensure we meet all applicable requirements. We continue to engage with the FAA and global regulators throughout this process and like any development program, we are learning along the way and incorporating those learnings into our plans.
As we progress in our certification work, we continue to conduct Boeing flight tests and began engine performance flight testing earlier this month. The airplane is performing well and in line with our customer commitments based on the data that we've collected to date. We will validate these results, and we will continue to work with the FAA to ensure we meet their requirements prior to beginning the certification flight test. We still expect that we will deliver the first 777X in late 2023.
Given the continued robust freighter demand and the compelling economics of the 777X, we are currently evaluating the timing of launching a freighter version of our 777X airplane. We will keep you updated as we progress in this evaluation.
In addition, for the 737 MAX 7, the MAX 10 and the 777X, we are investing in our future, laying the foundation for our next commercial airplane development program. This quarter, we stood up an integrated product team to bring together a digital environment where the next commercial new airplane and production system can be designed together. While we have not launched a new airplane, this is an important step in our digitization journey and our development journey to evaluate how we holistically design, build, test, certify and support the airplane and production system. It will build on the invaluable experience of our recent Defense programs.
Meanwhile, we continue to execute for our customers across our business. Let me highlight a few key milestones. Our Defense, Space & Security team made progress on key programs. For example, our MQ-25 unmanned test asset completed aerial refueling of a F-35C fighter jet and an E-2D command and control aircraft. We also delivered 37 aircraft in the quarter, including the first CH-47F Chinook to the Royal Australian Army.
As was recently shared, the NASA and Boeing teams have identified the most probable cause of the valve malfunction on our commercial cruise Starliner, and we are working through corrective and preventative actions. We are currently working toward opportunities for the second orbital flight test to launch in 2022, pending hardware readiness to rocket manifest and space station availability. As we have demonstrated, we will continue to prioritize the safety of our employees, crew members and spacecraft as we progress.
In our Global Services business, our team continued to perform and demonstrate sustained recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. As cargo demand increases, we announced plans to create additional capacity for the 767-300 Boeing converted freighter. In addition to these program accomplishments, we continue to make progress on our commitment to drive the future of sustainable aviation.
Boeing recently joined a virtual White House event on sustainable aviation, reiterating our commitment to have our commercial airplanes capable of running on 100% sustainable aviation fuels by 2030 and our partnership with SkyNRG to expand the global supply of sustainable aviation fuel. We also hosted a 2-day Boeing Innovation Forum in Glasgow, bringing together partners in the region, customers, aviation experts and STEM students to accelerate efforts to ensure a safe and sustainable aerospace future.
We were also excited to participate in the IATA Annual General Meeting to discuss our path toward a more sustainable future and how we can support the aviation sector's commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In fact, just yesterday, our Chief Technology Officer, along with the CTOs from 6 other leading aerospace manufacturing companies, reaffirmed our commitment to reaching this industry-wide target.
Now let's turn to the next slide to discuss the industry environment. Last month, we released our 2021 Boeing market outlook, which forecasts a total market value of $9 trillion over the next decade. This is up from $8.5 trillion a year ago and from $8.7 trillion in the prepandemic 2019 forecast, reflecting the market's continued recovery. The forecast closely aligns to what we laid out last year.
Our government services, defense and space markets remain significant and relatively stable. While increased government spending on COVID-19 response is adding pressure to defense budgets in some countries, others are increasing spending on their security. Overall, the global defense market remains strong and enduring with all of our major programs. 
We remain focused on delivering the highest quality, innovative, capable and affordable platforms to the warfighter and maintaining the health of our supplier base. The diversity of our portfolio creates new opportunities and continues to help provide critical stability for us as we move forward. We continue to focus on our customers' needs, expanding capabilities on our trusted platforms, investing in next-generation technologies like autonomy and building on our foundation in model-based engineering to deliver and intelligently support key franchise programs like the T-7A and the MQ-25.
We see strong continued bipartisan support for U.S. national security, including strategic investments in Boeing products and services as Congress works through its annual budget and authorization process for fiscal year 2022. The F/A-18 and the Chinook Block II remain critical capabilities for the warfighter both domestically and for non-U.S. customers. We will continue to work with the administration and with Congress to ensure the necessary support for these key programs is in place.
The commercial market is shaping up largely as we expected. While near-term pressure due to COVID-19 continues, the recovery is broadening and the key long-term fundamentals remain strong. We've seen positive momentum in some markets. However, the recovery continues to be uneven. In the third quarter, we saw global departures increase slightly to an average of 67% of 2019 levels, up from 59% the previous quarter.
Similar to what we saw in the first half of the year, domestic traffic is leading the recovery. However, traffic took a slight step back in the late summer due to the Delta variant and increased travel restrictions, resulting in global August domestic traffic of approximately 30% below 2019 levels. Since then, it has shown signs of improvement, most notably in the domestic China market.
The U.S. domestic market continues to be a bright spot in the recovery with TSA screenings resuming an upward weekly trend since mid-September and peak travel days are reaching 80% to 85% of 2019 volumes. We are also seeing the recovery accelerate in more parts of the world which reduced travel restrictions and coordinated protocols. Japan's domestic traffic is accelerating after the country recently dropped its COVID state of emergency, and European airlines have seen large booking spikes following the U.S. decision to open to vaccinated foreign travelers in November.
Passenger traffic in other parts of the world, particularly Southeast Asia, remained significantly lower due to continued travel restriction, uncertainty and case rates. Even there, however, there is increasing momentum for air travel as vaccination rates climb.
International operations are starting to see incremental improvement, with August traffic 69% below 2019, which was an improvement from June and July. And we're seeing promising signs of entry protocols loosening across the transatlantic corridor. Despite this progress, international traffic is still a long way from full recovery. Limited coordination on travel protocols are still significantly hindering traffic in the international segment.
Yet the active fleet is now approximately 85% of its previous size, with single-aisle activity levels slightly above twin-aisle. With utilization rates and load factors still below historic levels, airlines are flying around 60% of their normal global capacity. Recent changes to government policies could accelerate this to 70% by year-end. 
However, we have seen continued variability in capacity due to supply chain and logistics challenges our customers are facing. As the recovery continues to expand, airlines are shifting their focus to medium-term fleet planning. As part of this assessment, airlines have retired or announced plans to retire around 1,500 airplanes since the onset of the pandemic. We anticipate this trend will continue as our customers modernize their fleets to reduce carbon emissions and increase operational efficiency.
With oil prices today approximately 30% higher than at the end of 2019, operating efficiency is top of mind for most of our customers. The new airplanes we deliver will be as much as 25% to 40% more fuel efficient with commensurate reductions in emissions compared to the airplanes they replaced. The freighter market remains robust, with cargo traffic 8% higher year-to-date through August compared to 2019. With limited belly cargo capacity on passenger airlines, more dedicated freighters are being utilized to transport cargo. This is resulting in healthy demand for our freighter offerings, with 24 additional freighter airplanes ordered in the quarter and strong demand for Boeing converted freighters. In fact, our converted and new freighter orders through the first 9 months of this year have already surpassed our highest annual freighter tally in history.
As we look to the medium and long term, we see our original forecast still holds. We continue to expect passenger traffic to return to 2019 levels in '23 to '24, and then a few years beyond that to return to long-term growth trends. We still see recovery in 3 phases. First domestic, then regional markets such as intra-Asia, intra-Europe and intra-Americas flights, and finally, long-haul international routes. We've seen this phased recovery translate into demand with strong 737 MAX orders this year, which mainly support domestic markets. We anticipate demand for widebody aircraft to take longer in line with the international traffic recovery.
Our 10-year commercial airplane market outlook is largely unchanged from what we assumed a year ago, reflecting the impacts of the global pandemic as well as the ongoing market recovery. From now until 2030, we forecast demand for over 14,000 single-aisle airplanes such as the 737 MAX, which equates to roughly 115 to 130 airplanes per month.
From a 20-year perspective, we still see the impact of COVID, but to a lesser extent, as traffic reverts to long-term trends. Through 2040, we project demand for about 43,500 new airplanes, an increase of about 500 planes over last year's forecast. And as air travel grows, we're committed to reaching sustainability goals and future guidelines through government and industry partnerships and a combination of technology, policy and operational advances.
And a significant area of growth, projected demand has increased for dedicated freighters, including new and converted models. With sustained demand for air cargo tied to expanding e-commerce and air freight's speed and reliability, we project the global freighter fleet in 2040 will be 70% larger than the prepandemic fleet.
On the global trade front, we continue to support and monitor U.S.-China trade relations, given the importance of the Chinese market to our economy and our industry's recovery as well as our near-term delivery profile and future orders, all of which influence future production rates. We remain in active discussions with our Chinese customers on their fleet planning needs and continue to urge leaders in both countries to resolve trade differences by reiterating the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry.
Ultimately, America's leadership in aerospace as well as the health and stability of millions of commercial aerospace jobs rely on free and fair trade, and we are confident our leaders understand the importance of this area, not just for our business but for the overall health of our economy and competitiveness.
Turning to the commercial services market. We saw demand improve again in the third quarter as we supported airlines during their peak summer season. We expect this trend to continue near term, slightly ahead of our expectations. That said, we still anticipate a multiyear recovery that may be uneven. Liquidity is improving across the industry, and managing liquidity remains critical for the aerospace industry's bridge to full recovery.
As we highlighted previously, product differentiation and versatility will be key as airlines adapt to evolving market realities. In fact, the 787 has been the most utilized widebody airplane during the pandemic and demand for the MAX continues to grow. So far this year, we have sold more than 550 737s across each of the models from Dash 7 to Dash 10, reflecting the value of versatility and commonality. I'm confident our product line is well positioned, and we're focused on executing to meet that customer demand.
Despite the continued challenges our industry is facing due to COVID-19, passenger traffic is increasing. And more broadly, we're seeing incrementally positive indicators for economic growth. With economic activity picking up, labor availability within our supply chain will be the critical watch item. 
As we position for a robust recovery, we're focused on delivering for our customers and capturing the opportunities ahead. We're maintaining and, in some cases, expanding key investments in strategic processes, technologies and capabilities that will define our future. And whether we're investing in manufacturing technology, digital engineering, technology advances, autonomous solutions, supply chain capability or platform designs, sustainability will be a key factor in every decision.
We're continuing our transformational efforts to create long-lasting value, which will improve our performance, help us generate positive cash flow and create a foundation to enable us to return to healthy margins. While we do this, we remain committed to safety, quality and transparency, and I'm confident in our future.
With that, let me turn it over to Brian."

In the short time I've been here, the priorities couldn't be more clear: Deliver for our customers, drive the highest levels of safety, quality and stability in all we do, innovate for the future and generate positive, sustainable free cash flow. While we have our share of challenges, I'm impressed with the team and confident in our path forward.
Let's turn to Slide 4, please. Third quarter revenue increased to $15.3 billion, primarily due to higher commercial deliveries and commercial services volume. We recorded a $0.60 loss per share in the quarter primarily driven by higher commercial volume, partially offset by lower tax benefits. Third quarter 2021 was also impacted by 787 abnormal costs and the Commercial Crew Starliner charge.  
Now let's move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. Revenue was $4.5 billion, reflecting higher 737 deliveries, partially offset by lower 787 deliveries. Although Commercial Airplanes' operating margin continue to be under pressure, it improved in the quarter due to higher commercial airplane deliveries and the BCA backlog is currently valued at $290 billion.
Moving to the 737 MAX. We delivered 62 airplanes in the quarter. We currently have approximately 370 MAX airplanes built and stored in inventory, including those that we have successfully remarketed. We know where the vast majority of the airplanes are going given the demand, and we anticipate delivering most of these airplanes by the end of 2023. This assumes we resume delivery to our customers in China during the first quarter of 2022.
This delivery timing and the production rate ramp profile remains dynamic, given the market environment, customer discussions, regulatory approvals and supply chain stability. There is no material change to our assumptions for the 737 abnormal costs or our assessment of the liability for estimated 737 MAX potential concessions and other considerations to customers.
Turning to the 787. We did not deliver any 787s in the third quarter while we continue our reviews and work with the FAA, as Dave mentioned. In line with our accounting practices, we recorded $183 million of abnormal costs in the third quarter due to the low rate of 787 production as well as inspection and rework costs. These costs will continue in future period while we complete the rework, and we remain at an abnormally low production rate. We currently anticipate total 787 abnormal costs to be approximately $1 billion.
Our latest assessment of the financial impact of these abnormal costs and the estimated impacts of delayed deliveries to customers has been included in our third quarter closing position. The 787 program margin remains near breakeven. We still expect overall unit margins to hold up relatively well, and we're confident in the demand and the health of the 787 program over the long term.
As we ended the third quarter, we have approximately 105 787s in inventory. Timing of deliveries will be dependent upon completing necessary inspections and rework, ongoing fleet planning conversations with our customers and closing out our activities with the FAA. While the commercial recovery will take time, we remain focused on driving stability on the 787 program and across the business. As we bridge to the recovery, we expect improvements in Commercial Airplanes' financial performance due to increasing deliveries and continued efforts by the BCA team to transform for the future.
Let's now move to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 6. Third quarter revenue decreased slightly to $6.6 billion, and operating margin was 6.6%, primarily due to a $185 million earnings charge on our Commercial Crew Starliner program driven by the second uncrewed orbital flight test now anticipated in 2022 and the latest assessment of remaining work. 
We received $6 billion in orders during the quarter, including an award for 4 Chinook Block II helicopters to the U.S. Army and a JDAM contract for the U.S. Air Force. We also received the award from Germany for 5 P-8A aircraft. The BDS backlog is currently valued at $58 billion.
Let's now turn to Global Services on Slide 7. In the third quarter, Global Services revenue increased to $4.2 billion, and operating margin grew to 15.3%, driven by higher commercial services as the market recovers from the impacts of COVID-19. Operating margin was also favorably impacted by lower severance costs and mix of products and services.
During the quarter, BGS won key contracts worth approximately $4 billion, including 12 additional 737-800 Boeing converted freighters for BBAM and an award for performance-based logistics support of the global C-17 fleet. Total backlog remains at $19 billion.
We continue to see incremental improvement in commercial services during the third quarter, and we expect the quarterly revenue trend to improve as we support increasing airline flight operations. Looking ahead, we expect the continued commercial market recovery to drive commercial services to increase as a percentage of total BGS revenue.
Let's now turn to cash flow on Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $0.3 billion, reflecting higher commercial deliveries, higher order receipts, reduced expenditures on lower widebody production rates and importantly, benefits from our business transformation efforts. Operating cash flow was favorably impacted by a $1.3 billion income tax refund. While we continue to see a cash flow benefit from order activity, and we saw some advanced payment timing benefit in the third quarter, we still expect advanced payment burn down to be a headwind through next year.
Let's move to Slide 9 and discuss our liquidity position. We ended the third quarter with solid liquidity, including $20 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet. We have access to a total of $14.7 billion across our bank credit facilities, which remain undrawn. Our debt balance decreased by $1.2 billion from last quarter to $62.4 billion, driven by the paydown of bond maturities.
As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to have lower total debt at the end of the year due to the paydown of maturing bonds and early paydown of the remaining $4 billion delayed draw term loan. Given continued uncertainties in our environment, we are vigilantly managing our cash. We've seen our cash balance begin to stabilize due to prudent actions taken across the business and increasing commercial deliveries. Therefore, we believe we currently have sufficient liquidity.
We remain committed to reducing debt levels and actively managing the balance sheet. Our investment-grade credit rating is very important to us, and we will consider all aspects of our capital structure to strengthen our balance sheet. Cash flow expectations are largely unchanged from what we shared last quarter. We still expect full year 2021 to be a use of cash and turn cash flow positive in 2022. As always, cash flow may vary quarter-over-quarter due to timing of deliveries as well as receipts and expenditures, including the potential of further cash tax benefits and MAX customer settlement payments.
The key driver of cash flow in 2022 compared to 2021 is higher 737 and 787 delivery volume. The significant working capital benefit of delivering airplanes from inventory will have some offset from the reduction to advances and progress payments balance. As we previously shared, our advances balance largely reflects delivery plans from before the pandemic and MAX production pause. While we anticipate a meaningful burn down next year, we expect the balance will normalize by the end of 2022.
Also keep in mind, there will be an impact to cash flow in 2022 for compensation to customers for delivery delays and some headwind from the strong 2021 order book, which helped fill the near-term skyline and improved cash flow in this calendar year. As we bridge to sustainable free cash flow generation, we continue to proactively manage our liquidity and look to strengthen our balance sheet.
In closing, while our business environment is dynamic, we're confident in the future. The key enablers for our business and our financial performance for the remainder of this year and into 2022 include vaccine distribution and travel protocols, which will ultimately facilitate the commercial market recovery; remaining 737 MAX regulatory approvals; U.S.-China trade relations; and resumption of 787 deliveries.
Our team continues to closely examine all aspects of our business, simplify and streamline our work and make long-lasting change. Above all else, we'll stay focused on safety, quality, stability, innovation while generating sustainable free cash flow. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Dave for closing comments."

And this understandably helped with getting deliveries out in a tough demand environment. And I think of it as many of your customers are effectively seeing a discount through compensation.
But 2 issues around that. First, how complete are your compensation negotiations at this point? In other words, is the remaining $3.4 billion largely spoken for, and it's just a matter of paying it out over time? And then second, how do you work with new customers to see, if I'm an airline, I look at others benefiting from these effective discounts and discounts that would not be available to me potentially?

No negotiation is complete until it's complete. So I can't be perfectly accurate on this front. But the lion's share are, in fact, in the rearview mirror. And we know where the wiggle room is with respect to the -- we think the final ones.
On the other hand, I'll never say we're done until we're done. I am quite confident that pricing discipline going forward has been and will continue to be sustained and maintained. And I think as we shift from what used to be a demand problem to more of a supply problem in the course of next calendar year, that, in fact, all of the trends are in our favor on that front.
So I really -- I think this has been managed well in the separation of those issues. And I think we're in a pretty good and disciplined place with respect to pricing."

So I wish I could give you a little more clarity. It's going to be when it's going to be with respect to increasing the rates and also beginning deliveries because we really do have to get through these issues that prevent us from getting ticketed. 
While I believe we have clear line of sight on the issues, we've got to give our own teams and then the FAA time to get through all their analytics and agree with everything that we're doing with respect to the rework plans, et cetera. We are well through it, but we're not through it. So until that happens, until we can announce deliveries commencing, it's going to be hard for me to give you guidance.
With respect to demand, look, if I thought we were going to be at something below 5 a month anytime soon, I would make bigger adjustments and we'd have less of an abnormal cost scenario. Abnormal costs for me are important cost to keep this line up, running fresh and ready when 5 comes back. And so that's where we are.
And I also just happen to believe on the basis of the testimony from customers and their experience with the airplane. As I said, and I reiterate, the irony of the whole story is it's the most utilized widebody out there. It's delivering on efficiency. It's delivering on everything we promised. It's got cargo capability, which has been an important factor in the way the role that it's played.
It's just -- I think the demand is going to be quite robust. And I think as we get to the second half of next year, that will begin to play out for all of us. But at this moment in time, I just can't be real definitive until we commence deliveries."

So I would characterize it as something quite a bit less than that. Our tip-to-tail inspection, and I think I mentioned this the last time we're all together, is complete. So we're not out there hunting for anything. We did have a sort of a late breaking from a parts supplier that, unfortunately, is a sub-tier supplier to other suppliers where we have to track a particular material substitution question that was brought to us by their regulators and track it through every part and then every supplier to us.
So that process just takes time. We have, of course, segmented those parts. We believe we're in a good place. We don't believe there's safety ramifications. On the other hand, on the subject of compliance, we have to make sure we're compliant with the material specs that are included in our design.
So that just takes some time. We are working our way through it. We're well past halfway. We're working our way down to the finish line, but that was the one that sort of added some time to this. And then with respect to the workload, it's 90% Boeing. We're the ones that have to satisfy ourselves that we're compliant. And then the FAA has to agree with those set of analytics, and they have to agree with all of our -- ultimately the judgments we make. And that's reasonably well in hand. We've been transparent from the word go. So there won't be any surprises with respect to what the issues are and/or the data that we're collecting to support our ultimate conclusions.
So I think we're in an okay place. I wouldn't say very uncertain. I don't use that term, but we are uncertain and we've got to get to that moment where we can start delivering."

I continue to believe and the evidence is beginning to support that by the second half of next year, our industry will be supply constrained. So in trying to determine what the right rate would be for us at 31, we believe we have a supply chain that can handle that. And you're right, with the amount of inventory build that we have asked for during these current months with low production rates, we think we're in a pretty good place to be able to do that. 
With respect to increasing from 31, as we go through the second half of the year and forward, I think that will be an assessment of the supply chain, not an assessment of demand that gets us to whatever number we get to. I think we're going to be in a supply-constrained world, probably from second half through all of '23 with respect to narrowbodies. And that's true, I believe, for the industry."

And we've said to the team, take all the time you need to get that exactly right. We're going to do this one airplane at a time. So we still have more variability in that than I'd like to have. We are getting a little more stable. I think as we move into next year, we're going to be quite stable on that front.
