With me as usual are Joe Bergstein, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin, the head of our Pennsylvania utility business; Paul Thompson, the head of our Kentucky utility business; and Phil Swift, who heads up our U.K. utility business.
Moving to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning with a brief overview of our 2020 performance as we overcame the difficult challenges of COVID-19. I'll also share a few updates on regulatory and ESG matters. Later, Joe will provide a more detailed overview of year-end and fourth quarter financial results. I'll then share some closing thoughts on our key focus areas for 2021. And as always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 4. I'm incredibly proud of how PPL performed in 2020, a year unlike any we've seen in our lifetimes. It was a year that tested our resolve, our resilience and our ability to adapt very quickly to dynamic conditions. Importantly, we provided electricity and natural gas safely and reliably to more than 10.5 million customers when it mattered the most.
This included the hospital workers and the first responders who were on the front lines. And it included customers whose homes became offices, whose kitchens and bedrooms became classrooms and who were counting on us to deliver without fail. We're extremely honored that our continued operational excellence resulted in further recognition from these very same customers in 2020.
In the U.S., we earned 3 new J.D. Power Awards for customer satisfaction, bringing our total to 54 since J.D. Power surveys began. This included topping all large utilities in the east for the 9th straight year for residential customer satisfaction and all mid-sized utilities in the Midwest for both residential and business customer satisfaction. 
In the U.K., at the end of 2020, we again finished with scores of over 9 out of 10 in all 4 of our DNOs and are on track to receive the maximum incentive reward under Ofgem's broad measure customer satisfaction. We also received the U.K.'s Customer Service Excellence Award for the 28x since 1992. 
As we focused on our commitment to provide a superior customer experience, we also recognize the need to support our local communities and assist customers struggling with COVID-19. With that in mind, we continue to offer payment assistance programs, flexible payment options and referral services to help customers manage their energy bills. 
Shifting to our financial performance, we achieved financial results that are within our original earnings guidance range, despite the challenges of COVID-19. This achievement included overcoming a $0.12 per share unfavorable impact from COVID due primarily to low sales volumes in the U.K. and lower commercial and industrial demand in Kentucky, as well as a $0.05 per share unfavorable impact due to mild weather compared to normal conditions. 
We were able to offset some of the impact through effective cost management and several other factors without negatively impacting the long-term strength of the business. And as we've discussed previously, the U.K. regulatory construct provides recovery for any undercollected revenues from lower sales volumes, which was a significant portion of the 2020 impact. 
We also maintained a strong financial position and delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareowners, something PPL has done each quarter for 75 consecutive years. 
Turning to Slide 5. As we dealt with the challenges of COVID-19 during the year, we also remain very focused on the future. Building on the $27 billion we had invested over the prior decade to improve service to our customers, during 2020, we completed more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvement, in line with the original expectations we outlined for you at the beginning of the year. The vast majority of this investment, nearly 90%, was focused on transmission and distribution infrastructure to strengthen grid resilience, incorporate new technology and advance our clean energy strategy. 
Shifting to a few sustainability highlights, we continue to advance our clean energy strategy in 2020. At the outset of the year, we set a more aggressive carbon reduction goal. And throughout the remainder of the year, we invested in our networks to enable increased electrification and large-scale additions of distributed energy resources in the future. 
In Kentucky, we secured regulatory approval for a 100-megawatt solar power purchase agreement to meet increasing customer demand for clean energy solutions. We also continued to expand customer participation in our solar share program, securing full subscription for 2 additional phases of solar share construction that will begin this spring. 
In addition, our Safari Energy business also added more than 90 megawatts of solar capacity to its portfolio, increasing its own capacity to 110 megawatts. This new capacity is all contracted via long-term power purchase agreements. 
And in August, we joined a 5-year industry initiative to accelerate the development of low-carbon energy technology and advance affordable pathways to economy wide decarbonization. We recognize that going even further, faster than the goals that we've set to address climate change, requires new ideas, technology and systems that can be delivered safely, reliably and affordably. That's why we're partnering with EPRI and GTI on their new low-carbon resources initiative. 
As part of our sustainability efforts, we also remain focused on advancing a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion across PPL and supporting meaningful change in progress in the communities we serve. To build on PPL's prior momentum in this area, the company adopted a new enterprise-wide DEI strategy with 5 supporting DEI commitments. 
In the wake of the killings of George Floyd, Briana Taylor and others in 2020, PPL led focused discussions with our employees and in our communities on race and social justice that will continue to guide our efforts moving forward. In addition, we provided initial contributions to support local organizations focused on DEI initiatives and launched a new scholarship program that aims to award $1 million over the next decade to support minorities and females, pursuing careers in engineering, IT, technical and trade roles. 
As a reflection of PPL's continuous focus on embracing diversity, inclusion and advancing equity for all, we were named a best place to work for LGBTQ equality by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, once again, earning a perfect score. 
Lastly, on this slide, I would note that we continue to enhance our ESG disclosures in 2020, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to transparency and to keeping stakeholders informed. This included our disclosures around political spending, an area in which the center for political accountability and the Zicklin Center for business ethics research day PPL their trends that are ranking on the CPA Zicklin Index. 
Turning to Slide 6 for some regulatory updates. In November, we took steps at our Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities businesses to support continued infrastructure investments that benefit our customers. 
LG&E and KU filed rate request with the Kentucky Public Service Commission on November 25, seeking approval for a combined revenue increase of about $331 million in electricity and gas base rates. The requested increases will support continued modernization of the grid to strengthen grid resilience, as well as upgrades to LG&E's natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability. 
In addition, we are seeking approval for full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, faster electric vehicle charging stations and an updated net metering tariff. If approved by the commission, LG&E and KU's requested revenue increases would take effect July 1, 2021. 
Given the COVID pandemic and in an effort to reduce the near-term impact of the rate adjustment for our customers, we sought to minimize the size of the requested increase and have included in our request for approval, a $53 million economic release or credit to help mitigate the impact of the rate adjustment until mid-2022. 
In addition, we have proposed to implement AMI in a manner, which based on current projections, will not require an increase in the combined revenue of LG&E and KU in this rate case or in the future as operating cost savings are projected to more than offset the incremental capital cost of the project. 
Additionally, pending the outcome of the proceeding, it's our goal not to request another base rate adjustment for several years. A detailed procedural schedule for the rate case is available in the appendix of today's presentation. 
In other notable Kentucky updates, LG&E and KU on January 7, issued a request for proposal for generation capacity to meet a potential energy shortfall that may be created by the anticipated retirements of 1,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation during this decade. 
LG&E and KU's Mill Creek Unit 1 is expected to retire in 2024, while Mill Creek Unit 2 and EW Brown Unit 3 are expected to be retired by 2028 as they reach the end of their economic useful lives. We've also included in the appendix a slide that details the projected economic lies with our baseload generation plan. 
The utilities are seeking 300 to 900 megawatts of capacity beginning in 2025 to 2028. Additionally, we're asking for proposals for at least 100 megawatts of battery storage. Proposals are due March 31, and we anticipate making a decision by mid-2021 and potentially filing for regulatory approvals in early 2022. 
Lastly, in the U.K., Ofgem issued its RIIO-ED3 sector-specific methodology decision in mid-December. The decision was largely in line with our expectations and underscores the vital role DNOs will play in supporting decarbonization in the U.K. to achieve a net 0 economy. 
In January, WPD became the first D&O to issue a draft business plan for RIIO-ED2. That draft plan proposes GBP 6 billion in new investments to support decarbonization, digitalization and enhanced network utilization. 
Turning to Slide 7 and the 2021 to 2025 capital plan, we've outlined more than $14 billion from 2021 to 2025 to support continued modernization of our transmission and distribution networks and to advance a cleaner energy future. This forecast spending represents $1 billion of incremental CapEx from 2021 to 2024 compared to our prior plan. Those increases include $400 million in Kentucky to support full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, $300 million in Pennsylvania for additional transmission investments as well as incremental funding for IT initiatives focused on digital transformation investments in work optimization, smart grid technology and a customer experience and $200 million in the U.K. due to a shift of certain investments from 2020 to 2021 as a result of COVID-19, additional funding for telecommunications projects and updates to our RIIO-ED2 capital plan. 
At this point, I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and year-end financial results. Joe?"

I'll begin with a brief overview of our fourth quarter results on Slide 9. PPL delivered fourth quarter 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.59 per share compared to $0.57 per share in the fourth quarte",882,"Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a brief overview of our fourth quarter results on Slide 9. PPL delivered fourth quarter 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.59 per share compared to $0.57 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Weather in the quarter was about $0.01 unfavorable compared to 2019 as our Kentucky segment experienced slightly milder temperatures. The estimated impact of COVID on our fourth quarter results was about $0.02 per share, $0.01 due to lower U.K. sales volumes and $0.01 driven by lower demand in Kentucky. 
We continue to experience improvement in this area as C&I demand steadily improves across our service territories. These headwinds were more than offset by positive impacts from returns on additional capital investments, lower O&M expenses at our domestic utilities and a higher realized foreign currency exchange rate in the U.K. Overall, these results were in line with our expectations. 
Moving to our full year 2020 earnings results on Slide 10. We achieved 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $2.40 per share compared to $2.45 per share a year ago. 
As Vince mentioned earlier, our 2020 financial results reflect an estimated $0.12 unfavorable variance due to COVID-19. During 2020, we also experienced a $0.06 unfavorable variance due to weather compared to 2019, primarily in Kentucky. In terms of dilution for the year, we experienced $0.11 per share of dilution year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of the equity forward settlement in late 2019. 
Moving to the segment drivers, excluding impacts from weather and dilution, our U.K. regulated segment earned $1.33 per share, a $0.01 year-over-year decrease. The decrease in U.K. earnings was primarily due to lower adjusted gross margins, driven by lower sales volumes, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19, lower other income due to lower pension income, higher operation and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense. These decreases were partially offset by higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior period with 2020 average rates of $1.47 per pound compared to $1.32 per pound in 2019. 
In Pennsylvania, we earned $0.65 per share, which was $0.07 higher than our results in 2019. Our Pennsylvania results were primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission and lower operation and maintenance expense. These increases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense and other factors that were not individually significant. 
Turning to our Kentucky segment, we earned $0.55 per share in 2020, a $0.03 increase over comparable results one year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from higher retail rates effective May 1, 2019, and lower operation and maintenance expense. Partially offsetting these items were lower commercial and industrial demand revenue, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and higher depreciation expense. 
Results at Corporate and Other were $0.03 higher compared to the prior year. Factors driving earnings results at Corporate and Other, primarily included lower overall corporate expenses and other factors, not individually significant. 
Turning to Slide 11, we outlined the trends we observed in weather-normalized sales for each segment by customer class since the beginning of the pandemic. Overall, lower demand in the C&I sectors continued to be partially offset by higher residential load in each of our service territories. We also experienced a steady recovery in the C&I space as certain restrictions were eased during the year. 
In Pennsylvania, residential usage steadily declined following the sharp spike we experienced at the onset of COVID, yet remains up about 3.5% compared to last year, signaling strong demand from customers still working from home. 
As for the C&I sector, we saw incremental recovery from the lows experienced in the second quarter. And by year-end, we're tracking less than 3% behind prior year levels. The largest declines remain primarily in the retail trade and services industry, which we expect will remain depressed until restrictions are lifted. 
In Kentucky, residential usage was up about 7% in Q4 compared to last year consistent with what we experienced in Q3. We continue to experience a moderate recovery in the C&I sectors in Kentucky, up substantially from the second quarter. 
C&I volumes were down 3.5% from last year's usage in Q4, which was an improvement from the 7% decline observed during Q3. Similar to Pennsylvania, the largest declines in the C&I sector continue to be seen in the services industry. However, sales to the manufacturing sector returned closer to the 2019 levels in Q4. 
And finally, in the U.K., residential usage also remained higher, with volumes being up about 6% compared to last year. Recovery in the U.K's. C&I sectors has lagged our domestic jurisdictions overall, but has continued to make a strong comeback, down about 9% versus the prior year, a substantial improvement from the second quarter lows of over 20%. 
While additional incremental lockdowns were put in place during the fourth quarter, these impacts did not restrict the construction and housing industries, and we have not seen a slowdown in operational activity in these sectors. And as a reminder, any revenue shortfall in the 2020, 2021 regulatory year will be recovered by WPD in the 2022, 2023 regulatory year adjusted for inflation. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince."

Before I briefly highlight our 2021 strategic priorities, I just want to reiterate how proud I am of what we were able to achieve in 2020 under truly remarkable circumstances. 
Operationally, we didn't miss a beat, delivering very strong results. Financially, we overcame stiff headwinds to achieve our earnings guidance and return capital to share owners. 
Internally, I saw our businesses collaborate like never before as we work to keep each other safe and tackle COVID-19. And at the end of the day, I truly believe we made a positive impact on society, and that's the common purpose that really unites employees at all levels across PPL. 
In 2020, we demonstrated PPL's tremendous resilience and agility. And as I've shared with our employees, I truly believe we will emerge from this pandemic stronger and more united than ever before. With that in mind, our clear focus moving forward is on delivering long-term value for our customers and our share owners. 
In 2021, that includes completing the process to sell our U.K. utility business and repositioning PPL as a purely U.S.-focused utility company. I'm pleased to report that the process to sell WPD remains on track, and we continue to expect to announce a transaction in the first half of this year. 
As we shared previously, we believe the sale of the U.K. business will simplify our business mix, strengthen our balance sheet and enhance the company's long-term earnings growth rate. In addition, we believe it will give the company greater financial flexibility to invest in sustainable energy solutions. 
Another top priority of ours this year is, as always, delivering electricity and natural gas safely, reliably and affordable. No job we do is more important than that. And this year, we will remain focused on continuous improvement, innovation, benchmarking and best practice sharing as we seek to once again deliver industry-leading operational performance and provide a superior customer experience. 
Other notable priorities for 2021 include advancing our clean energy strategy and reducing PPL's carbon footprint, further enhancing the DEI culture I spoke about earlier and building strong communities through philanthropy, volunteerism and customer assistance. 
In conclusion, as we look to 2021 and beyond, I'm excited about the opportunity we have to reposition PPL for future success. And I'm confident we will continue to deliver long-term value for our customers, our shareowners and the communities we serve.

And so we will certainly continue to remain engaged with the administration, their goals to advance some of those policies. Obviously, rejoining The Paris Agreement will certainly lead to more aggressive U.S. carbon reduction commitments, either 2030, 2035 remains to be seen there that the targets that are being discussed there certainly would require advancements in technology to be able to achieve those as it's really not feasible today from our industry to really be net 0 by 2035, which is what they're talking about. 
So we'll continue to discuss these challenges with the administration as we're engaging with EI and EPRI and other industry groups, and we'll continue to do that to support what we think is the most efficient way to accomplish those goals. As you know, the industry has been supportive of the overall goals, we don't quite have agreement on how to get there and the ability of the industry to meet those aggressive targets.

I think what you might be seeing is the effect of 2021's capital plan versus 2025's capital plan. And so we were at $3.2 billion of spend this year and the current plan has about $2.7 billion in 2025. 
So you'll see a little bit of an impact on the growth rate, likely as a result of that, but plan over plan, as we've talked about, we only include known projects in our capital budgets. And as we've said, historically, as we execute the plan, we tend to find additional capital. And overall, including the U.K., we added about $1 billion of incremental capital plan over plan. But specific to your growth question, it could be just the larger number dropping off versus the 2025 number coming in."

The second is really directly supporting future rate base growth, whether that's via organic with our current utilities or through other investment opportunities in rate-regulated assets here in the U.S. 
The third is potentially investing in renewables as our tax position could change post-sale, we've talked about that as well so the renewable position could be in a better competitive spot post sale. 
And then the fourth is really potentially returning capital to our shareholders.

To Vince's point, the approach that we're taking on this is, as part of the rate case and the CPCN, not having that capital go into the right base but rather have AFUDC treatment so that over time, the O&M savings that we're projecting to the customers are effectively paying for that capital.

With me as usual are Joe Bergstein, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin, the head of our Pennsylvania utility business; Paul Thompson, the head of our Kentucky utility business; and Phil Swift, who heads up our U.K. utility business.
Moving to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning with a brief overview of our 2020 performance as we overcame the difficult challenges of COVID-19. I'll also share a few updates on regulatory and ESG matters. Later, Joe will provide a more detailed overview of year-end and fourth quarter financial results. I'll then share some closing thoughts on our key focus areas for 2021. And as always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 4. I'm incredibly proud of how PPL performed in 2020, a year unlike any we've seen in our lifetimes. It was a year that tested our resolve, our resilience and our ability to adapt very quickly to dynamic conditions. Importantly, we provided electricity and natural gas safely and reliably to more than 10.5 million customers when it mattered the most.
This included the hospital workers and the first responders who were on the front lines. And it included customers whose homes became offices, whose kitchens and bedrooms became classrooms and who were counting on us to deliver without fail. We're extremely honored that our continued operational excellence resulted in further recognition from these very same customers in 2020.
In the U.S. we earned 3 new J.D. Power Awards for customer satisfaction, bringing our total to 54 since J.D. Power surveys began. This included topping all large utilities in the East for the 9th straight year for residential customer satisfaction and all mid-sized utilities in the Midwest for both residential and business customer satisfaction.
In the U.K., at the end of 2020, we again finished with scores of over 9 out of 10 in all 4 of our DNOs and are on track to receive the maximum incentive reward under Ofgem's broad measure of customer satisfaction. We also received the U.K.'s Customer Service Excellence Award for the 28th time since 1992.
As we focused on our commitment to provide a superior customer experience, we also recognized the need to support our local communities and assist customers struggling with COVID-19. With that in mind, we continued to offer payment assistance programs, flexible payment options and referral services to help customers manage their energy bills.
Shifting to our financial performance. We achieved financial results that are within our original earnings guidance range, despite the challenges of COVID-19. This achievement included overcoming a $0.12 per share unfavorable impact from COVID, due primarily to low sales volumes in the U.K. and lower commercial and industrial demand in Kentucky as well as a $0.05 per share unfavorable impact due to mild weather compared to normal conditions.
We were able to offset some of the impact through effective cost management and several other factors without negatively impacting the long-term strength of the business. And as we've discussed previously, the U.K. regulatory construct provides recovery for any under-collected revenues from lower sales volumes, which was a significant portion of the 2020 impact. We also maintained a strong financial position and delivered on our commitment to return capital to share owners, something PPL has done each quarter for 75 consecutive years.
Turning to Slide 5. As we dealt with the challenges of COVID-19 during the year, we also remained very focused on the future. Building on the $27 billion we had invested over the prior decade to improve service to our customers, during 2020, we completed more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvement, in line with the original expectations we outlined for you at the beginning of the year. The vast majority of this investment, nearly 90%, was focused on transmission and distribution infrastructure to strengthen grid resilience, incorporate new technology and advance our clean energy strategy.
Shifting to a few sustainability highlights. We continued to advance our clean energy strategy in 2020. At the outset of the year, we set a more aggressive carbon reduction goal. And throughout the remainder of the year, we invested in our networks to enable increased electrification and large-scale additions of distributed energy resources in the future.
In Kentucky, we secured regulatory approval for a 100-megawatt solar power purchase agreement to meet increasing customer demand for clean energy solutions. We also continued to expand customer participation in our Solar Share Program, securing full subscription for 2 additional phases of Solar Share construction that will begin this spring.
In addition, our Safari Energy business also added more than 90 megawatts of solar capacity to its portfolio, increasing its own capacity to 110 megawatt. This new capacity is all contracted via long-term power purchase agreements.
And in August, we joined a 5-year industry initiative to accelerate the development of low-carbon energy technology and advance affordable pathways to economy-wide decarbonization. We recognize that going even further, faster than the goals that we've set to address climate change requires new ideas, technology and systems that can be delivered safely, reliably and affordably. That's why we're partnering with EPRI and GTI on their new Low-Carbon Resources Initiative.
As part of our sustainability efforts, we also remained focused on advancing a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion across PPL and supporting meaningful change in progress in the communities we serve. To build on PPL's prior momentum in this area, the company adopted a new enterprise-wide DEI strategy with 5 supporting DEI commitments.
In the wake of the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others in 2020, PPL led focused discussions with our employees and in our communities on race and social justice that will continue to guide our efforts moving forward. In addition, we provided initial contributions to support local organizations focused on DEI initiatives and launched a new scholarship program that aims to award $1 million over the next decade to support minorities and females pursuing careers in engineering, IT, technical and trade roles.
As a reflection of PPL's continuous focus on embracing diversity, inclusion and advancing equity for all, we were named a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ equality by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, once again earning a perfect score.
Lastly, on this slide, I would note that we continued to enhance our ESG disclosures in 2020, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to transparency, and to keeping stakeholders informed. This included our disclosures around political spending, an area in which the Center for Political Accountability and the Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research gave PPL their Trendsetter ranking on the CPA-Zicklin Index.
Turning to Slide 6 for some regulatory updates. In November, we took steps at our Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities businesses to support continued infrastructure investments that benefit our customers. LG&E and KU filed rate requests with the Kentucky Public Service Commission on November 25, seeking approval for a combined revenue increase of about $331 million in electricity and gas base rates. The requested increases will support continued modernization of the grid to strengthen grid resilience as well as upgrades to LG&E's natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability.
In addition, we are seeking approval for full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, faster electric vehicle charging stations and an updated net metering tariff. If approved by the Commission, LG&E and KU's requested revenue increases would take effect July 1, 2021.
Given the COVID pandemic and in an effort to reduce the near-term impact of the rate adjustment for our customers, we sought to minimize the size of the requested increase and have included in our request for approval a $53 million Economic Relief Surcredit to help mitigate the impact of the rate adjustment until mid-2022.
In addition, we have proposed to implement AMI in a manner, which based on current projections will not require an increase in the combined revenue of LG&E and KU in this rate case or in the future as operating cost savings are projected to more than offset the incremental capital cost of the project.
Additionally, pending the outcome of the proceeding, it's our goal not to request another base rate adjustment for several years. A detailed procedural schedule for the rate case is available in the appendix of today's presentation.
In other notable Kentucky updates, LG&E and KU on January 7 issued a request for proposal for generation capacity to meet a potential energy shortfall that may be created by the anticipated retirements of 1,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation during this decade. LG&E and KU's Mill Creek Unit 1 is expected to retire in 2024, while Mill Creek Unit 2 and E.W. Brown Unit 3 are expected to be retired by 2028 as they reach the end of their economic useful lives. We've also included in the appendix a slide that details the projected economic lives with our baseload generation plan.
The utilities are seeking 300 to 900 megawatts of capacity beginning in 2025 to 2028. Additionally, we're asking for proposals for at least 100 megawatts of battery storage. Proposals are due March 31, and we anticipate making a decision by mid-2021 and potentially filing for regulatory approvals in early 2022.
Lastly, in the U.K., Ofgem issued its RIIO-ED2 sector-specific methodology decision in mid-December. The decision was largely in line with our expectations and underscores the vital role DNOs will play in supporting decarbonization in the U.K. to achieve a net 0 economy. In January, WPD became the first DNO to issue a draft business plan for RIIO-ED2. That draft plan proposes GBP 6 billion in new investments to support decarbonization, digitalization and enhanced network utilization.
Turning to Slide 7 and the 2021 to 2025 capital plan. We've outlined more than $14 billion from 2021 to 2025 to support continued modernization of our transmission and distribution networks and to advance a cleaner energy future. This forecast spending represents $1 billion of incremental CapEx from 2021 to 2024 compared to our prior plan.
Those increases include $400 million in Kentucky to support full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, $300 million in Pennsylvania for additional transmission investments as well as incremental funding for IT initiatives focused on digital transformation investments in work optimization, smart grid technology and the customer experience and $200 million in the U.K. due to a shift of certain investments from 2020 to 2021 as a result of COVID-19, additional funding for telecommunications projects and updates to our RIIO-ED2 capital plan.
At this point, I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and year-end financial results. Joe?"

PPL delivered fourth quarter 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.59 per share compared to $0.57 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Weather in the quarter was about $0.01 unfavorable compared to 2019, as our Kentucky segment experienced slightly milder temperatures. The estimated impact of COVID on our fourth quarter results was about $0.02 per share, $0.01 due to lower U.K. sales volumes and $0.01 driven by lower demand in Kentucky.
We continue to experience improvement in this area as C&I demand steadily improves across our service territories. These headwinds were more than offset by positive impacts from returns on additional capital investments, lower O&M expenses at our domestic utilities and a higher realized foreign currency exchange rate in the U.K. Overall, these results were in line with our expectations.
Moving to our full year 2020 earnings results on Slide 10. We achieved 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $2.40 per share compared to $2.45 per share a year ago.
As Vince mentioned earlier, our 2020 financial results reflect an estimated $0.12 unfavorable variance due to COVID-19. During 2020, we also experienced a $0.06 unfavorable variance due to weather compared to 2019, primarily in Kentucky. In terms of dilution for the year, we experienced $0.11 per share of dilution year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of the equity forward settlement in late 2019.
Moving to the segment drivers, excluding impacts from weather and dilution. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.33 per share, a $0.01 year-over-year decrease. The decrease in U.K. earnings was primarily due to lower adjusted gross margins, driven by lower sales volumes primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19, lower other income due to lower pension income, higher operation and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense. These decreases were partially offset by higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior period with 2020 average rates of $1.47 per pound compared to $1.32 per pound in 2019.
In Pennsylvania, we earned $0.65 per share, which was $0.07 higher than our results in 2019. Our Pennsylvania results were primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission and lower operation and maintenance expense. These increases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense and other factors that were not individually significant.
Turning to our Kentucky segment. We earned $0.55 per share in 2020, a $0.03 increase over comparable results 1 year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from higher retail rates effective May 1, 2019, and lower operation and maintenance expense. Partially offsetting these items were lower commercial and industrial demand revenue, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and higher depreciation expense.
Results at Corporate and Other were $0.03 higher compared to the prior year. Factors driving earnings results at Corporate and Other primarily included lower overall corporate expenses and other factors not individually significant.
Turning to Slide 11. We outlined the trends we observed in weather-normalized sales for each segment by customer class since the beginning of the pandemic. Overall, lower demand in the C&I sectors continued to be partially offset by higher residential load in each of our service territories. We also experienced a steady recovery in the C&I space as certain restrictions were eased during the year.
In Pennsylvania, residential usage steadily declined following the sharp spike we experienced at the onset of COVID, yet remains up about 3.5% compared to last year, signaling strong demand from customers still working from home.
As for the C&I sector, we saw incremental recovery from the lows experienced in the second quarter. And by year-end, we're tracking less than 3% behind prior year levels. The largest declines remain primarily in the retail trade and services industry, which we expect will remain depressed until restrictions are lifted.
In Kentucky, residential usage was up about 7% in Q4 compared to the last year, consistent with what we experienced in Q3. We continue to experience a moderate recovery in the C&I sectors in Kentucky, up substantially from the second quarter.
C&I volumes were down 3.5% from last year's usage in Q4, which was an improvement from the 7% decline observed during Q3. Similar to Pennsylvania, the largest declines in the C&I sector continue to be seen in the services industry. However, sales to the manufacturing sector returned closer to the 2019 levels in Q4.
And finally, in the U.K., residential usage also remained higher, with volumes being up about 6% compared to last year. Recovery in the U.K. C&I sectors has lagged our domestic jurisdictions overall, but has continued to make a strong comeback, down about 9% versus the prior year, a substantial improvement from the second quarter lows of over 20%.
While additional incremental lockdowns were put in place during the fourth quarter, these impacts did not restrict the construction and housing industries, and we have not seen a slowdown in operational activity in these sectors. And as a reminder, any revenue shortfall in the 2020-2021 regulatory year will be recovered by WPD in the 2022-2023 regulatory year adjusted for inflation.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince."

Before I briefly highlight our 2021 strategic priorities, I just want to reiterate how proud I am of what we were able to achieve in 2020 under truly remarkable circumstances.
Operationally, we didn't miss a beat, delivering very strong results. Financially, we overcame stiff headwinds to achieve our earnings guidance and returned capital to share owners. Internally, I saw our businesses collaborate like never before, as we worked to keep each other safe and tackle COVID-19. And at the end of the day, I truly believe we made a positive impact on society, and that's the common purpose that really unites employees at all levels across PPL.
In 2020, we demonstrated PPL's tremendous resilience and agility. And as I've shared with our employees, I truly believe we will emerge from this pandemic stronger and more united than ever before. With that in mind, our clear focus moving forward is on delivering long-term value for our customers and our share owners.
In 2021, that includes completing the process to sell our U.K. utility business and repositioning PPL as a purely U.S.-focused utility company. I'm pleased to report that the process to sell WPD remains on track, and we continue to expect to announce a transaction in the first half of this year.
As we shared previously, we believe the sale of the U.K. business will simplify our business mix, strengthen our balance sheet and enhance the company's long-term earnings growth rate. In addition, we believe it will give the company greater financial flexibility to invest in sustainable energy solutions.
Another top priority of ours this year is, as always, delivering electricity and natural gas safely, reliably and affordably. No job we do is more important than that. And this year, we will remain focused on continuous improvement, innovation, benchmarking and best practice sharing as we seek to once again deliver industry-leading operational performance and provide a superior customer experience.
Other notable priorities for 2021 include advancing our clean energy strategy and reducing PPL's carbon footprint, further enhancing the DEI culture I spoke about earlier and building strong communities through philanthropy, volunteerism and customer assistance.
In conclusion, as we look to 2021 and beyond, I'm excited about the opportunity we have to reposition PPL for future success. And I'm confident we will continue to deliver long-term value for our customers, our share owners and the communities we serve.
With that, Operator, let's open the call for questions."

Certainly, the -- as we're looking at what's happening at the federal level and with the Biden administration, right, it's still early yet in terms of anything specific coming out of the Biden administration. But I think it's clear that they intend to make policy addressing climate change, right, a priority. And so we will certainly continue to remain engaged with the administration on their goals to advance some of those policies.
Obviously, rejoining the Paris Agreement will certainly lead to more aggressive U.S. carbon reduction commitments, either 2030, 2035, remains to be seen there that the targets that are being discussed there certainly would require advancements in technology to be able to achieve those as it's really not feasible today from our industry to really be net 0 by 2035, which is what they're talking about.
So we'll continue to discuss these challenges with the administration, as we're engaging with EEI and EPRI and other industry groups, and we'll continue to do that to support what we think is the most efficient way to accomplish those goals. As you know, the industry has been supportive of the overall goals. We don't quite have agreement on how to get there and the ability of the industry to meet those aggressive targets, but Paul, do you want to talk about maybe how we're kind of thinking about things in Kentucky, recognizing that it's pretty early in the game?"

To Vince's point, the approach that we're taking on this is, as part of the rate case and the CPCN, not having that capital go into the rate base, but rather have AFUDC treatment so that over time, the O&M savings that we're projecting to the customers are effectively paying for that capital. So the basics, though, of the case that we think -- that we are putting forward, we think it's very strong. And so we're very hopeful that the Commission will rule in the positive on that case."

We appreciate you joining us for our first quarter earnings call. Moving to the agenda for today's call on Slide 3. I'll begin this morning with a brief overview of first quarter financial performance. I'll share a few operational highlights as well as an update on the 2 strategic transactions we announced in March. 
Joe will provide a more detailed overview of first quarter financial results. And as always, we'll leave ample time for your questions. Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced the first quarter reported net loss of $2.39 per share. This reflects special item net losses of $2.67 per share, primarily related to reporting WPD's discontinued operations this quarter. 
Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.28 per share compared with $0.27 per share a year ago. These results were in line with our expectations for the quarter. Compared to last year, improved margins were the most significant driver of the increase, primarily due to more favorable weather compared to the mild winter we experienced in 2020. 
Shifting to a few operational highlights. Now over a year into the pandemic, I'm pleased to report that operationally, all 7 of our utilities continue to perform extremely well with no operational issues to report. We continue to operate in a very similar manner to last year with many of our team members continuing to work from home. 
We continue to stress the importance of social distancing and mask wearing within our facilities and at our work site. With vaccinations in full swing, we are beginning to turn our attention to return to office planning and protocols. However, we are not expecting to deviate from our current mode of operations for at least a few more months and perhaps until end of summer for some of our locations. 
We've been able to operate extremely well during this virtual working environment, as evidenced not only by our strong operational performance, but also our ability to execute 2 significant strategic transactions simultaneously in a fully virtual manner. Our #1 priority has been and will continue to be the safety of our employees and our customers, so we will be very diligent in our return-to-office planning. 
Moving to an update on the Kentucky rate case proceedings. We reached unanimous settlement agreements subject to Kentucky Public Service Commission approval with all parties in our rate reviews for both LG&E and KU. The agreements cover all matters in the review except for net metering. We have a long track record of working constructively with the parties to our rate reviews to achieve positive outcomes that balance the interest of all our stakeholders, and this time was no exception. 
The settlement agreements were filed with the KPSC on April 19, and hearings were held last week. We expect KPSC orders on all settled matters by June 30 with new rates effective July 1. I'll review the terms of the settlement agreements in a bit more detail on the next slide. 
Moving to Pennsylvania. PPL Electric Utilities recently received the 2021 Energy Star Partner of the Year award from the EPA and Department of Energy. This award recognizes outstanding corporate energy management programs and is the EPA's highest level of recognition. It reflects PPL's commitment to protecting the environment and helping customers save energy and money. 
In April, we also made a number of leadership changes to help further position the company for long-term success, especially as we plan for the integration of Narragansett Electric into the PPL family of regulated utilities. Greg Dudkin was promoted to Chief Operating Officer of PPL from his prior role as President of PPL Electric Utilities. 
Under Greg's leadership over the past decade, PPL Electric Utilities has been focused squarely on creating the utility of the future. The business has developed one of the nation's most advanced electricity networks has consistently delivered award-winning customer satisfaction and has firmly established itself as an industry leader in reliability. 
This advanced grid that we've built at PPL Electric Utilities uniquely positions us to partner with the state of Rhode Island in support of their ambitious decarbonization goals of net zero by 2050, and potentially driving toward 100% renewable energy by 2030. We continue to be very excited about the opportunity to bring our experience and expertise to an already very strong utility in Narragansett Electric. Greg will also focus on driving continuous improvement and best practices across our already strong regulated utility operations. 
Stephanie Raymond is succeeding Greg as the President of PPL Electric Utilities. Stephanie has been a key member of PPL electric utilities leadership team for nearly a decade and has led both the transmission and distribution functions. She has played a central role in spearheading our operational excellence in Pennsylvania, as well as our forward-looking investments to strengthen grid resilience and prepare for increased distributed energy resources. 
Our Pennsylvania customers are in very good hands with Stephanie now at the helm of PPL Electric Utilities. We also hired Wendy Stark as our new Senior Vice President and General Counsel. Wendy replaces Joanne Raphael, who announced her retirement from the company effective June 1 after an impressive and distinguished 35-year career with our company. We certainly wish Joanne all the best as she transitions to this new phase of her life. Wendy joins PPL from Pepco Holdings, where she served as Senior Vice President, Legal and Regulatory Strategy and General Counsel. 
Wendy is an excellent addition to our team, and she's already making her presence known as we prepare for the regulatory approval process for the Narragansett acquisition. She brings to PPL significant experience in leading legal teams and extensive background in regulatory matters and a deep knowledge of our industry. I'm very excited about the strong leadership team that we've assembled here at PPL. 
I believe it's the right team at the right time as we strategically reposition PPL for long-term growth in success. Finally, I'll note that we continue to make good progress on the regulatory approval processes. Related to both the WPD sale and the Narragansett acquisition. In the U.K., we remain on track to close the WPD sale by the end of July. On April 22, National Grid shareowners voted overwhelmingly to approve the transaction. 
And on May 4, we received the Guernsey approval, leaving just the financial conduct authority approval outstanding in the U.K. while we have no assurance as to the timing of this final approval, the WPD sale could close as early as this month. In the U.S., we've made all the required regulatory filings to secure approval for the Narragansett Electric acquisition. 
We've requested the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers to decide on our petition by November 1, 2021. While we cannot be assured, the division will decide on our petition in that time frame, we remain confident in our ability to close on the acquisition by March of next year. The transition teams for both PPL and National Grid have been formed. And have actively begun planning to ensure a seamless transition for both employees and Rhode Island customers upon the approval and closing of the transaction. 
The PPL transition team is being led by Greg Dudkin, with strong executive presence and experienced leaders on the team, who will oversee the eventual integration of Narragansett Electric into PPL. I'll also note that we've had very constructive discussions with public officials in Rhode Island since our announcement. These interactions have only strengthened my belief that PPL is well positioned to drive real value for Rhode Island customers in their communities and to play a key role in helping the state achieve its ambitious decarbonization goals. 
Turning to Slide 5 in a bit more detail on the settlement agreements in Kentucky. We believe the agreements, which again require approval of the KPSC, represent constructive outcomes for all stakeholders and that they minimize the near-term rate impact on customers while still providing LG&E and KU the opportunity to recover their costs by providing safe and reliable service. The settlements proposed a combined revenue increase of $217 million for LG&E KU with an allowed base ROE of 9.55%. These revenue increases enable LG&E and KU to continue modernizing the grid, strengthening grid resilience and upgrading LG&E's natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability. 
They include LG&E and KU'S proposed $53 million economic release store credit to help mitigate the impact of the rate adjustments until mid-2022. The stipulation reflects the continuation of the currently approved depreciation rates for Mill Creek Units 1 and 2 and Brown Unit 3 for rate making purposes, rather than using the depreciation rates proposed in our original applications. 
We had initially requested the depreciation rates for these units to be updated with their expected retirement over the next decade as they reach the end of their economic useful lives. This adjustment reduces the requested revenue increases by approximately $70 million. In a related provision, the settlement agreements also proposed the establishment of a retired asset recovery rider to provide recovery of and on the remaining net book values of retired generation assets as well as associated inventory and decommissioning costs. 
The writer would provide recovery over a 10-year period upon retirement, as well as a return on those investments at the utilities than weighted average cost of capital. As we announced in January, Mill Creek Unit 1 is expected to retire in 2024. And Mill Creek Unit 2 and E.W. Brown Unit 3 are expected to be retired in 2028 as they reach the end of their economic useful lives. 
These units represent a combined 1,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity. The settlements also proposed full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, I'll note that the capital cost of the proposed AMI investment is not included in the revenue requirements in these rate cases. We'll record our investment in the AMI project as [indiscernible] and a crew AFUDC during the AMI implementation period. 
And finally, the settlement agreements include commitments that LG&E and KU will not increase base rates for at least 4 years, subject to certain exceptions. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a detailed overview of our first quarter financial results. Joe?"

In connection with t",438,"Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover our first quarter segment results on Slide 6. And with the U.K. now reflected as discontinued operations, we removed the U.K. Regulated segment from our quarterly earnings walk. In connection with this change, we have also updated our ongoing segment presentation for certain items. First, we have adjusted the 2020 corporate and other amount to reflect certain costs previously reflected in the U.K. Regulated segment, which was primarily interest expense. 
The total amount of these costs was about $0.01 per share for the quarter. In addition, beginning with our 2021 results, corporate level financing costs will no longer be allocated for segment reporting purposes. Those costs were primarily related to the acquisition financing of the Kentucky Regulated segment and will also be reflected in corporate and other moving forward. 
Now turning to the domestic segment drivers. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results were flat compared to a year ago. During the first quarter, we experienced higher distribution adjusted gross margins resulting primarily from higher sales volumes due to favorable weather compared to the prior year, a year in which we experienced a mild winter. Weather in Pennsylvania was essentially flat to our forecast for Q1 2021, with quarterly heating degree days slightly below normal conditions. Adjusted gross margins related to transmission were slightly lower for the first quarter. 
Returns on additional capital investments were offset by lower peak transmission demand and a reserve recorded as a result of a challenge to the transmission formula rate return on equity. Settlement negotiations related to the challenge are currently proceeding, but there can be no assurance that they will result in a final settlement. Finally, we experienced lower O&M expense of about $0.01 per share in Pennsylvania during the first quarter compared to 2020. Turning to our Kentucky Regulated segment. Results were $0.02 per share higher than our comparable results in Q1 2020. 
The increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes, primarily due to favorable weather, and similar to Pennsylvania, weather was flat compared to our forecast. Partially offsetting the increase from higher sales was higher operation and maintenance expense, primarily at our generation plants. Results at Corporate and Other were $0.01 lower compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher interest expense from the additional debt we issued at the start of the pandemic to ensure we had adequate liquidity to navigate the uncertainty. 
We expect our interest expense to be reduced significantly after we complete the liability management following the closing of the WPD sale. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince."

So yes, the state has enacted a net zero by 2050 goal through Executive Board or with the prior governor had aspirations for a 100% renewable generation by 2030. That's the executive order, not legislation. However, we feel very positive and very comfortable about the opportunity in front of us to partner with the state to really help them reposition that great to be ready for those ambitious goals. 
And we -- in our conversations, we've had many conversations with public officials up there around what our value proposition is to the state and why we think we're uniquely positioned to own these assets at this point in time. And to your point, Julien, I think what we've been able to create in Pennsylvania with -- we use the term grid of the future, utility of the future, with the automation and really having that grid setup for distributed energy resources and being able to not only be able to connect significantly more renewable energy behind-the-meter renewable energy, but to also to be able to have the insight and the ability to control those resources to ensure we can maintain power quality and stability of the grid. 
And so as we've been talking with the constituents in Rhode Island, we've been stressing that we've already built a lot of what they are going to need to achieve those objectives. And obviously, doing it the second time is easier and faster than doing it the first time. And so we think there's an incredible opportunity not only to support their 2050 ambitions, but their 2030 ambitions, I think, are potentially achievable as well given what to do in Pennsylvania and our confidence in our ability to replicate that and [indiscernible]. 
So to your earlier point, and you mentioned a little bit here, your question, we need to -- obviously, we talked about that in our petition.

But to your point, we need to close on the transaction and then really work on the capital investment plans with both the division and the commission up there, demonstrate what we've done. We'll be doing that through the petition process, I'm sure, through [indiscernible] and testimonies. 
And so we look forward to engaging with the constituents in Rhode Island to demonstrate our ability there. But to your point, we absolutely see that as an opportunity for us. But as importantly for the state of Rhode Island."

I don't think we have much in terms of further details to talk about versus what we talked about in March when we announced the transactions, we do continue to explore various options for the best use of the remaining proceeds we will certainly update the market at the appropriate time when we make a decision on that. In terms of M&A, that's one of the options that we will look at. 
We continuously look at M&A opportunities, as you know. I think our track record has demonstrated a disciplined approach there. Including the 2 transactions that we did with National Grid, both on the valuation we got for WPD, but the valuation that we paid for arrogance and both of those demonstrate a lot more discipline. And so we will continue that disciplined approach as we look at potential strategic acquisitions with the remaining use of proceeds. 
But there's also opportunities that we're looking at for, potentially, further investments in the utility. We talked about the opportunity in Rhode Island, but we'll also continue to look at those opportunities in Pennsylvania and Kentucky additional investments in renewables. We talked about that in March as well. I think when you look at the Biden's plans, both infrastructure plan and the clean energy plan, that will certainly continue to be a tailwind for renewable investment, and we think we're poised very well to take advantage of that with our distributed energy resource group. 
And then potentially share buybacks could be, again, the use of those proceeds, but we'll -- again, that kind of creates the base case that will look at these other opportunities. And I'll just stress, Julien that we'll continue to be disciplined in that analysis and work with the Board on those various options.

We appreciate you joining us for our first quarter earnings call. Moving to the agenda for today's call on Slide 3. I'll begin this morning with a brief overview of first quarter financial performance. I'll share a few operational highlights as well as an update on the 2 strategic transactions we announced in March. 
Joe will provide a more detailed overview of first quarter financial results. And as always, we'll leave ample time for your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced the first quarter reported net loss of $2.39 per share. This reflects special item net losses of $2.67 per share, primarily related to reporting WPD's discontinued operations this quarter. 
Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.28 per share compared with $0.27 per share a year ago. These results were in line with our expectations for the quarter. Compared to last year, improved margins were the most significant driver of the increase, primarily due to more favorable weather compared to the mild winter we experienced in 2020. 
Shifting to a few operational highlights. Now over a year into the pandemic, I'm pleased to report that operationally, all 7 of our utilities continue to perform extremely well with no operational issues to report. We continue to operate in a very similar manner to last year with many of our team members continuing to work from home. 
We continue to stress the importance of social distancing and mask wearing within our facilities and at our work site. With vaccinations in full swing, we are beginning to turn our attention to return-to-office planning and protocols. However, we are not expecting to deviate from our current mode of operations for at least a few more months and perhaps until end of summer for some of our locations. 
We've been able to operate extremely well during this virtual working environment, as evidenced not only by our strong operational performance, but also our ability to execute 2 significant strategic transactions simultaneously in a fully virtual manner. Our #1 priority has been and will continue to be the safety of our employees and our customers, so we will be very diligent in our return-to-office planning. 
Moving to an update on the Kentucky rate case proceedings. We reached unanimous settlement agreements subject to Kentucky Public Service Commission approval with all parties in our rate reviews for both LG&E and KU. The agreements cover all matters in the review except for net metering. We have a long track record of working constructively with the parties to our rate reviews to achieve positive outcomes that balance the interest of all our stakeholders, and this time was no exception. 
The settlement agreements were filed with the KPSC on April 19, and hearings were held last week. We expect KPSC orders on all settled matters by June 30 with new rates effective July 1. I'll review the terms of the settlement agreements in a bit more detail on the next slide. 
Moving to Pennsylvania. PPL Electric Utilities recently received the 2021 Energy Star Partner of the Year award from the EPA and Department of Energy. This award recognizes outstanding corporate energy management programs and is the EPA's highest level of recognition. It reflects PPL's commitment to protecting the environment and helping customers save energy and money. 
In April, we also made a number of leadership changes to help further position the company for long-term success, especially as we plan for the integration of Narragansett Electric into the PPL family of regulated utilities. Greg Dudkin was promoted to Chief Operating Officer of PPL from his prior role as President of PPL Electric Utilities. 
Under Greg's leadership over the past decade, PPL Electric Utilities has been focused squarely on creating the utility of the future. The business has developed one of the nation's most advanced electricity networks, has consistently delivered award-winning customer satisfaction and has firmly established itself as an industry leader in reliability. 
This advanced grid that we've built at PPL Electric Utilities uniquely positions us to partner with the state of Rhode Island in support of their ambitious decarbonization goals of net zero by 2050, and potentially driving toward 100% renewable energy by 2030. We continue to be very excited about the opportunity to bring our experience and expertise to an already very strong utility in Narragansett Electric. Greg will also focus on driving continuous improvement and best practices across our already strong regulated utility operations. 
Stephanie Raymond is succeeding Greg as the President of PPL Electric Utilities. Stephanie has been a key member of PPL Electric Utilities leadership team for nearly a decade and has led both the transmission and distribution functions. She has played a central role in spearheading our operational excellence in Pennsylvania as well as our forward-looking investments to strengthen grid resilience and prepare for increased distributed energy resources. 
Our Pennsylvania customers are in very good hands with Stephanie now at the helm of PPL Electric Utilities. We also hired Wendy Stark as our new Senior Vice President and General Counsel. Wendy replaces Joanne Raphael, who announced her retirement from the company effective June 1 after an impressive and distinguished 35-year career with our company. We certainly wish Joanne all the best as she transitions to this new phase of her life. Wendy joins PPL from Pepco Holdings, where she served as Senior Vice President, Legal and Regulatory Strategy and General Counsel. 
Wendy is an excellent addition to our team, and she's already making her presence known as we prepare for the regulatory approval process for the Narragansett acquisition. She brings to PPL significant experience in leading legal teams and extensive background in regulatory matters and a deep knowledge of our industry. I'm very excited about the strong leadership team that we've assembled here at PPL. 
I believe it's the right team at the right time as we strategically reposition PPL for long-term growth and success. Finally, I'll note that we continue to make good progress on the regulatory approval processes related to both the WPD sale and the Narragansett acquisition. In the U.K., we remain on track to close the WPD sale by the end of July. On April 22, National Grid shareowners voted overwhelmingly to approve the transaction. 
And on May 4, we received the Guernsey approval, leaving just the Financial Conduct Authority approval outstanding in the U.K. While we have no assurance as to the timing of this final approval, the WPD sale could close as early as this month. In the U.S., we've made all the required regulatory filings to secure approval for the Narragansett Electric acquisition. 
We've requested the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers to decide on our petition by November 1, 2021. While we cannot be assured the division will decide on our petition in that time frame, we remain confident in our ability to close on the acquisition by March of next year. The transition teams for both PPL and National Grid have been formed and have actively begun planning to ensure a seamless transition for both employees and Rhode Island customers upon the approval and closing of the transaction. 
The PPL transition team is being led by Greg Dudkin, with strong executive presence and experienced leaders on the team, who will oversee the eventual integration of Narragansett Electric into PPL. I'll also note that we've had very constructive discussions with public officials in Rhode Island since our announcement. These interactions have only strengthened my belief that PPL is well positioned to drive real value for Rhode Island customers in their communities and to play a key role in helping the state achieve its ambitious decarbonization goals. 
Turning to Slide 5 in a bit more detail on the settlement agreements in Kentucky. We believe the agreements, which again require approval of the KPSC, represent constructive outcomes for all stakeholders and that they minimize the near-term rate impact on customers while still providing LG&E and KU the opportunity to recover their costs while providing safe and reliable service. The settlements proposed a combined revenue increase of $217 million for LG&E and KU with an allowed base ROE of 9.55%. These revenue increases enable LG&E and KU to continue modernizing the grid, strengthening grid resilience and upgrading LG&E's natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability. 
They include LG&E and KU'S proposed $53 million economic release store credit to help mitigate the impact of the rate adjustments until mid-2022. The stipulation reflects the continuation of the currently approved depreciation rates for Mill Creek Units 1 and 2 and Brown Unit 3 for rate-making purposes, rather than using the depreciation rates proposed in our original applications. 
We had initially requested the depreciation rates for these units to be updated with their expected retirement over the next decade as they reach the end of their economic useful lives. This adjustment reduces the requested revenue increases by approximately $70 million. In a related provision, the settlement agreements also proposed the establishment of a retired asset recovery rider to provide recovery of and on the remaining net book values of retired generation assets as well as associated inventory and decommissioning costs. 
The rider would provide recovery over a 10-year period upon retirement as well as a return on those investments at the utilities than weighted average cost of capital. As we announced in January, Mill Creek Unit 1 is expected to retire in 2024. And Mill Creek Unit 2 and E.W. Brown Unit 3 are expected to be retired in 2028 as they reach the end of their economic useful lives. 
These units represent a combined 1,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity. The settlements also proposed full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure. I'll note that the capital cost of the proposed AMI investment is not included in the revenue requirements in these rate cases. We'll record our investment in the AMI project as CWIP and accrue AFUDC during the AMI implementation period. 
And finally, the settlement agreements include commitments that LG&E and KU will not increase base rates for at least 4 years, subject to certain exceptions. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a detailed overview of our first quarter financial results. Joe?"

I'll cover our first quarter segment results on Slide 6. With the U.K. now reflected as discontinued operations, we removed the U.K. Regulated segment from our quarterly earnings walk. In connection with this",436,"Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover our first quarter segment results on Slide 6. With the U.K. now reflected as discontinued operations, we removed the U.K. Regulated segment from our quarterly earnings walk. In connection with this change, we have also updated our ongoing segment presentation for certain items. First, we have adjusted the 2020 Corporate and Other amount to reflect certain costs previously reflected in the U.K. Regulated segment, which was primarily interest expense. 
The total amount of these costs was about $0.01 per share for the quarter. In addition, beginning with our 2021 results, corporate-level financing costs will no longer be allocated for segment reporting purposes. Those costs were primarily related to the acquisition financing of the Kentucky Regulated segment and will also be reflected in Corporate and Other moving forward. 
Now turning to the domestic segment drivers. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results were flat compared to a year ago. During the first quarter, we experienced higher distribution, adjusted gross margins resulting primarily from higher sales volumes due to favorable weather compared to the prior year, a year in which we experienced a mild winter. Weather in Pennsylvania was essentially flat to our forecast for Q1 2021, with quarterly heating degree days slightly below normal conditions. Adjusted gross margins related to transmission were slightly lower for the first quarter. 
Returns on additional capital investments were offset by lower peak transmission demand and a reserve recorded as a result of a challenge to the transmission formula rate return on equity. Settlement negotiations related to the challenge are currently proceeding, but there can be no assurance that they will result in a final settlement. Finally, we experienced lower O&M expense of about $0.01 per share in Pennsylvania during the first quarter compared to 2020. 
Turning to our Kentucky Regulated segment. Results were $0.02 per share higher than our comparable results in Q1 2020.  The increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes, primarily due to favorable weather. And similar to Pennsylvania, weather was flat compared to our forecast. Partially offsetting the increase from higher sales was higher operation and maintenance expense, primarily at our generation plants. Results at Corporate and Other were $0.01 lower compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher interest expense from the additional debt we issued at the start of the pandemic to ensure we had adequate liquidity to navigate the uncertainty. 
We expect our interest expense to be reduced significantly after we complete the liability management following the closing of the WPD sale. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince."

You cut out a little bit throughout that, but I think your question was how are we thinking about Rhode Island's trajectory given the clean energy mandate there. So yes, the state has enacted a net zero by 2050 goal. They, through executive order with the prior governor, had aspirations for 100% renewable generation by 2030. That's the executive order, not legislation. However, we feel very positive and very comfortable about the opportunity in front of us to partner with the state to really help them reposition that grid to be ready for those ambitious goals. 
And we -- in our conversations, we've had many conversations with public officials up there around what our value proposition is to the state and why we think we're uniquely positioned to own these assets at this point in time. And to your point, Julien, I think what we've been able to create in Pennsylvania with -- we use the term grid of the future, utility of the future, with the automation and really having that grid setup for distributed energy resources and being able to not only be able to connect significantly more renewable energy, behind-the-meter renewable energy, but to also to be able to have the insight and the ability to control those resources to ensure we can maintain power quality and stability of the grid. 
And so as we've been talking with the constituents in Rhode Island, we've been stressing that we've already built a lot of what they are going to need to achieve those objectives. And obviously, doing it the second time is easier and faster than doing it the first time. And so we think there's an incredible opportunity not only to support their 2050 ambitions. But their 2030 ambitions, I think, are potentially achievable as well given what we've been able to do in Pennsylvania and then our confidence in our ability to replicate that in Rhode Island. 
So to your earlier point, and you mentioned a little bit in your question, we need to -- obviously, we talked about that in our petition. And we've been very open in our discussions with the commission and the division as well as just some of the public officials. But to your point, we need to close on the transaction and then really work on the capital investment plans with both the division and the commission up there, demonstrate what we've done. We'll be doing that through the petition process, I'm sure, through interview and testimonies. 
And so we look forward to engaging with the constituents in Rhode Island to demonstrate our ability there. But to your point, we absolutely see that as an opportunity for us but as importantly for the state of Rhode Island."

We do continue to explore various options for the best use of the remaining proceeds. We will certainly update the market at the appropriate time when we make a decision on that. In terms of M&A, that's one of the options that we will look at. 
We continuously look at M&A opportunities, as you know. I think our track record has demonstrated a disciplined approach there, including the 2 transactions that we did with National Grid, both on the valuation we got for WPD but the valuation that we paid for Narragansett. Both of those demonstrate a lot of discipline. And so we will continue that disciplined approach as we look at potential strategic acquisitions with the remaining use of proceeds. 
But there's also opportunities that we're looking at for, potentially, further investments in the utilities. We talked about the opportunity in Rhode Island, but we'll also continue to look at those opportunities in Pennsylvania and Kentucky. Additional investments in renewables, we talked about that in March as well. I think when you look at the Biden plans, both infrastructure plan and the clean energy plan, that will certainly continue to be a tailwind for renewable investment. And we think we're poised very well to take advantage of that with our distributed energy resource group. 
And then potentially, share buybacks could be, again, a use of those proceeds. But we'll -- again, that kind of creates the base case that we'll look at these other opportunities. And I'll just stress, Julien, that we'll continue to be disciplined in that analysis and work with the Board on those various options.

After we make the acquisition, we do certainly think there's potential opportunity to deploy more capital than what was being spent previously, especially if the state wants to meet some of those more aggressive targets in that 2030, '35 time frame. And then the challenge for us, which, again, we think we're up to the challenge, but what we'll have to do is work with the division and the commission to show a path to make that investment in a way that remains affordability for the state. And that would likely come from being more efficient on the O&M side that would enable that investment without necessarily driving up customer rates significantly. 
So that's the opportunity, Paul, to be honest. And we just need to work through the details with both the division and the commission in the state once we close the deal."

We appreciate you joining us for our second quarter investor update. 
Moving to Slide 3 and the agenda for today's call. I'll begin this morning with an overview of the exciting quarter we've had here at PPL, including an update on our strategic repositioning, our newly announced net 0 emissions goal along with a brief operational update. Joe will then provide a detailed review of second quarter financial results and walk through some recent actions we've taken to strengthen PPL's balance sheet. And as always, we'll leave ample time for your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. The second quarter has been a busy one as we continue to advance the strategic repositioning of the company. First, we completed the sale of our U.K. utility, achieving exceptional value for the business and once again demonstrating our ability to deliver on our strategic priorities to maximize shareowner value. The sale resulted in net cash proceeds of $10.4 billion, which will support the repositioning of PPL as high-growth U.S. regulated utility company. As a reminder, we've earmarked $3.8 billion of those proceeds to acquire Narragansett Electric from National Grid. We also deployed some of the proceeds to achieve our previously stated objective of strengthening our balance sheet, utilizing $3.9 billion to retire $3.5 billion of outstanding holding company debt which will provide the company with substantial financial flexibility. Regarding the remaining proceeds, we continue to review various options as previously discussed, including investing incremental capital at our utilities or in renewable energy as well as the repurchase of PPL shares. On the topic of share repurchases, our Board recently authorized the company to repurchase up to $3 billion in PPL common stock. We currently expect to repurchase about $500 million by year-end, while we continue to assess other opportunities to deploy proceeds to maximize shareowner value. The actual amount we apply to share repurchases will depend on various factors, including the determination of other uses for the proceeds. We believe our current plan provides a balance of an efficient use of proceeds while still maintaining financial flexibility. I'll note that we are in the process of reevaluating our capital plans for incremental investment opportunities for the benefit of our customers. As a result, we have removed our prior capital and rate base projections from our presentation. We'll provide further updates to our capital and rate base plans after we complete this review. The U.K. sale represented an important first step in our strategic repositioning. Simplifying our structure with a clear focus on U.S. rate-regulated utilities and strengthening our balance sheet while providing much greater flexibility to support future growth. We're also making great progress in the acquisition of Narragansett Electric in Rhode Island. To date, we've satisfied our HSR and FCC requirements. And on July 16, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities granted a waiver of jurisdiction over the sale, streamlining the overall path to regulatory approval for the acquisition. We continue to make progress on securing approvals from FERC and the Rhode Island division of public utilities and carriers, which are the 2 remaining approvals required for the transaction. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to close the transaction by March of next year with hopes of closing before year-end. As we pursue the final regulatory approvals, we are working closely with National Grid on transition planning to ensure a seamless transition for Rhode Island customers and Narragansett employees upon closing. We've also announced our planned leadership team for the Rhode Island Utility, Dave Bonenberger, who has nearly 4 decades of energy industry experience, including leading both the transmission and distribution businesses at PPL Electric Utilities will serve as the Rhode Island President upon completion of the transaction. Dave is well positioned to lead the execution of our operational strategy in Rhode Island as we seek to drive significant value for Rhode Island customers, and to support the state's decarbonization goals. Dave will be joined in Rhode Island by former National Grid employees in creating a strong, experienced and local leadership team with a deep commitment to delivering energy safely and reliably to Rhode Island customers. 
Moving to Slide 5. In addition to strong execution towards our strategic repositioning, we also continue to advance our clean energy transition strategy and announced a new net 0 carbon emissions goal this morning. This goal encompasses greenhouse gas emissions from our Kentucky generation as well as other aspects of our business as outlined in the footnote on the slide. PPL is fully committed to driving innovation to enable net 0 carbon emissions by 2050. And to ensure a balanced, responsible and just transition for our employees, communities and customers as we advance towards our clean energy goals. Our new goal reflects our continuous evaluation of our progress and opportunities through ongoing business and resource planning efforts. Based on our latest reviews, we believe we are on a path to achieve 80% emissions reduction by 2040, a full decade ahead of our prior goal. As a result, in addition to today's announced net 0 emissions goal, we've also accelerated our previous interim goals, now targeting an 80% reduction by 2040 and a 70% reduction by 2035. In addition, we are undertaking an enterprise-wide effort to enhance our clean energy strategy and develop additional programs, metrics and goals that will guide our path to net 0 emissions. We've hired an industry-leading global consulting firm to assist us in this endeavor. In addition to the strategic initiative, we are completing an updated scenario-based climate assessment to evaluate the potential impacts to PPL from climate change and potential future requirements. Our last climate assessment report was published in 2017. Our updated assessment, which we intend to publish later this year, will analyze multiple scenarios, including a scenario tied to limiting the global temperature increase to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. As we conduct our climate assessment, our efforts will be informed by our ongoing integrated resource planning activities in Kentucky. LG&E and KU submit an IRP once every 3 years to the Kentucky Public Service Commission. And the next IRP will be filed in October of this year. Both the Climate Assessment and the IRP will serve as key inputs as we further define the pathway to achieving our emissions goals. Wrapping up this slide, we recognize that achieving these emissions reductions while maintaining reliability and affordability will require significant advances in clean energy technology and solutions, that can be scaled economically to meet the country's energy needs. This is especially true as we support greater electrification of other sectors. With that in mind, investing in research and development is a key pillar of our clean energy strategy. And we continue to look for opportunities to engage in this area to drive the innovation and solutions necessary to achieve net 0. PPL, for example, is an anchor sponsor of the low carbon resources initiative, being led by EPRI in the Gas Technology Institute and I chair EPRI's LCRI Board Working Group. We also recently joined Energy Impact Partners global investment platform, which brings together leading companies and entrepreneurs worldwide to foster innovation towards a sustainable energy future. Through our participation in the EIP platform, PPL will support up to $50 million in investments aimed at accelerating shift to a low carbon future and driving commercial scale solutions needed to deliver deep economy-wide decarbonization. Apart from LCRI and EIP's investment platform, we also continue to engage in a number of other R&D efforts related to clean energy technologies and enhancing the power grid. These collaborative efforts provide PPL greater visibility into emerging technologies that can be leveraged to advance the clean energy transition, and we will continue to look for opportunity to expand our work and support in this area. 
Moving to Slide 6. We've outlined our updated path to net 0 carbon emissions on this slide, along with our current expectations on coal-fired generation capacity in Kentucky, which is consistent with the generation planning and analysis study included in our recently approved rate case filings. It's clear that we'll need to advance technology to achieve net 0 emissions by 2050 as we balance the need for affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for our customers. Based on these current factors and consistent with our most recent rate case filings in Kentucky, we currently expect to achieve a reduction in our coal-fired capacity of 70% by 2035, 90% by 2040 and 95% by 2050 from our baseline in 2010. We anticipate having about 550 megawatts of remaining coal-fired generation in 2050, due to our highly efficient and relatively new Trimble County Unit 2 that started commercial operation in 2011. Therefore, our objective is to continue to explore innovative ways through our R&D efforts to economically drive these reductions further while supporting our customers and local communities. We have also assessed the implications of advancing these goals even further. Our internal view of what it could take to achieve 100% carbon-free generation by 2035 as proposed by the Biden administration using current technologies would create significant affordability issues for our customers. our new commitment to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by 2050 is backed by the actions that we are and will continue to take to support a low-carbon energy system that is affordable and reliable and provides the time needed for technology to advance. 
Next, on Slide 7, I'll cover the details of the Kentucky rate cases. On June 30, the KPSC approved the settlements that LG&E and KU had reached with parties to their rate reviews with certain modifications. At a high level, the orders support continued investment to modernize our energy infrastructure, strengthen grid resilience and upgrade LG&E's natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability for those we serve. Effective July 1, the KPSC authorized a combined $199 million increase in annual revenue for LG&E and KU with an allowed base ROE of 9.425% and a 9.35% ROE for the environmental cost recovery and gas line tracker mechanisms. In addition, the KPSC approved a $53 million economic release store credit, that was proposed by LG&E and KU to help mitigate the impact of rate adjustments until mid-2022. Importantly, the commission's order authorized full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, which will empower customers with detailed energy usage information, enable LG&E and KU to respond more fleet to power outages and improve operational efficiency. We continue to believe the resulting O&M savings from installing advanced meters will exceed the cost of this investment for the benefit of our customers. The $350 million capital cost of the proposed AMI investment is not included in rates that took effect July 1. Instead, we will record our investment in the AMI project at [indiscernible] and accrue AFUDC during the project's implementation period. The KPSC also approved a very constructive retired asset recovery rider to provide recovery of and a return on the remaining net book value of retired generation assets as well as associated inventory and decommissioning costs. The rider will provide cost recovery over a 10-year period upon retirement of such assets as well as return on those investments at the utilities then weighted average cost of capital. As we announced in January, Mill Creek Unit 1 is expected to retire in 2024. Mill Creek Unit 2 and EW Brown Unit 3 are expected to be retired in 2028 as they reach the end of their economic useful lives. These units represent a combined 1,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity. The retired asset recovery rider balances the interest of all stakeholders and provide certainty of recovery for the prudent investments made in these coal plants. Pursuant to the settlement agreements approved by the KPSC, LG&E and KU have committed that they will not increase the new base rates for at least 4 years, subject to certain exceptions. And before leaving this slide, I would note that in approving the settlement agreements, the commission adjusted the proposed base ROE downward from 9.55% to 9.425% and disallowed the recovery of certain legal costs. These modifications reduced the annual revenue requirements proposed in the settlements by approximately $20 million. We have filed a request for a limited rehearing on these matters. 
And finally, turning to Slide 8. In other highlights across PPL, we continue to achieve recognition for our strong commitment to diversity equity inclusion, innovation and safety. During the second quarter, PPL was recognized by Diversity Inc. in 2 distinct areas. First, as 1 of the top utilities in the nation for workforce diversity and second, as 1 of the top 50 companies for ESG, determined by several factors, including our programs and practices surrounding talent in the workforce, corporate social responsibility and philanthropy, supplier diversity programs and overall leadership in governance. PPL was also named the Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion for the fourth consecutive year, earning a perfect score on the 2021 disability equality index. And finally, PPL Electric Utilities received the Southeastern Electric Changes Chairman's Award for its groundbreaking technology that safely and automatically cuts power to down power line. These awards reflect the corporate strategy focused on creating value for all stakeholders as grounded in our 5 strategic priorities. These include achieving industry-leading performance and safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and optional efficiency, advancing a clean energy transition while maintaining affordability and reliability, maintain a strong financial foundation and creating long-term value for our shareowners, fostering a diverse and exceptional workplace and building strong communities in the areas we serve. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Joe?"

Turning to Slide 10. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.03 per share. This reflects special item net losses of $0.16 per share, primarily related to a U.K. tax rate change and a loss",716,"Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. 
Turning to Slide 10. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.03 per share. This reflects special item net losses of $0.16 per share, primarily related to a U.K. tax rate change and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by earnings from the U.K. utility business that have been recorded as discontinued operations. I'll note that the tax-related item was a noncash adjustment prior to the completion of the sale of WPD in June. Adjusting for these special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.19 per share compared with $0.20 per share a year ago. We remain encouraged by the economic recovery from the pandemic in both our Pennsylvania and Kentucky jurisdictions, which has resulted in continuously improving commercial and industrial sales. These higher sales were offset by several factors, which I will cover on the next slide. 
So let's move to Slide 11 for a more detailed look at our second quarter segment results. As a reminder, we've adjusted the 2020 corporate and other amount to reflect certain costs previously reflected in the U.K. Regulated segment, which was primarily interest expense. Total amount of these costs was about $0.02 per share for the quarter. Turning to the ongoing segment results. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results were $0.02 per share lower compared to a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower adjusted gross margins, driven by lower transmission demand as discussed in Q1 and consistent with our expectations and an increase in the reserve recorded as a result of a challenge to the transmission-based return on equity. Partially offsetting these negative variances were increased returns on additional capital investments. We also experienced an additional $0.01 decline due to favorable tax-related items recorded in the second quarter of 2020. Turning to our Kentucky Regulated segment. Results were $0.01 per share higher than our comparable results in Q2 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher commercial and industrial demand revenue as we experienced a strong recovery in 2021 in these sectors from the significant impacts of COVID-19 and lower interest expense, primarily due to the interest costs previously allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment in 2020 that are now reflected in Corporate & Other. Partly offsetting these items was higher operation and maintenance expense, primarily at our generation plants. Results at Corporate & Other were flat compared with a year ago. Higher interest costs of $0.01 a share related to the corporate debt previously allocated to the Kentucky segment were offset by several factors that were not individually significant. 
Turning to Slide 12. I'll cover some notable financing-related updates. First, following the sale of the U.K. utility business, we successfully completed a series of financing activities in June and July that led to a significant reduction in holding company debt. The result was a total reduction of PPL capital funding debt by about $3.5 billion, which was in line with our previously discussed targets. Through these actions, we've reduced total holding company debt to about 20% of PPL's total outstanding debt, while effectively clearing all near-term maturities at PPL capital funding through 2025. We've provided a detailed breakdown of these actions in the appendix of today's presentation. In addition to the activity of PPL capital funding, we redeemed at par $250 million at LG&E and KU Energy in July, which was part of our original financing plan for the year in order to simplify the capital structure of the company by eliminating intermediate holding company debt. That was the final remaining outstanding debt security at the LKE entity. Therefore, we have deregistered LKE as we no longer expect to issue debt out of this entity. We expect PPL capital funding will be the financing entity at the holding company level to provide support to all of our operating subsidiaries. The successful execution of liability management leaves PPL well positioned and on track to achieve our targeted credit metrics post closing of the Narragansett Electric acquisition. In addition to these notable financing updates, we also reduced outstanding short-term debt as an efficient use of available cash until we fully deploy the remaining proceeds from the sale of WPD. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince."

And again, from a capital deployment perspective, we think deploying capital into the utilities can create significant value for all of our customers and our share owners. So a lot of work going on right now going through that. You mentioned having the closure of Rhode Island. That's obviously a key component of how we think about capital deployment moving forward within the utilities. So in terms of timing, we'll want to see the closure of getting deals done. You also mentioned the IRP in Kentucky, that as well as the climate assessment report, those will be key inputs into our clean energy strategy going forward. There could be some capital deployment opportunities coming out of that. So yes, you're -- I think you hit all the points in terms of the areas that we're looking at that will ultimately drive the organic use of the remaining proceeds. 
In terms of M&A, I would just say that, first of all, we don't need M&A to hit targets that we're -- we're targeting from both an earnings and a growth perspective. And we will continue to be disciplined as we look at M&A opportunities as we always have been. I'll just say that current valuations that we're seeing in the market are quite high. The utilities are trading quite expensively right now. We didn't pay anywhere near some of those valuations for Rhode Island, and we continue to think that Rhode Island acquisition will drive value for our share owners. It will be earnings accretive, credit accretive and value accretive for our shareowners. So again, from our perspective, maintaining discipline is incredibly important, and we'll continue to do that."

They are quite aggressive when you -- when you compare them to other states, which we completely think we can support with what we've been able to accomplish in Pennsylvania and be able to replicate that up there. So I think for us, Durgesh, it's really about working with the state stakeholders and identify how quickly they want to move on that. And then how quickly can we deploy our operating model and keep it affordable for customers and so that's -- we see tremendous opportunity up there, but that's something that we'll be working on once we close the deal.

You talked about EPRI and the low carbon resources initiative. So I've just recently took over the Board working group chair role for EPRI. And so we're integrally involved with the expert team at EPRI and looking at various different technologies. Again, as it relates to carbon capture, new nuclear, hydrogen, ammonia all different types of decarbonization technology, again EPRI is focused on what are the technology breakthroughs that are currently being -- or the technologies, the emerging technologies that are currently being looked at, but they're also assessing alternatives to those and then identifying demigration projects down the road to try to commercialize some of these newer technologies. And so we are actively engaged with them on all of that, depending on how those things evolve, whether it's hydrogen for storage or even hydrogen blending for gas LDCs or combined cycle generation. There's a way to go, I think, to prove all that out for hydrogen, but there's a lot of work and a lot of activity going on there. Our caricature sequestration continues to be an area. Again, about 80% of the world's energy is coming from fossil fuel spill. So for the growth to get to net 0 at some point, we think carbon capture will have to play a role in that. And so EPRI is spending some time on that as well. Again, nuclear looking at different forms of nuclear modular units, et cetera, could also play a role but making those units smaller and more adaptable. So a lot of things going on there, Paul. And I think we're -- our strategy is to make sure that we keep our finger on the pulse there. Again, we'll be be retiring coal plants this decade and next. And so could there be potential opportunities for demonstration projects on some of those plants. We'll work with the state to see if there's opportunities there as we think about, again, Trimble County 2 which went in service in 2011. And so unless teams change at the federal level, where that plant will be forced to be shut. Our current projection is that it would continue to be economic in 2050.

In terms of the mechanisms, while we're staying out, first of all, I would just say that, again, in Pennsylvania, we've been very successful at growing our rate base and our earnings despite staying out of rate cases. And we haven't had a distribution rate case since January 1, 2016. But over that time, and again, this is just distribution. We've grown our rate base 6%, 7% CAGR over that time period, and our net income CAGR has pretty much stayed in line with that rate base growth. And the way that you're able to do that is obviously we have some mechanisms within the different jurisdictions that that reduce regulatory lag, whether it's the disc NPA or the ECR and the gas line tracker and Kentucky, of course, we had some in Rhode Island as well around capital planning. But also when you deploy the capital. In many cases, you will see operational efficiencies as a result to those operational efficiencies can drive the return on that capital even though you're staying out of rate cases. I will say that our -- we don't think the right answer just because we're staying out of rate cases is not to invest in the networks. It's incredibly important, and we continue to reinvest in the networks and then making sure that we do that in a way that drives efficiency for the customers and drives a return while we're staying out. We have experience and have successfully done that in Pennsylvania. So we'll look to replicate that. But just because we're staying out, we don't think that, that means that there won't be rate base or earnings growth opportunity."

We appreciate you joining us for our second quarter investor update.  Moving to Slide 3 and the agenda for today's call. I'll begin this morning with an overview of the exciting quarter we've had here at PPL,",2260,"Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our second quarter investor update.  
Moving to Slide 3 and the agenda for today's call. I'll begin this morning with an overview of the exciting quarter we've had here at PPL, including an update on our strategic repositioning, our newly announced net-zero emissions goal along with a brief operational update. Joe will then provide a detailed review of second quarter financial results and walk through some recent actions we've taken to strengthen PPL's balance sheet. And as always, we'll leave ample time for your questions.  
Turning to Slide 4. The second quarter has been a busy one as we continue to advance the strategic repositioning of the company. First, we completed the sale of our U.K. utility, achieving exceptional value for the business and once again demonstrating our ability to deliver on our strategic priorities to maximize shareowner value. The sale resulted in net cash proceeds of $10.4 billion, which will support the repositioning of PPL as a high-growth U.S. regulated utility company.
As a reminder, we've earmarked $3.8 billion of those proceeds to acquire Narragansett Electric from National Grid. We also deployed some of the proceeds to achieve our previously stated objective of strengthening our balance sheet, utilizing $3.9 billion to retire $3.5 billion of outstanding holding company debt which will provide the company with substantial financial flexibility.
Regarding the remaining proceeds, we continue to review various options as previously discussed, including investing incremental capital at our utilities or in renewable energy as well as the repurchase of PPL shares. On the topic of share repurchases, our Board recently authorized the company to repurchase up to $3 billion in PPL common stock. We currently expect to repurchase about $500 million by year-end, while we continue to assess other opportunities to deploy proceeds to maximize shareowner value.
The actual amount we apply to share repurchases will depend on various factors, including the determination of other uses for the proceeds. We believe our current plan provides a balance of an efficient use of proceeds while still maintaining financial flexibility. I'll note that we are in the process of reevaluating our capital plans for incremental investment opportunities for the benefit of our customers.
As a result, we have removed our prior capital and rate base projections from our presentation. We'll provide further updates to our capital and rate base plans after we complete this review. The U.K. sale represented an important first step in our strategic repositioning. Simplifying our structure with a clear focus on U.S. rate-regulated utilities and strengthening our balance sheet while providing much greater flexibility to support future growth. We're also making great progress in the acquisition of Narragansett Electric in Rhode Island.
To date, we've satisfied our HSR and FCC requirements. And on July 16, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities granted a waiver of jurisdiction over the sale, streamlining the overall path to regulatory approval for the acquisition. We continue to make progress on securing approvals from FERC and the Rhode Island division of public utilities and carriers, which are the 2 remaining approvals required for the transaction.
Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to close the transaction by March of next year with hopes of closing before year-end. As we pursue the final regulatory approvals, we are working closely with National Grid on transition planning to ensure a seamless transition for Rhode Island customers and Narragansett employees upon closing. We've also announced our planned leadership team for the Rhode Island Utility, Dave Bonenberger, who has nearly 4 decades of energy industry experience, including leading both the transmission and distribution businesses at PPL Electric Utilities will serve as the Rhode Island President upon completion of the transaction. Dave is well positioned to lead the execution of our operational strategy in Rhode Island as we seek to drive significant value for Rhode Island customers, and to support the state's decarbonization goals. Dave will be joined in Rhode Island by former National Grid employees in creating a strong, experienced and local leadership team with a deep commitment to delivering energy safely and reliably to Rhode Island customers.
Moving to Slide 5. In addition to strong execution towards our strategic repositioning, we also continue to advance our clean energy transition strategy and announced a new net-zero carbon emissions goal this morning. This goal encompasses greenhouse gas emissions from our Kentucky generation as well as other aspects of our business as outlined in the footnote on the slide. PPL is fully committed to driving innovation to enable net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. And to ensure a balanced, responsible and just transition for our employees, communities and customers as we advance towards our clean energy goals.
Our new goal reflects our continuous evaluation of our progress and opportunities through ongoing business and resource planning efforts. Based on our latest reviews, we believe we are on a path to achieve 80% emissions reduction by 2040, a full decade ahead of our prior goal. As a result, in addition to today's announced net-zero emissions goal, we've also accelerated our previous interim goals, now targeting an 80% reduction by 2040 and a 70% reduction by 2035. In addition, we are undertaking an enterprise-wide effort to enhance our clean energy strategy and develop additional programs, metrics and goals that will guide our path to net-zero emissions. We've hired an industry-leading global consulting firm to assist us in this endeavor. 
In addition to the strategic initiative, we are completing an updated scenario-based climate assessment to evaluate the potential impacts to PPL from climate change and potential future requirements. Our last climate assessment report was published in 2017. Our updated assessment, which we intend to publish later this year, will analyze multiple scenarios, including a scenario tied to limiting the global temperature increase to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. As we conduct our climate assessment, our efforts will be informed by our ongoing integrated resource planning activities in Kentucky. LG&E and KU submit an IRP once every 3 years to the Kentucky Public Service Commission.  And the next IRP will be filed in October of this year. Both the Climate Assessment and the IRP will serve as key inputs as we further define the pathway to achieving our emissions goals. 
Wrapping up this slide, we recognize that achieving these emissions reductions while maintaining reliability and affordability will require significant advances in clean energy technology and solutions, that can be scaled economically to meet the country's energy needs. This is especially true as we support greater electrification of other sectors. With that in mind, investing in research and development is a key pillar of our clean energy strategy. And we continue to look for opportunities to engage in this area to drive the innovation and solutions necessary to achieve net-zero. PPL, for example, is an anchor sponsor of the low carbon resources initiative, being led by EPRI in the Gas Technology Institute and I chair EPRI's LCRI Board Working Group. 
We also recently joined Energy Impact Partners global investment platform, which brings together leading companies and entrepreneurs worldwide to foster innovation towards a sustainable energy future. Through our participation in the EIP platform, PPL will support up to $50 million in investments aimed at accelerating shift to a low carbon future and driving commercial scale solutions needed to deliver deep economy-wide decarbonization. Apart from LCRI and EIP's investment platform, we also continue to engage in a number of other R&D efforts related to clean energy technologies and enhancing the power grid. These collaborative efforts provide PPL greater visibility into emerging technologies that can be leveraged to advance the clean energy transition, and we will continue to look for opportunity to expand our work and support in this area.
Moving to Slide 6. We've outlined our updated path to net-zero carbon emissions on this slide, along with our current expectations on coal-fired generation capacity in Kentucky, which is consistent with the generation planning and analysis study included in our recently approved rate case filings. It's clear that we'll need to advance technology to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 as we balance the need for affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for our customers. Based on these current factors and consistent with our most recent rate case filings in Kentucky, we currently expect to achieve a reduction in our coal-fired capacity of 70% by 2035, 90% by 2040 and 95% by 2050 from our baseline in 2010. We anticipate having about 550 megawatts of remaining coal-fired generation in 2050, due to our highly efficient and relatively new Trimble County Unit 2 that started commercial operation in 2011. 
Therefore, our objective is to continue to explore innovative ways through our R&D efforts to economically drive these reductions further while supporting our customers and local communities.  We have also assessed the implications of advancing these goals even further. Our internal view of what it could take to achieve 100% carbon-free generation by 2035 as proposed by the Biden administration using current technologies would create significant affordability issues for our customers. our new commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 is backed by the actions that we are and will continue to take to support a low-carbon energy system that is affordable and reliable and provides the time needed for technology to advance.
Next, on Slide 7, I'll cover the details of the Kentucky rate cases. On June 30, the KPSC approved the settlements that LG&E and KU had reached with parties to their rate reviews with certain modifications. At a high level, the orders support continued investment to modernize our energy infrastructure, strength and grid resilience and upgrade LG&E's natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability for those we serve. Effective July 1, the KPSC authorized a combined $199 million increase in annual revenue for LG&E and KU with an allowed base ROE of 9.425% and a 9.35% ROE for the environmental cost recovery and gas line tracker mechanisms.
In addition, the KPSC approved a $53 million economic release or credit that was proposed by LG&E and KU to help mitigate the impact of rate adjustments until mid-2022. Importantly, the commission's order authorized full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, which will empower customers with detailed energy usage information, enable LG&E and KU to respond more quickly to power outages and improve operational efficiency. We continue to believe the resulting O&M savings from installing advanced meters will exceed the cost of this investment for the benefit of our customers. The $350 million capital cost of the proposed AMI investment is not included in the new rates that took effect July 1. Instead, we will record our investment in the AMI project as CWIP and accrue AFUDC during the project's implementation period.
The KPSC also approved a very constructive retired asset recovery rider to provide recovery of and a return on the remaining net book values of retired generation assets as well as associated inventory and decommissioning costs. The rider will provide cost recovery over a 10-year period upon retirement of such assets as well as return on those investments at the utilities then weighted average cost of capital. As we announced in January, Mill Creek Unit 1 is expected to retire in 2024. Mill Creek Unit 2 and EW Brown Unit 3 are expected to be retired in 2028 as they reach the end of their economic useful lives. These units represent a combined 1,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity.  The retired asset recovery rider balances the interest of all stakeholders and provide certainty of recovery for the prudent investments made in these coal plants. Pursuant to the settlement agreements approved by the KPSC, LG&E and KU have committed that they will not increase the new base rates for at least 4 years, subject to certain exceptions. 
And before leaving this slide, I would note that in approving the settlement agreements, the commission adjusted the proposed base ROE downward from 9.55% to 9.425% and disallowed the recovery of certain legal costs. These modifications reduced the annual revenue requirements proposed in the settlements by approximately $20 million. We have filed a request for a limited rehearing on these matters.  
And finally, turning to Slide 8. In other highlights across PPL, we continue to achieve recognition for our strong commitment to diversity equity inclusion, innovation and safety. During the second quarter, PPL was recognized by Diversity Inc. in 2 distinct areas. First, as 1 of the top utilities in the nation for workforce diversity and second, as 1 of the top 50 companies for ESG, determined by several factors, including our programs and practices surrounding talent in the workforce, corporate social responsibility and philanthropy, supplier diversity programs and overall leadership in governance. PPL was also named the Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion for the fourth consecutive year, earning a perfect score on the 2021 disability equality index.
And finally, PPL Electric Utilities received the  Southeastern Electric Exchange’s Chairman’s Award for its groundbreaking technology that safely and automatically cuts power to down power line. These awards reflect the corporate strategy focused on creating value for all stakeholders as grounded in our 5 strategic priorities. These include achieving industry-leading performance and safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and optional efficiency, advancing a clean energy transition while maintaining affordability and reliability, maintaining a strong financial foundation and creating a long-term value for our shareowners, fostering a diverse and exceptional workplace and building strong communities in the areas we serve.  
I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Joe?"

Turning to Slide 10. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.03 per share. This reflects special item net losses of $0.16 per share, primarily related to a U.K. tax rate change and a loss",716,"Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone.  
Turning to Slide 10. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.03 per share. This reflects special item net losses of $0.16 per share, primarily related to a U.K. tax rate change and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by earnings from the U.K. utility business that have been recorded as discontinued operations. I'll note that the tax-related item was a noncash adjustment prior to the completion of the sale of WPD in June. Adjusting for these special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.19 per share compared with $0.20 per share a year ago. We remain encouraged by the economic recovery from the pandemic in both our Pennsylvania and Kentucky jurisdictions, which has resulted in continuously improving commercial and industrial sales. These higher sales were offset by several factors, which I will cover on the next slide.  
So let's move to Slide 11 for a more detailed look at our second quarter segment results. As a reminder, we've adjusted the 2020 corporate and other amount to reflect certain costs previously reflected in the U.K. Regulated segment, which was primarily interest expense. Total amount of these costs was about $0.02 per share for the quarter. Turning to the ongoing segment results. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results were $0.02 per share lower compared to a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower adjusted gross margins, driven by lower transmission demand as discussed in Q1 and consistent with our expectations and an increase in the reserve recorded as a result of a challenge to the transmission-based return on equity, partially offsetting these negative variances were increased returns on additional capital investments.
We also experienced an additional $0.01 decline due to favorable tax-related items recorded in the second quarter of 2020. Turning to our Kentucky Regulated segment. Results were $0.01 per share higher than our comparable results in Q2 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher commercial and industrial demand revenue as we experienced a strong recovery in 2021 in these sectors from the significant impacts of COVID-19 and lower interest expense, primarily due to the interest costs previously allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment in 2020 that are now reflected in Corporate & Other. Partly offsetting these items was higher operation and maintenance expense, primarily at our generation plants. Results at Corporate & Other were flat compared with a year ago. Higher interest costs of $0.01 a share related to the corporate debt previously allocated to the Kentucky segment were offset by several factors that were not individually significant.  
Turning to Slide 12. I'll cover some notable financing-related updates. First, following the sale of the U.K. utility business, we successfully completed a series of financing activities in June and July that led to a significant reduction in holding company debt. The result was a total reduction of PPL capital funding debt by about $3.5 billion, which was in line with our previously discussed targets. Through these actions, we've reduced total holding company debt to about 20% of PPL's total outstanding debt, while effectively clearing all near-term maturities at PPL capital funding through 2025. We've provided a detailed breakdown of these actions in the appendix of today's presentation.
In addition to the activity of PPL capital funding, we redeemed at par $250 million at LG&E and KU Energy in July, which was part of our original financing plan for the year in order to simplify the capital structure of the company by eliminating intermediate holding company debt. That was the final remaining outstanding debt security at the LKE entity. Therefore, we have deregistered LKE as we no longer expect to issue debt out of this entity. We expect PPL capital funding will be the financing entity at the holding company level to provide support to all of our operating subsidiaries. The successful execution of liability management leaves PPL well positioned and on track to achieve our targeted credit metrics post closing of the Narragansett Electric acquisition. In addition to these notable financing updates, we also reduced outstanding short-term debt as an efficient use of available cash until we fully deploy the remaining proceeds from the sale of WPD.  
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince."

In terms of timing, I would say that we're not really setting an arbitrary time line to complete this. We want to make sure that we're going through this process in a disciplined and diligent way as we always do",414,"Sure. You hit a lot in that question, Shar. In terms of timing, I would say that we're not really setting an arbitrary time line to complete this. We want to make sure that we're going through this process in a disciplined and diligent way as we always do. So not really setting an artificial time line on that. But to your point, you mentioned many of the factors that really are going into the process, right? So we're in the middle right now of assessing the capital plans including for Rhode Island once acquired, we do see additional T&D opportunities across the utilities, again, including Rhode Island for the benefit of our customers to drive improved efficiency and resiliency of the networks as well as additional gas LDC investments to further enhance the safety of those operations.
And again, from a capital deployment perspective, we think deploying capital into the utilities can create significant value for all of our customers and our share owners. So a lot of work going on right now going through that. You mentioned having the closure of Rhode Island. That's obviously a key component of how we think about capital deployment moving forward within the utilities. So in terms of timing, we'll want to see the closure of getting deals done. You also mentioned the IRP in Kentucky, that as well as the climate assessment report, those will be key inputs into our clean energy strategy going forward. There could be some capital deployment opportunities coming out of that. So yes, you're -- I think you hit all the points in terms of the areas that we're looking at that will ultimately drive the organic use of the remaining proceeds. 
In terms of M&A, I would just say that, first of all, we don't need M&A to hit the targets that we're targeting from both an earnings and a growth perspective. And we will continue to be disciplined as we look at M&A opportunities as we always have been. I'll just say that current valuations that we're seeing in the market are quite high. The utilities are trading quite expensively right now. We didn't pay anywhere near some of those valuations for Rhode Island, and we continue to think that Rhode Island acquisition will drive value for our shareowners. It will be earnings accretive, credit accretive and value accretive for our shareowners. So again, from our perspective, maintaining discipline is incredibly important, and we'll continue to do that."

We need to get through the regulatory process in Rhode Island. We will be meeting with the governor and the legislature up there as well as the commission and the regulatory bodies, putting together what we think the best investment plan moving forward for Rhode Island will be. We've talked about the clean energy aspiration that the state has. They are quite aggressive when you compare them to other states, which we completely think we can support with what we've been able to accomplish in Pennsylvania and be able to replicate that there. 
So I think for us, Durgesh, it's really about working with the state stakeholders and identify how quickly they want to move on that. And then how quickly can we deploy our operating model and keep it affordable for customers and so that's -- we see tremendous opportunity up there, but that's something that we'll be working on once we close the deal. Having said that, I think we see continued opportunity, both in Pennsylvania and Kentucky to continue to bring those utilities along the utility of the future curve and continue to make investments in PA and Kentucky as well. So those are the activities we're going through right now over the summer, and we'll be in a position to communicate that again once the Rhode Island deal closes when we come out with the whole story."

And from our perspective, the benefit of that, Paul, is that we get -- I mean, not only has EIP demonstrated positive returns in the fund which takes what traditionally would be a cost center for a company with R&D efforts and potentially turn that into neutral to a positive return.
But really, the strategic value of getting in there is that we get board seats. So we have visibility into the technologies that are emerging in all of these different areas as we think about potential for demonstration projects or just where we think the next breakthrough in technology will come, whether that's on car recapture or energy storage, a long-duration storage technologies, various different areas that we're looking at as we think about getting to net-zero for not only the fleet but economy-wide."

You talked about EPRI and the low carbon resources initiative. So I've just recently taken over the Board working group chair role for EPRI. And so we're integrally involved with the expert team at EPRI and looking at various different technologies. Again, as it relates to carbon capture, new nuclear, hydrogen, ammonia all different types of decarbonization technology, again EPRI is focused on what are the technology breakthroughs that are currently being -- or the technologies, the emerging technologies that are currently being looked at, but they're also assessing alternatives to those and then identifying demonstration projects down the road to try to commercialize some of these newer technologies.
And so we are actively engaged with them on all of that, depending on how those things evolve, whether it's hydrogen for storage or even hydrogen blending for gas LDCs or combined cycle generation. There's a way to go, I think, to prove all that out for hydrogen, but there's a lot of work and a lot of activity going on there. Our carbon capture sequestration continues to be an area. Again, about 80% of the world's energy is coming from fossil fuel spill. So for the growth to get to net 0 at some point, we think carbon capture will have to play a role in that. And so EPRI is spending some time on that as well. Again, nuclear -- looking at different forms of nuclear modular units, et cetera, could also play a role but making those units smaller and more adaptable.
So a lot of things going on there, Paul. And I think we're -- our strategy is to make sure that we keep our finger on the pulse there. Again, we'll be retiring coal plants this decade and next. And so could there be potential opportunities for demonstration projects on some of those plants. We'll work with the state to see if there's opportunities there as we think about, again, Trimble County 2 which went in service in 2011. And so unless things change at the federal level, where that plant will be forced to be shut, our current projection is that it would continue to be economic in 2050. And so identifying these technological advancements to drive specifically that plant to net-zero. But again, you're going to have combined cycle fleet that are part of the transition strategy that you heard from me and many of my -- again probably it can play a role there."

Again, we don't want to put an artificial time line on the use of the proceeds, right? So the first step, I think, is getting through the detailed process of identifying the organic growth opportunities and putting those plants together and to your point, when do they get staged in, in terms of '22 maybe versus potential feeding into the back part of the 5-year plan and then even beyond that. So I would just say we're -- the first step is to get through that, and then we'll assess the timing of when that cash is needed and then see exactly how much is really fitting into the scenario that you're talking about. In terms of the mechanisms, while we're staying out, first of all, I would just say that, again, in Pennsylvania, we've been very successful at growing our rate base and our earnings despite staying out of rate cases.
And we haven't had a distribution rate case since January 1, 2016. But over that time, and again, this is just distribution. We've grown our rate base 6%, 7% CAGR over that time period, and our net income CAGR has pretty much stayed in line with that rate base growth. And the way that you're able to do that is obviously we have some mechanisms within the different jurisdictions that reduce regulatory lag, whether it's the PPA or the ECR and the gas line tracker and Kentucky, of course, we had some in Rhode Island as well around capital planning.
But also when you deploy the capital, in many cases, you will see operational efficiencies as a result and those operational efficiencies can drive the return on that capital even though you're staying out of rate cases. I will say that our -- we don't think the right answer just because we're staying out of rate cases is not to invest in the networks. It's incredibly important, and we continue to reinvest in the networks and then making sure that we do that in a way that drives efficiency for the customers and drives a return while we're staying out. We have experience and have successfully done that in Pennsylvania. So we'll look to replicate that. But just because we're staying out, we don't think that, that means that there won't be rate base or earnings growth opportunity."

We appreciate you joining us for our third quarter investor update. 
Moving to Slide 3 and the agenda for today's call. I'll begin this morning with an update on the progress we continue to make in advancing our strategic repositioning. I'll also share some current initiatives underway to advance PPL's clean energy strategy and provide a brief operational and regulatory update. Joe will then provide a financial update, including a detailed review of third quarter financial results. And as always, we'll leave ample time for your questions. 
Turning to Slide 4. We continue to make excellent progress on our key initiatives to strategically reposition PPL for long-term growth and success. In September, we received FERC approval for our planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric. With FERC's approval, we now have 4 of the 5 approvals necessary to close on the transaction. 
We continue to make progress on securing the final approval from the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers. In its procedural schedule, the division has established February 25 as the target date for a decision. This would put PPL and National Grid on a path to close on the transaction by March of next year as originally expected. We've included a slide with the division's procedural schedule in the appendix of today's presentation. 
As we pursue the final regulatory approval, we continue working closely with National Grid on planning to ensure a smooth transition for Rhode Island customers and Narragansett employees upon closing. Together, we've collaborated through 30 functional integration teams to plan and execute a safe, effective and minimally disruptive transition of the Rhode Island operations. 
These teams have built robust day 1 integration plans to execute on identified business requirements; extracted transition service agreements that will be key to providing a stable, seamless transition for customers; redesigned critical business processes to enable the TSAs to effectively operate; designed a new Rhode Island operating model and organization from the ground up, with over 1,100 National Grid employees accepting employment offers pending the close of the transaction. 
We've initiated an integrated change management and communication strategy to engage our future employees, customers and Rhode Island stakeholders to begin to build relationships for the long term. And all 3 labor unions have ratified their new contracts that will be effective under PPL's ownership. 
As we work to secure final approval, we look forward to partnering with the talented team in Rhode Island to deliver safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable energy. And we are very excited about the opportunity the acquisition presents to build one of the nation's most advanced clean energy-enabling grids in support of Rhode Island's ambitious decarbonization goals. 
Finally, on this slide, I'm excited to highlight a new valuable addition to PPL's Board of Directors, Heather Redman. Heather is the Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Flying Fish Partners, a venture capital firm that invests in early-stage artificial intelligence and machine learning startups, including energy-related applications. 
She brings expertise in disruptive technology, industry transformation, energy development and energy technology at a time when PPL is squarely focused on driving innovation and positioning our company for growth in the clean energy transition. I am confident that Heather will be a fantastic addition to our diverse and experienced Board. With Heather's addition, our Board now has 10 directors, 60% of whom are diverse, and 30% of whom are women. 
Turning to Slide 5. In advancing our strategic repositioning, we also continue to make progress in deploying proceeds from the sale of our U.K. assets to maximize shareowner value. And while we recognize cash is fungible, we are showing the major buckets for the use of proceeds on this slide. And today, we've announced 2 updates. 
First, as we continue to develop our business plan, we've identified at least $1 billion in incremental capital investments in Pennsylvania and Kentucky through 2025 to support grid resilience and modernization in advance of sustainable energy future for our customers. We identified CapEx opportunities, predominantly in the T&D areas, include continued application of smart grid technologies, which improve overall system reliability and reduce O&M costs at the same time. It also includes further hardening of the system to support reliability and resilience in the face of more frequent and stronger storms. 
We'll look to make these same types of investments in Rhode Island once we close the transaction and work with Rhode Island stakeholders on the pace of change to the clean energy economy in the state, keeping in mind the cost impacts for customers. 
In addition to our updates on CapEx opportunities, we've also revised our expectations for share repurchases and have allocated an additional $500 million to buybacks. We now expect to repurchase a total of approximately $1 billion of PPL common stock by year-end, effectively doubling the amount previously announced on our Q2 call. 
We've already completed $550 million in share repurchases through October 31. We're pleased about the progress we've made in evaluating our capital plans and look forward to sharing additional details at an Analyst Day following the closing of the Narragansett acquisition. 
In the meantime, we'll continue to review our business plans for additional opportunities that will drive value for both customers and shareowners. We are also providing an update on the timing of an expected change to PPL's dividend and reiterate the planned dividend policy following the closing of the Narragansett acquisition. 
The dividend has and will remain an important part of PPL's total shareowner return proposition. Given the procedural schedule in place for the required regulatory approval in Rhode Island, we expect to maintain the current quarterly dividend rate through the January 3, 2022, payment. After that date, we plan to realign the dividend, targeting a payout ratio of 60% to 65% of the repositioned PPL earnings as previously communicated. The final decision regarding the dividend will be made by the Board of Directors after the Narragansett closing. 
Moving to Slide 6. We continue to advance our clean energy strategy as we pursue our goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In October, our Kentucky Utilities filed renewable power purchase agreements with the Kentucky Public Service Commission to provide a combined 125 megawatts of solar power to 5 major customers. 
Under the 20-year agreements, which will support customer participation in LG&E and KU's green tariff, LG&E and KU will procure 100% of the power from a new solar facility that will be built in Western Kentucky. The agreements reflect our continued efforts to support the growth of renewable energy and economic development in the state. 
In another notable third quarter development, we announced in September that we've joined an expanding coalition of U.S. utilities committed to supporting the growth of electric vehicles as we seek additional opportunities to enable third-party decarbonization. The Electric Highway Coalition will focus on development of a seamless network of rapid electric vehicle charging stations, connecting major highway systems from the Northeast to the Midwest down to Texas. The goal is to create convenient options for long-distance EV travel to reduce range anxiety for consumers. 
We also continue to expand investments in R&D needed to achieve net zero. Our Kentucky Utilities recently announced a partnership to study the capture of carbon dioxide emissions. The partnership with the University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research or CAER will seek to develop cost-effective, scalable technology to capture carbon dioxide from a natural gas combined cycle plant. 
We'll be working with CAER and using the carbon capture infrastructure we've already built at our Brown coal facility in 2014 to simulate emissions from a natural gas plant. The project will also support a study aimed at direct air capture of CO2, potentially creating a negative emissions power plant. 
In addition to capturing CO2, the system aims to produce 2 value-added streams, hydrogen and oxygen, that can be sold to offset the cost of capturing and storing the CO2. Additional partners in this R&D initiative include Vanderbilt University and EPRI and GTI through their low carbon resources initiative. The carbon capture unit we've built at the Brown plant is one of only a few carbon capture systems in operation today at power plants in the United States. 
Furthering our R&D-related efforts, PPL recently acquired an ownership interest in the SOO Green project, a 350-mile underground transmission project that seeks to connect the MISO and PJM power markets and support growing demand for clean energy. We recognize that expanding the nation's transmission grid will be critical to connecting more wind and solar power and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
Breaking through siting, permitting and other barriers to build this transmission quickly and cost effectively will be key. SOO Green seeks to tackle these challenges by developing high-voltage transmission lines underground along major rail corridors. PPL's investment in the SOO Green project will enable us to gain valuable insight into this innovative approach. We look forward to lending our capabilities and transmission expertise to support this project's success. 
Turning to Slide 7. On October 19, LG&E and KU submitted their triennial joint Integrated Resource Plan to the Kentucky Public Service Commission. The IRP provides the commission with information regarding our potential generation sources over the next 15 years to meet forecasted energy demand in a least cost manner. 
The IRP is submitted for informational purposes and represents a moment-in-time look at ongoing resource planning, using current business assumptions and long-term forecasts. LG&E and KU's 2021 IRP projects a significant reduction in coal's contribution to our generation mix, declining from over 80% of the expected electricity produced in 2021 to about half of the total power produced in 2036. 
In our base case scenario for load and fuel prices, we show the retirement of nearly 2,000 megawatts of coal capacity as we economically advance a clean energy transition. These projected retirements are consistent with the depreciation study filed in our last rate case as well as the estimates used in developing our net zero goal announced last quarter. 
The IRP base demand and base fuel price scenario envision solar power playing a growing role in meeting our customers' demand for energy over the next 15 years, accounting for nearly 20% of all the power we supply to our Kentucky customers by 2036. This scenario shows an additional 2,100 megawatts of solar combined with 200 megawatts of battery storage, along with simple cycle gas units needed for reliability purposes by the end of the planning period to replace that 2,000 megawatts of expected coal plant retirements. 
We've also added a high-case scenario to this slide, which reflects the implications of higher demand and higher fuel prices due to several factors. Under the high-case scenario, we would expect there to be significantly more energy needed by 2036, requiring additional capacity. Based on our assumptions, that would primarily be met with an additional 5,500 megawatts of incremental renewable and storage resources above the base case scenario through that time period. 
Further, that would result in more than twice as much output from renewable resources by 2036, reflecting approximately 40% of generation output primarily replacing natural gas from the base case scenario. We've provided a slide in the appendix of today's presentation that outlines the differences in the assumptions for the base and high-case scenarios. We expect the next IRP, which will be filed in 2024, to be an extremely important plan based on the current timing of our next coal plant retirements, which are expected to begin again in 2024. 
Moving to Slide 8. On August 20, PPL Electric Utilities announced a constructive settlement with an alliance of industrial and municipal customers that had challenged the company's FERC-approved base transmission return on equity. The settlement, which must be approved by FERC, would change PPL Electric's base ROE from 11.18% to 9.9% from May 2020 to May 2022 with the rate stepping up to 10% by June 2023. 
The settlement also updates the equity component of PPL Electric's capital structure to be the lower of its actual equity component calculated in accordance with the formula rate template or 56%. The settlement also allows PPL Electric to modify the current formula rate, which is based on a historic test year and move the company to a projected rate year. 
Further, PPL's formula rate could also be modified to be based on the calendar year moving forward rather than the current rate year that begins June 1. We expect these changes to help reduce regulatory lag as we continue to make additional investments in transmission infrastructure. 
Overall, the settlement is expected to reduce net income by approximately $25 million to $30 million per year. The details of the FERC transmission ROE settlement are included in the appendix of today's presentation. 
In other operational developments, our utilities continue to be recognized for our award-winning customer service and innovation. PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities were once again listed as 2 of the most trusted utility brands in the United States based on a recent study performed by human behavior firm Escalent. The results of the study show that communications played a vital role in building brand trust between utilities and our customers in 2020 during the pandemic. It was the third consecutive year PPL Electric received this recognition and the second consecutive year for Kentucky Utilities. 
Also, the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies selected PPL Electric Utilities as a winner of one of their 2021 achievement awards for revolutionary work in vegetation management. Trees are a common cause of outages. Within PPL Electric Utility service territory, it's estimated that about 1/3 of distribution outages over the past 5 years were caused by trees contacting overhead wires. 
By using a new approach that leverages data analytics and other new technologies, PPL Electric Utilities found ways to trim and remove the right trees at the right times across 28,000 miles of overhead lines to help prevent outages. This has led to improved reliability despite an increase in more severe weather without increasing overall vegetation management costs. 
Additionally, Public Utilities Fortnightly has named PPL Electric Utilities as a top innovator for 2021, thanks to its industry-leading use of dynamic line rating or DLR technology on its transmission line. By using smart sensors that collect real-time information like wind speed and line temperature, operators can relieve transmission congestion and increase the electricity sent over those lines. PPL Electric Utilities has been recognized for its leading-edge approach to integrating DLR into core operations and using data from the sensors to make prudent investment decisions. 
And finally, we continue our efforts to support economic development in the regions we serve. One recent major development in this area is Ford's announcement of plans to construct a $6 billion electric battery complex within our LG&E and KU service territory. It is one of, if not the largest economic development announcement in Kentucky's history and will have far-reaching positive impacts on communities around the commonwealth. 
In fact, 2021 has been a record year for Kentucky in terms of economic development growth with over $10 billion in new investments being announced within the state. Other recent developments in addition to Ford's announcement include a $460 million investment by Toyota and a $450 million investment by GE at its Appliance Park in Louisville. These decisions exemplify the strengths that Kentucky has to offer large industrial customers. 
Specifically, we are known for exceptional reliability to deliver energy 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Further, we have some of the lowest retail rates in the country, an important characteristic for large industrial customers and something we remain keenly focused on maintaining. 
Kentucky also has the third lowest business cost in the country and is home to 3 global shipping hubs. And our Kentucky service territories are located in a centralized region that is well protected from intensifying coastal storms and other natural disasters. We are excited to support the energy needs of these developments and their prospective impact on our surrounding communities. 
Before we move to the next slide, in the broader context, I would also note that Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear in the state's Office of Energy Policy unveiled a new energy strategy on October 20 called E-Cube. The strategy considers 3 Es as key pillars to the strategic vision of a resilient economy in the state: energy, the environment and economic development. And this strategy aligns very well with PPL's clean energy transition strategy. 
We're encouraged by several areas included in the strategy where our utilities will play a vital role and we expect will provide future opportunities, including ensuring a transmission grid that supports growing renewable resources; ensuring an electric distribution grid that is self-healing, self-sufficient and auto sensing; supporting a diversified energy supply that is fuel secure, sustainable and resilient; incentivizing sustainable business investments, including hydrogen and other renewable fuels; supporting the development of carbon capture utilization and sequestration industries; and supporting alternative fuel transportation infrastructure. 
LG&E and KU participated in working groups associated with affordability and economic development in the lead up to the state announcing its strategy. We believe the strategic framework represents a comprehensive approach to positioning Kentucky for success in a changing energy landscape. We look forward to engaging with the Kentucky administration and other stakeholders as the state further develops its strategy to support sustainability, boost competitiveness and spur job growth and innovation in local and regional economies. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Joe?"

Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.27 per share. This reflects special items of $0.09 per share primarily related to losses on the early extinguishment of debt associated with the recapitalization of the balance sheet post the sale of WPD. Adjusting for special items, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.36 per share compared with $0.30 per share a year ago. 
Our third quarter results bring our year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations to $0.83 per share. Details on our year-to-date earnings are available in the appendix to today's presentation. 
Now let's move to Slide 10 for a more detailed look at our third quarter segment results. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment recorded $0.16 per share for the third quarter, which was $0.01 per share lower compared to a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to higher operation and maintenance expense primarily related to higher storm and support costs and reserve recorded for a reduction to the return on equity in the transmission formula rate. Partially offsetting these items were returns on additional capital investments in transmission. 
Turning to our Kentucky Regulated segment. Third quarter results were $0.21 per share, a $0.04 per share increase compared to Q3 2020 results. The increase was primarily driven by higher base retail rates effective July 1 and lower interest expense primarily due to interest costs that were previously allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment. Partially offsetting this increase was higher operation and maintenance expense related to support and generation-related cost factors that were not individually significant. 
Results at Corporate and Other were a loss of $0.01 per share, which was $0.03 higher compared to a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by lower interest expense due to less outstanding long-term holding company debt. 
And that concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince."

I'll have Greg talk about where we're seeing the $1 billion that we've identified to date. And again, we continue to review the business plans.

And so as we put on the slide, we think that will come in at about $1 billion to $2 billion as we finalize the plans. 
On the Rhode Island side, Shar, I think you're hitting the nail right on the head. That's an area where I think we'll have a pretty good sense on what the opportunity is in Rhode Island as we think about the clean energy transition on what we've done in Pennsylvania, bringing that grid to Rhode Island to support the renewable ambitions within the state. Of course, there's going to be offshore wind opportunities that we need to get ready for as well as significant DPR in the state. There's also a lot of transmission opportunity. 
So there -- I think we'll have a pretty good sense of what needs to be done. The question will be -- and we'll have to work with the state on how quickly they want to get to the new clean energy transition, especially keeping -- just keeping rates in check, which, of course, we do across all of our jurisdictions. 
So I think it's probably a little premature to provide too much detail on that right now. But qualitatively, I would say I think we'll have a pretty good sense of the opportunity. When it happens, we'll need to engage with the state. But Greg, do you want to touch on the $1 billion that we've already identified?"

I just want to make sure I heard your question properly. So look, I would say in general, as we think about the capital allocation, right, investing in the utilities is our priority and our bias, especially as we try to make sure that we're delivering the grids that our customers need as we look at the transition to a clean energy future. 
So being able to fund that in a way that requires little to no equity issuances over the foreseeable future is incredibly important to us, which is really how Joe and the team identified the, right, the $3.5 billion of debt that we bought down with part of the proceeds and getting the balance sheet in that position where we can fund not only this $1 billion but even incremental capital, to your point, with Rhode Island and other potential opportunities that we may identify without issuing equity. So that's kind of the first component of that. 
In terms of the stock buybacks themselves, again, we're looking at that versus other potential opportunities. And you mentioned inorganic. I talked about last quarter we don't need M&A to hit the growth profile that we've communicated. Of course, we will be opportunistic as we always have been with M&A. 
But our -- I would say our focus in the M&A area right now, Shar, is to close Rhode Island, get the integration underway and really ensure that we have a smooth transition there and then as we talked about before, working with the state on the pace of change for the clean energy transition up in Rhode Island and then making sure that we're supporting that with the capital and investment plans. 
So our focus, I would say, on M&A right now is squarely on that. But as I always say, you never say never. If there's an opportunity that presents itself that we think would create incremental shareholder value above our organic growth plans, certainly, it's something that we would consider as we've done in the past, but it's not the core of our strategy right now."

And all of that will go into our full plan. So I think once -- we'll be in a better position post the close of Narragansett to discuss the additional details and including how we deploy that remaining proceeds and what falls into each of those buckets."

So for -- through 2028, I would say certainly through '24, which is our next projected coal plant retirement, we don't think we require significant, if any, replacement generation for our '24 retirement. So really, the reserve margins start to tight",345,"Sure. So for -- through 2028, I would say certainly through '24, which is our next projected coal plant retirement, we don't think we require significant, if any, replacement generation for our '24 retirement. So really, the reserve margins start to tighten when we start to get into the 2028 time frame. 
And so as you can see in the -- on Slide 18, which is the IRP megawatts that we're talking about under the base case and then the high case, over the 15-year period, which is really where, again, it's post '28 when you see more significant retirements and then ultimate replacement for the increase in energy that we're projecting, both in the base case and then in the high case. 
So we're thinking in the base case, there's probably around $3 billion of investment opportunity over that 15-year period, significantly more in the high case. Obviously, you're seeing 56, 50-ish -- 5,600-ish additional megawatts significantly more renewables in that case. And so the investment opportunity under the high case would be call it, around $10 billion, plus or minus. So that's a significant opportunity. 
As we -- I should clarify that like the Ford announcement and some of the other announcements I talked about we're not necessarily in the base case. They don't necessarily get us to the high case as again, the high case has EV assumptions and electric heat assumptions, very high gas prices over the sustained period. 
So obviously, all of that is still to be determined. But I would say the positive thing with the Ford and the other announcements I talked about at least on the major new customer additions, we're certainly trending towards the high case versus the base case. 
So the investment opportunity, call it, $3 billion to $10 billion depending on the cases, not a significant amount in the next 5 years. You might start to see some in 2026 as we plan for the 2028 retirements. But it's really, I would say, just following that time period when you'll see more significant investment."

What they seem to be complaining though about is that PJM has this system impact study stuff that's delaying stuff, as you know. I mean, they're saying it could be up to 3 years.

They're a little bit short as you -- we have slides in the deck that show the load. And that's really things that you're seeing across the country. 
So retail and hospitality, those have not fully come back yet. We're seeing the same thing down in Kentucky on that with the commercial. Industrial in Kentucky, of course, just a lot of the shutdown issues that we had during COVID, that's all recovered. But with the ship -- the chip shortages and some of the supply chain issues, we're seeing some of the factories being turned back. So that's why a little bit short on the C&I side. 
And then on the residential, we're just seeing in Pennsylvania a lot more workers are still working from home than what we're seeing in Kentucky. So for the most part, Kentucky is back to pre-COVID. Again, it's a little bit positive. But in PA, we're still quite a bit positive. 
So we'll -- we're still waiting to see how much of that remains permanent, Ryan, in terms of load, in terms -- with hybrid work schedules and just more flexibility that companies are providing their workforce. So I guess our expectation would be that residential stays slightly above, but that remains to be seen. 
And then in terms of the announcements that we talked about, probably a little premature to talk about the low -- the exact load impacts on those and when they will -- and when that will show up. We really -- in the case of the Ford plant, the final designs need to be prepared and released. 
And so I think while certainly qualitatively, this is positive for our jurisdiction and the state in general, and I think it will be -- it will actually fuel additional announcements and opportunities for folks that want to come into the state. Again, on top of the E-Cube energy strategy that the governor announced, I think this all bodes very well for economic development opportunities within Kentucky, which I think qualitatively is good for our jurisdictions and our service areas. 
But putting that into, say, a megawatt of load, I think it's a little premature for that. But as soon as we can do that, we will -- we'll get that disclosure out."

We appreciate you joining us for our third quarter investor update.  
Moving to Slide 3 and the agenda for today's call. I'll begin this morning with an update on the progress we continue to make in advancing our strategic repositioning. I'll also share some current initiatives underway to advance PPL's clean energy strategy and provide a brief operational and regulatory update. Joe will then provide a financial update, including a detailed review of third quarter financial results. And as always, we'll leave ample time for your questions.  
Turning to Slide 4. We continue to make excellent progress on our key initiatives to strategically reposition PPL for long-term growth and success. In September, we received FERC approval for our planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric. With FERC's approval, we now have 4 of the 5 approvals necessary to close on the transaction.  
We continue to make progress on securing the final approval from the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers. In its procedural schedule, the division has established February 25 as the target date for a decision. This would put PPL and National Grid on a path to close on the transaction by March of next year as originally expected. We've included a slide with the division's procedural schedule in the appendix of today's presentation.  
As we pursue the final regulatory approval, we continue working closely with National Grid on planning to ensure a smooth transition for Rhode Island customers and Narragansett employees upon closing. Together, we've collaborated through 30 functional integration teams to plan and execute a safe, effective and minimally disruptive transition of the Rhode Island operations.  
These teams have built robust day 1 integration plans to execute on identified business requirements; extracted transition service agreements that will be key to providing a stable, seamless transition for customers; redesigned critical business processes to enable the TSAs to effectively operate; designed a new Rhode Island operating model and organization from the ground up, with over 1,100 National Grid employees accepting employment offers pending the close of the transaction.  
We've initiated an integrated change management and communication strategy to engage our future employees, customers and Rhode Island stakeholders to begin to build relationships for the long term. And all 3 labor unions have ratified their new contracts that will be effective under PPL's ownership.  
As we work to secure final approval, we look forward to partnering with the talented team in Rhode Island to deliver safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable energy. And we are very excited about the opportunity the acquisition presents to build one of the nation's most advanced clean energy-enabling grids in support of Rhode Island's ambitious decarbonization goals.  
Finally, on this slide, I'm excited to highlight a new valuable addition to PPL's Board of Directors, Heather Redman. Heather is the Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Flying Fish Partners, a venture capital firm that invests in early-stage artificial intelligence and machine learning startups, including energy-related applications.  
She brings expertise in disruptive technology, industry transformation, energy development and energy technology at a time when PPL is squarely focused on driving innovation and positioning our company for growth in the clean energy transition. I am confident that Heather will be a fantastic addition to our diverse and experienced Board. With Heather's addition, our Board now has 10 directors, 60% of whom are diverse, and 30% of whom are women.  
Turning to Slide 5. In advancing our strategic repositioning, we also continue to make progress in deploying proceeds from the sale of our U.K. assets to maximize shareowner value. And while we recognize cash is fungible, we are showing the major buckets for the use of proceeds on this slide. And today, we've announced 2 updates.  
First, as we continue to develop our business plan, we've identified at least $1 billion in incremental capital investments in Pennsylvania and Kentucky through 2025 to support grid resilience and modernization in advance of sustainable energy future for our customers. We identified CapEx opportunities, predominantly in the T&D areas, include continued application of smart grid technologies, which improve overall system reliability and reduce O&M costs at the same time. It also includes further hardening of the system to support reliability and resilience in the face of more frequent and stronger storms.  
We'll look to make these same types of investments in Rhode Island once we close the transaction and work with Rhode Island stakeholders on the pace of change to the clean energy economy in the state, keeping in mind the cost impacts for customers.  
In addition to our updates on CapEx opportunities, we've also revised our expectations for share repurchases and have allocated an additional $500 million to buybacks. We now expect to repurchase a total of approximately $1 billion of PPL common stock by year-end, effectively doubling the amount previously announced on our Q2 call.  
We've already completed $550 million in share repurchases through October 31. We're pleased about the progress we've made in evaluating our capital plans and look forward to sharing additional details at an Analyst Day following the closing of the Narragansett acquisition.  
In the meantime, we'll continue to review our business plans for additional opportunities that will drive value for both customers and shareowners. We are also providing an update on the timing of an expected change to PPL's dividend and reiterate the planned dividend policy following the closing of the Narragansett acquisition.  
The dividend has and will remain an important part of PPL's total shareowner return proposition. Given the procedural schedule in place for the required regulatory approval in Rhode Island, we expect to maintain the current quarterly dividend rate through the January 3, 2022, payment. After that date, we plan to realign the dividend, targeting a payout ratio of 60% to 65% of the repositioned PPL earnings as previously communicated. The final decision regarding the dividend will be made by the Board of Directors after the Narragansett closing.  
Moving to Slide 6. We continue to advance our clean energy strategy as we pursue our goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In October, our Kentucky Utilities filed renewable power purchase agreements with the Kentucky Public Service Commission to provide a combined 125 megawatts of solar power to 5 major customers.  
Under the 20-year agreements, which will support customer participation in LG&E and KU's green tariff, LG&E and KU will procure 100% of the power from a new solar facility that will be built in Western Kentucky. The agreements reflect our continued efforts to support the growth of renewable energy and economic development in the state.  
In another notable third quarter development, we announced in September that we've joined an expanding coalition of U.S. utilities committed to supporting the growth of electric vehicles as we seek additional opportunities to enable third-party decarbonization. The Electric Highway Coalition will focus on development of a seamless network of rapid electric vehicle charging stations, connecting major highway systems from the Northeast to the Midwest down to Texas. The goal is to create convenient options for long-distance EV travel to reduce range anxiety for consumers.  
We also continue to expand investments in R&D needed to achieve net zero. Our Kentucky Utilities recently announced a partnership to study the capture of carbon dioxide emissions. The partnership with the University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research or CAER will seek to develop cost-effective, scalable technology to capture carbon dioxide from a natural gas combined cycle plant.  
We'll be working with CAER and using the carbon capture infrastructure we've already built at our Brown coal facility in 2014 to simulate emissions from a natural gas plant. The project will also support a study aimed at direct air capture of CO2, potentially creating a negative emissions power plant.  
In addition to capturing CO2, the system aims to produce 2 value-added streams, hydrogen and oxygen, that can be sold to offset the cost of capturing and storing the CO2. Additional partners in this R&D initiative include Vanderbilt University and EPRI and GTI through their low carbon resources initiative. The carbon capture unit we've built at the Brown plant is one of only a few carbon capture systems in operation today at power plants in the United States.  
Furthering our R&D-related efforts, PPL recently acquired an ownership interest in the SOO Green project, a 350-mile underground transmission project that seeks to connect the MISO and PJM power markets and support growing demand for clean energy. We recognize that expanding the nation's transmission grid will be critical to connecting more wind and solar power and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  
Breaking through siting, permitting and other barriers to build this transmission quickly and cost effectively will be key. SOO Green seeks to tackle these challenges by developing high-voltage transmission lines underground along major rail corridors. PPL's investment in the SOO Green project will enable us to gain valuable insight into this innovative approach. We look forward to lending our capabilities and transmission expertise to support this project's success.  
Turning to Slide 7. On October 19, LG&E and KU submitted their triennial joint Integrated Resource Plan to the Kentucky Public Service Commission. The IRP provides the commission with information regarding our potential generation sources over the next 15 years to meet forecasted energy demand in a least cost manner.  
The IRP is submitted for informational purposes and represents a moment-in-time look at ongoing resource planning, using current business assumptions and long-term forecasts. LG&E and KU's 2021 IRP projects a significant reduction in coal's contribution to our generation mix, declining from over 80% of the expected electricity produced in 2021 to about half of the total power produced in 2036.  
In our base case scenario for load and fuel prices, we show the retirement of nearly 2,000 megawatts of coal capacity as we economically advance a clean energy transition. These projected retirements are consistent with the depreciation study filed in our last rate case as well as the estimates used in developing our net zero goal announced last quarter.  
The IRP base demand and base fuel price scenario envision solar power playing a growing role in meeting our customers' demand for energy over the next 15 years, accounting for nearly 20% of all the power we supply to our Kentucky customers by 2036. This scenario shows an additional 2,100 megawatts of solar combined with 200 megawatts of battery storage, along with simple cycle gas units needed for reliability purposes by the end of the planning period to replace that 2,000 megawatts of expected coal plant retirements.  
We've also added a high-case scenario to this slide, which reflects the implications of higher demand and higher fuel prices due to several factors. Under the high-case scenario, we would expect there to be significantly more energy needed by 2036, requiring additional capacity. Based on our assumptions, that would primarily be met with an additional 5,500 megawatts of incremental renewable and storage resources above the base case scenario through that time period.  
Further, that would result in more than twice as much output from renewable resources by 2036, reflecting approximately 40% of generation output primarily replacing natural gas from the base case scenario. We've provided a slide in the appendix of today's presentation that outlines the differences in the assumptions for the base and high-case scenarios. We expect the next IRP, which will be filed in 2024, to be an extremely important plan based on the current timing of our next coal plant retirements, which are expected to begin again in 2024.  
Moving to Slide 8. On August 20, PPL Electric Utilities announced a constructive settlement with an alliance of industrial and municipal customers that had challenged the company's FERC-approved base transmission return on equity. The settlement, which must be approved by FERC, would change PPL Electric's base ROE from 11.18% to 9.9% from May 2020 to May 2022 with the rate stepping up to 10% by June 2023.  
The settlement also updates the equity component of PPL Electric's capital structure to be the lower of its actual equity component calculated in accordance with the formula rate template or 56%. The settlement also allows PPL Electric to modify the current formula rate, which is based on a historic test year and move the company to a projected rate year.  
Further, PPL's formula rate could also be modified to be based on the calendar year moving forward rather than the current rate year that begins June 1. We expect these changes to help reduce regulatory lag as we continue to make additional investments in transmission infrastructure.  
Overall, the settlement is expected to reduce net income by approximately $25 million to $30 million per year. The details of the FERC transmission ROE settlement are included in the appendix of today's presentation.  
In other operational developments, our utilities continue to be recognized for our award-winning customer service and innovation. PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities were once again listed as 2 of the most trusted utility brands in the United States based on a recent study performed by human behavior firm Escalent. The results of the study show that communications played a vital role in building brand trust between utilities and our customers in 2020 during the pandemic. It was the third consecutive year PPL Electric received this recognition and the second consecutive year for Kentucky Utilities.  
Also, the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies selected PPL Electric Utilities as a winner of one of their 2021 achievement awards for revolutionary work in vegetation management. Trees are a common cause of outages. Within PPL Electric Utility service territory, it's estimated that about 1/3 of distribution outages over the past 5 years were caused by trees contacting overhead wires.  
By using a new approach that leverages data analytics and other new technologies, PPL Electric Utilities found ways to trim and remove the right trees at the right times across 28,000 miles of overhead lines to help prevent outages. This has led to improved reliability despite an increase in more severe weather without increasing overall vegetation management costs.  
Additionally, Public Utilities Fortnightly has named PPL Electric Utilities as a top innovator for 2021, thanks to its industry-leading use of dynamic line rating or DLR technology on its transmission line. By using smart sensors that collect real-time information like wind speed and line temperature, operators can relieve transmission congestion and increase the electricity sent over those lines. PPL Electric Utilities has been recognized for its leading-edge approach to integrating DLR into core operations and using data from the sensors to make prudent investment decisions.  
And finally, we continue our efforts to support economic development in the regions we serve. One recent major development in this area is Ford's announcement of plans to construct a $6 billion electric battery complex within our LG&E and KU service territory. It is one of, if not the largest economic development announcement in Kentucky's history and will have far-reaching positive impacts on communities around the commonwealth.  
In fact, 2021 has been a record year for Kentucky in terms of economic development growth with over $10 billion in new investments being announced within the state. Other recent developments in addition to Ford's announcement include a $460 million investment by Toyota and a $450 million investment by GE at its Appliance Park in Louisville. These decisions exemplify the strengths that Kentucky has to offer large industrial customers.  
Specifically, we are known for exceptional reliability to deliver energy 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Further, we have some of the lowest retail rates in the country, an important characteristic for large industrial customers and something we remain keenly focused on maintaining.  
Kentucky also has the third lowest business cost in the country and is home to 3 global shipping hubs. And our Kentucky service territories are located in a centralized region that is well protected from intensifying coastal storms and other natural disasters. We are excited to support the energy needs of these developments and their prospective impact on our surrounding communities.  
Before we move to the next slide, in the broader context, I would also note that Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear in the state's Office of Energy Policy unveiled a new energy strategy on October 20 called E3. The strategy considers 3 Es as key pillars to the strategic vision of a resilient economy in the state: energy, the environment and economic development. And this strategy aligns very well with PPL's clean energy transition strategy.  
We're encouraged by several areas included in the strategy where our utilities will play a vital role and we expect will provide future opportunities, including ensuring a transmission grid that supports growing renewable resources; ensuring an electric distribution grid that is self-healing, self-sufficient and auto sensing; supporting a diversified energy supply that is fuel secure, sustainable and resilient; incentivizing sustainable business investments, including hydrogen and other renewable fuels; supporting the development of carbon capture utilization and sequestration industries; and supporting alternative fuel transportation infrastructure.  
LG&E and KU participated in working groups associated with affordability and economic development in the lead up to the state announcing its strategy. We believe the strategic framework represents a comprehensive approach to positioning Kentucky for success in a changing energy landscape. We look forward to engaging with the Kentucky administration and other stakeholders as the state further develops its strategy to support sustainability, boost competitiveness and spur job growth and innovation in local and regional economies.  
I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Joe?"

Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.27 per share. This reflects special items of $0.09 per share primarily related to losses on the early extinguishment of debt associated with the recapitalization of the balance sheet post the sale of WPD. Adjusting for special items, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.36 per share compared with $0.30 per share a year ago.  
Our third quarter results bring our year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations to $0.83 per share. Details on our year-to-date earnings are available in the appendix to today's presentation.  
Now let's move to Slide 10 for a more detailed look at our third quarter segment results. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment recorded $0.16 per share for the third quarter, which was $0.01 per share lower compared to a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to higher operation and maintenance expense primarily related to higher storm and support costs and reserve recorded for a reduction to the return on equity in the transmission formula rate. Partially offsetting these items were returns on additional capital investments in transmission.  
Turning to our Kentucky Regulated segment. Third quarter results were $0.21 per share, a $0.04 per share increase compared to Q3 2020 results. The increase was primarily driven by higher base retail rates effective July 1 and lower interest expense primarily due to interest costs that were previously allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment. Partially offsetting this increase was higher operation and maintenance expense related to support and generation-related cost factors that were not individually significant.  
Results at Corporate and Other were a loss of $0.01 per share, which was $0.03 higher compared to a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by lower interest expense due to less outstanding long-term holding company debt.  
And that concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince."

And so as we put on the slide, we think that will come in at about $1 billion to $2 billion as we finalize the plans.  
On the Rhode Island side, Shar, I think you're hitting the nail right on the head. That's an area where I think we'll have a pretty good sense on what the opportunity is in Rhode Island as we think about the clean energy transition on what we've done in Pennsylvania, bringing that grid to Rhode Island to support the renewable ambitions within the state. Of course, there's going to be offshore wind opportunities that we need to get ready for as well as significant DPR in the state. There's also a lot of transmission opportunity.  
So there -- I think we'll have a pretty good sense of what needs to be done. The question will be -- and we'll have to work with the state on how quickly they want to get to the new clean energy transition, especially keeping -- just keeping rates in check, which, of course, we do across all of our jurisdictions.  
So I think it's probably a little premature to provide too much detail on that right now. But qualitatively, I would say I think we'll have a pretty good sense of the opportunity. When it happens, we'll need to engage with the state. But Greg, do you want to touch on the $1 billion that we've already identified?"

I just want to make sure I heard your question properly. So look, I would say in general, as we think about the capital allocation, right, investing in the utilities is our priority and our bias, especially as we try to make sure that we're delivering the grids that our customers need as we look at the transition to a clean energy future. 
So being able to fund that in a way that requires little to no equity issuances over the foreseeable future is incredibly important to us, which is really how Joe and the team identified the, right, the $3.5 billion of debt that we bought down with part of the proceeds and getting the balance sheet in that position where we can fund not only this $1 billion but even incremental capital, to your point, with Rhode Island and other potential opportunities that we may identify without issuing equity. So that's kind of the first component of that. 
In terms of the stock buybacks themselves, again, we're looking at that versus other potential opportunities. And you mentioned inorganic. I talked about last quarter we don't need M&A to hit the growth profile that we've communicated. Of course, we will be opportunistic as we always have been with M&A. 
But our -- I would say our focus in the M&A area right now, Shar, is to close Rhode Island, get the integration underway and really ensure that we have a smooth transition there and then as we talked about before, working with the state on the pace of change for the clean energy transition up in Rhode Island and then making sure that we're supporting that with the capital and investment plans. 
So our focus, I would say, on M&A right now is squarely on that. But as I always say, you never say never. If there's an opportunity that presents itself that we think would create incremental shareholder value above our organic growth plans, certainly, it's something that we would consider as we've done in the past, but it's not the core of our strategy right now."

So for -- through 2028, I would say certainly through '24, which is our next projected coal plant retirement, we don't think we require significant, if any, replacement generation for our '24 retirement. So really, the reserve margins start to tighten when we start to get into the 2028 time frame. 
And so as you can see in the -- on Slide 18, which is the IRP megawatts that we're talking about under the base case and then the high case, over the 15-year period, which is really where, again, it's post '28 when you see more significant retirements and then ultimate replacement for the increase in energy that we're projecting, both in the base case and then in the high case. 
So we're thinking in the base case, there's probably around $3 billion of investment opportunity over that 15-year period, significantly more in the high case. Obviously, you're seeing 56, 50-ish -- 5,600-ish additional megawatts significantly more renewables in that case. And so the investment opportunity under the high case would be call it, around $10 billion, plus or minus. So that's a significant opportunity. 
As we -- I should clarify that like the Ford announcement and some of the other announcements I talked about we're not necessarily in the base case. They don't necessarily get us to the high case as again, the high case has EV assumptions and electric heat assumptions, very high gas prices over the sustained period. 
So obviously, all of that is still to be determined. But I would say the positive thing with the Ford and the other announcements I talked about at least on the major new customer additions, we're certainly trending towards the high case versus the base case. 
So the investment opportunity, call it, $3 billion to $10 billion depending on the cases, not a significant amount in the next 5 years. You might start to see some in 2026 as we plan for the 2028 retirements. But it's really, I would say, just following that time period when you'll see more significant investment."

They're a little bit short as you -- we have slides in the deck that show the load. And that's really things that you're seeing across the country. 
So retail and hospitality, those have not fully come back yet. We're seeing the same thing down in Kentucky on that with the commercial. Industrial in Kentucky, of course, just a lot of the shutdown issues that we had during COVID, that's all recovered. But with the ship -- the chip shortages and some of the supply chain issues, we're seeing some of the factories being turned back. So that's why a little bit short on the C&I side. 
And then on the residential, we're just seeing in Pennsylvania a lot more workers are still working from home than what we're seeing in Kentucky. So for the most part, Kentucky is back to pre-COVID. Again, it's a little bit positive. But in PA, we're still quite a bit positive. 
So we'll -- we're still waiting to see how much of that remains permanent, Ryan, in terms of load, in terms -- with hybrid work schedules and just more flexibility that companies are providing their workforce. So I guess our expectation would be that residential stays slightly above, but that remains to be seen. 
And then in terms of the announcements that we talked about, probably a little premature to talk about the low -- the exact load impacts on those and when they will -- and when that will show up. We really -- in the case of the Ford plant, the final designs need to be prepared and released. 
And so I think while certainly qualitatively, this is positive for our jurisdiction and the state in general, and I think it will be -- it will actually fuel additional announcements and opportunities for folks that want to come into the state. Again, on top of the E3 energy strategy that the governor announced, I think this all bodes very well for economic development opportunities within Kentucky, which I think qualitatively is good for our jurisdictions and our service areas. 
But putting that into, say, a megawatt of load, I think it's a little premature for that. But as soon as we can do that, we will -- we'll get that disclosure out."
