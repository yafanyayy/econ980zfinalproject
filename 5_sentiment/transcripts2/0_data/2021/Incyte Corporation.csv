So 2020 was a year of strong growth for product commercialized by Incyte and thus commercialized by our collaboration partners. Total product and royalty revenues grew 18%, fueled by continued growth demand for Jakafi, which grew 15% year-over-year, and revenue from other hematology and oncology product was up 46% versus the prior year, benefiting from a strong launch of Pemazyre and good performance from The launch of Monjuvi is progressing well as we continue to observe market share gains. Royalties were up 28% to nearly $400 million, with Jakafi up 23%; Olumiant up 38% and the launch of Tabrecta now contributing to our royalty revenues. We also received over $200 million in milestone payments during 2020, resulting in an increase of 24% in total revenues year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 5. In 2020, we presented positive data from several pivotal trials and submitted 7 regulatory filing, and we expect to have a decision on all of this during this year. These decisions include the potential FDA approval of Jakafi in chronic GVHD, ruxolitinib in cell carcinoma, tafasitamab in DLBCL in Europe and pemigatinib for cholangiocarcinoma in Japan and Europe, where we recently obtained a positive CHMP opinion. We are also just a few months away from the potential approval of ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis and the expected sNDA submission for vitiligo. 
I will now pass the call over to Barry for additional details on product performance as well as our commercial preparation for the launch of ruxolitinib cream."

Jakafi performance was excellent in 2020, with revenues growing over $250 million to reach $1.94 billion. The demand Jakafi remains high with the total number of patients being treated, continuing to grow across all 3 indications. We are also encouraged by the partial recovery of new patient starts in the third and fourth quarter of 2020. For 2021, we expect strong Jakafi growth as we reach a normalization of oncology visits with a broader availability of COVID-19 vaccines. The potential approval of Jakafi in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD would represent its fourth indication and an additional important growth driver. The range of Jakafi guidance we have provided today for 2021 of $2.125 billion to $2.2 billion reflects the ongoing impact of COVID-19, especially in the first half of the year as well as the expected increase in the gross to net adjustment with the largest impact coming in the first quarter. 
Turning to Slide 8. The launch of Pemazyre has gone quite well as we have been able to capitalize on our relationships and experience in oncology. Since launch, over 300 physicians have prescribed Pemazyre. As expected, community-based oncologists are driving adoption and testing patients for FGFR2 alterations is going smoothly. Given the rate, we know that appropriate patients are being identified and are being treated with Pemazyre, and it is very gratifying to know that we have been able to bring this much needed therapy to a previously underserved patient population. 
The launch of Monjuvi is progressing well. Sales in the fourth quarter reached $17 million versus $5 million in Q3. We believe the strong safety and efficacy profile of Monjuvi is resonating with physicians. And as expected, we are seeing good utilization in the community setting. Since our Q3 update, the number of accounts purchasing Monjuvi has more than doubled to over 400. And we are also seeing good uptake from the vast majority of our top 100 key accounts. According to market research in BMT ineligible diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients, the Monjuvi regimen is the most used treatment in the second line plus patient population. 
Turning to Slide 10. We submitted the NDA for ruxolitinib cream for atopic dermatitis in December last year, and we expect a regulatory decision midyear. There are an estimated 21 million atopic dermatitis patients aged 12 and above in the United States, of which approximately 5.5 million received prescription therapy today. The number of prescriptions for the treatment of atopic dermatitis has grown significantly in recent years, as new therapies are introduced. However, only approximately 20% of patients report their atopic dermatitis is controlled with their current treatment, highlighting the significant unmet need that currently exists. We expect the initial uptake of ruxolitinib cream to be driven by specialists in medical dermatology and allergy. Our team has identified approximately 11,000 high prescribers who collectively account for approximately 80% of total prescriptions written for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in the U.S. Over the past several months, we have been able to recruit an exceptional team with significant experience in successfully launching dermatology products in the United States. We are expected -- we expect a fully recruited field team of 150 FTEs by mid-April, which is optimal to reach these high-volume prescribers. 
I'll turn the call over to Steven for a clinical update."

In 2020, we made significant progress across our development pipeline, as shown on Slide 12. Some highlights include positive results from pivotal trials of ruxolitinib in chronic graft-versus-host disease, ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis, tafasitamab in squamous cell anal carcinoma and parsaclisib in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, with each study forming the basis for regulatory submissions in their respective indications. We also announced multiple product approvals, including Pemazyre and Monjuvi in the United States; and Tabrecta in the United States and Japan and a new indication for Olumiant in atopic dermatitis in both Europe and Japan. We also recently announced the positive CHMP opinion for pemigatinib, a crucial step towards bringing the first targeted therapy to European patients with cholangiocarcinoma. 
As you can see on Slide 13, we are expecting multiple regulatory actions during 2021, with 7 expected approvals and 6 additional submissions during the year. For ruxolitinib, we expect an FDA decision for Jakafi in chronic graft-versus-host disease, and our partner, Novartis, is expected to submit Jakafi for acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, in both the EU and Japan during the first half of 2021.
Within hematology and oncology, we await an EMA decision for tafasitamab in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and an FDA decision for in squamous cell anal carcinoma. We expect pemigatinib to receive European approval in cholangiocarcinoma, following the recent positive CHMP opinion, and we also have a submission under review in Japan. Later this year, we plan to submit an NDA for parsaclisib monotherapy in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma based on the pivotal Citadel trials. Within dermatology, we expect an FDA decision for ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis in June, and we look to submit an sNDA in vitiligo shortly thereafter, assuming our Phase III program in this indication is successful. As you can see, this is shaping to be a very eventful and exciting year ahead for Incyte in terms of clinical development and regulatory action. 
Slide 14 provides a brief overview of the LIMBER clinical development program. Once-daily ruxolitinib is the furthest along with potential FDA approval before the end of 2022. We have multiple combinations planned and in development with PI3 kinase delta, BET or L2, which we believe have the potential to significantly improve outcomes for patients living with myelofibrosis. As you can see on the right-hand side, we expect the patent protection for many of these novel assets to extend well into the 2030s. 
Moving to Slide 15. This year with our partner, MorphoSys, we intend to initiate 2 Phase III trials. frontMIND is expected to enroll approximately 900 patients and will evaluate the combination of tafasitamab plus lenalidomide and R-CHOP versus R-CHOP alone in first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. InMIND is expected to enroll approximately 600 patients and will assess the combination of tafasitamab plus R square versus R-squared in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular or marginal zone lymphoma. We also plan on initiating 2 proof-of-concept trials in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, investigating tafasitamab in combination with our own PI3 kinase delta inhibitor parsaclisib, and in combination with lenalidomide and a CD20, CD3 bispecific antibody. 
Moving to Slide 16. We recently announced the acceptance under priority review of the BLA for The BLA was submitted based on the results from PODIUM202, data from which which was shared at the ESMO Congress last year. And the PDUFA date has been set at July 25. We have also been informed that the FDA expects to convene an advisory committee meeting as part of the review process. This slide also gives me an opportunity to remind you of our development strategy for retifanlimab. The first part of the strategy is to develop retifanlimab as monotherapy in certain niche indications where accelerated approvals are available. And other registration-directed trials beyond squamous cell anal carcinoma are ongoing in merkel cell carcinoma and MSI-high endometrial cancer. We also have an ongoing global Phase III study in lung cancer, which, of course, offers a much more substantial potential opportunity. A key part of our development strategy is related to the utility of having an in-house PD-1 antibody, which gives us the option to run numerous internal clinical combinations with other assets within our immuno-oncology portfolio, including and adenosine 2A, 2b, where there's potential for synergistic activity and enhanced efficacy. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update."

Turning now to our financial results. Our fourth quarter results reflect continued strong revenue growth with total product and royalty revenues of $680 million, representing an increase of 17% over the fourth quarter of 2019 and reflecting growth across products commercialized by Incyte and by our partners. Total product and royalty revenues for the quarter are comprised of net product revenues of $517 million for Jakafi, $29 million for and $14 million for Pemazyre. Royalties from Novartis of $87 million for Jakafi and $2 million for Tabrecta and royalties from Lilly of $31 million for Olumiant. For the full year 2020, total product and royalty revenues were $2.46 billion, an increase of 18% over 2019. Total revenues for 2020 of $2.67 billion increased 24% over 2019, reflecting the higher product and royalty revenues and an increase in milestone payments from our collaborative partners for the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones. 
Moving on to our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Ongoing R&D expenses of $380 million for the fourth quarter increased 23% from the prior year period due to our 55% share of the global and U.S.-specific development costs for tafasitamab and product/supply-related costs to support the potential launch in 2021 and of ruxolitinib cream as a treatment for atopic dermatitis. Ongoing R&D expense for the full year 2020 of $1.24 billion increased by 10% over 2019 also driven by the impact of our 55% share of tafasitamab development cost and ruxolitinib cream product supply-related costs. If ruxolitinib cream is approved, the product supply cost expensed in 2020 will ultimately contribute to lower cost of goods sold for a period of time subsequent to the product launch. As a reminder, our total R&D expense of $2.2 billion for the full year 2020 includes the upfront consideration of $805 million for our collaborative agreement with MorphoSys and $120 million of expense related to our purchase of an FDA priority review voucher utilized to accelerate the review of ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis. SG&A expense for the fourth quarter of $167 million increased 23% from the prior year period due to the timing of certain expenses. For the full year 2020, SG&A expense grew 10% compared to 2019, driven by an increase in sales and marketing spend to support the commercialization of Pemazyre in the U.S. and to prepare for the potential launch of RUX cream in the U.S. Our collaboration loss for the quarter was $12 million, which represents our 50% share of U.S. net commercialization loss for Monjuvi. For the full year 2020, the total collaboration loss was $43 million and was comprised of total net product revenues of $22 million and total operating expenses, including COGS and SG&A expenses of $107 million. 
Finally, we ended the year with $1.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
Looking at the evolution of our P&L offer over the past 5 years, you can see how the growth in our product and royalty revenues has exceeded the growth in both our ongoing R&D expense and SG&A expense leading to increased operating leverage and reflecting our commitment to prudent management of our financial resources. 
Moving on to 2021. I will now discuss the key components of our 2021 guidance on a GAAP basis. Given the expansion of our commercial portfolio, we are providing 2021 net product revenue guidance for Jakafi and as a total for other hematology/oncology products. For Jakafi, we expect net product revenues to be in the range of $2.125 billion to $2.2 billion, which at the midpoint represents approximately 12% growth over 2020 driven by continued growth across all indications. We expect our gross to net adjustment in 2021 to be approximately 18% with the adjustment in the first quarter of the year being higher relative to the previous quarter and subsequent quarters. For other hematology/oncology products, which currently include in Europe and Pemazyre in the U.S., we are expecting total net product revenues to be in the range of $145 million to $160 million. As in previous years, we are not providing guidance for milestone or royalty revenues. We are also not providing revenue guidance for any potential new product launches during 2021 or for Monjuvi in the U.S., which was recently launched and which we are commercializing, together with our partner, MorphoSys. 
Turning to operating expenses. We expect COGS to range from 6% to 7% of net product revenues. We expect R&D expense to be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.39 billion, representing mid single-digit growth at the midpoint versus 2020, excluding the impact of the MorphoSys upfront consideration and in 2020. Our SG&A expense guidance includes the investment related to the establishment of the new dermatology commercial organization in the U.S. and the related sales and marketing activities to support the potential launch of ruxolitinib cream for atopic dermatitis; the expansion of our sales and marketing activities in Europe to support the potential launches pemigatinib for carcinoma and tafasitamab for DLBCL; and the establishment of a commercial organization in Japan to support the potential launch of pemigatinib for carcinoma. As a result, in 2021, we expect GAAP G&A expense for the year to be in the range of $735 million to $775 million. Excluding the impact of these investments, we expect our SG&A expense for 2021 to remain flat compared to 2020. 
I will now turn the call back to Hervé for further discussions of the year ahead."

So first, could you characterize for us any key differences between the Phase II and the Phase III patient population that you're looking at for vitiligo?

I'll take your question. In terms of the question on the translatability of the Phase II to the Phase III, given the magnitude of the size of the Phase II, the geography we conducted it in and eligibility criteria, we actually expect there to be no differences in population or in outcome. We expect the read in the Phase III to be of similar efficacy, magnitude to the Phase II and the safety to be the same. I'll just sure the one nuance on the difference is we in Phase III limit the body surface area of vitiligo patients with depigmentation to be up to and including 10%, whereas in the Phase II are a little more liberal and allowed up to 20%. But that is the only difference. We expect no other differences in outcome and in read-through of the population. In terms of vitiligo itself, it's probably a much more common disease than everybody realizes. If you look at the United States, there are several million ""sufferers"" with vitiligo. Not all of them view it as a disease and not all of them want treatment. But currently, given the available therapies, about 100,000 to 150,000 people, we estimate seek different treatments including steroids, phototherapy, which is reimbursed as well and not -- they're not very effective in terms of remediating the disease and improving it and nothing to the degree we saw in the Phase II with topical RUX. There's also, as you know, a large psychosocial component to the condition where people often depressed from it as well. So we expect to work in the same population as the Phase II will include the majority of sufferers with vitiligo, particularly on the face and hands. And that's the label we'll aim for should the Phase III be as positive as we expect it to be."

Given the Celgene data  versus TNF therapy, particularly in RA patients, particularly looking at venous thromboembolism, malignancy and in major adverse cardiac events, you asked a question on the read-through to RUX",335,"Yes, Michael, thanks for the question. Given the Celgene data  versus TNF therapy, particularly in RA patients, particularly looking at venous thromboembolism, malignancy and in major adverse cardiac events, you asked a question on the read-through to RUX itself and then, I guess, potentially to topical RUX. We've been with RUX on the market since 2011. So we have many, many thousand years of patient exposure, including with our partner, Novartis, as well as long-term follow-up on our clinical trial programs. So let me just talk a little bit about the clinical trial programs. If you look at the COMFORT data in MF, now with 5 years of follow-up on those studies, there's been no signal for any of those events that are worrying in that particular exposure. In the response studies, that is a pro thrombotic disease, also now have 5 years of published follow-up and we've looked across the board at thromboembolic events, cardiac events and malignancies there. And in fact, on the treated arms, the rates are lower in both the primary treated arm, the crossover arm versus the best available therapy arms there. So it's in keeping as well with our market experience that we're not seeing a signal for any of those events as we asked to on a yearly basis by regulatory authorities. And just remind you, RUX cream has no warnings or black box for any of these. Topical RUX itself, as we have in 2 published papers now, 1 in AD and 1 in vitiligo, shown that the bioavailability of the cream is about 4% to 7% of that applied, on average about 5%. So -- and those are 2 published papers, 1 in AD, 1 in vitiligo. And thus, the effective oral exposure there is very small and not at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. So given the parent compound itself not having an issue, RUX cream having that sort of bioavailability and our safety from those clinical programs, we don't expect any read-through there at the moment."

They've never seen anything like this that has targeted -- that is a targeted therapy that's topical, that has biologic like activity. So we think that the safety and efficacy we demonstrated so far in true AD1 and true AD2 is going to help the uptake in patients throughout the United States."

Given that it's now early February, it's still early days of that submission and review, and it's going exactly as expected. It's in 12 years and above the 2 AD studies, which covers the majority of the population Barry was talking about with atopic dermatitis. However, there is a population that is younger, that does also have atopic dermatitis. And we have a commitment to continue to study that. We have to do more safety enabling work in the pediatric population to enable those studies to look, for example, is there any bone effect, et cetera, as you look at young ages. And we've got through those hurdles successfully, and we'll determine this calendar year, given that the Phase II is successfully completed, what sort of Phase IIIs we'll be conducting in conjunction with regulatory authorities to address the population 2 years and above and conduct those studies. And we'll let you know soon as we have those studies in place, but it's going well."

Well, the uptake of Monjuvi, like I said, is going very well in the second line plus patient population. Like any new therapy that launches, you end up starting in later line therapies, third and fourth-line therapy, for example, and we continue to try to move patients -- try to move physicians up into the second-line setting because we think that's where the patients will benefit the most. Our uptake at launch was mostly in the academic centers, and we do follow the academic centers that actually have CAR-T therapies available to them. And we're actually doing very well. Patients who are referred to academic centers for CAR-T therapy sometimes get there and they're actually not eligible for CAR-T therapy. So then they need another therapy to choose. As we progressed with our launch, more and more of the community oncologists are taking up Monjuvi and that surpassing number of patients who are being treated in the academic center. But we still have some of the largest centers in the country that are using this regimen of Monjuvi and As far as bispecifics go, we don't know that, that's a problem necessarily yet. And in fact, we think that the safety and efficacy profile of Monjuvi will match up very well to any of the new therapies that might be coming next year. As far as the CAR-T therapies go, again, physicians will choose their patient population based upon their ability to tolerate the side effects of the CAR-T therapy. So generally, it might be younger patients who are healthy that they might select for those therapies. But again, that's a limited number of centers around the country. So we think that Monjuvi has a long way to go with treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma."

I think the umbralisib approval from TG Therapeutics is good for patients. Obviously, we are believers in the PI3 kinase delta class. We think it has somewhat of an unfair overhang from years ago and that many have now addressed many of the untoward side effects. So we view that as a positive outcome. It doesn't in any way impact our plans in terms of where we're going with the Citadel studies and the filings this year, hopefully, in follicular, marginal and mantle cell lymphoma. If you look on the face of it, with many, many caveats on cross-trial comparisons, are independently reviewed activity in all those indications, follicular, marginal and mantle cell is higher than that reported with drugs like umbralisib, again with lots of caveats. So we're very encouraged by the efficacy we've seen with parsaclisib and obviously are proceeding with our plans. Tolerability is important as well. And obviously, we looked at their label and their discontinuations versus ours, et cetera. And we, again, think the class has been somewhat unfairly burdened by prior products. We lock our -- both our efficacy and safety profile. And we see, again, to be repetitive, no impact. In terms of switching to earlier programs, you spoke about adenosine and the adenosine targeted compounds. We have 1 in the clinic already, a small molecule, A2B inhibitor that's open and enrolling, and we announced at JPMorgan we also said we'll be following very shortly with antibody that will inhibit adenosine production higher up in the pathway. And Hervé showed in in that the 2 together, at least in a preclinical model are synergistic. We also feel that this is potentially an area where you may require triplet therapy, and you'll have to add checkpoint on top of a PD-1. It's too early to say where these will be going in terms of histology, lung would always be of interest, particularly in lung patients that don't respond to current IO therapies. So that will remain of interest. I'll just remind you also that both the adenosine program and the CD73 antibody or in-house programs, and we're very, very proud of them. Thanks."

That's one way. Other topical therapies may or may not be reimbursed. But I think it's -- Steven talked about the millions of patients in the United States, somewhere between 2 million and 4 million patients that have vitiligo, but maybe only 150,000 to 200,000 patients are seeking therapy. And that's because, in fact, there aren't very many effective therapies. We do have to continue to educate both payers. I don't think we really have to educate dermatologists very much. Dermatologists know that this is an autoimmune disease that drastically impacts patients' lives. So having a therapy like RUX cream for vitiligo, we think, can greatly enhance the quality of life for those patients, essential upon us to educate payers that this is not a cosmetic issue, that it is an autoimmune disease and that the responsible thing is actually to pay for it."

The LIMBER program itself is an umbrella program is numerous pillars. The formulation work was one of the pillars. Obviously, once-daily has potential compliance improvement over twice daily, although in oncology, people tend to do very well with twice dailies, but that was one of the efforts behind it for those people who would potentially benefit from that. Additionally, it does give us down the line, very important optionality on fixed-dose combinations should we develop, for example, PI3 delta or BET or L2 is a once daily, it could lend itself to be combined with a once-daily ruxolitinib in 1 FTC. So that would be really, really important from that. After we pursue the route through bioavailability and bioequivalence, finished the stability file and hopefully have it approved at the end of 2022, we could look at things that may be slight differences in the clinical profile of the once daily. For example, just by its very nature from a pharmakinetic point of view, it will have a lower peak, a lower Cmax. If if that is 1 of the causes of anemia from the drug, which we think it is, it may tend to have a lower rate of anemia with the once daily, which would be a benefit in MF patients because that's one of the reasons they discontinue and then allow patients to stay on drug longer and they -- as a direct result, actually enhance efficacy as well. So there are lots of aspects to the program. It's step-wise. It's about getting approval first, which may lend itself to compliance, optionality on fixed-dose combinations and potentially an upside on ameliorating anemia."

So again, back to the LIMBER program, we just spoke about in the prior question about the first pillar around formulation work. The second pillar is around important combination work with combinations that either enhance efficacy or enhance safety like the L2 or both because you ameliorate anemia with L2 and you can stay on RUX. The delta program that you alluded to has 2 very important Phase IIIs that are open site initiations ongoing now. One is a suboptimal setting for patients who have had at least 3 months of ruxolitinib, but have not had an adequate response in terms of spleen or symptom control and are then randomized to RUX plus delta in that set in PI3 delta versus RUX alone. The dosing -- because you asked the question specifically is for RUX itself. Obviously, we know optimal dosing and how to titrate based on potential safety issues like thrombocytopenia. The delta dosing came from proof-of-concept work we did in prior patients who had inadequate responses to long-term RUX. And that's how we determined that the 5-milligram was active there as well as had a tolerable profile. And that's what we're using in both the suboptimal study and the first line study, which are now open and site initiations ongoing. In terms of selling costs, it's a completely new mechanism of action. It's -- there's some enticing small clinical anecdotes. It's umbilical cord derived regulatory T cells that they have a way to enrich for CXCR4, which are then regulatory T cells that would then hone to the bone marrow. And they've shown in a small number of patients who are heavily pretreated. Some enticing data of clinical response, drop in and maybe even some fibrosis improvement. It's very early. We like the way the deal is structured because we go in with a small upfront. We finance the proof-of-concept work, and then we have the option to take it up. And we really -- it's exciting. It's an off-the-shelf umbilical cord with a completely new MOA. So that's the drivers behind that one."

Either we dosed more than 100 patients in a very solid tumor mine frame at the time. We were trying to drive inhibition with our BET inhibitor, and we treated, as I said, north of 100 patients. We had adequate inhibition, but we had a lot of on target toxicity in terms of thrombocytopenia and not much efficacy in solid tumors. So we put that program ourselves on hold or on the shelf, so to speak. And then obviously, the externally, the field evolved CPI610 showed data as monotherapy in MF patients in second-line setting and then in combination with RUX in the first-line setting that we think has an interesting signal. So we reinvigorated our program. It's up an open now for enrollment. And the idea is this calendar year, in the first half, hopefully, COVID behaves, but is to get monotherapy safety. And then in the second half of this year, get the combination safety with RUX with our own BET inhibitor and then potentially go ahead with pivotal studies. You ask how does it differentiate? So we were able with the external data to model a completely different dosing scheme from our prior one. We had about 1?3 to 1/4 of the dose who were in the clinic before. We've looked at the external environment, and we think that will weave the therapeutic ratio in terms of effect because we know it's effective in MF with our own data preclinically as well and then not have unacceptable rates of thrombocytopenia. But it's not a different BET inhibitor in any way in terms of targeting otherwise. And then we'll make bigger decisions once we have the safety data at the end of this calendar year."

So 2020 was a year of strong growth for product commercialized by Incyte and thus commercialized by our collaboration partners. Total product and royalty revenues grew 18%, fueled by continued growth demand for Jakafi, which grew 15% year-over-year, and revenue from other hematology and oncology product was up 46% versus the prior year, benefiting from a strong launch of Pemazyre and good performance from Iclusig. The launch of Monjuvi is progressing well as we continue to observe market share gains. Royalties were up 28% to nearly $400 million, with Jakavi up 23%; Olumiant up 38% and the launch of Tabrecta now contributing to our royalty revenues. We also received over $200 million in milestone payments during 2020, resulting in an increase of 24% in total revenues year-over-year.  
Turning to Slide 5. In 2020, we presented positive data from several pivotal trials and submitted 7 regulatory filings, and we expect to have a decision on all of this during this year. These decisions include the potential FDA approval of Jakafi in chronic GVHD, retifanlimab in squamous cell anal carcinoma, tafasitamab in DLBCL in Europe and pemigatinib for cholangiocarcinoma in Japan and Europe, where we recently obtained a positive CHMP opinion. We are also just a few months away from the potential approval of ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis and the expected sNDA submission for vitiligo.  
I will now pass the call over to Barry for additional details on product performance as well as our commercial preparation for the launch of ruxolitinib cream."

Jakafi performance was excellent in 2020, with revenues growing over $250 million to reach $1.94 billion.
The demand for Jakafi remains high with the total number of patients being treated, continuing to grow across all 3 indications. We are also encouraged by the partial recovery of new patient starts in the third and fourth quarter of 2020. For 2021, we expect strong Jakafi growth as we reach a normalization of oncology visits with a broader availability of COVID-19 vaccines. The potential approval of Jakafi in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD would represent its fourth indication and an additional important growth driver. The range of Jakafi guidance we have provided today for 2021 of $2.125 billion to $2.2 billion reflects the ongoing impact of COVID-19, especially in the first half of the year as well as the expected increase in the gross to net adjustment with the largest impact coming in the first quarter. 
Turning to Slide 8. The launch of Pemazyre has gone quite well as we have been able to capitalize on our relationships and experience in oncology. Since launch, over 300 physicians have prescribed Pemazyre. As expected, community-based oncologists are driving adoption, and testing patients for FGFR2 alterations is going smoothly. Given the refill rate, we know that appropriate patients are being identified and are being treated with Pemazyre, and it is very gratifying to know that we have been able to bring this much needed therapy to a previously underserved patient population. 
The launch of Monjuvi is progressing well. Sales in the fourth quarter reached $17 million versus $5 million in Q3. We believe the strong safety and efficacy profile of Monjuvi is resonating with physicians. And as expected, we are seeing good utilization in the community setting. Since our Q3 update, the number of accounts purchasing Monjuvi has more than doubled to over 400. And we are also seeing good uptake from the vast majority of our top 100 key accounts. 
According to market research in BMT and in eligible diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients, the Monjuvi LEN regimen is the most used treatment in the second line plus patient population. 
Turning to Slide 10. We submitted the NDA for ruxolitinib cream for atopic dermatitis in December last year, and we expect a regulatory decision midyear. There are an estimated 21 million atopic dermatitis patients aged 12 and above in the United States, of which approximately 5.5 million received prescription therapy today. The number of prescriptions for the treatment of atopic dermatitis has grown significantly in recent years, as new therapies are introduced. However, only approximately 20% of patients report their atopic dermatitis is controlled with their current treatment, highlighting the significant unmet need that currently exists. 
We expect the initial uptake of ruxolitinib cream to be driven by specialists in medical dermatology and allergy. Our team has identified approximately 11,000 high prescribers who collectively account for approximately 80% of total prescriptions written for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in the U.S. Over the past several months, we have been able to recruit an exceptional team with significant experience in successfully launching dermatology products in the United States. We are expected -- we expect a fully recruited field team of 150 FTEs by mid-April, which is optimal to reach these high-volume prescribers. 
I'll turn the call over to Steven for a clinical update."

In 2020, we made significant progress across our development pipeline, as shown on Slide 12. Some highlights include positive results from our pivotal trials of ruxolitinib in chronic graft-versus-host disease, ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis, retifanlimab in squamous cell anal carcinoma and parsaclisib in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, with each study forming the basis for regulatory submissions in their respective indications. 
We also announced multiple product approvals, including Pemazyre and Monjuvi in the United States; and Tabrecta in the United States and Japan and a new indication for Olumiant in atopic dermatitis in both Europe and Japan. We also recently announced the positive CHMP opinion for pemigatinib, a crucial step towards bringing the first targeted therapy to European patients with cholangiocarcinoma. 
As you can see on Slide 13, we are expecting multiple regulatory actions during 2021, with 7 expected approvals and 6 additional submissions during the year. For ruxolitinib, we expect an FDA decision for Jakafi in chronic graft-versus-host disease, and our partner, Novartis, is expected to submit Jakafi for acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, in both the EU and Japan during the first half of 2021.
Within hematology and oncology, we await an EMA decision for tafasitamab in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and an FDA decision for retifanlimab in squamous cell anal carcinoma. We expect pemigatinib to receive European approval in cholangiocarcinoma, following the recent positive CHMP opinion, and we also have a submission under review in Japan. Later this year, we plan to submit an NDA for parsaclisib monotherapy in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma based on the pivotal CITADEL trials. 
Within dermatology, we expect an FDA decision for ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis in June, and we look to submit an sNDA in vitiligo shortly thereafter, assuming our Phase III program in this indication is successful. As you can see, it is shaping to be a very eventful and exciting year ahead for Incyte in terms of clinical development and regulatory action. 
Slide 14 provides a brief overview of the LIMBER clinical development program. Once-daily ruxolitinib is the furthest along with potential FDA approval before the end of 2022. We have multiple combinations planned and in development with PI3 kinase delta, BET or ALK2, which we believe have the potential to significantly improve outcomes for patients living with myelofibrosis. As you can see on the right-hand side, we expect the patent protection for many of these novel assets to extend well into the 2030s. 
Moving to Slide 15. This year with our partner, MorphoSys, we intend to initiate 2 Phase III trials. frontMIND is expected to enroll approximately 900 patients and will evaluate the combination of tafasitamab plus lenalidomide and R-CHOP versus R-CHOP alone in first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. inMIND is expected to enroll approximately 600 patients and will assess the combination of tafasitamab plus R square versus R square in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular or marginal zone lymphoma. We also plan on initiating 2 proof-of-concept trials in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, investigating tafasitamab in combination with our own PI3 kinase delta inhibitor parsaclisib, and in combination with lenalidomide and plamotamab, a CD20 x CD3 bispecific antibody. 
Moving to Slide 16. We recently announced the acceptance under priority review of the BLA for retifanlimab. The BLA was submitted based on the results from POD1UM-202, data from which was shared at the ESMO Congress last year, and the PDUFA date has been set at July 25. 
We have also been informed that the FDA expects to convene an advisory committee meeting as part of the review process. This slide also gives me an opportunity to remind you of our development strategy for retifanlimab. The first part of the strategy is to develop retifanlimab as monotherapy in certain niche indications where accelerated approvals are available. And other registration-directed trials beyond squamous cell anal carcinoma are ongoing in Merkel cell carcinoma and MSI-high endometrial cancer. We also have an ongoing global Phase III study in lung cancer, which, of course, offers a much more substantial potential opportunity. A key part of our development strategy is related to the utility of having an in-house PD-1 antibody, which gives us the option to run numerous internal clinical combinations with other assets within our immuno-oncology portfolio, including AXL/MER and adenosine 2A, 2B, where there's potential for synergistic activity and enhanced efficacy. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update."

Turning now to our financial results. Our fourth quarter results reflect continued strong revenue growth with total product and royalty revenues of $680 million, representing an increase of 17% over the fourth quarter of 2019 and reflecting growth across products commercialized by Incyte and by our partners. Total product and royalty revenues for the quarter are comprised of net product revenues of $517 million for Jakafi, $29 million for Iclusig and $14 million for Pemazyre. Royalties from Novartis of $87 million for Jakavi and $2 million for Tabrecta and royalties from Lilly of $31 million for Olumiant. For the full year 2020, total product and royalty revenues were $2.46 billion, an increase of 18% over 2019. Total revenues for 2020 of $2.67 billion increased 24% over 2019, reflecting the higher product and royalty revenues and an increase in milestone payments from our collaborative partners for the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones. 
Moving on to our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Ongoing R&D expenses of $380 million for the fourth quarter increased 23% from the prior year period due to our 55% share of the global and U.S.-specific development costs for tafasitamab and product/supply-related costs to support the potential launch in 2021 of ruxolitinib cream as a treatment for atopic dermatitis. Ongoing R&D expense for the full year 2020 of $1.24 billion increased by 10% over 2019 also driven by the impact of our 55% share of tafasitamab development cost and ruxolitinib cream product supply-related costs. If ruxolitinib cream is approved, the product supply cost expensed in 2020 will ultimately contribute to lower cost of goods sold for a period of time subsequent to the product launch. 
As a reminder, our total R&D expense of $2.2 billion for the full year 2020 includes the upfront consideration of $805 million for our collaborative agreement with MorphoSys and $120 million of expense related to our purchase of an FDA priority review voucher utilized to accelerate the review of ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis. SG&A expense for the fourth quarter of $167 million increased 23% from the prior year period due to the timing of certain expenses. For the full year 2020, SG&A expense grew 10% compared to 2019, driven by an increase in sales and marketing spend to support the commercialization of Pemazyre in the U.S. and to prepare for the potential launch of RUX cream in the U.S. Our collaboration loss for the quarter was $12 million, which represents our 50% share of U.S. net commercialization loss for Monjuvi. For the full year 2020, the total collaboration loss was $43 million and was comprised of total net product revenues of $22 million and total operating expenses, including COGS and SG&A expenses of $107 million. 
Finally, we ended the year with $1.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
Looking at the evolution of our P&L over the past 5 years, you can see how the growth in our product and royalty revenues has exceeded the growth in both our ongoing R&D expense and SG&A expense leading to increased operating leverage and reflecting our commitment to prudent management of our financial resources. 
Moving on to 2021. I will now discuss the key components of our 2021 guidance on a GAAP basis. Given the expansion of our commercial portfolio, we are providing 2021 net product revenue guidance for Jakafi and as a total for other hematology/oncology products. 
For Jakafi, we expect net product revenues to be in the range of $2.125 billion to $2.20 billion, which at the midpoint represents approximately 12% growth over 2020 driven by continued growth across all indications. We expect our gross to net adjustment in 2021 to be approximately 18% with the adjustment in the first quarter of the year being higher relative to the previous quarter and subsequent quarters. 
For other hematology/oncology products, which currently include Iclusig in Europe and Pemazyre in the U.S., we are expecting total net product revenues to be in the range of $145 million to $160 million. As in previous years, we are not providing guidance for milestone or royalty revenues. We are also not providing revenue guidance for any potential new product launches during 2021 or for Monjuvi in the U.S., which was recently launched and which we are commercializing, together with our partner, MorphoSys. 
Turning to operating expenses. We expect COGS to range from 6% to 7% of net product revenues. We expect R&D expense to be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.39 billion, representing mid single-digit growth at the midpoint versus 2020, excluding the impact of the MorphoSys upfront consideration and the PRV in 2020. Our SG&A expense guidance includes the investment related to the establishment of the new dermatology commercial organization in the U.S. and the related sales and marketing activities to support the potential launch of ruxolitinib cream for atopic dermatitis; the expansion of our sales and marketing activities in Europe to support the potential launches of pemigatinib for cholangiocarcinoma and tafasitamab for DLBCL; and the establishment of a commercial organization in Japan to support the potential launch of pemigatinib for cholangiocarcinoma. 
As a result, in 2021, we expect GAAP SG&A expense for the year to be in the range of $735 million to $775 million. Excluding the impact of these investments, we expect our SG&A expense for 2021 to remain flat compared to 2020. 
I will now turn the call back to Hervé for further discussions of the year ahead."

So first, could you characterize for us any key differences between the Phase II and the Phase III patient populations that you're looking at for vitiligo?

I'll take your question. In terms of the question on the translatability of the Phase II to the Phase III, given the magnitude of the size of the Phase II, the geography we conducted it in and eligibility criteria, we actually expect there to be no differences in population or in outcome. We expect the read in the Phase III to be of similar efficacy, magnitude to the Phase II and the safety to be the same. I'll just show the one nuance on the difference is we in Phase III, limit the body surface area of vitiligo patients with depigmentation to be up to and including 10%, whereas in the Phase II, we are a little more liberal and allowed up to 20%. But that is the only difference. We expect no other differences in outcome and in read-through of the population. In terms of vitiligo itself, it's probably a much more common disease than everybody realizes. 
If you look at the United States, there are several million ""sufferers"" with vitiligo. Not all of them view it as a disease and not all of them want treatment. But currently, given the available therapy, about 100,000 to 150,000 people, we estimate seek different treatments including steroids, phototherapy, which is reimbursed as well and not -- they're not very effective in terms of ameliorating the disease and improving it and nothing to the degree we saw in the Phase II with topical RUX. There's also, as you know, a large psychosocial component to the condition where people are often depressed from it as well. So we expect to work in the same population as the Phase II will include the majority of sufferers with vitiligo, particularly on the face and hands. And that's the label we'll aim for, should the Phase III be as positive as we expect it to be. Thanks."

Given the Celgene's non-inferiority data versus TNF therapy, particularly in RA patients, particularly looking at venous thromboembolism, malignancy and in major adverse cardiac events, you asked a question on the read-through to RUX itself and then, I guess, potentially to topical RUX. We've been with RUX on the market since 2011. So we have many, many thousand years of patient exposure, including with our partner, Novartis, as well as long-term follow-up on our clinical trial programs. 
So let me just talk a little bit about the clinical trial programs. If you look at the COMFORT data in MF, now with 5 years of follow-up on those studies, there's been no signal for any of those events that are worrying in that particular exposure. In polycythemia vera, the response studies, that is a prothrombotic disease, also now have 5 years of published follow-up, and we've looked across the board at thromboembolic events, cardiac events and malignancies there. And in fact, on the treated arms, the rates are lower in both the primary treated arm, the crossover arm versus the best available therapy arms there. So as in keeping as well with our market experience that we're not seeing a signal for any of those events as we asked to on a yearly basis by regulatory authorities. And just remind you, RUX cream has no warnings or black box for any of these. Topical RUX itself, as we have in 2 published papers now, one in AD and one in vitiligo, shown that the bioavailability of the cream is about 4% to 7% of that applied, on average about 5%. So -- and those are 2 published papers, one in AD, one in vitiligo. And thus, the effective oral exposure there is very small and not at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. 
So given the parent compound itself not having an issue, RUX cream having that sort of bioavailability and our safety from those clinical programs, we don't expect any read-through there at the moment."

So we're very excited about it. We know that in talking to dermatologists across the country, that when they look at the data from TRuE-AD1 and TRuE-AD2, they're very excited.

Like any new therapy that launches, you end up starting in later line therapies, third and fourth-line therapy, for example, and we continue to try to move patients -- try to move physicians up into the second-line setting because we think that's where the patients will benefit the most. Our uptake at launch was mostly in the academic centers, and we do follow the academic centers that actually have CAR-T therapies available to them. And we're actually doing very well. Patients who are referred to academic centers for CAR-T therapy sometimes get there and they're actually not eligible for CAR-T therapy. So then they need another therapy to choose. 
As we progressed with our launch, more and more of the community oncologists are taking up Monjuvi and that's surpassing number of patients who are being treated in the academic center. But we still have some of the largest centers in the country that are using this regimen of Monjuvi and LEN. 
As far as bispecifics go, we don't know that, that's a problem necessarily yet. And in fact, we think that the safety and efficacy profile of Monjuvi will match up very well to any of the new therapies that might be coming next year. As far as the CAR-T therapies go, again, physicians will choose their patient population based upon their ability to tolerate the side effects of the CAR-T therapy. So generally, it might be younger patients who are healthy that they might select for those therapies. But again, that's a limited number of centers around the country.

I think the umbralisib approval from TG Therapeutics is good for patients. Obviously, we are believers in the PI3 kinase delta class. We think it has somewhat of an unfair overhang from idelalisib years ago and that many have now addressed many of the untoward side effects. So we view that as a positive outcome. It doesn't in any way impact our plans in terms of where we're going with the CITADEL studies and the filings this year, hopefully, in follicular, marginal and mantle cell lymphoma. 
If you look on the face of it, with many, many caveats on cross-trial comparisons, but our independently reviewed activity in all those indications, follicular, marginal and mantle cell is higher than that reported with drugs like umbralisib, again with lots of caveats. So we're very encouraged by the efficacy we've seen with parsaclisib and obviously are proceeding with our plans. Tolerability is important as well. And obviously, we looked at their label and their discontinuations versus ours, et cetera. And we, again, think the class has been somewhat unfairly burdened by prior products. 
We like our -- both our efficacy and safety profile. And we see, again, to be repetitive, no impact. 
In terms of switching to earlier programs, you spoke about adenosine and the adenosine-targeted compounds. We have one in the clinic already, a small molecule, A2A, A2B inhibitor that's open and enrolling that we announced at JPMorgan. 
We also said we'll be following very shortly with a CD73 antibody that will inhibit adenosine production higher up in the pathway. And Hervé showed in  his presentation that the 2 together, at least in a preclinical model are synergistic. We also feel that this is potentially an area where you may require triplet therapy, and you'll have to add checkpoint on top of a PD-1. It's too early to say where these will be going in terms of histology. Lung would always be of interest, particularly in lung patients that don't respond to current IO therapies.

So that will be one aspect. 
We also did a technology deal with a company called Cellenkos, and that was about myelofibrosis. So you can imagine also that we are looking at opportunities that we will be adding to our internal portfolio as part of the LIMBER program. And in general, the way we are thinking about it is, if there are products that could be available, that would be fitting with our hematology/oncology portfolio, that would be the priority. And if there were opportunities that are also providing additional revenue to our dermatology team in the U.S., it could be also something that we look, but mostly on the different time lines, as we will be launching first atopic dermatitis this year and then vitiligo next year. So there is no urgency to add to that in the short term.

So we have plans in place, just like many products that you see, particularly in dermatology, but throughout the United States for newly launched products, where we're going to ensure that when a dermatologist, when a physician prescribes RUX cream, that it's as easy as possible for the patient to obtain it. So that begins first with market access, working with PBMs and payers to make sure that there's as few restrictions as possible, as few prior approvals as possible. And then once we get to the pharmacy counter, to be able to help the patients with their co-pays and deductibles through, as you say, a couponing program or other ways for us to manage that. 
As far as Jakafi goes, Jakafi continues to -- Jakafi in PV goes, Jakafi continues to grow in PV faster than it does in MF. And even though MF continues to grow, the total number of patients continues to grow. I suppose our biggest activity that we're doing in PV, well, is, first, talking about the long-term follow-up of the response studies, which are very, very important. Over time, the data just continued to get more impressive and looked better. But also, we had our -- we had our disease awareness campaigns around polycythemia vera and the number of patients who are suffering because of the symptoms that they undergo when they're getting PVs.

The LIMBER program itself is an umbrella program with numerous pillars. The formulation work was one of the pillars. Obviously, once daily has potential compliance improvement over twice daily, although in oncology, people tend to do very well with twice dailies, but that was one of the efforts behind it for those people who would potentially benefit from that. 
Additionally, it does give us down the line, very important optionality on fixed-dose combinations should we develop, for example, PI3 delta or BET or ALK2 as a once daily, it could lend itself to be combined with a once-daily ruxolitinib in one FDC. So that would be really, really important from that. After we pursue the 505(b) route through bioavailability and bioequivalence, finish the stability file and hopefully have it approved at the end of 2022, we could look at things that may be slight differences in the clinical profile of the once daily. For example, just by its very nature from a pharmacokinetic point of view, it will have a lower peak, a lower Cmax. If  that is one of the causes of anemia from the drug, which we think it is, it may tend to have a lower rate of anemia with the once daily, which would be of benefit in MF patients because that's one of the reasons they discontinue and then allow patients to stay on drug longer and they, as a direct result, actually enhance efficacy as well. So there are lots of aspects to the program. It's step-wise. It's about getting approval first, which may lend itself to compliance, optionality on fixed-dose combinations and potentially an upside on ameliorating anemia."

So again, back to the LIMBER program, we just spoke about in the prior question about the first pillar around formulation work. The second pillar is around important combination work with combinations that either enhance efficacy or enhance safety like the ALK2 or both because you ameliorate anemia with ALK2 and you can stay on RUX. The delta program that you alluded to has 2 very important Phase IIIs that are open site initiations ongoing now. One is a suboptimal setting for patients who have had at least 3 months of ruxolitinib, but have not had an adequate response in terms of spleen or symptom control and are then randomized to RUX plus delta in that setting PI3 delta versus RUX alone. The dosing, because you asked the question specifically, is for RUX itself. Obviously, we know optimal dosing and how to titrate based on potential safety issues like thrombocytopenia. 
The delta dosing came from proof-of-concept work we did in prior patients who had inadequate responses to long-term RUX. And that's how we determined that the 5-milligram was active there as well as had a tolerable profile. And that's what we're using in both the suboptimal study and the first-line study, which are now open and site initiations ongoing. 
In terms of Cellenkos, it's a completely new mechanism of action. It's -- there's some enticing small clinical anecdotes. It's umbilical cord derived regulatory T cells that they have a way to enrich for CXCR4, which are then regulatory T cells that would then hone to the bone marrow. And they've shown in a small number of patients who are heavily pretreated, some enticing data of clinical response, drop in allele burden and maybe even some fibrosis improvement. It's very early. We like the way the deal is structured because we go in with a small upfront, we finance the proof-of-concept work, and then we have the option to take it up. And we really -- it's exciting, it's an off-the-shelf umbilical cord with a completely new MOA. So that's the drivers behind that one."

We dosed more than 100 patients in a very solid tumor mind frame at the time. We were trying to drive M1c inhibition with our BET inhibitor, and we treated, as I said, north of 100 patients. We had adequate inhibition, but we had a lot of on target toxicity in terms of thrombocytopenia and not much efficacy in solid tumors. So we put that program on hold or on the shelf, so to speak. And then obviously, the externally, the field evolved, CPI-0610 showed data as monotherapy in MF patients in second-line setting and then in combination with RUX in the first-line setting that we think has an interesting signal. 
So we reinvigorated our program. It's up and open now for enrollment. And the idea is this calendar year, in the first half, hopefully, COVID behaves, but is to get monotherapy safety, and then in the second half of this year, get the combination safety with RUX with our own BET inhibitor and then potentially go ahead with pivotal studies. You ask how does it differentiate? So we were able with the external data to model a completely different dosing scheme from our prior one. We had about 1/3 to 1/4 of the dose who were in the clinic before. We've looked at the external environment, and we think that will weave the therapeutic ratio in terms of effect because we know it's effective in MF with our own data preclinically as well and then not have unacceptable rates of thrombocytopenia. But it's not a different BET inhibitor in any way in terms of targeting otherwise. And then we'll make bigger decisions once we have the safety data at the end of this calendar year."

In the first quarter of this year, we continued to execute on our strategy to drive further growth and diversification. We entered the year following a strong 2020 where we were able to increase revenue by 24% and achieve multiple regulatory successes, including 3 product approval. We continue to deliver across our portfolio in the first quarter. Our revenues grew 6% year-over-year to reach $605 million with growth driven by new product launches and royalty revenues of $100 million. Q1, which is typically a quarter impacted by higher gross-to-net and forward purchasing patterns in the U.S., was further challenged by the ongoing pandemic. Total patients on Jakafi grew year-over-year. And in March, new patients start recovered to pre-COVID level. The launches of both Monjuvi and Pemazyre, continue to progress with good uptake from both academic and community physicians. Barry will provide additional details in his remarks.
We made significant progress across the clinical and regulatory landscape with Pemazyre approved in both Europe and Japan, becoming the first internally discovered product to be globally commercialized by Incyte. We also have 3 regulatory applications under priority review at the FDA as well as 2 applications under review in Europe, potentially increasing our sources of revenue in the near term.
Last month, we presented updated data for RUX cream at the American Academy of Dermatology meeting, including the 2-year data from our Phase II vitiligo trial and updated pooled results from our Phase III TRuE AD program in atopic dermatitis, with each highlighting the exciting potential of ruxolitinib cream as a treatment for these 2 indications.
We also announced, with our partner Lilly, 2 positive pivotal trials for baricitinib in alopecia areata. If approved, baricitinib could be the first FDA-approved therapy in alopecia areata.
Looking ahead, over the next 1 to 2 years, we have the potential to undergo a significant transformation here at Incyte with several expansion opportunity as new products and new indications are launched across the U.S., Europe and Japan. This includes RUX cream in atopic dermatitis and vitiligo, ruxolitinib in chronic GVHD, tafacitamab in relapse/refractory DLBCL in Europe, parsaclisib in multiple types of lymphomas and QD ruxolitinib in MFPV and GVHD.
As we look at our key business objectives for the year, we have 3 priorities. First, to grow our existing revenue base by driving new patient starts for Jakafi and accelerating the uptake of Monjuvi and Pemazyre. Second, to expand upon our revenue base by successfully launching new products and new indications. We expect several regulatory decisions before the end of this year. And third, to continue to progress our late-stage pipeline as well as our earlier-stage programs. Before I pass the call to Barry, I'd like to now take a minute to speak about our ESG initiative, which we call global responsibility and which was launched in 2019. Since then, we have increased our ESG disclosures and improved upon our objectives.
In this slide, we list a few key accomplishments among our 5 priority areas, and I'd like to specifically highlight our efforts on the environmental front. In an effort to reduce our environmental impact, we offset 100% of our 2019 measured carbon emissions in the U.S. through verified reforestation carbon credits in partnership with Foundation.
Looking ahead, we have a set of goals to achieve carbon neutral -- we have set a goal to achieve carbon neutrality through a combination of absolute reductions and offset by 2025. With that, I'll hand it over to Barry to cover the individual product performance."

Jakafi net sales in the first quarter grew year-over-year to $466 million. As you may recall, first quarter growth in 2020 was 22% year-over-year, due in large part to growth in patient demand, but also to a o",716,"Thank you, Herve, and good morning, everyone. Jakafi net sales in the first quarter grew year-over-year to $466 million. As you may recall, first quarter growth in 2020 was 22% year-over-year, due in large part to growth in patient demand, but also to a onetime increase in purchasing due to concerns over COVID-19 restrictions. Our Q1 net sales growth this year was impacted by the pandemic, a higher gross to net, and forward purchasing patterns. Patient demand growth of 2.3% in Q1 was softer than normal, due primarily to the decline in new patient starts since the beginning of the pandemic.
The graph on the right shows monthly new patient starts from 2019 to the end of 2021. In the first quarter last year, new patient starts were higher versus prior year, but then significantly declined in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. This loss of new patients impacts total patient growth in subsequent quarters and explains part of the slow growth in Q1 of this year.
We are seeing a gradual return of cancer patients to oncologist offices. And as you can see, by following the red line, new patient starts are now at pre-COVID levels. So due to patients returning for their treatments, our representatives being able to have face-to-face meetings with oncologists, our improved gross to net for the rest of the year and our anticipated launch in chronic GVHD, we expect strong growth in the second half of this year. Therefore, we are very confident in our full year outlook for Jakafi and are reaffirming our guidance of $2.125 billion to $2.2 billion.
Turning now to Slide 10. The launch of Pemazyre continues to perform well and has exceeded our initial expectations, and we continue to see an increasing use in the second-line setting. Since launch, the rapid adoption of FGFR2 testing by oncologist has facilitated the identification of appropriate patients for treatment with Pemazyre, and as a result, we see a continuous flow of new patients.
We launched Monjuvi with our partner MorphoSys in the third quarter of last year, and our teams demonstrated their ability to launch an injectable drug in a difficult environment. Our field teams continue to generate awareness amongst physicians of the strong efficacy and safety profile of Monjuvi, and we have maintained a leading share of voice near 50%. We are seeing encouraging growth in the number of purchasing accounts, which has risen by over 25% since Q4 of 2020 to over 500 at the end of March.
Looking ahead, we expect an acceleration in the adoption of Monjuvi in the second half of this year as oncology offices reopen, patients' diagnosis and treatment rates normalize, and our field teams are able to fully educate oncologists on the benefits of Monjuvi with in-person meetings.
Our focus now and going forward is on continuing to grow our market share in the second-line setting, so more patients can benefit from Monjuvi earlier in their treatment plan. Additionally, at ASCO, in June, will be presenting important 3-year follow-up data from the inMIND trial, which will provide additional insights into the use of Monjuvi and in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Turning our attention now to ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis. We recently conducted a survey of key external experts and payers assessing their perspective of ruxolitinib cream. Physicians and payers perceive ruxolitinib cream to be differentiated from other topicals and systemic therapies from both a safety and efficacy standpoint, and noted improvements in itch as the most impactful for both physicians and patients. In a separate survey of nearly 300 dermatologists, results show that ruxolitinib cream has a significant opportunity to address a large unmet medical need in the treatment of atopic dermatitis, and that physicians have a high willingness to prescribe. Our dermatology field force is fully assembled, and we are ready for a rapid launch upon approval.
Turning to Slide 13. Earlier this year, the FDA hosted a vitiligo panel in which patients living with the disease spoke on various subjects, including how vitiligo has impacted their quality of life and their links to which they go to seek treatment. Again, highlighting the need for a novel and effective therapy, such as ruxolitinib cream. I'll now turn the call over to Steven for a clinical update."

Over the past year, we have presented data from the AD program, highlighting the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis. At the American Academy of Dermatology conference in April, we presented additional pooled analysis from the 2 Phase III studies, demonstrating ruxolitinib creams impact on efficacy metrics such as itch, sleep and other quality of life measures across multiple subgroups.
In patients living with atopic dermatitis, the cycle of itching and scratching can lead to infections or disruptions in sleep, and these results further highlight the potential for ruxolitinib cream to become an important therapeutic option for these patients.
Turning to Slide 16. We previously showed at EADV in 2019, Phase II results for ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo at 52 weeks. At AAD this year, we presented updated 104-week data from the Phase II vitiligo program, showing treatment with ruxolitinib cream produced substantial repigmentation of vitiligo lesions through 104 weeks of treatment. Nearly 3/4 of patients who received ruxolitinib cream, 1.5% bid for 104 weeks, achieved a facial VASI 75, and nearly 60% achieved 90% clearance of vitaligo lesions on their face by week 104. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events reported, and ruxolitinib cream was well tolerated throughout.
We are excited by the potential of ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo and look forward to sharing with you the results of the Phase III True V program, which should read out in the second quarter.
On Slide 17, a reminder of the broad clinical development program for tafasitamab in combination with other therapies, including our PI3 kinase delta inhibitor, parsaclisib, across several non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in both the first-line and relapsed or refractory settings. In mind, a pivotal trial evaluating tafasitamab plus R-squared in relapsed follicular lymphoma is ongoing, and we expect to initiate another pivotal trial, frontMIND, in first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the second quarter. topMIND, our proof-of-concept study of tafasitamab in combination with parsaclisib is expected to initiate in 2021, and our proof-of-concept study in collaboration with Xencor is expected to start later this year.
Turning to the next slide. We continue to progress our LIMBER development program. Once-daily ruxolitinib data is in-house, and we expect data release at an upcoming medical conference, followed by an NDA submission early next year. Our parsaclisib plus ruxolitinib combination trials are progressing, and our BET and ALK2 monotherapy dose escalation trials are ongoing, with planned initiation of combinations in the second half of this year.
On the right side of the slide, our results from a turpentine-induced anemia mouse model. Turpentine was used to elicit an inflammatory response, which acutely increased their levels of hepcidin production and thus anemia. As can be seen in the chart, anemia developed in mice injected with turpentine and when given in conjunction with ruxolitinib, hemoglobin levels were further reduced. The pink data on the right side showed that ALK2 treated mice, when given with ruxolitinib, had less severe anemia as demonstrated by the improved hemoglobin levels.
In closing, we have made significant progress within our key development programs in the past year, and we expect another busy year for Incyte with multiple potential approvals and regulatory submissions throughout the year.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update."

Our total product and royalty revenues for the quarter were $605 million, representing a 6% increase over the first quarter of 2020. Total product and royalty revenues for the quarter are comprised of net product revenues of $466 million for Jakafi, $26 million for Iclusig and $30 million for Pemazyre. Royalties from Novartis of $66 million for Jakafi and $2 million for Tabrecta and royalties from of $32 million for Olumiant. Jakafi net product revenues in the first quarter of 2021 were impacted by the decline in new patient starts since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, forward purchasing in the first quarter of 2020 in advance of the annual resetting of copay obligations and the typical higher gross to net adjustment in the first quarter, compared to the other quarters during the year due to the impact of the Medicare Part D coverage gap or donut hole. The 1% year-over-year growth in Jakafi net product sales also reflects the higher patient demand and forward purchasing late in the first quarter of 2020, driven by concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic could cause potential supply disruption.
The decrease in net sales in the first quarter of 2021 from the prior year quarter also reflects the impact of COVID-related forward purchasing in the prior year, partially offset by positive currency effects. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient demand, we remain confident in the outlook for the year and our ability to continue to grow revenues through our existing products and new product launches like Pemazyre and Tabrecta.
Moving on to our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Ongoing R&D expenses of $295 million for the first quarter increased 6% from the prior year period, primarily due to cost to support the continued progression of our pipeline programs. Total R&D expense for the first quarter of $307 million decreased 72% from the prior year quarter, which included the upfront consideration of $805 million for our collaborative agreement with MorphoSys.
Our ongoing SG&A expense for the quarter of $141 million increased 27% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to our investments related to the establishment of the new dermatology commercial organization in the U.S. and the related activities to support the potential launch of ruxolitinib cream for atopic dermatitis as well as the timing of certain expenses.
Total SG&A expense for the first quarter of $154 million includes a $30 million reserve related to a settlement principle in connection with the December 2018 serial investigative development from the U.S. Department of Justice.
Our collaboration loss for the quarter was $10 million, which represents our 50% share of the $20 billion U.S. net commercialization loss for Monjuvi. This is comprised of total net product revenues of $15.5 million and total operating expenses, including COGS and SG&A expenses of $35.5 million.
Finally, our financial position continues to be strong as we ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash and marketable securities. Moving on to our guidance for 2021. We are reiterating our revenue, COGS, R&D and SG&A guidance for the year. We remain confident in our full year guidance for Jakafi based on the recent recovery of new patient starts and the potential approval later this year in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD.

But you couple that with the itch response, which is, in our view and our opinion leaders view, outstanding and also occurs rapidly. So you get patients having -- the dominant symptom resolve pretty quickly and then the resolution of the skin effect. In terms of the durability of effect, we expect and what we've seen is patients treat to remission and then sort of go off the drug and then restart it again in terms of when they get recurrence because it's a chronic condition of the symptoms, including itch or the skin effect. We estimate from the clinical data that we've seen on the study that somewhere around 3 to 4 60-gram tubes a year would be used. But it's hard to see what will happen in the real setting because in patients won't be in the clinical trial and, obviously, will be managed by physicians in their own effect.

We have it in-",358,"Vikram, it's Steven again. You are correct. So the RUX XR once-daily program has progressed well. It's a relatively preset route in terms of bioequivalence and bioavailability testing of the different tablet strengths. We've completed that. We have it in-house. And we follow the FDA guidance on what needs to be achieved comparable to the RUX that's used in the clinic in terms of area under the curve. So there's very strict guidance on what you have to come within to meet that, and we -- then we have that data in house. Yes, we do expect to have a public presentation of the data this calendar year at an appropriate median and forum, and we'll give that to you.
The other rate-limiting step there is just stability. So once we completed the BA and BE, all these strengths are laid down for 12-month stability, as soon as that completes, then we expect to proceed with filing very early next year. And what should be about a 10-month review period, we should have an approval if everything goes well, right before the end of '22, early '23 sort of time period, if you work that out. But again, to be repetitive, we will present the data publicly to you this year. It's interesting. So it's a relative JAK1 agent compared to ruxolitinib, which is more JAK1, JAK2. And we're trying to leverage that effect in terms of its cytopenias to see if we can have some benefit in myelofibrosis patients who require a modulation of the effect in terms of less JAK2 and less cytopenias. So it will be tested in a Phase II setting there for the appropriate patients to see if we achieve proof-of-concept with this drug. Just let me remind you, it has ongoing work in multiple other settings including cytokine release syndrome, including bronchiolitis obliterans and including some other work as well in inflammation and autoimmunity. So that's not the only program that's being used for.
And sorry, also, I should mention ongoing chronic GVHD work, where we're doing some dose-ranging work, which we'll get data in towards the end of this calendar year."

So remember, firstly, it's important to us, LIMBER. I mean, Barry has spoken about RUX. It's enormous benefit to patients, the value it brings to patients and then to the company and shareholders as well. So this is an internal effort that's cross-functional and appropriately large, directed at many different areas. So you have the once-daily program, we just spoke about, and its importance there for once-daily alone, plus optionality potentially on fixed-dose combinations with other ones dailies down the line should we decide to do that. Then the second pillar, it's all the combination work. And you ask more specifically what we may be more excited about versus others, and I'll come back to that in a second. But just to mention, the third pillar of the program, which we're more quiet about because it's preclinical in terms of discovery, research work in both MF and, where there are other potential targets which we may end up pursuing research endeavors are looking at those, plus with various collaborators.
Just to come back to that middle tier and the combos. So the RUX program, both registration-directed Phase III's are open. Sites are already being initiated and are screening patients. Just to remind you, there's a suboptimal setting where patients have had at least 3 months of ruxolitinib, 8 weeks of stable dose, but are not having sufficient benefit in terms of spleen reduction of symptoms and are then randomized to continue RUX plus parsaclisib setting, and that study is open; and then the first-line study of RUX plus parsaclisib RUX alone in first line, looking typically at a 24-week spleen volume response of 35% or greater. We also then internally have our BET program, which this half of the year is looking at monotherapy safety, and then we want to initiate combinations with RUX in the second half of this year. Just also to remind you, this is not a new drug to us. We had it in the clinic a few years ago where we were dosing at multiples of where we were now looking largely at solid tumors and MYC inhibition. So we already have an experience with this compound of 100-plus patients or more in that setting, and we want to keep accelerating that.
And then as in my prepared remarks, the third program is the ALK2 program. Very a little bit of a different mindset, probably works as we illustrated through hepcidin inhibition and ameliorating the anemia, which has a twofold effect. It will ameliorate potentially the anemia of myelofibrosis itself, plus the ruxolitinib-induced anemia. And then not only that, should that be successful, that's one of the principal reasons patients discontinue ruxolitinib. So we can ameliorate that. You'll get the added benefit of continued RUX use and the efficacy thereof. So that's also an exciting program. So I'm not giving you a priority list because they all have slightly different nuances. The one most ahead is obviously parsaclisib in terms of registration studies underway. The other two, we want to complete the monotherapy and combination safety this year and present data to you next year. I'll hand it to Barry for your second question."

So 707 is another in-house JAK inhibitor currently being used in higher, also a different profile to RUX, maybe in terms of more relative JAK1 effect versus JAK2. And it's good you bring this up because there's a spectrum of disease, if you will, in vitiligo that goes from mild to moderate to much more severe patients, where in the latter setting and the more severe, there may be more of a tolerance both from a patient point of view and regulator point of view for a different risk-benefit profile and need for a ""more potent"" effect should this work. So the idea here would be to get, we think JAK inhibition, what we know from the cream, is really effective therapy, and I just showed you in my prepared remarks, 104-week data. But perhaps with an RO having a different profile and potentially a more potent effect with albeit a different risk-benefit profile is worth testing. And in that way, we would look after vitiligo as an entity in completeness, in a more holistic manner, and be able to offer patients both a topical treatment for their illness and then also potentially an oral treatment for more severe settings, and that's the idea behind that."

Thanks for the question. So again, the data sets with parsaclisib in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are in 3 different entities: follicular lymphoma, relapsed/refractory; marginal zone lymphoma, relapsed/refractory; and mantle cell lymphoma, relapsed/refractory. We've updated at a few meetings now, the independently reviewed response rates, which are extremely robust and durable and albeit in single-arm studies with long progression-free survivals. So we really like the efficacy profile of the compound and then the tolerability with the second-generation delta inhibitors now largely dialing out the liver effect and then acceptable profile in terms of the other effects you see with delta inhibitors. So the intent in the U.S. is to file all 3 indications, in follicular, marginal zone and mantle cell lymphoma together. We still are working out the filing approaches in the other regions. We operate in, in Europe and Japan. But we feel that it has a competitive profile there as well. There's no other gating effect. It was merely the requirement to have a year's follow-up on the last responders, which is typical in these settings. And everything is progressing well on getting that file in, in the second half of 2021.
In terms of how we'll be positioned in lymphomas versus other options? As you indirectly alluded to, it's an area where there's chemotherapy, there's other targeted therapy with BTK inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors, the CAR-T therapies. As we -- early in the call said, antibody drug conjugates as well. And again, these are not -- these data sets are not first-line Settings. They're relapsed/refractory settings. I think physicians will look at the efficacy and turbidity data on its face and use it appropriately there. There's a little bit of a cloud over the area now early on in terms of data and some of the toxicity seen in combination that needs to be overcome. But now with a few delta inhibitors out there showing really robust data in B-cell lymphomas, different tolerability profiles, physicians getting used to it again, we feel and we hear that people will use it appropriate to the data sets."

Barry will talk about the sales performance question embedded there. So just to talk about our first indication in second-line cholangiocarcinoma, which, as Hervé said, is now globally approved in Europe and Japan as well. And our first internally discovered global product, and then Barry showed you the excellent uptake on the launch so far in a rare entity. However, again, in a good way, given now there's other targets beyond FGFR2, like IDH, more and more of these patients are getting molecularly profiled, more and more discovering that the FGFR2 driven and additionally, there's an awareness now beyond cholangio that one of the most common entities in carcinoma of unknown origin is potentially cholangiocarcinoma. So that -- when that entity gets molecular profile and is FGFR2 driven, there's a feeling that may be cholangiocarcinoma lend itself to treatment with pemigatinib. Remember, as part of our accelerated approval, we have an ongoing first-line study. So that's critical in terms of life cycle management. It's against first-line chemotherapy in terms of gemcitabine and cisplatinum. And if you look in other entities where you have a molecular profile that ends up being an oncogenic driver that drives particular tumor. So look at melanoma with BRAF Mec, et cetera, you see this -- or even lung cancer with EGFR, you see this migration to earlier line settings in terms of a targeted therapy. And that's the idea behind first-line cholangio plus, obviously, a very different tolerability profile versus chemotherapy. We have an ongoing large tumor-agnostic study that is enrolled well that looks at -- not to belabor the molecular side of this, but fusions, rearrangements, amplifications and then any other potential driver. And there are 3 different buckets there. And there's optionality around that as we gather the data now to either pursue potentially a tumor-agnostic setting if there's a strong enough signal or to look at a particular histology or 2 where there may be a driver there and then to do stand-alone work in that setting. So those are very important endeavors to us that we'll be focusing on this year from a clinical development point of view with pemigatinib. We don't think bladder cancer is the way to go, as we've said on prior calls, largely because of how the environment has changed there in terms of treatment paradigms and the use of EV earlier and earlier plus checkpoint inhibitors. So that's the pemigatinib life cycle side, and Barry will speak about the performance side, just on the data releases, that we spoke about. So as Barry said, we'll have the very important 3-year follow-up on the L-MIND study with continued results, particularly on duration of response at ASCO. The -- I should have said the bioavailable and  bioequivalent data with ruxolitinib the intent is actually to present it in an appropriate forum -- or published an appropriate forum this half of the year. And then obviously, the idea is also as soon we have it to also present the vitiligo Phase III data, incredibly important for topical RUX. Barry speak about the performance side of pemi."

I think when you launch into a tumor type of disease area where there is no other therapies, sometimes you actually don't really know how many patients are out there. Steven alluded to carcinoma of unknown primary. Some of those patients may in fact be cholangiocarcinoma patients. Some of them might have the FGFR2 rearrangement or fusion. So that's what I think we're experiencing is that there might have been more patients than our initial assumption around 800 to 1,000 patients in the United States. And then the duration of therapy, it turns out to be longer than perhaps we anticipated, both from the study and from our just estimates in the regular patient population. So that's very encouraging. The patients are getting therapy. They're getting tested, getting therapy, staying on therapy. And I think that helps us. In fact, we do have competitors in this space in cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 alterations because, one, it's nice to launch first, and then it's nice to launch with an excellent drug like Pemazyre. So we're all prepared for any competition, but we still think that patients will ultimately benefit from starting a drug like Pemazyre with its efficacy, safety and duration of therapy that we can offer."

In the first quarter of this year, we continued to execute on our strategy to drive further growth and diversification. We entered the year following a strong 2020 where we were able to increase revenue by 24% and achieve multiple regulatory successes, including 3 product approval. We continue to deliver across our portfolio in the first quarter. Our revenues grew 6% year-over-year to reach $605 million with growth driven by new product launches and royalty revenues of $100 million.
Q1, which is typically a quarter impacted by higher gross-to-net and forward purchasing patterns in the U.S., was further challenged by the ongoing pandemic. Total patients on Jakafi grew year-over-year. And in March, new patient starts recover to pre-COVID level. The launches of both Monjuvi and Pemazyre continue to progress with good uptake from both academic and community physicians. Barry will provide additional details in his remarks.
We made significant progress across the clinical and regulatory landscape with Pemazyre approved in both Europe and Japan, becoming the first internally discovered product to be globally commercialized by Incyte. We also have 3 regulatory applications under priority review at the FDA as well as 2 applications under review in Europe, potentially increasing our sources of revenue in the near term.
Last month, we presented updated data for RUX cream at the American Academy of Dermatology meeting, including the 2-year data from our Phase II vitiligo trial and updated pooled results from our Phase III TRuE AD program in atopic dermatitis, with each highlighting the exciting potential of ruxolitinib cream as a treatment for these 2 indications. We also announced, with our partner Lilly, 2 positive pivotal trials for baricitinib in alopecia areata. If approved, baricitinib could be the first FDA-approved therapy in alopecia areata.
Looking ahead, over the next 1 to 2 years, we have the potential to undergo a significant transformation here at Incyte with several expansion opportunity as new products and new indications are launched across the U.S., Europe and Japan. This includes RUX cream in atopic dermatitis and vitiligo, ruxolitinib in chronic GVHD, tafacitamab in relapse/refractory DLBCL in Europe, parsaclisib in multiple types of lymphomas and QD ruxolitinib in MFPV and GVHD.
As we look at our key business objectives for the year, we have 3 priorities. First, to grow our existing revenue base by driving new patient starts for Jakafi and accelerating the uptake of Monjuvi and Pemazyre. Second, to expand upon our revenue base by successfully launching new products and new indications. We expect several regulatory decisions before the end of this year. And third, to continue to progress our late-stage pipeline as well as our earlier-stage programs.
Before I pass the call to Barry, I'd like to now take a minute to speak about our ESG initiative, which we call global responsibility and which was launched in 2019. Since then, we have increased our ESG disclosures and improved upon our objectives. In this slide, we list a few key accomplishments among our 5 priority areas, and I'd like to specifically highlight our efforts on the environmental front. In an effort to reduce our environmental impact, we offset 100% of our 2019 measured carbon emissions in the U.S. through verified reforestation carbon credits in partnership with Arbor Day Foundation. Looking ahead, we have a set of goal to achieve carbon neutrality through a combination of absolute reductions and offsets by 2025.
With that, I'll hand it over to Barry to cover the individual product performance."

Jakafi net sales in the first quarter grew year-over-year to $466 million.

Jakafi net sales in the first quarter grew year-over-year to $466 million. As you may recall, first quarter growth in 2020 was 22% year-over-year, due in large part to growth in patient demand, but also to a onetime increase in purchasing due to concerns over COVID-19 restrictions. Our Q1 net sales growth this year was impacted by the pandemic, a higher gross to net, and forward-purchasing patterns. Patient demand growth of 2.3% in Q1 was softer than normal, due primarily to the decline in new patient starts since the beginning of the pandemic.
The graph on the right shows monthly new patient starts from 2019 to the end of 2021. In the first quarter last year, new patient starts were higher versus prior year, but then significantly declined in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. This loss of new patients impacts total patient growth in subsequent quarters and explains part of the slow growth in Q1 of this year.
We are seeing a gradual return of cancer patients to oncologist offices. And as you can see, by following the red line, new patient starts are now at pre-COVID levels. So due to patients returning for their treatments, our representatives being able to have face-to-face meetings with oncologists, our improved gross to net for the rest of the year and our anticipated launch in chronic GVHD, we expect strong growth in the second half of this year. Therefore, we are very confident in our full year outlook for Jakafi and are reaffirming our guidance of $2.125 billion to $2.2 billion.
Turning now to Slide 10. The launch of Pemazyre continues to perform well and has exceeded our initial expectations, and we continue to see an increasing use in the second-line setting. Since launch, the rapid adoption of FGFR2 testing by oncologist has facilitated the identification of appropriate patients for treatment with Pemazyre, and as a result, we see a continuous flow of new patients.
We launched Monjuvi with our partner MorphoSys in the third quarter of last year, and our teams demonstrated their ability to launch an injectable drug in a difficult environment. Our field teams continue to generate awareness amongst physicians of the strong efficacy and safety profile of Monjuvi, and we have maintained a leading share of voice near 50%. We are seeing encouraging growth in the number of purchasing accounts, which has risen by over 25% since Q4 of 2020 to over 500 at the end of March.
Looking ahead, we expect an acceleration in the adoption of Monjuvi in the second half of this year as oncology offices reopen, patients' diagnosis and treatment rates normalize and our field teams are able to fully educate oncologists on the benefits of Monjuvi with in-person meetings.
Our focus now and going forward is on continuing to grow our market share in the second-line setting, so more patients can benefit from Monjuvi earlier in their treatment plan. Additionally, at ASCO, in June, we'll be presenting important 3-year follow-up data from the L-MIND trial, which will provide additional insights into the use of Monjuvi and LEN in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Turning our attention now to ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis. We recently conducted a survey of key external experts and payers assessing their perspective of ruxolitinib cream. Physicians and payers perceive ruxolitinib cream to be differentiated from other topicals and systemic therapies from both a safety and efficacy standpoint and noted improvements in itch as the most impactful for both physicians and patients. In a separate survey of nearly 300 dermatologists, results show that ruxolitinib cream has a significant opportunity to address a large unmet medical need in the treatment of atopic dermatitis and that physicians have a high willingness to prescribe. Our dermatology field force is fully assembled, and we are ready for a rapid launch upon approval.
Turning to Slide 13. Earlier this year, the FDA hosted a vitiligo panel in which patients living with the disease spoke on various subjects, including how vitiligo has impacted their quality of life and their lengths to which they go to seek treatment, again highlighting the need for a novel and effective therapy, such as ruxolitinib cream.
I'll now turn the call over to Steven for a clinical update."

Over the past year, we have presented data from the TRuE AD program, highlighting the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis. At the American Academy of Dermatology Conference in April, we presented additional pooled analysis from the 2 Phase III studies, demonstrating ruxolitinib cream's impact on efficacy metrics such as itch, sleep and other quality-of-life measures across multiple subgroups.
In patients living with atopic dermatitis, the cycle of itching and scratching can lead to infections or disruptions in sleep, and these results further highlight the potential for ruxolitinib cream to become an important therapeutic option for these patients.
Turning to Slide 16. We previously showed at EADV in 2019, Phase II results for ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo at 52 weeks. At AAD this year, we presented updated 104-week data from the Phase II vitiligo program, showing treatment with ruxolitinib cream produced substantial repigmentation of vitiligo lesions through 104 weeks of treatment. Nearly 3/4 of patients who received ruxolitinib cream 1.5% BID for 104 weeks, achieved a facial VASI75, and nearly 60% achieved 90% clearance of vitaligo lesions on their face by week 104. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events reported, and ruxolitinib cream was well tolerated throughout. We are excited by the potential of ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo and look forward to sharing with you the results of the Phase III TRuE-V program, which should read out in the second quarter.
On Slide 17, a reminder of the broad clinical development program for tafasitamab in combination with other therapies, including our PI3 kinase delta inhibitor, parsaclisib, across several non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in both the first-line and relapsed or refractory settings. inMIND, a pivotal trial evaluating tafasitamab plus R-squared in relapsed follicular lymphoma is ongoing, and we expect to initiate another pivotal trial, Front-MIND, in first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the second quarter. topMIND, our proof-of-concept study of tafasitamab in combination with parsaclisib is expected to initiate in 2021, and our proof-of-concept study in collaboration with Xencor is expected to start later this year.
Turning to the next slide. We continue to progress our LIMBER development program. Once-daily ruxolitinib data is in-house, and we expect data release at an upcoming medical conference, followed by an NDA submission early next year. Our parsaclisib plus ruxolitinib combination trials are progressing, and our BET and ALK2 monotherapy dose escalation trials are ongoing, with planned initiation of combinations in the second half of this year.
On the right side of the slide, our results from a turpentine-induced anemia mouse model. Turpentine was used to elicit an inflammatory response, which acutely increased their levels of hepcidin production and thus anemia. As can be seen in the chart, anemia developed in mice injected with turpentine. And when given in conjunction with ruxolitinib, hemoglobin levels were further reduced. The pink data on the right side show that ALK2 treated mice, when given with ruxolitinib, had less severe anemia as demonstrated by the improved hemoglobin levels.
In closing, we have made significant progress within our key development programs in the past year, and we expect another busy year for Incyte with multiple potential approvals and regulatory submissions throughout the year.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update."

Our total product and royalty revenues for the quarter were $605 million, representing a 6% increase over the first quarter of 2020. Total product and royalty revenues for the quarter are comprised of net product revenues of $466 million for Jakafi, $26 million for Iclusig and $30 million for Pemazyre. Royalties from Novartis of $66 million for Jakavi and $2 million for Tabrecta and royalties from Lilly of $32 million for Olumiant.
Jakafi net product revenues in the first quarter of 2021 were impacted by the decline in new patient starts since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, forward purchasing in the first quarter of 2020 in advance of the annual resetting of copay obligations and the typical higher gross to net adjustment in the first quarter, compared to the other quarters during the year due to the impact of the Medicare Part D coverage gap or donut hole. The 1% year-over-year growth in Jakafi net product sales also reflects the higher patient demand and forward purchasing late in the first quarter of 2020, driven by concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic could cause potential supply disruption.
The decrease in Iclusig net sales in the first quarter of 2021 from the prior year quarter also reflects the impact of COVID-related forward purchasing in the prior year, partially offset by positive currency effects. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient demand, we remain confident in the outlook for the year and our ability to continue to grow revenues through our existing products and new product launches like Pemazyre and Tabrecta.
Moving on to our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Ongoing R&D expenses of $295 million for the first quarter increased 6% from the prior year period, primarily due to cost to support the continued progression of our pipeline programs. Total R&D expense for the first quarter of $307 million decreased 72% from the prior year quarter, which included the upfront consideration of $805 million for our collaborative agreement with MorphoSys.
Our ongoing SG&A expense for the quarter of $141 million increased 27% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to our investments related to the establishment of the new dermatology commercial organization in the U.S. and the related activities to support the potential launch of ruxolitinib cream for atopic dermatitis as well as the timing of certain expenses.
Total SG&A expense for the first quarter of $154 million includes a $30 million reserve related to a settlement in principle in connection with the December 2018 civil investigative demand from the U.S. Department of Justice.
Our collaboration loss for the quarter was $10 million, which represents our 50% share of the $20 billion U.S. net commercialization loss for Monjuvi. This is comprised of total net product revenues of $15.5 million and total operating expenses, including COGS and SG&A expenses of $35.5 million. Finally, our financial position continues to be strong as we ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Moving on to our guidance for 2021. We are reiterating our revenue, COGS, R&D and SG&A guidance for the year. We remain confident in our full year guidance for Jakafi based on the recent recovery of new patient starts and the potential approval later this year in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD.

Even the 90% rate now getting, greater than 60% of patients achieving that.
And there's very little spontaneous remissions of vitiligo, as you saw, in our data we presented to date. Placebo rates are negligible. The studies are large because of -- to require a safety database, not to hit the efficacy numbers. So we have a profile that we've already seen now in Phase II with 2-year update that is of enormous benefit to patients should they elect to be treated for it. And then you couple that with an extremely tolerable safety profile.
From an atopic dermatitis point of view, we don't discuss regulatory interactions. It's gone as expected, and we're very comfortable where we sit. And we remain on track for achieving everything we need, hopefully, by the PDUFA date. So that's how we're comfortable in that regard. Thank you."

Thank you. In terms of atopic dermatitis, again, from the data we've already shown publicly on a few occasions, you see, obviously, the effect in terms of Investigator Global Assessment, Eczema Area Severity Index, being about the best presented to date in mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. But you couple that with the itch response, which is, in our view and our opinion leaders' view, outstanding and also occurs rapidly. So you get patients having -- the dominant symptom resolve pretty quickly and then the resolution of the skin effect.
In terms of the durability of effect, we expect and what we've seen is patients treat to remission and then sort of go off the drug and then restart it again in terms of when they get recurrence because it's a chronic condition of the symptoms, including itch or the skin effect. We estimate from the clinical data that we've seen on the study that somewhere around 3 to 4 60-gram tubes a year would be used. But it's hard to see what will happen in the real setting because then patients won't be in the clinical trial and, obviously, will be managed by physicians in their own effect. But the -- that would give you a sense of the durability of response, and that's from the clinical trial setting.

It's a relatively preset route in terms of bioequivalence and bioavailability testing of the different tablet strengths. We've completed that. We have it in-house. And we follow the FDA guidance on what needs to be achieved comparable to the RUX that's used in the clinic in terms of area under the curve. It's a very strict guidance on what you have to come within to meet that, and we -- then we have that data in house. Yes, we do expect to have a public presentation of the data this calendar year at an appropriate median and forum, and we'll give that to you.
The other rate-limiting step there is just stability. So once we completed the BA and BE, all these strengths are laid down for 12-month stability. As soon as that completes, then we expect to proceed with filing very early next year. And what should be about a 10-month review period, we should have an approval, if everything goes well, right before the end of '22, early '23 sort of time period, if you work that out. But again, to be repetitive, we will present the data publicly to you this year.
Itacitinib, It's interesting. So it's a relative JAK1 agent compared to ruxolitinib, which is more JAK1, JAK2. And we're trying to leverage that effect in terms of its cytopenias to see if we can have some benefit in myelofibrosis patients who require a modulation of the effect in terms of less JAK2 and less cytopenias. So it will be tested in a Phase II setting there for the appropriate patients to see if we achieve proof-of-concept with this drug.
Just let me remind you, it has ongoing work in multiple other settings including cytokine release syndrome, including bronchiolitis obliterans and including some other work as well in inflammation and autoimmunity. So that's not the only program that's being used for. Thanks.

So remember, firstly, it's important to us, LIMBER. I mean, Barry has spoken about RUX, its enormous benefit to patients, the value it brings to patients and then to the company and shareholders as well. So this is an internal effort that's cross-functional and appropriately large, directed at many different areas. So you have the once-daily program, we just spoke about, and its importance there for once-daily alone, plus optionality potentially on fixed-dose combinations with other ones dailies down the line, should we decide to do that.
Then the second pillar, it's all the combination work. And you're asking more specifically what we may be more excited about versus others, and I'll come back to that in a second. But just to mention, the third pillar of the program, which we're more quiet about because it's preclinical in terms of discovery, research work in both MF and P vera where there are other potential targets which we may end up pursuing and Dash and his research endeavors are looking at those, plus with various collaborators.
Just to come back to that middle tier and the combos. So the RUX parsa program, both registration-directed Phase III's are open. Sites are already being initiated and are screening patients. Just to remind you, there's a suboptimal setting where patients have had at least 3 months of ruxolitinib, 8 weeks of stable dose but are not having sufficient benefit in terms of spleen reduction of symptoms and are then randomized to continue RUX with RUX plus parsaclisib setting, and that study is open. And then the first-line study of RUX plus parsaclisib RUX alone in first line, looking typically at a 24-week spleen volume response of 35% or greater.
We also then internally have our BET program, which this half of the year is looking at monotherapy safety, and then we want to initiate combinations with RUX in the second half of this year. Just also to remind you, this is not a new drug to us. We had it in the clinic a few years ago where we were dosing at multiples of where we were now looking largely at solid tumors and MYC inhibition. So we already have an experience with this compound of 100-plus patients or more in that setting, and we want to keep accelerating that.
And then as I had in my prepared remarks, the third program is the ALK2 program. Very -- a little bit of a different mindset, probably works as we illustrated through hepcidin inhibition and ameliorating the anemia, which has a twofold effect. It will ameliorate potentially the anemia of myelofibrosis itself, plus the ruxolitinib-induced anemia. And then not only that, should that be successful, that's one of the principal reasons patients discontinue ruxolitinib. So we can ameliorate that. You'll get the added benefit of continued RUX use and the efficacy thereof. So that's also an exciting program.
So I'm not giving you a priority list because they all have slightly different nuances. The one most ahead is obviously parsaclisib in terms of registration studies underway. The other two, we want to complete the monotherapy and combination safety this year and present data to you next year. I'll hand it to Barry for your second question."

It's steven. And thanks for bringing that up. So 707 is another in-house JAK inhibitor currently being used in hidradenitis suppurativa, also a different profile to RUX, maybe in terms of more relative JAK1 effect versus JAK2. And it's good you bring this up because there's a spectrum of disease, if you will, in vitiligo that goes from mild to moderate to much more severe patients, where in the latter setting and the more severe, there may be more of a tolerance both from a patient point of view and regulator point of view for a different risk-benefit profile and need for a ""more potent"" effect should this work.
So the idea here would be to get, we think, JAK inhibition. We know from the cream is really effective therapy, and I just showed you in my prepared remarks, 104-week data. But perhaps with an RO having a different profile and potentially a more potent effect with albeit a different risk-benefit profile is worth testing. And in that way, we would look after vitiligo as an entity in completeness, in a more holistic manner and be able to offer patients both a topical treatment for their illness and then also potentially an oral treatment for more severe settings, and that's the idea behind that."

So again, the data sets with parsaclisib in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are in 3 different entities: follicular lymphoma, relapsed/refractory; marginal zone lymphoma, relapsed/refractory; and mantle cell lymphoma, relapsed/refractory.
We've updated at a few meetings now, the independently reviewed response rates, which are extremely robust and durable and albeit in single-arm studies with long progression-free survivals. So we really like the efficacy profile of the compound and then the tolerability with the second-generation delta inhibitors now largely dialing out the liver effect and then acceptable profile in terms of the other effects you see with delta inhibitors.
So the intent in the U.S. is to file all 3 indications, in follicular, marginal zone and mantle cell lymphoma together. We still are working out the filing approaches in the other regions we operate in, in Europe and Japan. But we feel that it has a competitive profile there as well. There's no other gating effect. It was merely the requirement to have a year's follow-up on the last responders, which is typical in these settings. And everything is progressing well on getting that file in, in the second half of 2021.
In terms of how we'll be positioned in lymphomas versus other options, as you indirectly alluded to, it's an area where there's chemotherapy, there's other targeted therapy with BTK inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors, the CAR-T therapies. As we early in the call said, antibody drug conjugates as well. And again, these are not -- these data sets are not first-line settings. They're relapsed/refractory settings. I think physicians will look at the efficacy and tolerability data on its face and use it appropriately there.
There's a little bit of a cloud over the area now early on in terms of idelalisib data and some of the toxicity seen in combination that needs to be overcome. But now with a few delta inhibitors out there showing really robust data in B-cell lymphomas, different tolerability profiles, physicians getting used to it again, we feel and we're hearing that people will use it appropriate to the data sets."

And again, just to be repetitive, we mentioned we had this drug in the clinic a few years ago for quite a bit at multiples of the 4-milligram dose we're now at. We are treating above 10 milligrams. And we withdrew it because of a lack of efficacy in solid tumors, plus a safety profile around thrombocytopenia.
We then watched this field evolve, modeled -- did some modeling on the Constellation 610 compound and worked out that a much lower dose may be effective in myelofibrosis. So we're now using the 4-milligram dose in a Phase I just to document that safety, principally an acceptable profile in terms of thrombocytopenia, then quickly do a smaller number of patients with ruxolitinib again to document the safety aspect.
At that juncture, round around the end of this year, early next year, we will have choices to make which we're not there yet, which is what you alluded to, how aggressive to be. Do we then have to repeat or want to repeat in a Phase II proof-of-concept work or will we be comfortable enough given the arena to be more aggressive and go straight to Phase III or registration-directed studies. And we will make that decision once we see the safety profile of the combination."

So whenever you have a study and you decide to lock a database, you'll just -- you'll have what's in that database at that time. And there will be, by its nature, potentially missing data or missing visits, and that's partly what you're seeing.
In addition, and I think you're indirectly alluding to this, when people have that degree of improvement, they may elect for various reasons in the extension phase not to go on to the extension because they're satisfied where they are at, at the time. These are things we have to work out, given the impressive efficacy we see with the drug over time.
For me, the major message though is -- and there's also, sorry, one more thing I want to say. There is a little bit of a COVID impact on the longer-term study, and people, for example, wanting to come back to a clinic for a formal visit when it's not really needed for the primary endpoint. But what -- for me, the major message of the study, which is really interesting in terms of the biology is you get continued improvement over time. And we think there's a twofold effect happening there. Melanocytes are repopulating the area. They're present there. Plus the T cell suppression is probably largely gone and could be long lived.
And you've seen this continued improvement over time, which is just fascinating. It leaves the remaining questions to ask is when you withdraw therapy how long -- how durable that is, will treatment be needed, et cetera. And all those experience will conduct and will be ongoing here at Incyte as we understand this further. But it really somewhat surprised us in a good way to see that even at 2 years later, you're still getting an increase in the rates. But your comment's noted on smaller patient numbers down the pike."

Barry will talk about the sales performance question embedded there. So just to talk about our first indication in second-line cholangiocarcinoma, which, as Hervé said, is now globally approved in Europe and Japan as well and our first internally discovered global product, and then Barry showed you the excellent uptake on the launch so far in a rare entity.
However, again, in a good way, given now there's other targets beyond FGFR2, like IDH, more and more of these patients are getting molecularly profiled, more and more are discovering that the FGFR2 driven and additionally, there's an awareness now beyond cholangio that one of the most common entities in carcinoma of unknown origin is potentially cholangiocarcinoma. So that -- when that entity gets molecular profiled and is FGFR2 driven, there's a feeling that may be cholangiocarcinoma and lend itself to treatment with pemigatinib.
Remember, as part of our accelerated approval, we have an ongoing first-line study. So that's critical in terms of life cycle management. It's against first-line chemotherapy in terms of gemcitabine and cisplatinum. And if you look in other entities where you have a molecular profile that ends up being an oncogenic driver that drives particular tumor. So look at melanoma with BRAF/MEK, et cetera, you see this -- or even lung cancer with EGFR, you see this migration to earlier line settings in terms of a targeted therapy. And that's the idea behind first-line cholangio plus, obviously, a very different tolerability profile versus chemotherapy.
We have an ongoing large tumor-agnostic study that is enrolled well that looks at -- not to belabor the molecular side of this, but fusions, rearrangements, amplifications and then any other potential driver. And there are 3 different buckets there. And there's optionality around that as we gather the data now to either pursue potentially a tumor-agnostic setting if there's a strong enough signal or to look at a particular histology or 2 where there may be a driver there and then to do stand-alone work in that setting. So those are very important endeavors to us that we'll be focusing on this year from a clinical development point of view with pemigatinib.
We don't think bladder cancer is the way to go, as we've said on prior calls, largely because of how the environment has changed there in terms of treatment paradigms and the use of EV earlier and earlier plus checkpoint inhibitors. So that's the pemigatinib life cycle side, and Barry will speak about the performance side.
Just on the data releases, that we spoke about, so as Barry said, we'll have the very important 3-year follow-up on the L-MIND study with continued results, particularly on duration of response at ASCO. The -- I should have said the bioavailable and  bioequivalent data with ruxolitinib XR. The intent is actually to present it in an appropriate forum -- or publish at an appropriate forum this half of the year. And then obviously, the idea is also to -- as soon as we have it to also present the vitiligo Phase III data, incredibly important for topical RUX. Barry will speak about the performance side of pemi."

I think when you launch into a tumor type of disease area where there is no other therapies, sometimes you actually don't really know how many patients are out there. Steven alluded to carcinoma of unknown primary. Some of those patients may in fact be cholangiocarcinoma patients. Some of them might have the FGFR2 rearrangement or fusion. So that's what I think we're experiencing is that there might have been more patients than our initial assumption around 800 to 1,000 patients in the United States.
And then the duration of therapy, it turns out to be longer than perhaps we anticipated, both from the study and from our just estimates in the regular patient population. So that's very encouraging. The patients are getting therapy. They're getting tested, getting therapy, staying on therapy. And I think that helps us if in fact we do have competitors in this space in cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 alterations because, one, it's nice to launch first, and then it's nice to launch with an excellent drug like Pemazyre. So we're all prepared for any competition, but we still think that patients will ultimately benefit from starting a drug like Pemazyre with its efficacy, safety and duration of therapy that we can offer."

On Slide 4. So at the beginning of the year, we laid out several key business objectives for 2021, and we executed on a number of our commercial and clinical goals in the first half, representing a continuation of the momentum we saw throughout 2020. We believe these achievements, including the success of the TRuE-V1 and TRuE-AD program in vitiligo and atopic dermatitis will significantly contribute to our long-term strategy for growth and diversification. 
In the second quarter, our product and royalty revenues grew 17% to reach nearly $700 million. Jakafi net product sales were up 12%, with growth driven by the return of new patient starts to pre-COVID levels. Both Pemazyre and Monjuvi revenues increased quarter-over-quarter, up 33% and 16%, as both new product launches continue to gain traction and royalties grew 30% to $121 million for the quarter with Jakafi up 24% and Aluminum up 40%. 
Our performance in the second quarter shows the strength of our business and our new product launches are progressing well. We are looking forward to the second half as we await 2 important FDA decisions in September and the potential approval of tafasitamab in Europe, following the positive CHMP opinion received in June. 
While we are disappointed by the PDUFA extension for ruxolitinib premier atopic dermatitis and for ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD, we remain confident in the value these medicines can bring to patients based on the robust data from pivotal programs TRuE-AD and REACH3, respectively. We will continue to work the FDA on retifanlimab, which recently received a complete response later for the BLA submission for SCIC. Retifanlimab remains under review with the European Medicines Agency. 
Moving on to our clinical development progress. In addition to the positive top line results in vitiligo and long-term data in atopic dermatitis for ruxolitinib cream, we also announced positive Phase II data for parsaclisib in patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia and the achievement of bioequivalence with QD ruxolitinib, which is on track for an NDA submission in early 2022. 
Looking outside of the U.S., we have multiple growth opportunities across several markets. In the first half of the year, Pemazyre was approved in Europe and Japan, and we have seen encouraging uptake with ex-U.S. sales reaching 3 million further supporting the importance of Pemazyre as a treatment for patients with cholangiocarcinoma, NICE provided a positive recommendation for Pemazyre in the U.K. 
Turning to tafacitamab in the EU. If approved, Incyte will be commercializing tafacitamab under the brand name, Minjuvi, bringing the therapy to many patients in need. In Europe, 16,000 patients are diagnosed with relapsed or refractory DLBCL each year, of which approximately 14,000 would be eligible for tafasitamab. Our hematology team in Europe, which was already deployed for are launch-ready, and we will be leveraging resources to support the launch of tafacitamab on a country-by-country basis. 
So Slide 6 shows the key business objectives that we set for the year. So first, to continue driving growth in our current product portfolio; second, to continue to expand and diversify our revenue base through new product and new indication launches; and third, to continue to progress our late-stage pipeline as well as our earlier-stage program. 
So with that, I will hand it over to Barry to cover the individual product performance."

Good morning, everyone. Before we talk about our individual product performance, I wanted to mention how encouraged we are, as we see the gradual return of patients to physicians' offices, following a year of decreases in patient diagnosis and treatment due to COVID. 
While pharmaceutical representatives access to oncology offices is still lagging other therapeutic areas across the industry, we are seeing that there is now meaningful improvement in access to in-person meetings with oncologists. We expect these positive trends to continue and are optimistic about a stronger recovery in the second half of the year. 
On Slide 8, we show that Jakafi's sales grew 12% year-over-year to $525 million -- $529 million for the quarter, with total patient demand increasing across all 3 of our improved indications. New patient starts, shown by the Magenta line on the chart, are now at the pre-pandemic levels, signaling more patients are returning to their doctors and receiving the treatments they need. 
Regarding Jakafiguidance, we are reaffirming our growth prospects for the year. A slight reduction in the upper end of guidance has been made to account for the increase in gross to net due to greater percentage of Jakafi volume ordered from 340B accounts and the 3-month extension in the PDUFA for ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD. We now expect Jakafi net product sales between $2.125 billion and $2.170 billion for the year. We expect the growth of Jakafi to continue in the second half of the year with a stronger recovery of new patients to potential approval of ruxolitinib for the treatment of steroid-refractory chronic GVHD, representing an additional growth opportunity for Jakafi. And we look forward to the FDA's decisions next month. 
Turning to Slide 9. Pemazyre continues to outpace our expectations. Product sales grew 33% quarter-over-quarter to $18 million, including $15 million in U.S. sales as used in the second line continues to grow and the duration of therapy continues to drive performance. Since our initial launch, 60% of patients on Pemazyre have been second-line patients as reported by their physicians. However, in the recent survey of physicians, who have prescribed Pemazyre, that percentage is near 80%, indicating a earlier adoption of this therapy. 
Testing rates for FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements, continues to grow, and a recent survey showed that unaided awareness of FGFR2 fusions relative to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma increased to 61%, up from 34% noted in the survey prior to the Pemazyre launch. We are optimistic for the second half as our reps continue to drive awareness for FGFR2 testing and usage in the second line. 
Turning to Monjuvi on Slide 10. Monjuvi sales grew to $18 million in the second quarter, representing a 16% growth over Q1. We continue to see an increasing uptake of Monjuvi in the second-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and are seeing positive trends in new patient starts with momentum continuing as we exited June. 
As I said before, it has been a challenge to launch an injectable therapy in the midst of COVID However, we are seeing positive trends, including the expanded number of accounts purchasing Monjuvi, the increase in new patient share and higher percentage of Monjuvi patients in the second-line setting updated 3-year results from L-MIND were recently published, and we believe these data will help bring greater awareness to the potential benefit of Monjuvi in the second-line setting. 
I'd like to turn now our attention to ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis. As we wait for an FDA decision, we want to remind you of the high unmet need that exists for patients living with atopic dermatitis. There are currently 5.5 million patients with atopic dermatitis over the age of 12 on prescription medications and yet a significant number of patients continues to experience symptoms. Based on a recent survey of AD patients, over 40% of patients on prescription therapy experience flares at least once a week. Clearly, the need for novel effective treatments is high. 
Shifting to another survey of dermatologists, over 70% of these dermatologists are aware of ruxolitinib cream's development in atopic dermatitis. 85% of dermatologists separately indicated that they would be highly likely to prescribe ruxolitinib cream to patients who are presented with a blinded safety and efficacy profile and itch reduction was cited as the #1 treatment driver. We are confident in the data supporting ruxolitinib cream in AD, and we look forward to the FDA's decision next month. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Steven for a clinical update."

Starting with ruxolitinib cream, the FDA review of the NDA for ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis is ongoing with a new PDUFA date of September 21. At the revolutionizing atopic dermatitis conference in June,",833,"Thanks, Barry, and good morning, everyone. Starting with ruxolitinib cream, the FDA review of the NDA for ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis is ongoing with a new PDUFA date of September 21. At the revolutionizing atopic dermatitis conference in June, 52-week data from the TRuE-AD program were presented, showing long-term disease control with as-needed use of ruxolitinib cream. The majority of subjects achieved clear or almost clear skin by Week 8, and we saw no new safety signals during the long-term safety period, including no adverse events suggestive of a relationship to systemic exposure. We also recently initiated our Phase III pediatric program in an effort to expand the patient populations who might benefit from ruxolitinib cream. 
Turning to Slide 14. We previously announced at the beginning of Q2 that the Phase III vitiligo program had achieved its primary and key secondary endpoints at Week 24. Patients were randomized to receive 1.5% ruxolitinib cream twice daily or vehicle for 24 weeks, at which point a crossover occurred from vehicle to 1.5% ruxolitinib cream twice daily for an additional 28 weeks. 
The overall efficacy and safety profile of ruxolitinib cream were consistent with previously reported Phase II data. As a reminder, 30% of patients in the Phase II study achieved a facial VASI75 and continued improvement was seen through 52 weeks. With these positive outcomes, we are on track for an sNDA and MAA submissions in the second half of 2021 and are optimistic that ruxolitinib cream may be a meaningful treatment option for patients living with vitiligo. 
On Slide 15, tafasitamab 3-year data from the L-MIND study were presented in June, the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting and subsequently published in hematologic in July. These data demonstrated significant durable responses and reaffirmed a consistent safety profile with tafasitamab treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who are eligible for transplant. 
We are particularly encouraged by the tolerability and high overall response rates seen especially in the second-line setting, which exhibits the importance of starting therapy sooner. In addition, the study demonstrated that subsequent treatment, including an autologous stem cell transplant and CAR-T therapy is not precluded in patients with disease progression during the tafasitamab plus lenalidomide treatment. We are looking forward to the decision from the European Commission, following the positive CHMP opinion received in June. 
Turning to the next slide. Tafasitamab's clinical program continues to develop with multiple pivotal and proof-of-concept studies to start later this year. As of today, there are 3 updates to the program. The first being frontMIND, which is now ongoing and enrolling patients in first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Second, the initiation of coreMIND, a pivotal trial evaluating tafasitamab plus parsaclisib in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia based on the positive results of the COSMOS study. Lastly, we expect to initiate MINDWay, which is our dose optimization study in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 
On Slide 17, the LIMBER program continues to evolve in a positive way. We presented positive once-daily ruxolitinib bioavailability and bioequivalence data at ER in 2021, which demonstrated bioequivalence for area under the curve. Once daily ruxolitinib stability testing is ongoing, and we expect to file an NDA in early 2022. Multiple trials are ongoing, including the potential for fixed-dose combinations with parsaclisib plus ruxolitinib, and we anticipate the initiation of the vet and L2 combination components of their respective trials with ruxolitinib in the second half of this year. 
Turning to Slide 18. We the results of REACH3 investigating ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory chronic graft versus host disease were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. This data shows that treatment with ruxolitinib significantly improved overall response rate in Week 24 as well as a much higher best overall response rate versus best available therapy. REACH3 also achieved statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in key secondary endpoints, including failure-free survival and symptom response. With the September 22 PDUFA, we are excited at the potential to help bring this therapy to patients living with steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease, who currently have very limited treatment options. 
Turning to parsaclisib on Slide 19. We presented Phase II data in autoimmune hemolytic anemia at EHA in 2021, which showed high response rates and a normalization of hemoglobin levels during the initial 12-week treatment period. Clinically meaningful improvements in fatigue related quality of life were observed, and parsaclisib was generally well tolerated. In a disease with no currently approved treatments, we continue our commitment to patients through the development of parsaclisib and the initiation of the Phase III trial to start later this year. 
In closing, we had a number of clinical development successes announcing positive data across multiple programs and making significant progress within certain key development programs during the first half of '21, and we expect an eventful second half with multiple potential approvals and additional regulatory submissions. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update."

Our total product and royalty revenues for the second quarter were $696 million, representing a 17% increase over the second quarter of 2020. Total product and royalty revenues for the quarter are comprised of net product revenues of $529 million for Jakafi, $28 million for Iclusig and $18 million for Pemazyre. 
Royalties from Novartis of $82 million for Jakafi and $2 million for Taperecta and royalties from Lilly of $36 million for Olumiant. The 12% year-over-year growth in Jakafi net product sales reflects higher patient demand across all indications and a continued recovery of new patient starts as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic subside. 
Moving on to our operating expenses on a GAAP basis, ongoing R&D expenses of $339 million for the second quarter increased 20% from the prior year period, primarily due to the product supply cost for ruxolitinib cream, the progression of our late-stage pipeline and our 55% share of the global and U.S.-specific development costs for tafasitamab. Excluding the $11 million impact of incremental product supply cost for ruxolitinib cream, ongoing R&D expense for the quarter increased 16% from the prior year. 
Our SG&A expense for the quarter of $169 million increased 43% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to our investments related to the establishment of the new dermatology commercial organization in the U.S. and the related activities to support the potential launch of ruxolitinib cream or atopic dermatitis. 
Our collaboration loss for the quarter was $10 million, which represents a 50% share of the U.S. net commercialization loss for Monjuvi. This is comprised of total net product revenues of $18 million and total operating expenses, including COGS and SG&A expenses of $38 million. Finally, our financial position continues to be strong as we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
As we are at the midpoint of 2021, we are taking the opportunity to update our revenue and expense guidance. As Barry detailed earlier, for Jakafi, we are tightening the range to $2.125 billion to $2.17 billion. Based on the strong performance of Pemazyre in the first half of 2021, we are increasing the guidance range for other hematology oncology to $155 million to $170 million. 
Finally, we are lowering SG&A guidance to $725 million to $755 million to reflect lower expenses for ruxolitinib cream as a treatment for atopic dermatitis in the U.S. based on the PDUFA date extension. There are no changes in our guidance for COGS and our R&D. 
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A."

The efficacy profile in atopic dermatitis that we presented before in mild-to-moderate AD is outstanding, and the safety profile is in keeping with what I just said with the low systemic absorption of approximately 4% to 7% bioavailability compared to an oral tablet, in other words, no untoward effect So given all of that, we remain obviously extremely confident in the profile, and we look forward to that PDUFA date on September 21.

And then secondarily, on the once-daily form, I know physicians have this perception of myelosuppression with JAKs being intrinsically linked to spleen response and activity. So I'm just wondering how you hope to educate physicians around the potential to have comparable efficacy with a once-daily form that may have less toxicity? And is there any clinical data beyond the bioequivalence that you're hoping to deploy to help support that education and awareness?"

So thanks for the question on once-daily ruxolitinib. As you sort of alluded to albeit indirectly, the once-daily PK profile, while we demonstrated the comparability needed for area under the curve, the as you would expect from a once daily versus quicker release formulation is lower. We do think, although this is still need to be proven that, that is one of the aspects that drives, as you were alluding to the myelosuppression, particularly through potentially JAK2 inhibition and that there may be less anemia with once daily. 
I don't think that it's fully true in what you said, and it's more perception than reality that myelosuppression is linked to spleen volume reduction. In fact, as you know, we see SVR35 or better improvements in many patients who don't have any myelosuppression at all. So I think that is definitely more perception than reality, but it's something we will have to counter. 
The route we've taken for once daily in terms of approval is bioavailability bioequivalence route. The forms are now in stability testing. And if stability goes well, we'll be filing that early next year. There is no clinical data yet on outcomes in terms of efficacy or safety. That's something we would do after the fact that we wanted to. So a very sort of ""simple"" BA/BE route to prove the needed are under curve equivalents and the stability to get the approval."

So in terms of LIMBER, I mean, it's an incredibly important program to us for all the obvious reasons, both for the company shareholder value, commercial value, but also patient value and unmet need And just to give you the different aspects. Firstly, the formulation work on once-daily has gone really well with the outcome we desire as we just spoke about in terms of bioequivalence and stability now and that file should go ahead in early '22, if stability is fine, which we expect it to be. 
In terms of the combination, which is what your direct question, just a reminder, there are 3 we have internally. There's the parsaclisib combination program. That went very well. We presented the data multiple times. Both of the studies are open. The suboptimal study in patients who've had at least 3 months of ruxolitinib with either an inadequate spleen response or an adequate symptom response or both and then are randomized to continue ruxo or ruxo or parsa is ongoing and enrolling now. And then the first-line study of the combination is also open and enrolling now. So that program is going as well as we expected and on track. 
In terms of the earlier programs, the BET work with our BET inhibitor, we've always said we will do single agent safety in the first half of '21 and then the combination work in the second half. And then we'll have to make decisions on how aggressive to be in terms of a program thereafter, and we could go very aggressively, for example, into first line if the data warranted that. There has been some COVID impact on enrollment in all early studies across the board in oncology and hematology, but we're comfortable with where that program is. 
And then the third program L2, it's a different proposition, if you will, through -- we think through hepcidin inhibition that there'll be amelioration of anemia. That is one of the main reasons patients I'll remind you discontinue rock, so it will be of enormous benefit if it works there. And then not only that, they'll be able to maintain rux adequate dosing, so there'll probably be an efficacy upside as well. And that program, as we've always said as well, first half of this year, a single-arm safety and then combination work second arm and then the same process, how aggressive we want to be in terms of programs. There, again, has been some covered impact on enrollment in early studies, but we're comfortable with where the programs are."

But we saw, for a number of years, 340B orders rising and the discounts, obviously, going back to those institutions. And then it slowed down in this year, picked up again for a number of reasons. 
And some of those are that there's more disproportionate share hospitals coming on to the 340B program, so DISH hospitals. And then their what's called their child sites which is their satellite sites, more of those coming on as health systems buy up oncology practices, and they do it specifically for to take advantage of the 340B program. And then in fact, we see that some of the hospital or health systems are establishing their own specialty pharmacies -- so they don't contract with other specialty pharmacies outside of their institution or their health systems. So more orders are going through there. We think we forecasted going forward, and it's built into our forecast. The correct gross to net or the amount of gross to net that attributed to 340B.

And then just to mention because I didn't earlier that the optionality on this for fixed-dose combinations is also really important. So for any of the combinations I mentioned earlier, parsaclisib to ALK2, the ability to do a fixed-dose combination with once daily will also be there, should we elect to do so, and there will be a path forward there.

And the second question on Monjuvi. I guess based on the U.S. experience so far, how should we think about the potential launch trajectory in Europe, especially since you would presumably be launching into an environment that's less impacted by train at that time?"

Thanks for the question on Pemazyre. So what we saw, we had an ongoing tumor-agnostic program, as you know, looking at different potential biologic drivers, whether they're fusions, rearrangements or amplifications or any other FGFR thing. And we started to see signals within that program in glioblastoma multiforme that had a particular molecular driver and then in non-small cell lung cancer that also had a particular molecular driver. And we elected to pull those 2 and pursue them as standalone entity separately based on the biomarker. 
So we will work that out regulatory path now over the next few months with the regulatory agency, define the program and the eligibility criteria and then the study will go up on clintrials.gov and give you a little more information and granular details you want. But I will tell you, if you look at the prevalence of whether it be FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements or in some cases, FGFR3 as well, which may be particularly important in glioblastoma, the prevalence rates are sometimes in the single digits, 5% to 10%, sometimes a little higher. But obviously, in lung cancer, that's potentially enormous opportunity, given the number of patients, even if you have a 5% to 10% prevalence of a particular driver. 
So I can't give you more detail yet because we don't have regulatory agreement on the path, but you can sort of see how it would pan out. It would be a molecular-defined entity within that histology rather than a tumor-agnostic program. I'll turn the question over on the launch trajectory in Europe."

Not like the U.S. where the entire country, 1 day, the product becomes available. So you can anticipate that we'll be starting with Germany. And then from there, we will have other countries being added as we go. Interestingly, a nice recommendation now has been obtained already. So that should accelerate the availability in the U.K., which is very important. 
And also, it's important to realize that the treatment in -- for DLBCL in Europe is not exactly following the same path as the U.S. And I think there is a very good chance that we can see based on the data that you know. I mean, the 3-year data was recently published. It's reaffirming the duration of response, the high complete response rate. And I think it will have a very good chance to be used in second line very quickly in many of these countries. 
A reminder that we are really ready to launch it because we have an hematology team in place already in many of these countries from franchise and the relationship with physicians, the prescribers is already very well established. So the team is really optimistic about our ability to drive Monjuvi in -- Minjuvi in Europe quickly. And I think it will be successful. 
I mean the COVID situation is very different from country to country. And frankly, it's difficult to predict how it's going to evolve over the next few months. But I think it will be better than what we have seen in the U.S. where we were already at the lowest point when the approval of Monjuvi in -- tafasitamab in the U.S. took place. So everybody is fairly optimistic. Everybody is prepared, and I think it would be a successful launch."

Bone marrow transplants were down and GVHD was down, but now it's come back strong over the last several months or even since the end of last year. MF and PV patients that really dropped off in early spring -- in spring and early summer of 2020, all came back and just even in the last month of June, came back to about the highest new patient start level that we've had for a long time. So it's really GVHD growth is the highest in new patient starts and then PV, new patient starts after that and the MF patients after that. 
As far as Monjuvi goes, again, at least from our market research in the second-line setting, we're now the #1 drug used for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients in the second-line setting in terms of new patient starts. So that's where all of the new growth comes from and third, fourth or fifth line is falling off after that.

So the idea here is potentially with another JAK inhibitor, with a different JAK inhibitory profile, with a different PK that we'll be able to leverage some of that difference in terms of cytopenias and look for efficacy in populations, for example, that are more thrombocytopenic than others. It's still early days in terms of this program.

On Slide 4. So at the beginning of the year, we laid out several key business objectives for 2021, and we executed on a number of our commercial and clinical goals in the first half, representing a continuation of the momentum we saw throughout 2020. We believe these achievements, including the success of the TRuE-V and TRuE-AD program in vitiligo and atopic dermatitis will significantly contribute to our long-term strategy for growth and diversification.
In the second quarter, our product and royalty revenues grew 17% to reach nearly $700 million. Jakafi net product sales were up 12%, with growth driven by the return of new patient starts to pre-COVID levels. Both Pemazyre and Monjuvi revenues increased quarter-over-quarter, up 33% and 16%, as both new product launches continue to gain traction and royalties grew 30% to $121 million for the quarter with Jakafi up 24% and Olumiant up 40%.
Our performance in the second quarter shows the strength of our business and our new product launches are progressing well. We are looking forward to the second half as we await 2 important FDA decisions in September and the potential approval of tafasitamab in Europe, following the positive CHMP opinion received in June.
While we are disappointed by the PDUFA extension for ruxolitinib cream for atopic dermatitis and for ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD, we remain confident in the value these medicines can bring to patients based on the robust data from pivotal programs TRuE-AD and REACH3, respectively. We will continue to work the FDA on retifanlimab, which recently received a Complete Response Later for the BLA submission for SCAC. Retifanlimab remains under review with the European Medicines Agency.  
Moving on to our clinical development progress. In addition to the positive top line results in vitiligo and long-term data in atopic dermatitis for ruxolitinib cream, we also announced positive Phase II data for parsaclisib in patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia and the achievement of bioequivalence with QD ruxolitinib, which is on track for an NDA submission in early 2022.
Looking outside of the U.S., we have multiple growth opportunities across several markets. In the first half of the year, Pemazyre was approved in Europe and Japan, and we have seen encouraging uptake with ex U.S. sales reaching $3 million further supporting the importance of Pemazyre as a treatment for patients with cholangiocarcinoma. NICE provided a positive recommendation for Pemazyre in the U.K.  
Turning to tafasitamab in the EU. If approved, Incyte will be commercializing tafasitamab under the brand name Minjuvi bringing the therapy to many patients in need. In Europe, 16,000 patients are diagnosed with relapsed or refractory DLBCL each year, of which approximately 14,000 would be eligible for tafasitamab.
Our hematology team in Europe, which was already deployed for Iclusig, are launch-ready, and we will be leveraging resources to support the launch of tafasitamab on a country-by-country basis.
So Slide 6 shows the key business objectives that we set for the year. So first, to continue driving growth in our current product portfolio; second, to continue to expand and diversify our revenue base through new product and new indication launches; and third, to continue to progress our late-stage pipeline as well as our earlier-stage program.
So with that, I will hand it over to Barry to cover the individual product performance."

Good morning, everyone. Before we talk about our individual product performance, I wanted to mention how encouraged we are, as we see the gradual return of patients to physicians' offices, following a year of decreases in patient diagnosis and treatment due to COVID.
While pharmaceutical representatives' access to oncology offices is still lagging other therapeutic areas across the industry, we are seeing that there is now meaningful improvement in rep access to in-person meetings with oncologists. We expect these positive trends to continue and are optimistic about a stronger recovery in the second half of the year.
On Slide 8, we show that Jakafi's sales grew 12% year-over-year to $525 million -- $529 million for the quarter, with total patient demand increasing across all 3 of our improved indications. New patient starts, shown by the magenta line on the chart, are now at the pre-pandemic levels, signaling more patients are returning to their doctors and receiving the treatments they need.
Regarding Jakafi guidance, we are reaffirming our growth prospects for the year. A slight reduction in the upper end of guidance has been made to account for the increase in gross to net due to greater percentage of Jakafi volume ordered from 340B accounts, and the 3-month extension in the PDUFA for ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD.
We now expect Jakafi net product sales between $2.125 billion and $2.170 billion for the year. We expect the growth of Jakafi to continue in the second half of the year with a stronger recovery of new patient starts and the potential approval of ruxolitinib for the treatment of steroid-refractory chronic GVHD, representing an additional growth opportunity for Jakafi. And we look forward to the FDA's decisions next month.
Turning to Slide 9. Pemazyre continues to outpace our expectations. Product sales grew 33% quarter-over-quarter to $18 million, including $15 million in U.S. sales as use in the second line continues to grow and the duration of therapy continues to drive performance. Since our initial launch, 60% of patients on Pemazyre have been second-line patients as reported by their physicians. However, in the recent survey of physicians, who have prescribed Pemazyre, that percentage is near 80%, indicating a earlier adoption of this therapy.
Testing rates for FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements continues to grow, and a recent survey showed that unaided awareness of FGFR2 fusions relative to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma increased to 61%, up from 34% noted in the survey prior to the Pemazyre launch. We are optimistic for the second half as our reps continue to drive awareness for FGFR2 testing and usage in the second line.
Turning to Monjuvi on Slide 10. Monjuvi sales grew to $18 million in the second quarter, representing a 16% growth over Q1. We continue to see an increasing uptake of Monjuvi in the second-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and are seeing positive trends in new patient starts with momentum continuing as we exited June.
As I said before, it has been a challenge to launch an injectable therapy in the midst of COVID. However, we are seeing positive trends, including the expanded number of accounts purchasing Monjuvi, the increase in new patient share and higher percentage of Monjuvi patients in the second-line setting. Updated 3-year results from L-MIND were recently published, and we believe these data will help bring greater awareness to the potential benefit of Monjuvi in the second-line setting.
I'd like to turn now our attention to ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis. As we wait for an FDA decision, we want to remind you of the high unmet need that exists for patients living with atopic dermatitis. There are currently 5.5 million patients with atopic dermatitis over the age of 12 on prescription medications. And yet a significant number of patients continues to experience symptoms. Based on a recent survey of AD patients, over 40% of patients on prescription therapy experience flares at least once a week. Clearly, the need for novel effective treatments is high.
Shifting to another survey of dermatologists. Over 70% of these dermatologists are aware of ruxolitinib cream's development in atopic dermatitis. 85% of dermatologists separately indicated that they would be highly likely to prescribe ruxolitinib cream to patients who are presented with a blinded safety and efficacy profile, and itch reduction was cited as the number one treatment driver. We are confident in the data supporting ruxolitinib cream in AD, and we look forward to the FDA's decision next month.
Now I'll turn the call over to Steven for a clinical update."
332954,1674091514,2360704,"Incyte Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Incyte Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Barry, and good morning, everyone. Starting with ruxolitinib cream, the FDA review of the NDA for ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis is ongoing with a new PDUFA date of September 21. At the revolutionizing Atopic Dermatitis Conference in June,",832,"Thanks, Barry, and good morning, everyone. Starting with ruxolitinib cream, the FDA review of the NDA for ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis is ongoing with a new PDUFA date of September 21. At the revolutionizing Atopic Dermatitis Conference in June, 52-week data from the TRuE-AD program were presented, showing long-term disease control with as-needed use of ruxolitinib cream.
The majority of subjects achieved clear or almost clear skin by week 8, and we saw no new safety signals during the long-term safety period, including no adverse events suggestive of a relationship to systemic exposure. We also recently initiated our Phase III pediatric program in an effort to expand the patient populations, who might benefit from ruxolitinib cream.
Turning to Slide 14. We previously announced at the beginning of Q2 that the Phase III vitiligo program had achieved its primary and key secondary endpoints at week 24. Patients were randomized to receive 1.5% ruxolitinib cream twice daily or vehicle for 24 weeks, at which point a crossover occurred from vehicle to 1.5% ruxolitinib cream twice daily for an additional 28 weeks.
The overall efficacy and safety profile of ruxolitinib cream were consistent with previously reported Phase II data. As a reminder, 30% of patients in the Phase II study achieved a facial-VASI75 and continued improvement was seen through 52 weeks. With these positive outcomes, we are on track for an sNDA and MAA submissions in the second half of 2021, and are optimistic that ruxolitinib cream may be a meaningful treatment option for patients living with vitiligo.
On Slide 15, tafasitamab 3-year data from the L-MIND study were presented in June at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting and subsequently published in Hematologic in July. These data demonstrated significant durable responses and reaffirmed a consistent safety profile with tafasitamab treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who aren't eligible for transplant.
We are particularly encouraged by the tolerability and high overall response rates seen especially in the second-line setting, which exhibits the importance of starting therapy sooner. In addition, the study demonstrated that subsequent treatment, including an autologous stem cell transplant and CAR-T therapy is not precluded in patients with disease progression during the tafasitamab plus lenalidomide treatment. We are looking forward to the decision from the European Commission, following the positive CHMP opinion received in June.
Turning to the next slide. Tafasitamab's clinical program continues to develop with multiple pivotal and proof-of-concept studies to start later this year. As of today, there are 3 updates to the program. The first being Front-MIND, which is now ongoing and enrolling patients in first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Second, the initiation of Core-MIND, a pivotal trial evaluating tafasitamab plus parsaclisib in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia based on the positive results of the COSMOS study. Lastly, we expect to initiate MINDWay, which is our dose optimization study in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
On Slide 17, the LIMBER program continues to evolve in a positive way. We presented positive once-daily ruxolitinib bioavailability and bioequivalence data at EHA in 2021, which demonstrated bioequivalence for area under the curve. Once-daily ruxolitinib stability testing is ongoing, and we expect to file an NDA in early 2022. Multiple trials are ongoing, including the potential for fixed-dose combinations with parsaclisib plus ruxolitinib, and we anticipate the initiation of the BET and ALK2 combination components of their respective trials with ruxolitinib in the second half of this year.
Turning to Slide 18. We the results of REACH3 investigating ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory chronic graft versus host disease were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. This data shows that treatment with ruxolitinib significantly improved overall response rate in Week 24 as well as a much higher best overall response rate versus best available therapy.
REACH3 also achieved statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in key secondary endpoints, including failure-free survival and symptom response. With the September 22 PDUFA, we are excited at the potential to help bring this therapy to patients living with steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease, who currently have very limited treatment options.
Turning to parsaclisib on Slide 19. We presented Phase II data in autoimmune hemolytic anemia at EHA in 2021, which showed high response rates and a normalization of hemoglobin levels during the initial 12-week treatment period. Clinically meaningful improvements in fatigue related quality of life were observed, and parsaclisib was generally well tolerated. In a disease with no currently approved treatments, we continue our commitment to patients through the development of parsaclisib and the initiation of the Phase III trial to start later this year.
In closing, we had a number of clinical development successes announcing positive data across multiple programs and making significant progress within certain key development programs during the first half of '21, and we expect an eventful second half with multiple potential approvals and additional regulatory submissions.  
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update."

Our total product and royalty revenues for the second quarter were $696 million, representing a 17% increase over the second quarter of 2020. Total product and royalty revenues for the quarter are comprised of net product revenues of $529 million for Jakafi, $28 million for Iclusig and $18 million for Pemazyre.
Royalties from Novartis of $82 million for Jakafi and $2 million for Tabrecta and royalties from Lilly of $36 million for Olumiant. The 12% year-over-year growth in Jakafi net product sales reflects higher patient demand across all indications and a continued recovery of new patient starts as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic subside.
Moving on to our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Ongoing R&D expenses of $339 million for the second quarter increased 20% from the prior year period, primarily due to the product supply cost for ruxolitinib cream, the progression of our late-stage pipeline and our 55% share of the global and U.S.-specific development costs for tafasitamab. Excluding the $11 million impact of incremental product supply cost for ruxolitinib cream, ongoing R&D expense for the quarter increased 16% from the prior year.
Our SG&A expense for the quarter of $169 million increased 43% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to our investments related to the establishment of the new dermatology commercial organization in the U.S. and the related activities to support the potential launch of ruxolitinib cream for atopic dermatitis.
Our collaboration loss for the quarter was $10 million, which represents a 50% share of the U.S. net commercialization loss for Monjuvi. This is comprised of total net product revenues of $18 million and total operating expenses, including COGS and SG&A expenses, of $38 million. Finally, our financial position continues to be strong as we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and marketable securities.
As we are at the midpoint of 2021, we are taking the opportunity to update our revenue and expense guidance. As Barry detailed earlier, for Jakafi, we are tightening the range to $2.125 billion to $2.17 billion. Based on the strong performance of Pemazyre in the first half of 2021, we are increasing the guidance range for other hematology/oncology to $155 million to $170 million.
Finally, we are lowering SG&A guidance to $725 million to $755 million to reflect lower expenses for ruxolitinib cream as a treatment for atopic dermatitis in the U.S. based on the PDUFA date extension. There are no changes in our guidance for COGS and our R&D.

The efficacy profile in atopic dermatitis that we presented before in mild-to-moderate AD is outstanding, and the safety profile is in keeping with what I just said with the low systemic exposure of approximately 4% to 7% bioavailability compared to an oral tablet, in other words, no untoward effect seen.

Obviously, very encouraging to hear that new patient starts have now returned to pre-pandemic levels. I'm curious if you're seeing any recent changes with the Delta wave currently in the pandemic in terms of patient -- new patient diagnosis visits to physicians and new starts as well as your ability for sales reps to engage with physicians on the extent maybe to which that shapes your full -- your guidance?
And then secondarily, on the once-daily form, I know physicians have this perception of myelosuppression with JAKs being intrinsically linked to spleen response and activity. So I'm just wondering how you hope to educate physicians around the potential to have comparable efficacy with a once-daily form that may have less toxicity? And is there any clinical data beyond the bioequivalence that you're hoping to deploy to help support that education and awareness?"

So thanks for the question on once-daily ruxolitinib. As you sort of alluded to albeit indirectly, the once-daily PK profile, while we demonstrated the comparability needed for area under the curve, the Cmax as you would expect from a once-daily versus the quicker release formulation is lower. We do think, although this is still need to be proven that, that is one of the aspects that drives, as you were alluding to, the myelosuppression, particularly through potentially JAK2 inhibition and that there may be less anemia with once daily.
I don't think that it's fully true in what you said, and it's more perception than reality that myelosuppression is linked to spleen volume reduction. In fact, as you know, we see SVR35 have better improvement in many patients who don't have any myelosuppression at all. So I think that is definitely more perception than reality, but it's something we will have to counter.
The route we've taken for once daily in terms of approval is a bioavailability, bioequivalence route. The forms are now in stability testing. And if stability goes well, we'll be filing that early next year. There is no clinical data yet on outcomes in terms of efficacy or safety. That's something we would do after the fact that we wanted to. So a very sort of ""simple"" BA/BE route to prove the needed are under curve equivalents and the stability to get the approval."

So in terms of LIMBER, I mean, it's an incredibly important program to us for all the obvious reasons, both for the company shareholder value, commercial value, but also patient value, an unmet need here. And just to give you the different aspects. Firstly, the formulation work on once-daily has gone really well with the outcome we desire as we just spoke about in terms of bioequivalence and stability now and that file should go ahead in early '22, if stability is fine, which we expect it to be.
In terms of the combination, which is what your direct question, just a reminder there, the 3 we have internally, there's a parsaclisib combination program. That went very well. We presented the data multiple times. Both of the studies are open. The suboptimal study in patients who've had at least 3 months of ruxolitinib with either an inadequate spleen response or an inadequate symptom response or both and then our randomized to continue rux or rux plus parsa is ongoing and enrolling now. And then the first-line study of the combination is also open and enrolling now. So that program is going as well as we expected and on track.
In terms of the earlier programs, the BET work with our BET inhibitor, we've always said we will do single agent safety in the first half of '21 and then the combination work in the second half. And then we'll have to make decisions on how aggressive to be in terms of a program thereafter, and we could go very aggressively, for example, into first line if the data warranted that. There has been some COVID impact on enrollment in all early studies across the board in oncology and hematology, but we're comfortable with where that program is.
And then the third program ALK2, it's a different proposition, if you will, through -- we think through hepcidin inhibition that there'll be amelioration of anemia. That is one of the main reasons patients, I'll remind you, discontinue rux, so it will be of enormous benefit if it works there. And then not only that, they'll be able to maintain rux adequate dosing, so there'll probably be an efficacy upside as well. And that program, as we've always said as well, first half of this year, a single-arm safety and then combination work second arm and then the same process, how aggressive do we want to be in terms of programs. There, again, has been some COVID impact on enrollment in early studies, but we're comfortable with where the programs are."

But we saw, for a number of years, 340B orders rising and the discounts, obviously, going back to those institutions. And then it slowed down in this year, picked up again for a number of reasons. And some of those are that there's more disproportionate share hospitals coming on to the 340B program, so DSH hospitals.
And then their -- what's called their child sites, which is their satellite sites, more of those coming on as health systems buy up oncology practices, and they do it specifically for to take advantage of the 340B program. And then in fact, we see that some of the hospital or health systems are establishing their own specialty pharmacies -- so they don't contract with other specialty pharmacies outside of their institution or their health systems, so more orders are going through there. We think we forecasted going forward, and it's built into our forecast, the correct gross to net or the amount of gross to net that's attributed to 340Bs.

And then just to mention because I didn't earlier that the optionality on this for fixed-dose combinations is also really important. So for any of the combinations I mentioned earlier, parsaclisib, BET or ALK2, the ability to do a fixed-dose combination with once daily will also be there, should we elect to do so, and there will be a path forward there.

So the way we see it is that assuming we are at the end of 2022 with an approved once a day, there will be a transition of both existing patients moving to combination when it's appropriate and new patients being started on the once a day. So there is a sort of a -- in our plan, there is a transition period where the once a day we'll be basically replacing the twice a day for most of the indications in myelofibrosis."

I think stepping back from us alone and what the other 3 companies have communicated in the space with the oral programs, Pfizer, AbbVie and Eli Lilly that it looks like there's quite an impact from the ongoing Xeljanz safety review from RA in the room division, and that may be affecting actions across the class, so to speak, definitely with the other programs. And that's as much as I can say related to the cream.
From the peds aspect, Barry spoke about, within our current mild-to-moderate 12 and above, we're serving the majority of the population there that has the need. However, as you point out, many patients start with atopic dermatitis at much younger ages and that's the importance of the peds program and getting those Phase IIIs up and started already.
I won't give you the timing yet, it's a bit early, but our adult programs, as you know, accrued incredibly well and incredibly quickly.

Thanks for the question on Pemazyre. So what we saw, we had an ongoing tumor-agnostic program, as you know, looking at different potential biologic drivers, whether they're fusions, rearrangements or amplifications or any other FGFR thing. And we started to see signals within that program in glioblastoma multiforme that had a particular molecular driver and then in non-small cell lung cancer that also had a particular molecular driver. And we elected to pull those 2 and pursue them as standalone entity separately based on the biomarker.
So we will work that out regulatory path now over the next few months with the regulatory agency, define the program and the eligibility criteria and then the study will go up on clintrials.gov and give you a little more information and granular details you want. But I will tell you, if you look at the prevalence of whether it be FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements or in some cases, FGFR3 as well, which may be particularly important in glioblastoma, the prevalence rates are sometimes in the single digits, 5% to 10%, sometimes a little higher. But obviously, in lung cancer, that's potentially enormous opportunity, given the number of patients, even if you have a 5% to 10% prevalence of a particular driver.
So I can't give you more detail yet because we don't have regulatory agreement on the path, but you can sort of see how it would pan out. It would be a molecular-defined entity within that histology rather than a tumor-agnostic program. I'll turn the question over on the launch trajectory in Europe."

A reminder that we are really ready to launch it because we have an hematology team in place already in many of these countries from the Iclusig franchise and the relationship with physicians, the prescribers is already very well established. So the team is really optimistic about our ability to drive Monjuvi in -- Minjuvi in Europe quickly. And I think it will be successful.

So it's really, GVHD growth is the highest in new patient starts and then PV new patient starts after that and then MF patients after that.
As far as Monjuvi goes, again, at least from our market research in the second-line setting, we're now the #1 drug used for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients in the second-line setting in terms of new patient starts.

And as far as who writes what, so dermatologists for -- overwhelmingly write, at least, for the first script anyway for drugs like rux cream or most likely Eucrisa and so forth and obviously poor drugs like Dupixent, dermatologists are writing those. So -- and most of them are being treated in the community. Most of dermatology patients go to their local dermatologists in their community, not necessarily academic medical centers. We're very happy that most of the KOLs -- or all of the KOLs in dermatology are fully anticipating the approval of rux cream and looking forward to it.
And as far as primary care goes, yes, sure, they'll write for mild steroids. Maybe they'll write a refill script, but very little as far as our research goes that they'll be writing for rux cream, at least, currently. Now in the years to come, as everybody sees the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib cream, then that could change."

In terms of fixed-dose combinations, I don't think we'll lose optionality because we can make multiple of them and there are different ways of providing that. And given that it's a very set strength and then for parsaclisib, for example, there may only be 2 doses that would be needed. So you'd have the dose that's approved and then a reduction dose.

I'm happy to report today an important quarter for Incyte. But before we do that, I would like to take a moment to speak about the significant transformation our company has undergone over the past 2 years",551,"Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to report today an important quarter for Incyte. But before we do that, I would like to take a moment to speak about the significant transformation our company has undergone over the past 2 years. 
From the third quarter of 2019 to today, Incyte has more than doubled its number of approved products from 3 to 7 and has increased the number of approved indications from 5 to 12, a significant achievement for patients around the world. Within the same time period, quarterly product and royalty revenues have grown nearly 50% from $534 million to $778 million in the most recent quarter. This $778 million in product and royalty revenue for Q3 2021 does not yet reflect revenue contribution from our 2 most recent U.S. approval. Opzelura in atopic dermatitis and Jakafi in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD. In addition, we expect further growth from the recent approvals of Pemazyre in Europe and Japan and Minjuvi in Europe, where the launch is ongoing in Germany and will expand to other countries as reimbursement is secured. 
As you see on Slide 5, we have provided long-term guidance for some of these products and there is significant upside to the current sales number. Within hematology oncology, our MPN GVHD franchise, which includes Jakafi and other innovation is expected to surpass $3 billion in peak sales. Additionally, Minjuvi approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL has the potential to reach $500 million in this indication in the U.S. 
While we have not provided guidance in Minjuvi, Pemazyre  and Iclusig, this product represents additional growth potential and generate further value to our business. Turning to dermatology. Over the past year, we have successfully established our dermatology commercial franchise in the U.S. Given the product profile of Opzelura and Pemazyre commercial team we have in place,  we are confident in the potential for Opzelura and we expect peak sales to reach at least $1.5 billion in the United States in atopic dermatitis. 
While still very early in the launch of Opzelura, the initial uptake has been strong, and Barry will be providing details in his prepared remarks. Looking ahead in 2 other areas of our portfolio, we are anticipating multiple regulatory decision in 2022, including ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo in both the U.S. and Europe, parsaclisib in 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma indication in the U.S. as well as once-daily ruxolitinib late in 2022 or early 2023. 
This 2022 regulatory decision which closely follow multiple product approval in 2021, position us well for further growth and diversification of our product revenues in the coming year. Our partners are also making headway with Novartis, ruxolitinib is currently under review in Europe and Japan for acute and chronic GVHD, and capmatinib is under review in Europe for non-small cell lung cancer. 
In addition, Lilly is planning to submit an sNDA to the FDA for baricitinib  in alopecia areata by the end of this year. If approved, these opportunities will provide valuable growth to our royalty revenues, which have already surpassed $400 million during the first 9 months of this year. 
We have seen 2021 has been an important year of commercial, clinical and regulatory success for Incyte. With that, I will hand over to Barry to cover the individual product performance."

Jakafi sales grew 12% year-over-year to reach $547 million for the quarter, and we are reiterating our full year guidance range of $2.125 billion to $2.17 billion. Jakafi was first approved -- was the first ap",912,"Thank you, Herve, and good morning, everyone. Jakafi sales grew 12% year-over-year to reach $547 million for the quarter, and we are reiterating our full year guidance range of $2.125 billion to $2.17 billion. Jakafi was first approved -- was the first approved treatment in myofibrosis polycythemia vera and steroid-refractory acute GvHD. And years later, remains the standard of care in each of these indications. 
Growth across MF, PV and GVHD continues to be strong. And as you can see on the left, new patient starts have returned to pre-pandemic levels. With patients staying on therapy longer and new patients coming in, the total number of patients on Jakafi continues to increase year-over-year. 
Myelofibrosis patients, the largest proportion of patients on Jakafi comprise 45% of total patients, while and GVHD patients accounts for 34% and 14% of total patients, respectively. At the end of September, Jakafi was approved for its fourth indication for the treatment of steroid-refractory chronic GVHD. 
To put this recent approval into perspective, approximately 2,000 patients with graft-versus-host disease are currently using Jakafi, the majority of whom have acute form of the disease. There are over 14,000 patients in the U.S. living with chronic GVHD, of which have required therapy beyond systemic corticosteroids. 
We expect the recent approval to accelerate new patient starts with Jakafi. Turning to Slide 8. Minjuvi sales grew 22% sequentially to $22 million in the third quarter, with growth driven primarily by demand. We are seeing an increase in the number of total accounts across both academic and community settings, and there has been a swift shift towards adoption of Minjuvi earlier in the treatment paradigm. 
We now have a greater proportion of Minjuvi patients initiating therapy in the second line, which should result in patients experience in longer and more durable responses, leading to a longer duration of therapy. Feedback from health care professionals continues to be positive with efficacy, duration of response and safety being the key drivers of adoption. HCP awareness of Monjuvi's differentiated profile continues to increase and the L-MIND 3-year results have been well received by the physician community. 
As patients continue to return to the office and as our reps continue to educate health care professionals, on the clinical profile of Minjuvi, we are confident in our ability to build on this improving momentum. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are very excited to receive the approval of Opzelura the first FDA-approved topical JAK inhibitor for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. Prior to launch, we had identified 11,000 dermatologists and high priority allergists.  The top 20% of which are responsible for nearly 80% of atopic dermatitis prescriptions. 
Our patient assistance programs are in place to help reduce the barriers to access for Opzelura and our negotiations with payers are advancing well. To date, we have made significant progress with our in the launch of Opzelura. Since our launch on October 11, our field-based representatives have actively engaged with 76% of our target prescribers and have conducted 8,500 HCP calls in the first 3 weeks of launch, of which 95% are being conducted in person. 
We're also receiving a significant amount of interest in Opzelura from patients. And in the first 2 weeks of launch, we have approximately 61,000 unique website users, and this number continues to climb. Further highlighting, the level of engagement from patients, there were over 1,500 patient registrations for our co-pay card program. 
And lastly, on the payer front, our discussions with PBMs, which include the top 3, who account for nearly 80% of commercially insured patients in the U.S. have been very positive as they realize the value proposition of Opzelura. As a result, we expect to secure a broad coverage in Q1 of next year. 
In the meantime, during this contracting period, we have multiple efforts underway to ensure patients are able to access their medication. Although it is still early in launch, our efforts are translating into the first signs of a very successful launch. As you know, there are limitations to the accuracy of script data. It's important to note that IQVIA's capture rate of prescriptions are under representative of actual demand, especially in the initial weeks of launch. 
Over time, the capture rate is expected to continue to improve. There are 2 different metrics that we are using to track performance consisting of new brand new-to-brand Rxs and 867 data. New Rx data shown on the left captures the patients who are either new to the market or have switched to Opzelura. 
In the first 2 weeks of launch, there have been close to 1,000 new-to-brand prescriptions with nearly 2/3 of scripts coming from patients who were previously on topical corticosteroid therapy. On the right-hand side, we are showing 867 data, which is the number of units of Opzelura 60-gram tubes that our wholesalers are shipping to pharmacies. While 867 data doesn't translate directly into scripts, we believe it captures demand appropriately given the low level of inventory retail pharmacies typically hold for specialty dermatology products. 
Pharmacies order Opzelura when a prescription is received and approved by the patient's insurance are processed through our patient access programs. In its third week of launch, 1,115 tubes of Opzelura was shipped by wholesalers, bringing the total shift since launch to over 2,200. Based on early data, we are now tracking towards 300-plus units shipped in the first 4 weeks of launch. Now I'll turn the call over to Steven for a clinical update."

The third quarter brought numerous achievements on both the clinical and regulatory fronts. Starting with the 3 recent regulatory approvals, Minjuvi was approved in Europe for second-line diffuse large B-cell",1060,"Thank you, Barry, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter brought numerous achievements on both the clinical and regulatory fronts. Starting with the 3 recent regulatory approvals, Minjuvi was approved in Europe for second-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in August. In September, Opzelura was approved in the United States for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis, and Jakafi was approved in the United States for second-line chronic graft-versus-host disease. In addition to these regulatory milestones and successes, we presented pivotal data from our Phase III TRuE-V studies of ruxolitinib in Vitiligo at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology. 
The full data set highlighted the significant improvements in facial and total body repigmentation seen in vitiligo patients after treatment with ruxolitinib cream. Also presented at EADV was positive pivotal data for baricitinib, our partnered product with Eli Lilly in alopecia areata. These data showed that treatment with once-daily baricitinib 4 milligrams was superior to placebo in achieving significant scalp hair regrowth at 24 weeks in adults with severe alopecia areata. 
We also announced the global collaboration with Syndax Pharmaceuticals, which is pending regulatory clearance to develop and commercialize axatilimab, an anti-CSF1 receptor monoclonal antibody for chronic graft-versus-host disease and other fibrotic diseases. 
Lastly, we recently announced the acceptance of the marketing authorization application by the European Medicines Agency for ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo  and yesterday, we announced that the FDA accepted the NDA for parsaclisib in 3 types of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. 
We received priority review for parsaclisib in 2 of the indications, including for relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma in adult patients who have received at least 1 prior anti-CD20-based regimen and for mantle cell lymphoma in adult patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy. 
The PDUFA date for these 2 indications is April 30, 2022. There will be a standard review for parsaclisib in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma in adult patients who have received at least 2 prior systemic therapies with a PDUFA target action date of August 30, 2022. 
Let me remind you the efficacy across non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma, response rate seen and independently reviewed were 57% with the duration of response in PFS not yet reached. In mantle cell lymphoma, this was a 71% response rate with the duration of response of 9 months and a PFS of 11.1 months. 
And in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma, there was a 75% overall response rate with a duration of response of 14.7 months and a PFS of 15.8 months. All this data is with a once-daily regimen of 2.5 milligrams. 
Remember, this drug was designed to avoid hepatotoxicity associated with first-generation PI3 kinase delta inhibitors. And thus, we have seen low rates of liver toxicity with less than a 5% rate of Grade 3 ALT and AST elevations. In addition, cases of serious diarrhea and colitis were manageable and reversible. 
Turning to the next slide. The clinical development of parsaclisib in hemolytic anemia continues to progress with the Phase III study expected to start by the end of this year. The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of parsaclisib versus placebo with the primary endpoint of durable hemoglobin response at week 24. Patients must have a diagnosis of primary warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia.  Hemoglobin levels of 7 to 10 grams per deciliter and a faster F score of less than or equal to 43. 
This program represents another significant opportunity to address an unmet medical need where there are currently no approved therapies for patients. Moving to our LIMBER development program. We have multiple studies ongoing looking to improve upon the standard of care in myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera and graft-versus-host disease. We expect data and/or regulatory action for a few of these programs by the end of 2022, including the NDA submission for the once-daily formulation of ruxolitinib. We also recently entered into a collaboration with Syndax for axatilimab, an anti-CSF1 receptor monoclonal antibody, which is currently being evaluated as a monotherapy in third-line chronic graft-versus-host disease. In addition, we will have the opportunity to evaluate axatilimab as a combination therapy with our JAK inhibitors, where the ultimate goal would be to arrive at a safe and effective combination that could lead to a steroid-free regimen for chronic graft-versus-host disease. Turning to dermatology and ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo. The Phase III TRuE-V data presented at EADV showed meaningful superiority to vehicle with 30% of patients achieving a facial VASI75 at week 24, which is in line with our Phase II results. 
As a reminder, facial VASI75 response in the Phase II trial, continued to improve with ruxolitinib cream treatment with an over 51% response rate at week 52. We expect the 52-week data from the TRuE-V pivotal studies to be available in 2022. 
We are extremely encouraged by these poll results and the impact ruxolitinib cream may have for patients living with vitiligo in the United States and Europe. The MAA was recently validated by the European Medicines Agency and the U.S. sNDA is in progress. 
Turning to Slide 18 and an update on our dermatology programs. We continue to focus on developing our dermatology pipeline with ruxolitinib, and INCB54707, an oral selective Janus Kinase 1 inhibitor. Multiple studies are ongoing with ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis, including TRuE-AD3, a pivotal trial in atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients. 
In addition to our TRuE-V program in vitiligo, we are also looking at 707 in a Phase II study in patients with nonsegmental vitiligo with a body surface area of greater than or equal to 8%. Additional studies for 707 are currently underway in other indications, including 2 Phase II trials in hyrdrenitis Suprotiva and prurigo nodularis. We look forward to updating you on these programs next year. 
In closing, we had a very successful quarter with a number of clinical and regulatory accomplishments, including 3 approvals.  The FDA acceptance of an NDA for parsaclisib as a treatment for 3 types of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and the EMA acceptance of the MAA for ruxolitinib cream as a treatment for vitiligo. 
Later this week, we invite you to join an analyst and investor call to discuss our RO PD-L1 program, including data for 86550, which was accepted for presentation at the SITC Annual Congress on November 13. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update."

Our total product and royalty revenues for the third quarter were $778 million, representing a 25% increase over the third quarter of 2020. Total product and royalty revenues for the quarter are comprised of net product revenues of $547 million for Jakafi and $48 million for other hematology oncology products. 
Royalties from Novartis of $95 million for Jakafi and $3 million for Tabrecta and royalties from Lilly of $87 million for Olumiant. The 12% year-over-year growth in Jakafi net product sales reflects higher patient demand across all indications and a continued recovery of new patient starts as we continue to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The tripling of the Olumiant royalties is due primarily to the use of Olumiant  for the treatment of COVID-19. Per agreement with Lilly for global network sales of Olumiant  for the treatment of COVID-19, we are entitled to receive royalties equal to the base double-digit rate amicable to all global net product sales, plus an additional 13% royalty. 
Moving on to our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Ongoing R&D expenses of $331 million for the third quarter increased 11% from the prior year period, primarily due to the progression of our pipeline. Our SG&A expense for the quarter of $191 million increased 58% from the prior year quarter primarily due to our investments related to the establishment of the new dermatology commercial organization in the U.S. and the related activities to support the launch of Opzelura for atopic dermatitis. 
Our collaboration loss for the quarter was $9 million, which represents our 50% share of the U.S. net commercialization loss for Minjuvi. This is comprised of total net product revenues of $22 million and total operating expenses, including COGS and SG&A expenses of $40 million. 
Finally, our financial position continues to be strong as we ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and marketable securities. Moving on to our guidance for 2021. We are reiterating revenue, COGS, R&D and SG&A guidance for the year. We remain confident in our full year guidance for Jakafi based on our continued recovery of new patient starts and the approval in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD. 
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A."

First thing I'd like to say is that I realized I said that we were going to ship in my prepared remarks, 300 tubes of Opzelura in the first 4 weeks. And of course, I meant 3,000 tubes, which would actually make it on par or better than the last 2 launches in atopic dermatitis. 
So we expect those 3,000 shipments to pharmacies to actually translate into more than 3,000 prescriptions in the first full 4 weeks of our launch. So what patient population are they really looking at it? It's just the indication essentially patients who are 12 years or older. There's no difference. I've spoken to many dermatologists, spoken to many dermatologists and they're confident that they can use this drug in teens all the way up to the older adults. 
So the biggest roadblock patient access is always an interesting problem at the beginning of the launch. But in fact, I think we're making great headway there. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I think we will, in fact, have broad coverage in the first quarter of next year. As you know, when new products are launched, particularly products like this in dermatology, sometimes the big PBMs will just block you for 6 months or more. 
And we think we can overcome that as quickly as possible. We've presented many times to payers across the country, big and small payers with our clinical data, and they're really impressed by the value that Opzelura will provide to these patients. 
So even though it is always a barrier or worried about patient access, I think we're going to be fine in the relatively near future. As you know, in fact, when they start a new year is really when you want to ensure that your formulary is fully blown out and all of your customers know exactly what's going to be covered and what's on the formulary. So we think in the beginning of the year, we'll have good progress there."

Our biggest competition is really watch and wait. So getting physicians to fully understand the survival benefit that Jakafi offers to myelofibrosis patients is really what our challenge is, and we know we're making headway all the time. 
As I said in my -- at the beginning of my prepared remarks that myelofibrosis, PV, GVHD, the standard of care is Jakafi and will continue to be that way. PV patients, same thing. They continue to grow year after year, month after month. And GVHD, especially for chronic GVHD, we know is going to grow very well. Those patients are -- the prevalence of those patients are greater than the prevalence of acute GVHD patients and the chronic GVHD patients stay on for a much longer period of time.

Firstly, I'll start with L2, which is a mechanism now we have data in hand that we understand in more and more. So if you look at iron metabolism in humans, hepcidin, the way it works is high levels of hepcidin inhibit iron absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and stop its release from macrophages. 
So there's less iron available to make red blood cells. If you are able to inhibit that hepcidin pathway through an ALK2 inhibitor, irons released and made available, both from absorption and both from macrophages to make new red blood cells. And we've shown that this compound does that from a mechanism of action point of view. 
So where we are? So we're very excited about its potential. We completed the monotherapy safety and then the combo safety, and then we'll be ready to make more decisions on the path forward in terms of more pivotal studies, which, let me remind you, which I've said repeatedly, will hopefully address both the anemia of the underlying disorder, which we think is hepcidin-mediated plus the anemia induced by ruxolitinib, which we also think is hepcidin-mediated. 
And if we achieve both of those, you'll get the safety aspect and less discontinuations when it works, and then maintain ruxolitinib dose and enhance efficacy. So the program really has a lot of potential. We hope to have a recommended Phase II combo dose ready to go early next year and then make those decisions. 
For the BET program, again, a compound we've had in our hands for a long time, years ago, we dosed it to much higher multiples in patients with solid tumors and the dose-limiting toxicity there, as we know with BET inhibitors was on target and was thrombocytopenia. 
We're now dosing it at 20%, 25% of where we were before gathering monotherapy safety in myeloproliftive neoplasm patients and then combo safety, and then well, again, just like with the old program, have to make decisions on where to go, looking at the competitive space as well. Would we be looking given its profile, it suboptimal patients and in addition, would we consider first line? So those data sets for the mono safety and the combo safety will be available in 2022. And as soon as we're ready and put up on clintrials.gov, we'll be able to show you our clinical programs there, but we're comfortable where they are at the moment."

So what we're thinking about the gross to net is that what we said in the past is that long term, we anticipate the gross to net to be 25% to 50%. But in this quarter, in particular, and then as we move into next year, the gross to net will be much higher just because of the NDC blocks and the patient assistance programs that we provide, the co-pay assistance. 
And as you know, in this therapeutic category, over time, the use of those programs declines as there's more broader coverage. So our gross to net will continue to improve. For vitiligo, maybe I'll start out and hand over to Steven. We know it's going to be greater. 
I think we've forecasted, perhaps we said that we think in atopic dermatitis, 3 or more tubes will be used per year, 10 tubes per year, perhaps for vitiligo.

So some products are typically cancer product. 
But many of the products targeted therapies type of product, antibodies, et cetera, but many of the mechanisms we are studying in fact, have application outside of cancer. And that's where it started. And what we see today, when you look at the 10-plus mechanisms that we are studying in early studies is that they can have applications outside of cancer. That's what we found with PI3-kinase delta in hemolytic anemia. 
That's what we see in many dermatology indications. So the goal is really to continue on that sort of follow the science type of approach and obviously because dermatology of the skin is the largest immune organ I guess, we see a lot of applications in dermatology in the short term, but it could also go in other type of inflammatory immune type of disease.

There's still questions to be asked and addressed in vitiligo, including the -- what happens with -- in patients on for the long term with with really good improvements in facial VASI19 and beyond and what happens withdrawal in those situations. And then beyond those indications, as Herve was alluding to, given the mechanism of action of the cream in terms of JAK-STAT pathway, there are a number of other indications that we're extremely interested in addressing, which are actually relatively from an R&D point of view, certainly with an oncology context, really easy to study in terms of time. 
So stay tuned. We view this now as a life cycle management opportunity with a scale that we can address in a very, very efficient manner. And then because derm, as you also -- as others have said, they've alluded to has become really important to Incyte both from R&D and then a commercial point of view, it's beyond in terms of other compounds. 
So I alluded to in my prepared remarks with 54707 are relatively JAK1-specific oral inhibitor that there are other indications for which we already have really good Phase II data in hidradenitis suppurativa. We have an ongoing Phase IIb there in approximately 200 patients that will deliver data next year and then we can make a decision on what to do from a pivotal aspect. 
We're studying that compound in prurigo nodularis, Again, the mix of action is very relevant there. And then in my prepared remarks, for a nonsegmental vitiligo with body surface areas of total body surface area involvement of 8% or greater we think the risk benefit may well be favorable on oral JAK there. So you can see the derm thinking from an R&D point of view has expanded in an appropriate proportional way, and it's relatively efficient to do. So thanks for the question."

So they know that, for example, the safety profile between oral JAK inhibitor and a topical JAK inhibitor is going to be very different. So they're very comfortable with that. As I said before, I've spoken to many dermatologists. We've gotten a lot of feedback from the field. There really hasn't been a pushback on the types of patients that are going to use this Opzelura. 
So it's approved for the indication from 12 and over, and that's what they're telling us they're going to use it for.

Thanks for your questions. On the parsaclisib acceptance of filing, so it's one of the biggest submissions I've ever been involved in, in a positive way because we submitted all 3 indications at the same time with the entire package realizing that diseases, although under the umbrella of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, in general, are different in terms of some of their pathophysiology and the way they behave. 
And that's exactly what happened in terms of the review cycles you allude to. So for both marginal zone and mantle zone lymphoma, given the unmet medical need there, the FDA felt that they warrant a priority review and also given the data we've seen. For follicular, I think their feeling is maybe it's a little more of a crowded space, less unmet medical need. But also -- and I think very importantly, it's a condition that they want long, long-term follow-up in terms of the responders. 
And I think that's what's driving the review cycle there being lengthened. Obviously, our intent is to try and match these through all at the same time and get them approved at the same time. But if they end up separating out follicular to get longer follow-up on the responders, I think that's what's driving the standard review cycle there. In terms of your second question, I think you were alluding to pemigatinib tumor agnostic program, our IFGFR inhibitor, and we had a tumor-agnostic study underway for patients either with FGFR2-driven arrangements or FGFR3 or any others. And what we saw within that program, although early in small numbers is some encouraging signals in certain areas like glioblastoma that felt to be more FGFR3-driven, and like some areas of non-small cell lung cancer that were more FGFR2-driven. 
And we felt that the likelihood of getting a wide tumor-agnostic indication was perhaps more limited and it was more efficient to stop the agnostic program enrolling across the board and go at those exactly at those 2 histologies directly. So there'll be Phase II studies underway in both glioblastoma multiforme, that's FGFR3-driven, and in non-small cell lung cancer.  That's FGFR2 driven. And then for your Minjuvi Polivy question, I'll turn it to Barry."

We think -- well, first of all, we're approved in the second-line setting for a few large diffuse DLBCL patients. And we really think that our profile is always going to be attractive to patients and to physicians. In fact, perhaps, as you know, Polivy reported over the last 2 quarters that their sales have declined. And we actually believe that because we're continuing to make inroads there, but Polivy approved in the third-line setting were approved in the second line setting. 
As far as moving to the first line for Polivy, if they do move to the first line, we haven't seen the data yet. But that wouldn't bother us it actually gives us more faith that our frontline trial will be positive for these patients. And that even if they're in the first-line setting before we get there, we'd be the choice for the -- in the second-line setting going forward. But we really believe that if their study is positive in combination with R-CHOP, our study could be positive in combination with R-CHOP."

They're going to make sure that, in fact, patients have insurance coverage or they have access to the drug before they're going to order this from the wholesalers. So I don't think there's very much inventory there at all. Obviously, there's inventory at each of the wholesaler sites that will eventually go out to pharmacies. 
In fact, most of these pharmacies are independent pharmacies. So pharmacies that are very used to working with dermatologists as there is that's most of their practice. So that's actually very encouraging because the dermatologists like to work with their local pharmacy that's experienced in working with dermatologists. 
As far as the pemigatinib goes, Pemazyre  goes and the cholangiocarcinoma market in the United States, sure, there's growth opportunities there. Obviously, we have a first-line study moving into the first-line setting would actually mean a whole lot to us. 
That we know that there's -- patients are being tested for FGFR2 alterations and rearrangements.  But there could be more patient tests. So the more patients that are tested identify that they might have this FGFR2 alterations, then they would be candidates for Pemazyre.  So I think there is growth there. But it is, as you know, a very small patient population. And as far as the lung cancer patient population to go, we'll have to see. We'll have to see how many patients actually do have and FGFR alterations in lung cancer. And we'll see what the future opportunity is there as we continue to roll out our studies."

I'm happy to report today an important quarter for Incyte. But before we do that, I would like to take a moment to speak about the significant transformation our company has undergone over the past 2 years",550,"Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to report today an important quarter for Incyte. But before we do that, I would like to take a moment to speak about the significant transformation our company has undergone over the past 2 years.  
From the third quarter of 2019 to today, Incyte has more than doubled its number of approved products from 3 to 7 and has increased the number of approved indications from 5 to 12, a significant achievement for patients around the world. Within the same time period, quarterly product and royalty revenues have grown nearly 50% from $534 million to $778 million in the most recent quarter. This $778 million in product and royalty revenue for Q3 2021 does not yet reflect revenue contribution from our 2 most recent U.S. approval. Opzelura in atopic dermatitis and Jakafi in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD. In addition, we expect further growth from the recent approvals of Pemazyre in Europe and Japan and Minjuvi in Europe, where the launch is ongoing in Germany and will expand to other countries as reimbursement is secured.  
As you see on Slide 5, we have provided long-term guidance for some of these products and there is significant upside to the current sales number. Within hematology/oncology, our MPN/GVHD franchise, which includes Jakafi and other innovation is expected to surpass $3 billion in peak sales. Additionally, Monjuvi approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL has the potential to reach $500 million in this indication in the U.S.  
While we have not provided guidance in Minjuvi, Pemazyre  and Iclusig, this product represents additional growth potential and generate further value to our business. 
Turning to dermatology. Over the past year, we have successfully established our dermatology commercial franchise in the U.S. Given the product profile of Opzelura and the transit commercial team we have in place,  we are confident in the potential for Opzelura and we expect peak sales to reach at least $1.5 billion in the United States in atopic dermatitis.  
While still very early in the launch of Opzelura, the initial uptake has been strong, and Barry will be providing details in his prepared remarks. Looking ahead in 2 other areas of our portfolio, we are anticipating multiple regulatory decision in 2022, including ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo in both the U.S. and Europe, parsaclisib in 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma indication in the U.S. as well as once-daily ruxolitinib late in 2022 or early 2023.  
This 2022 regulatory decision which closely follow multiple product approval in 2021, position us well for further growth and diversification of our product revenues in the coming year. Our partners are also making headway with Novartis, ruxolitinib is currently under review in Europe and Japan for acute and chronic GVHD. And capmatinib is under review in Europe for non-small cell lung cancer.  
In addition, Lilly is planning to submit an sNDA to the FDA for baricitinib in alopecia areata by the end of this year. If approved, these opportunities will provide valuable growth to our royalty revenues, which have already surpassed $400 million during the first 9 months of this year.  
We have seen 2021 has been an important year of commercial, clinical and regulatory success for Incyte. With that, I will hand over to Barry to cover the individual product performance."

Jakafi sales grew 12% year-over-year to reach $547 million for the quarter. And we are reiterating our full year guidance range of $2.125 billion to $2.17 billion. Jakafi was first approved -- was the first ap",918,"Thank you, Herve, and good morning, everyone. Jakafi sales grew 12% year-over-year to reach $547 million for the quarter. And we are reiterating our full year guidance range of $2.125 billion to $2.17 billion. Jakafi was first approved -- was the first approved treatment in myofibrosis polycythemia vera and steroid-refractory acute GVHD. And years later, remains the standard of care in each of these indications.  
Growth across MF, PV and GVHD continues to be strong. And as you can see on the left, new patient starts have returned to pre-pandemic levels. With patients staying on therapy longer and new patients coming in, the total number of patients on Jakafi continues to increase year-over-year.  
Myelofibrosis patients, the largest proportion of patients on Jakafi comprised 45% of total patients, while polycythemia vera and GVHD patients accounts for 34% and 14% of total patients, respectively. At the end of September, Jakafi was approved for its fourth indication for the treatment of steroid-refractory chronic GVHD.  
To put this in this recent approval into perspective, approximately 2,000 patients with graft-versus-host disease are currently using Jakafi. The majority of whom have acute form of the disease. There are over 14,000 patients in the U.S. living with chronic GVHD, of which have required therapy beyond systemic corticosteroids.  We expect the recent approval to accelerate new patient starts with Jakafi. 
Turning to Slide 8. Monjuvi sales grew 22% sequentially to $22 million in the third quarter, with growth driven primarily by demand. We are seeing an increase in the number of total accounts across both academic and community settings, and there has been a swift shift towards adoption of Monjuvi earlier in the treatment paradigm.  
We now have a greater proportion of Monjuvi patients initiating therapy in the second line, which should result in patients experience in longer and more durable responses, leading to a longer duration of therapy. Feedback from health care professionals continues to be positive with efficacy, duration of response and safety being the key drivers of adoption. HCP awareness of Monjuvi's differentiated profile continues to increase and the L-MIND 3-year results have been well received by the physician community.  
As patients continue to return to the office and as our reps continue to educate health care professionals, on the clinical profile of Monjuvi, we are confident in our ability to build on this improving momentum.  
Turning to Slide 9. We are very excited to receive the approval of Opzelura, the first FDA-approved topical JAK inhibitor for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. Prior to launch, we had identified 11,000 dermatologists and high priority allergists.  The top 20% of which are responsible for nearly 80% of atopic dermatitis prescriptions.  
Our patient assistance programs are in place to help reduce the barriers to access for Opzelura and our negotiations with payers are advancing well. To date, we have made significant progress with our stakeholders in the launch of Opzelura. Since our launch on October 11, our field-based representatives have actively engaged with 76% of our target prescribers and have conducted 8,500 HCP calls in the first 3 weeks of launch, of which 95% are being conducted in person.  
We're also receiving a significant amount of interest in Opzelura from patients. And in the first 2 weeks of launch, we have approximately 61,000 unique website users, and this number continues to climb. Further highlighting, the level of engagement from patients, there were over 1,500 patient registrations for our co-pay card program.  
And lastly, on the payer front, our discussions with PBMs, which include the top 3, who account for nearly 80% of commercially insured patients in the U.S. have been very positive, as they realize the value proposition of Opzelura. As a result, we expect to secure a broad coverage in Q1 of next year.  
In the meantime, during this contracting period, we have multiple efforts underway to ensure patients are able to access their medication. Although it is still early in launch, our efforts are translating into the first signs of a very successful launch. As you know, there are limitations to the accuracy of script data, it's important to note that IQVIA's capture rate of prescriptions are under representative of actual demand, especially in the initial weeks of launch.  
Over time, the capture rate is expected to continue to improve. There are 2 different metrics that we are using to track performance consisting of new brand -- new-to-brand Rxs and 867 data. New Rx data shown on the left captures the patients who are either new to the market or have switched to Opzelura.  
In the first 2 weeks of launch, there have been close to 1,000 new-to-brand prescriptions with nearly 2/3 of scripts coming from patients who were previously on topical corticosteroid therapy. On the right-hand side, we are showing 867 data, which is the number of units of Opzelura 60-gram tubes that our wholesalers are shipping to pharmacies. While 867 data doesn't translate directly into scripts, we believe it captures demand appropriately given the low level of inventory retail pharmacies typically hold for specialty dermatology products.  
Pharmacies order Opzelura when a prescription is received and approved by the patient's insurance are processed through our patient access programs. In its third week of launch, 1,115 tubes of Opzelura was shipped by wholesalers, bringing the total shift since launch to over 2,200. Based on early data, we are now tracking towards 300-plus units shipped in the first 4 weeks of launch. Now I'll turn the call over to Steven for a clinical update."

The third quarter brought numerous achievements on both the clinical and regulatory fronts. Starting with the 3 recent regulatory approvals, Minjuvi was approved in Europe for second-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in August. In September, Opzelura was approved in the United States for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis, and Jakafi was approved in the United States for second-line chronic graft-versus-host disease. In addition to these regulatory milestones and successes, we presented pivotal data from our Phase III TRuE-V studies of ruxolitinib in Vitiligo at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.  
The full data set highlighted the significant improvements in facial and total body repigmentation seen in vitiligo patients after treatment with ruxolitinib cream. Also presented at EADV was positive pivotal data for baricitinib, our partnered product with Eli Lilly in alopecia areata. These data showed that treatment with once-daily baricitinib 4 milligrams was superior to placebo in achieving significant scalp hair regrowth at 24 weeks in adults with severe alopecia areata.  
We also announced the global collaboration with Syndax Pharmaceuticals, which is pending regulatory clearance to develop and commercialize axatilimab, an anti-CSF1 receptor monoclonal antibody for chronic graft-versus-host disease and other fibrotic diseases.  
Lastly, we recently announced the acceptance of the marketing authorization application by the European Medicines Agency for ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo  and yesterday, we announced that the FDA accepted the NDA for parsaclisib in 3 types of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.  
We received priority review for parsaclisib in 2 of the indications, including for relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma in adult patients who have received at least 1 prior anti-CD20-based regimen and for mantle cell lymphoma in adult patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy.  
The PDUFA date for these 2 indications is April 30, 2022. There will be a standard review for parsaclisib in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma in adult patients who have received at least 2 prior systemic therapies with a PDUFA target action date of August 30, 2022.  
Let me remind you the efficacy across non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma, response rate seen and independently reviewed were 57% with the duration of response in PFS not yet reached. In mantle cell lymphoma, this was a 71% response rate with the duration of response of 9 months and a PFS of 11.1 months.  
And in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma, there was a 75% overall response rate with a duration of response of 14.7 months and a PFS of 15.8 months. All this data is with a once-daily regimen of 2.5 milligrams.  
Remember, this drug was designed to avoid hepatotoxicity associated with first-generation PI3 kinase delta inhibitors. And thus, we have seen low rates of liver toxicity with less than a 5% rate of grade 3 ALT and AST elevations. In addition, cases of serious diarrhea and colitis were manageable and reversible.  
Turning to the next slide. The clinical development of parsaclisib in hemolytic anemia continues to progress with the Phase III study expected to start by the end of this year. The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of parsaclisib versus placebo with the primary endpoint of durable hemoglobin response at week 24. Patients must have a diagnosis of primary warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia.  Hemoglobin levels of 7 to 10 grams per deciliter and FACIT-F score of less than or equal to 43.  
This program represents another significant opportunity to address an unmet medical need where there are currently no approved therapies for patients. Moving to our LIMBER development program. We have multiple studies ongoing looking to improve upon the standard of care in myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera and graft-versus-host disease. We expect data and/or regulatory action for a few of these programs by the end of 2022, including the NDA submission for the once-daily formulation of ruxolitinib. We also recently entered into a collaboration with Syndax for axatilimab, an anti-CSF1 receptor monoclonal antibody, which is currently being evaluated as a monotherapy in third-line chronic graft-versus-host disease. 
In addition, we will have the opportunity to evaluate axatilimab as a combination therapy with our JAK inhibitors, where the ultimate goal would be to arrive at a safe and effective combination that could lead to a steroid-free regimen for chronic graft-versus-host disease. Turning to dermatology and ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo. The Phase III TRuE-V data presented at EADV showed meaningful superiority to vehicle with 30% of patients achieving a facial VASI75 at week 24, which is in line with our Phase II results.  
As a reminder, facial VASI75 response in the Phase II trial, continued to improve with ruxolitinib cream treatment with an over 51% response rate at week 52. We expect the 52-week data from the TRuE-V pivotal studies to be available in 2022.  
We are extremely encouraged by these positive results and the impact ruxolitinib cream may have for patients living with vitiligo in the United States and Europe. The MAA was recently validated by the European Medicines Agency and the U.S. sNDA is in progress.  
Turning to Slide 18 and an update on our dermatology programs. We continue to focus on developing our dermatology pipeline with ruxolitinib cream and INCB54707, an oral selective Janus Kinase 1 inhibitor. Multiple studies are ongoing with ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis, including TRuE-AD3, a pivotal trial in atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients.  
In addition to our TRuE-V program in vitiligo, we are also looking at 707 in a Phase II study in patients with nonsegmental vitiligo with a body surface area of greater than or equal to 8%. Additional studies for 707 are currently underway in other indications, including 2 Phase II trials in hidradenitis suppurativa and prurigo nodularis. We look forward to updating you on these programs next year.  
In closing, we had a very successful quarter with a number of clinical and regulatory accomplishments, including 3 approvals.  The FDA acceptance of an NDA for parsaclisib as a treatment for 3 types of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and the EMA acceptance of the MAA for ruxolitinib cream as a treatment for vitiligo.  
Later this week, we invite you to join an analyst and investor call to discuss our RO PD-L1 program, including data for 86550, which was accepted for presentation at the SITC Annual Congress on November 13.  
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update."

Our total product and royalty revenues for the third quarter were $778 million, representing a 25% increase over the third quarter of 2020. Total product and royalty revenues for the quarter are comprised of net product revenues of $547 million for Jakafi and $48 million for other hematology oncology products. 
Royalties from Novartis of $95 million for Jakafi and $3 million for Tabrecta and royalties from Lilly of $87 million from Olumiant. The 12% year-over-year growth in Jakafi net product sales reflects higher patient demand across all indications and a continued recovery of new patient starts as we continue to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The tripling of the Olumiant royalties is due primarily to the use of Olumiant  for the treatment of COVID-19. Per our agreement with Lilly for global network sales of Olumiant  for the treatment of COVID-19, we are entitled to receive royalties equal to the base double-digit rate applicable to all global net product sales, plus an additional 13% royalty. 
Moving on to our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Ongoing R&D expenses of $331 million for the third quarter increased 11% from the prior year period, primarily due to the progression of our pipeline. Our SG&A expense for the quarter of $191 million increased 58% from the prior year quarter primarily due to our investments related to the establishment of the new dermatology commercial organization in the U.S. and the related activities to support the launch of Opzelura for atopic dermatitis. 
Our collaboration loss for the quarter was $9 million, which represents our 50% share of the U.S. net commercialization loss for Monjuvi. This is comprised of total net product revenues of $22 million and total operating expenses, including COGS and SG&A expenses of $40 million. 
Finally, our financial position continues to be strong as we ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and marketable securities. Moving on to our guidance for 2021. We are reiterating revenue, COGS, R&D and SG&A guidance for the year. We remain confident in our full year guidance for Jakafi based on our continued recovery of new patient starts and the approval in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD. 
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A."

First thing I'd like to say is that I realized I said that we were going to ship in my prepared remarks, 300 tubes of Opzelura in the first 4 weeks. And of course, I meant 3,000 tubes, which would actually make it on par or better than the last 2 launches in atopic dermatitis. 
So we expect those 3,000 shipments to pharmacies to actually translate into more than 3,000 prescriptions in the first full 4 weeks of our launch. So what patient population are they really looking at it? It's just the indication essentially patients who are 12 years or older. There's no difference. I've spoken to many dermatologists, and they're confident that they can use this drug in teens all the way up to the older adults. 
So the biggest roadblock patient access is always an interesting problem at the beginning of the launch. But in fact, I think we're making great headway there. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I think we will, in fact, have broad coverage in the first quarter of next year. As you know, when new products are launched, particularly products like this in dermatology, sometimes the big PBMs will just block you for 6 months or more. 
And we think we can overcome that as quickly as possible. We've presented many times to payers across the country, big and small payers with our clinical data, and they're really impressed by the value that Opzelura will provide to these patients. 
So even though it is always a barrier or worried about patient access, I think we're going to be fine in the relatively near future. As you know, in fact, when they start a new year is really when you want to ensure that your formulary is fully blown out and all of your customers know exactly what's going to be covered and what's on the formulary. So we think in the beginning of the year, we'll have good progress there."

Our biggest competition is really watch and wait. So getting physicians to fully understand the survival benefit that Jakafi offers to myelofibrosis patients is really what our challenge is, and we know we're making headway all the time. 
As I said in my -- at the beginning of my prepared remarks that myelofibrosis, PV, GVHD, the standard of care is Jakafi and it will continue to be that way. PV patients, same thing. They continue to grow year after year, month after month. And GVHD, especially for chronic GVHD, we know is going to grow very well.

Firstly, I'll start with ALK2, which is a mechanism now we have data in hand that we understand in more and more. So if you look iron metabolism in humans, hepcidin, the way it works is high levels of hepcidin inhibit iron absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and stop its release from macrophages. 
So there's less iron available to make red blood cells. If you are able to inhibit that hepcidin pathway through an ALK2 inhibitor, irons released and made available, both from absorption and both from macrophages to make new red blood cells. And we've shown that this compound does that from a mechanism of action point of view. 
So where we are? So we're very excited about its potential. We completed the monotherapy safety and then the combo safety, and then we'll be ready to make more decisions on the path forward in terms of more pivotal studies, which, let me remind you, which I've said repeatedly, will hopefully address both the anemia of the underlying disorder, which we think is hepcidin-mediated plus the anemia induced by ruxolitinib, which we also think is hepcidin-mediated. 
And if we achieve both of those, you'll get the safety aspect and less discontinuations when it works, and then maintain ruxolitinib dose and enhance efficacy. So the program really has a lot of potential. We hope to have a recommended Phase II combo dose ready to go early next year and then make those decisions. 
For the BET program, again, a compound we've had in our hands for a long time, years ago, we dosed it to much higher multiples in patients with solid tumors and the dose-limiting toxicity there, as we know with BET inhibitors, was on target and was thrombocytopenia. 
We're now dosing it at 20%, 25% of where we were before gathering monotherapy safety in myeloproliftive neoplasm patients and then combo safety, and then well again, just like with the old program, have to make decisions on where to go, looking at the competitive space as well. Would we be looking -- given its profile, its suboptimal patients and in addition, would we consider first line? So those data sets for the mono safety and the combo safety will be available in 2022. And as soon as we're ready and put up on clintrials.gov, we'll be able to show you our clinical programs there, but we're comfortable where they are at the moment."

But in this quarter, in particular, and then as we move into next year, the gross to net will be much higher just because of the NDC blocks and the patient assistance programs that we provide, the co-pay assistance. 
And as you know, in this therapeutic category, over time, the use of those programs declines as there's more broader coverage. So our gross to net will continue to improve. For vitiligo, maybe I'll start out and hand over to Steven. We know it's going to be greater. 
I think we've forecasted, perhaps we said that we think in atopic dermatitis, 3 or more tubes will be used per year, 10 tubes per year perhaps for vitiligo.

I mean the whole idea from the beginning was that we do research and discovery of new products somewhere in between immunology, inflammation and cancer.

But many of the products targeted therapies type of product, antibodies, et cetera, but many of the mechanisms we are studying in fact, have application outside of cancer. And that's where it came -- that's where it started. And what we see today, when you look at the 10-plus mechanisms that we are studying in early studies is that they can have applications outside of cancer. That's what we found with PI3-kinase delta in hemolytic anemia. 
That's what we see in many dermatology indications. So the goal is really to continue on that sort of follow the science type of approach and obviously because dermatology of the skin is the largest immune organ I guess, we see a lot of applications in dermatology in the short term, but it could also go in other type of inflammatory immune type of disease.

The way we view in dermatology, and I'm glad you called the franchise, even from an R&D point of view, is absolutely not a one and done.

There's still questions to be asked and addressed in vitiligo, including the -- what happens with -- in patients on for the long term with really good improvements in facial VASI90 and beyond and what happens with withdrawal in those situations. And then beyond those indications, as Herve was alluding to, given the mechanism of action of the cream in terms of JAK-STAT pathway, there are a number of other indications that we're extremely interested in addressing, which are actually relatively from an R&D point of view, certainly with an oncology context, really easy to study in terms of time. 
So stay tuned. We view this now as a life cycle management opportunity with a scale that we can address in a very, very efficient manner. And then because derm, as you also -- as others have said, they've alluded it has become really important to Incyte both from R&D and then a commercial point of view, it's beyond in terms of other compounds. 
So I alluded to in my prepared remarks with 54707 are relatively JAK1-specific oral inhibitor that there are other indications for which we already have really good Phase II data in hidradenitis suppurativa. We have an ongoing Phase IIb there in approximately 200 patients that will deliver data next year and then we can make a decision on what to do from a pivotal aspect. 
We're studying that compound in prurigo nodularis. Again, the mix of action is very relevant there. And then in my prepared remarks, for a nonsegmental vitiligo with body surface areas of -- total body surface area involvement of 8% or greater, we think the risk benefit may well be favorable for an oral JAK there. So you can see the derm thinking from an R&D point of view has expanded in an appropriate proportional way, and it's relatively efficient to do so. Thanks for the question."

So it's approved for the indication from 12 and over, and that's what they're telling us they're going to use it for. In terms of combo use, I don't know. Sometimes they do cycle through -- dermatologist will cycle through different therapies as they're trying to control patients with atopic dermatitis, but we can't say in the future what they're going to do. 
In terms of vitiligo, it's a game changer. It can change patients' lives and how they feel about themselves. It's the only drug that will be approved for re-pigmentation of the skin, and we really think that's going to be something that patients and dermatologists health care providers who want to utilize because it is such a unique treatment and it's going to help maybe hundreds of thousands of patients, if not more, live a better life, I think."

Thanks for your questions. On the parsaclisib acceptance of filing, so it's one of the biggest submissions I've ever been involved in, in a positive way because we submitted all 3 indications at the same time with the entire package realizing that diseases, although under the umbrella of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, in general, are different in terms of some of their pathophysiology and the way they behave. 
And that's exactly what happened in terms of the review cycles you allude to. So for both marginal zone and mantle zone lymphoma, given the unmet medical need there, the FDA felt that they warrant a priority review and also given the data we've seen. For follicular, I think their feeling is maybe it's a little more of a product space, less unmet medical need. But also -- and I think very importantly, it's a condition that they want long, long-term follow-up in terms of the responders. 
And I think that's what's driving the review cycle there being lengthened. Obviously, our intent is to try and match these through all at the same time and get them approved at the same time. But if they end up separating out follicular to get longer follow-up on the responders, I think that's what's driving the standard review cycle there. 
In terms of your second question, I think you were alluding to pemigatinib tumor agnostic program, FGFR inhibitor, and we had a tumor-agnostic study underway for patients either with FGFR2-driven arrangements or FGFR3 or any others. And what we saw within that program, although early in small numbers, is some encouraging signals in certain areas like glioblastoma that felt to be more FGFR3-driven. And like some areas of non-small cell lung cancer that were more FGFR2-driven. 
And we felt that the likelihood of getting a wide tumor-agnostic indication was perhaps more limited and it was more efficient to stop the agnostic program enrolling across the board and go at those -- exactly at those 2 histologies directly. So there'll be Phase II studies underway in both glioblastoma multiforme, that's FGFR3-driven and in non-small cell lung cancer, that's FGFR2 driven. And then for your Monjuvi/Polivy question, I'll turn it to Barry."

We think -- well, first of all, we're approved in the second-line setting for a diffuse large -- diffuse DLBCL patients. And we really think that our profile is always going to be attractive to patients and to physicians. In fact, perhaps, as you know, Polivy reported over the last 2 quarters that their sales have declined. And we actually believe that because we're continuing to make inroads there, but Polivy approved in the third-line setting were approved in the second line setting. 
As far as moving to the first line for Polivy, if they do move to the first line, we haven't seen the data yet. But that wouldn't bother us. It actually gives us more faith that our frontline trial will be positive for these patients. And that even if they're in their first-line setting before we get there, we'd be the choice for the -- in the second-line setting going forward. But we really believe that if their study is positive in combination with R-CHOP, our study could be positive in combination with R-CHOP."

We think, in fact, we have a very good situation where from steroids all the way up to systemics, all of those patients for mild-to-moderate disease. This will be the drug to use for them. And we know that thousands and thousands of patients have already failed steroids, so the patient population is just there for us to -- for them to begin to utilize a drug with the profile that Opzelura has.

I think all of those tube shipped to pharmacies will be turned in prescriptions. The reason is simply that a drug like this, they don't keep on their shelf for a long period of time. 
They're going to make sure that, in fact, patients have insurance coverage or they have access to the drug before they're going to order this from the wholesalers. So I don't think there's very much inventory there at all. Obviously, there's inventory at each of the wholesaler sites that will eventually go out to pharmacies. 
In fact, most of these pharmacies are independent pharmacies. So pharmacies that are very used to working with dermatologists as there is -- that's most of their practice. So that's actually very encouraging because the dermatologists like to work with their local pharmacy that's experienced in working with dermatologists. 
As far as the pemigatinib goes -- Pemazyre goes and the cholangiocarcinoma market in the United States, sure, there's growth opportunities there. Obviously, we have a first-line study moving into the first-line setting would actually mean a whole lot to us. 
That we know that there's -- patients are being tested for FGFR2 alterations and rearrangements.  But there could be more patient tests. So the more patients that are tested identify that they might have this FGFR2 alterations, then they would be candidates for Pemazyre.  So I think there is growth there. But it is, as you know, a very small patient population. And as far as the lung cancer patient population to go, we'll have to see. We'll have to see how many patients actually do have an FGFR alterations in lung cancer. And we'll see what the future opportunity is there, as we continue to roll out our studies."
