Along with Bryan joining me on this morning's call is Mike Silveira, Waters' Vice President, Controller and Interim CFO. Some of you may already know Mike, who has been a part of the Waters finance organizatio",1766,"Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Along with Bryan joining me on this morning's call is Mike Silveira, Waters' Vice President, Controller and Interim CFO. Some of you may already know Mike, who has been a part of the Waters finance organization for 16 years. And I'm happy to have him joining me on this morning's call.
I would like to start by thanking our employees around the globe for their hard work and dedication through what has been an extraordinarily difficult year. It is one that has brought significant change and sacrifice. From navigating the pandemic and resulting short-term cost-saving initiatives earlier this year to changes in leadership, the Waters team has responded with drive, determination and an indomitable spirit. I am impressed by and grateful for our team's resilience and commitment to our customers and to each other.
During today's call, I will provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year operating results as well as an update on the stabilization that we have seen in the LC market and a few factors influencing our thinking for 2021. Mike will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our first quarter and full year financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.
Briefly reviewing our operating results for the fourth quarter, revenue grew 10% as reported, 7% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted earnings per share grew 14%. For the full year, revenue declined 2% and adjusted earnings per share was up 1%. This strong finish to the end of a challenging year was driven by the pharmaceutical market improvement, capital spending recovery in the second half of the year, strong execution and early contributions from our near-term growth initiatives.
Looking more closely at our top line results. First, from a customer perspective. Our largest market category pharma was the primary growth driver in the quarter with 15% growth. Our industrial market grew 5% while academia and government declined 15%.
Now to geography. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia were up 12%, with China up 19%. Meanwhile, sales in the Americas grew 3% with the U.S. growing 4%, and European sales grew at 6%. 
From a product perspective, our Waters-branded products and services grew approximately 8% and by around 1% on a constant currency basis.
While still navigating the global pandemic, we are seeing clear signs of improving customer activity, positive growth trends in our recurring revenues and an evidence of stabilization in LC instrument demand. Services grew 10%, while consumables business grew approximately 14%, driven largely by global pharma strength, including sales of our recently launched PREMIER Columns, which performed exceedingly well in the first quarter on the market.
LC instruments most -- grew across most of our major geographies with high single-digit growth. This improvement in capital equipment purchasing reflects the combination of the return of some of the planned capital spending that was delayed from the first half of the year, a normal pharma year-end budget flush and early contributions from our LC replacement initiative.
Following last June's release of the Arc HPLC system in the core HPLC market, with a particular focus on the small molecule development and QA/QC space, we look forward to the continued expansion of our liquid chromatography portfolio. On February 10, we will launch ACQUITY PREMIER, a next-generation UPLC system that offers customers an extraordinary breakthrough in efficiency, sensitivity and overall capability. This new system will benefit both large and small molecule discovery and development as well as biomedical research. This new system has even more profound benefits when paired with our ACQUITY PREMIER Columns, which I mentioned earlier
and were launched in the fourth quarter. The combined solution will alleviate nonspecific binding absorption losses and provide a significant leap forward with enhanced reproducibility, reduced  reduced passivation and an increased confidence in analytical results.
After a very strong third quarter, mass spec sales were about flat in Q4. As you know, the mass spec business can be lumpy, which we saw with biomedical research. There are -- there was also a general softness in clinical diagnostics as budgets were diverted to COVID-19 testing. Notably, however, mass spec sales to pharma customers grew double digits, driven by the strong double-digit growth of both BioAccord and the QDa.
Finally, the TA, revenues declined low single digits, which was much improved from earlier in the year. We saw the core thermal business start to pick up, driven by market improvement in Asia. In particular, life sciences, including pharma and medical devices, grew double digits. Combined, these comprised approximately 10% to 15% of TA's total revenues. However,  this was not enough to offset declines from TA's industrial customers.
Looking now at our geographies. All major regions grew. The Americas grew low single digits, Europe grew mid-single digits, and Asia grew double digits. In the U.S., the growth was driven by pharma, which was partially offset by declines in material science, environmental and academic and government. Though Latin America continued to decline, it improved meaningfully relative to earlier in the year.  Europe also experienced strong pharma performance, partially offset by material science, food and academic and government. In both U.S. and Europe, pharma growth was broad-based, including strength in big pharma, large molecule customers, generics and contract labs. China had an impressive quarter with strong double-digit growth, driven by continuing acceleration in pharma as well as strong environmental growth. The pharma growth was driven by both small and large molecule customers, including particularly strong growth at contract labs. India also continued to grow double digits.
In summary, overall, in the fourth quarter, we saw further relative strength in the market and benefited from strong year-end spending trends. Now for the year, our pharmaceutical market category achieved 1% growth with the U.S., Europe and India all seeing positive growth. Industrial declined 3% for the full year, and academic and government declined 16%. Notably, our pharma market category grew 10% in the second half compared to the first half decline of 8%, owed in part to strength in small molecules, the industry recovered from lockdowns. Industrial also grew in the second half at 4%, while academic and government declined 12% compared to the first half declines of 10% and 22%, respectively.
Geographically, for the year, Asia sales were down 4% with China sales down 8%. Sales in Americas were down 4%, with the U.S. down 2%. Europe sales were up 2%. Notably, all our major geographies grew in the second half of the year, with the U.S. up 4% and Europe up 6%, following first half declines of 9% and 3%, respectively. Our China market grew in the second half, up 11%, reversing much of its sharp 31% decline in the first half of the year.
Now I would like to share some of the progress we've made in our transformation program as several of the initiatives we're putting into action are starting to contribute to growth.
First, I will talk about our instrument replacement initiative, then our progress in contract lab expansion, followed by e-commerce. And lastly, I'll give you a BioAccord update.
First, as it relates to our instrument replacement initiative, which is the most advanced initiative underway, we delivered our first quarterly LC instrument revenue growth in 2 years, and our LC instrument win/loss was the highest it has been in 3 years. Initial customer feedback has been very positive on the Arc HPLC as well.
Second, as part of our contract lab expansion initiative, we have made important progress in targeting this high-growth customer group. We have contacted a number of customers globally, particularly in China and have strengthened our value proposition with expanded alternative revenue and service offerings, which have been well received by this segment. It is still early days, but we're pleased with the progress we're making.
Third, our e-commerce initiative is still in the early stages, but waters.com traffic is up double digits, driven by search engine optimization and paid search. While there isn't a 1:1 relationship between traffic and revenue, increased traffic is an important first step in driving revenue growth through the e-commerce channel.
In tandem with our e-commerce actions, we've also enhanced our e-procurement platform, on which we have expanded channel, our coverage of customers, leveraging this channel. This supported strong e-commerce [indiscernible] strong e-procurement growth, indicating that it's now easier to work with Waters.
Fourth, driving launch excellence. BioAccord sales exceeded expectations in the quarter as our market development efforts and our specialist sales model have started to take effect, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Many customers are increasingly adopting BioAccord for manufacturing and several have placed follow-on orders. Once we get BioAccord applications on an enterprise software platform, we believe we will be seeing more follow-on orders. More importantly, customer activity continues to be encouraging, which makes us optimistic about 2021. 
Lastly, I'd like to highlight our efforts to help mitigate the public health crisis. In addition to the significant efforts by our innovation response team, we're encouraged to see Waters consumables [ specked in on ] QA/QC methods for COVID vaccines and therapeutics. We're also seeing an uptick in COVID-driven demand for our instruments and consumables. This peaked in the fourth quarter, where COVID revenues contributed an estimated 1 to 2 percentage points to the growth, driven by those pharmaceutical customers developing COVID vaccines and therapeutics, who saw meaningfully higher growth than manufacturers that don't have COVID-related programs.
In summary, as I wrap up for 2020, we've done a great job at keeping our employees safe and our operations running. Our teams are focused not only on getting products out the door, but we have also assisted our customers engage in COVID-related efforts. Meanwhile, our base business is showing signs of recovery, and our transformation is well underway.
Turning to 2021. While the business environment remains uncertain, we look forward to building on the fourth quarter momentum. Mike will provide further details on our outlook for 2021, which is based on 3 key factors. One, we're assuming a gradual improvement in customer activity led by the pharma market. Two, we expect all major geographies to perform better than they did in 2020 led by growth in China. Lastly, our  near-term growth initiatives  are  expected to continue  to ramp up, led by our LC replacement initiative, which we  expect to increasingly contribute to performance.  
  
With that, I'd like to turn the call over  to Mike Silveira for a deeper review of the fourth quarter and 2020 financials and our outlook for 2021. Mike?"

In the fourth quarter, we recorded net sales of $787 million, an increase of approximately 7% in constant currency. Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 3%, resulting in sales growth of 10% as reported. For the full year, sales declined about 2% in constant currency and as reported.
Looking at product line growth. Our recurring revenue, which represents the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue, increased by 11% in the quarter while instrument sales increased 4%. For the full year, recurring revenue grew 3% while [indiscernible] sales declined 9%. Chemistry revenue were up 14% in the quarter, driven by strong pharma growth. On the service side of our business, revenues were up 10% as customers continue to reopen labs, catch up on our performance maintenance and professional services and repair visits.
As we noted last quarter, recurring sales were impacted by 2 additional calendar days in the quarter, which resulted in a slight increase in service revenue sales. Looking ahead, there are 5 additional calendar days in the first quarter and 6 fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 2020.
Breaking fourth quarter product sales down further. Sales related to Waters-branded products and services grew 8% while sales of TA-branded products and services declined 1%. Combined LC and LC-MS instrument sales were up 5% while TA Systems sales declined 4%.
Now I'd like to comment on our fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 59.2%, an increase compared to the 58.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to the higher sales volume in FX. On a full year basis, gross margin was 57.4% compared to 58% in the prior year on lower overall sales volumes in 2020. 
Moving down the fourth quarter P&L. Operating expenses increased by approximately 6% on a constant currency basis and 8% on a reported basis. The increase was primarily attributed to variable expenses related to the strong sales performance. For the year, operating expenses were 1% lower before currency translation and flat after.
In the quarter and for the full year, our effective operating tax rate was 14.9% and 14.8%, respectively, an increase from last year as the comparable period included some favorable discrete items. Net interest expense was $7 million for the quarter, a decrease of about $3 million, as anticipated on lower outstanding debt balances.
Our average share count came at 62.5 million shares, a reduction of approximately 3% or about 2 million shares lower than in the fourth quarter of last year. This is the result of shares repurchased through the end of the first quarter of 2020, subsequent to which we paused our share repurchase program.
Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter increased 14% to $3.65 in comparison to the $3.20 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $3.49 compared to $3.12 last year. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 1% at $9.05 per share versus $8.99 last year. On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share were $8.36 versus $8.69 in 2019.
A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning. 
Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. I would like to summarize our fourth quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excluding special items. In the fourth quarter of 2020, free cash flow grew 52% year-over-year to $240 million after funding $47 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $19 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation. In the fourth quarter, this resulted in $0.30 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. For the full year in 2020, free cash flow generation was $726 million after funding $172 million of capital expenditures. This represents a 26% increase and $31 million per dollar of sales converted into free cash flow.
Excluded from free cash flow was $70 million related to our investment in our Taunton chemistry operation and a $38 million transition tax payment related to the 2017 U.S. tax reform. Our increased free cash flow is primarily a result of our cost actions -- cost-saving actions and improvements in our cash conversion cycle.
In the fourth quarter, accounts receivable days sales outstanding came in at 70 days, down 7 days compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Inventories decreased by $16 million in comparison to the prior quarter -- prior year quarter, reflecting stronger revenue growth and revised production schedules.
Waters maintains a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $443 million and debt of $1.4 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $913 million and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.1x at the end of the fourth quarter.
Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent: invest for growth, balance sheet strength and flexibility and return of capital to shareholders. We remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities. As such, our Board of Directors has approved a 2-year extension of our January 2019 share repurchase authorization that was set to expire last month. As of today, we have $1.5 billion remains available under the program for share repurchases.
As we look forward to the year ahead, I'd like to provide some broader context on our thoughts for 2021. The business environment remains uncertain, and we are assuming a gradual improvement in customer activity led by the pharma market. We expect all major geographies to perform better than they did in 2020, led by growth in China. Our outlook does not anticipate a return of lockdown seen in 2020. We had a 1% tailwind from COVID-related revenue in 2020, 3 quarters of which was in the second half of the year. We expect a similar revenue impact in 2021, including a 1% to 2% growth tailwind in Q1. We anticipate the first half growth tailwind will moderate through the remainder of the year. Improved execution on our near-term growth initiatives contributed to our fourth quarter growth, but quarter also benefited from capital spending that was delayed from the first half into the second half of the year, which we don't expect to continue in 2021.
The second half of 2021 will have to contend with a challenging comp resulting from a revenue shift that took place in 2020. These dynamics support full year 2021 guidance for constant currency sales growth of 5% to 8%. At current rates, the positive currency translation to 2021 sales growth is expected to be 1 to 2 percentage points.
Gross margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of 57.5% to 58.5%. Every year, we look to balance growth, investment and profitability. Accordingly, we expect 2021 operating margins of 28% to 29% based on a combination of growth investments, normalization of COVID-related cost actions and disciplined expense controls.
Moving now below the operating income line. Other key assumptions from our full year guidance are: net interest expense of $35 million to $38 million; a full year tax rate of between 15% and 16%, which includes our new 5-year tax agreement with Singapore that will expire in March 2026; a restart of our share repurchase program in 2021 that will result in an average diluted 2021 share count of 61 million to 61.5 million shares outstanding. Over the course of the year, we will evaluate share repurchase program and provide quarterly updates as appropriate. 
Rolling all of this together, on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are projected in the range of $9.32 to $9.57, which assumes a positive currency impact on full year earnings per share growth of approximately 3 percentage points.
Looking at the first quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 7% to 10%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to increase first quarter sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.60. At current rates, the positive currency impact on first quarter earnings per share growth is expected to be approximately 15 percentage points.

Assuming there are about 8,000 or so of them, we expect 10% to 15% of those to be replaced. The initiative in itself is off to an excellent start. I mean, we've contacted over 60% of those customers already, received rather positive feedback.
And I would say a couple of facts. One, our HPLC is, of course, helping quite a bit in the replacement. But what we've seen in Q4 is the highest win/loss ratio that we've seen in over 3 years for our LC instruments. So this bodes well for the initiative, and we're seeing rather positive uptake.
Second, you asked the question on PREMIER. We launched our PREMIER Columns in Q4. And these are especially designed for molecules that are -- that have affinity for metals. And we've designed a nonabsorptive surface, which increases the efficiency of the separation. And you'd say, well, what is the application, the application is actually squarely targeted towards larger molecules and oligonucleotides, and the uptake has been excellent. And I would say it's even -- it will get even more interesting when we take the technology and implement it across our UPLC instruments, which is ACQUITY PREMIER, and that's set to launch on February 10. The pre-market work has been very, very good. And I expect that to do just as well. So I hope that gives you more clarity on LC and also on PREMIER."

I would say, again, if you remember the turnaround plan was the first focus is on the short-term commercial momentum. I think you would agree that, that gives us freedom to act, then we get our processes and systems right, and then we focus on the portfolio. So there would be more to say about the portfolio in the future, but the current assessment suggest the following, right? 
First, if we just look at the instrument portfolio, our mass spec portfolio has been completely refreshed with 5 new launches in 2019 alone. And we've talked a lot about BioAccord, but also our tandem quad portfolio with the Xevo line has done quite well, especially if you look at the uptake for traditional Chinese medicine in China and small molecule organic testing with that portfolio. So the mass spec portfolio, both on tandem quad and high res, I feel good about. Of course, there's always more to do, but it's a very, very good start.
And if I move to LC, we talked a bit about Arc HPLC and PREMIER. Both are significant steps forward for our portfolio. And as I mentioned earlier, we are thinking of how to reimagine the LC instrument, especially in the QA/QC space, and there'll be more to say about that in the next few years. That program is well underway.
If I move into the consumables side, both for small and large molecule pharma, our portfolio is very well set. I won't speak much about the small molecule. I think that is well understood. But on the large molecule side, our ACQUITY columns, in particular, have been designed for large molecules. And these are for proteins, for peptides, for oligos. And now with the launch of PREMIER, that even strengthens the position further.
So across the portfolio, on the instrument side, on the consumable side and with service, we continue to look for better options. I believe we're doing -- we've done a lot. We're doing a fair bit to continue to refresh the portfolio. And going forward, I mean, there are, of course, things to do to enhance the portfolio, but I don't feel for a second that we are disadvantaged versus competition in the market. So I think, for the short term, I believe with the hand that we have, we can fight pretty well."

I think what we're doing differently from the past, which starts to show -- starts to pay dividends, is that we are using -- we know exactly where these instruments are. We've taken a look at the database. We've targeted our reps to those exact channels, to those exact customers.
And in addition, armed with Arc HPLC as a new product, in addition to a value proposition with PREMIER, we feel our full portfolio with the LC, with PREMIER, with our service offering is off to a good start in this replacement cycle. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, and I won't speculate too much on the future, but this data point looks good. And leading indicators in terms of orders also look rather good.

I mean, I think R&D, and having been a researcher myself for a good part of my career, I mean, we want to focus on fundamentals. We want to focus on technology development. And Waters is a technology-oriented company, so we'll stay true to the problem-solving that we have to do.
Now to some facts, right, if you look at the R&D productivity in recent times, the mass spec portfolio has been completely renewed, both on the high-res side as well as on the tandem quad side. And to provide you more color on the tandem quads, we're seeing very good uptake of those, in particular, as I mentioned earlier in China. We wanted to continue to work on our software on those tandem quads to even increase the uptake in pharma DMPK sort of areas as well. So I feel we have done a good job in refreshing the mass spec portfolio. And we also know what we need to get done specifically, and we are funding those programs very well, especially on the informatics side for mass spec.
BioAccord is another case in point. I mean, as you know, LC-MS and QA/QC is somehow of the holy grail in the industry to be able to take large molecules to the same place where small molecules are in release testing. And we have a robust and reliable instrument, BioAccord, which is starting to see very good uptake. And we have a really clear road map in increasing applications and improving the software on that front as well, and that's very well funded. 
If I now turn to the LC side. No, I mean we've redoubled our effort on that front both on the commercial side, but also on the R&D side, and it's a question of turning dollars to the right to the right programs. And there, on the consumables, in particular, I mean, the launch of PREMIER has been received very well in the market. We're expanding that technology into our full instrument space. And that should be -- that is something that the market is, I think, looking forward to have a nonabsorptive surface for full instruments. And there, again, there is a strong effort on the software side as well to take and power into the cloud and expand the applications there.
And then finally, if I turn to the service side, there, we are always looking at better value propositions. And here, it's not necessarily a product-based innovation, but it's a service-based innovation. Many of our customers are asking us for more flexible value propositions, especially when it comes to, I would say, almost a la carte service is based on their utilization, and we are offering those value propositions as well.
So I've gone on long, but just to give you a flavor that the R&D programs are based on specifics and not what appears to be popular. And we will not be shy in increasing that funding, and you'll hear more about that as we go forward."

And they've gone in and developed methods with these customers. And in many cases, we have follow-on orders as well.
And to just come back to the facts, I mean, for BioAccord, Q4 was the best quarter since its launch by severalfold. So we think this approach is working. Now in terms of what fraction of the total field force is specialty versus generalist, look, most of our reps have a technical training. And the reason Waters has been successful in the market for so long is because of our technical capabilities and how we are able to partner with our customers. And now we basically trained a few of them on specific methods. I would say we will continue to expand it. If it works more, we'll continue to expand that specialty field force for more complex applications, and BioAccord is just a start. I hope that gives you a bit more clarity. I don't want to quantify the fraction of field force on specialty. We will basically -- it's a pilot.

I mean, I'll give you a general answer to your second question and then let Mike give you a bit of specifics on how we're seeing the margin evolution.
In general, look, simple way to think about it is consumables and recurring revenues have a bit of a higher margin than instruments. And over time, instruments, as the demand rises, you can see more leverage in the P&L and you have higher units. So hence -- and you'll start to see better and better margins over time, so you start off with a side lower margin with instruments, and that goes up over time. And with consumables and informatics, you already see a nice starting point. And so launch of PREMIER, more informatic solutions, better service, definitely gave a lift, and instruments at the beginning might start off at a lower starting point, but then would go up rather rapidly as the demand goes up, and we're seeing that already in many of our platforms. So Mike, do you want to comment a bit more on the margins and the evolution, especially on the gross margins?"

One, how are you thinking about instrument growth versus reoccurring growth in 2021? And maybe if you -- if there's any comments on the strong 14% chemicals growth you saw in the fourth quarter, if that was -- how sustainable that sort of growth is?
And then the second question is just you previously have made some comments about seeing some of the largest orders in company history here recently. Was just wondering if you could provide any more color on if that was something you think is a change or sustainable? Or does it just happened to be kind of a one-off here in the most recent couple of months?"

First, on instrument growth versus recurring. You saw in the fourth quarter that recurring revenues were double digits. Instruments were mid-single digits. And I think, going forward, also, we -- I mean, if yo",481,"Steve, thank you for both of those questions. First, on instrument growth versus recurring. You saw in the fourth quarter that recurring revenues were double digits. Instruments were mid-single digits. And I think, going forward, also, we -- I mean, if you just think through what we are thinking, what we are hoping to see in the future, I mean we expect that pharma continues, and you should see a similar sort of mix going forward as well if pharma continues its strength. And as other end markets recover, we expect a bit of upside to it. And if you just turn a bit towards -- I think rather than giving you a ratio, let me give you a bit of specifics on how one could think about it. If you just take -- think of our applications in pharma for both small and large molecules, and let me just give you a bit of the portfolio that goes towards that, right? So for small molecules, I mean, as that rises, especially as generic consumption and products for COVID, especially therapeutics, small molecule therapeutics rise, we see our LC portfolio with Arc HPLC, in particular, going up. Then if you turn to large molecules, you can start with consumables. And then the reason I'm giving you the specifics is just to give you color that on both fronts there is reason to believe that we should see some optimistic development.
And on the consumable side, for large molecules, first, I mean, our ACQUITY columns for UPLC have been designed, in particular, for large molecules. This starts with proteins, with peptides, glycans and also oligos. With PREMIER getting launched first as a column, the technology has got very good traction, especially for oligonucleotide applications, and now it goes into the instrument space. So it's rather broad-based. If I just take the LC example, both on the UPLC side and the HPLC side. And for mass spec, as you already know, BioAccord and our QDa have done pretty well for large molecule applications in Q4. So really, really broad-based. I would not speculate on one or the other, but I would say, Q4 gives you a good indication of what we should see even going forward, if not better. 
Now in terms of large orders and to give you color on my comment on large orders previously, you see with the LC replacement initiatives we've had some customers come in and ask us to replace their full fleet, and that has resulted in some of the largest orders. And this is why I'm rather optimistic about this initiative. So that gives you more color.
On the chemicals piece, I'm not sure what you're referring to in the 14%. So I don't know, Mike, if you have any comments on that, I don't know what that is referring to the chemicals growth of 14%."

So first one, based on what you were saying there, and correct me if I'm wrong, it appears to me that the China pharma recurring revenue sales and especially columns and small molecules and then services grew very strongly in the quarter. Obviously, you highlighted the growth in China. So wondering what has changed in your approach in China in terms of commercial execution? Or is it largely market-driven growth that we are seeing some across the peers as well? So correct me if I'm wrong on any of those assumptions as to what I'm seeing.
And then that light also, were there any incentives in the fourth quarter that drove this growth in that geography?"

I mean, it grew slightly shy of 20% after, I would say, a very difficult first half of the year. And so we're very happy with the momentum, and largely led -- largely led by pharma both on the small molecule and large molecule side and a very broad-based growth across the portfolio, across instruments, both mass spec as well as LC, consumables and service, especially recurring revenues did [indiscernible] well, especially 
in the pharma, especially in the pharma segment. So I feel really good about that. In terms of changes, I mean, it goes back to what we talked about earlier, really focusing the field on what matters. And as I mentioned earlier, as soon as we utter the words LC, at Waters, we have a genuine enthusiasm across the organization. I mean we have not just our portfolio, but our service teams are state-of-the-art. So I think having the organization focus on LC, giving them Arc HPLC as a new product, and it was especially designed for China, in particular, right? So giving them Arc HPLC and PREMIER to go out and have these conversations with the LC customers has been a terrific initiative. 
Secondly, I also mentioned our CXO or our contract testing and contract research organization initiative. That's also done rather well in China. Our team has gone out to meet contract manufacturers. We've increased our penetration in contact testing organizations in the food segment. It's, again, one data point, but it's a good data point. I'm reluctant to start extrapolating too much, but it's a good data point that it gives us confidence that activity is at a higher level.
Now as far as incentives are concerned, they are no different than they have been in the past. It's just a question of focus. But giving the team's new products, giving them clarity on which customers to go after and working with them to succeed, I think, are the key success factors I would point to."

And China, look, we talked a bit about in the past about what had caused the slowdown, right? I mean, the slowdown was led by the food segment, but also a bit of a slowdown in pharma and our focus on pharma. So again, let me break it down a bit across the different initiatives with pharma. We expect our focus with LC with Arc HPLC, with the launch of Arc HPLC and PREMIER and the replacement initiative should give us good tailwinds in pharma going forward.
Second, for the food segment, we have really focused on expanding our coverage for the contract testing organizations. You remember, I mentioned we were a little bit late in following that trend. The team has gone and reached out to each and every one of those customers. And now we have to make sure that our value propositions work before we start to see meaningful growth in that area.
And then across clinical, China is one of those markets that in the past grew very well in that segment. I mean, this year, we've seen some headwinds, especially on -- especially due to the diversion towards COVID-19 testing. So I expect that to come back. So across the board, we see some good opportunities in China.
Now talking a bit of a higher level, in the pharma industry in China, if you look at the -- the latest 5-year plan, it calls for cost for having roughly 45% or so of the production for biopharmaceuticals occurring locally in China for China use. And today, that number is around 20 -- between 20% and 25%. So there's a commitment in the Chinese government and the Chinese economy to increase pharma consumption. So we feel rather well placed with our portfolio, with our commercial focus to go after the opportunity in pharma as well as in food.
And from a portfolio perspective, Arc HPLC was specifically designed for the Chinese LC market. Our tandem quad portfolio is doing rather well for traditional Chinese medicine and food testing and environmental testing in China. So I feel very good from a portfolio perspective and from a commercial perspective on the base we've set, but it's -- as I said, it's a good start. It's a start all the same. So we're a bit prudent about what we want to see."

Along with Bryan joining me on this morning's call is Mike Silveira, Waters' Vice President, Controller and Interim CFO. Some of you may already know Mike, who has been a part of the Waters finance organization for 16 years. And I'm happy to have him joining me on this morning's call. 
I would like to start by thanking our employees around the globe for their hard work and dedication through what has been an extraordinarily difficult year. It is one that has brought significant change and sacrifice. From navigating the pandemic and resulting short-term cost-saving initiatives earlier this year to changes in leadership, the Waters team has responded with drive, determination and an indomitable spirit. I am impressed by and grateful for our team's resilience and commitment to our customers and to each other. 
During today's call, I will provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year operating results as well as an update on the stabilization that we have seen in the LC market and a few factors influencing our thinking for 2021. Mike will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our first quarter and full year financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions. 
Briefly reviewing our operating results for the fourth quarter, revenue grew 10% as reported, 7% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted earnings per share grew 14%. For the full year, revenue declined 2% and adjusted earnings per share was up 1%. This strong finish to the end of a challenging year was driven by the pharmaceutical market improvement, capital spending recovery in the second half of the year, strong execution and early contributions from our near-term growth initiatives. 
Looking more closely at our top line results. First, from a customer perspective. Our largest market category, pharma, was the primary growth driver in the quarter with 15% growth. Our industrial market grew 5%, while academia and government declined 15%. 
Now to geography. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia were up 12%, with China up 19%. Meanwhile, sales in the Americas grew 3% with the U.S. growing 4%, and European sales grew at 6%.  
From a product perspective, our Waters-branded products and services grew approximately 8%, while TA declined by around 1% on a constant currency basis. 
While still navigating the global pandemic, we are seeing clear signs of improving customer activity, positive growth trends in our recurring revenues and an evidence of stabilization in LC instrument demand. Services grew 10%, while consumables business grew approximately 14%, driven largely by global pharma strength, including sales of our recently launched PREMIER Columns, which performed exceedingly well in the first quarter on the market. 
LC instruments grew most -- grew across most of our major geographies with high single-digit growth. This improvement in capital equipment purchasing reflects the combination of the return of some of the planned capital spending that was delayed from the first half of the year, a normal pharma year-end budget flush and early contributions from our LC replacement initiative. 
Following last June's release of the Arc HPLC System in the core HPLC market, with a particular focus on the small molecule development and QA/QC space, we look forward to the continued expansion of our liquid chromatography portfolio. 
On February 10, we will launch ACQUITY PREMIER, a next-generation UPLC system that offers customers an extraordinary breakthrough in efficiency, sensitivity and overall capability. This new system will benefit both large and small molecule discovery and development as well as biomedical research. This new system has even more profound benefits when paired with our ACQUITY PREMIER Columns, which I mentioned earlier and were launched in the fourth quarter. The combined solution will alleviate nonspecific binding absorption losses and provide a significant leap forward with enhanced reproducibility, reduced passivation and an increased confidence in analytical results.
After a very strong third quarter, mass spec sales were about flat in Q4. As you know, the mass spec business can be lumpy, which we saw with biomedical research. There are -- there was also a general softness in clinical diagnostics as budgets were diverted to COVID-19 testing. Notably, however, mass spec sales to pharma customers grew double digits, driven by the strong double-digit growth of both BioAccord and the QDa. 
Finally, QDa, revenues declined low single digits, which was much improved from earlier in the year. We saw the core thermal business start to pick up, driven by market improvement in Asia. In particular, life sciences, including pharma and medical devices, grew double digits. Combined, these comprised approximately 10% to 15% of TA's total revenues. However, this was not enough to offset declines from TA's industrial customers. 
Looking now at our geographies, all major regions grew. The Americas grew low single digits, Europe grew mid-single digits, and Asia grew double digits. In the U.S., the growth was driven by pharma, which was partially offset by declines in material science, environmental and academic and government. Though Latin America continued to decline, it improved meaningfully relative to earlier in the year. 
Europe also experienced strong pharma performance, partially offset by material science, food and academic and government. In both U.S. and Europe, pharma growth was broad-based, including strength in big pharma, large molecule customers, generics and contract labs. 
China had an impressive quarter with strong double-digit growth, driven by continuing acceleration in pharma as well as strong environmental growth. The pharma growth was driven by both small and large molecule customers, including particularly strong growth at contract labs. India also continued to grow double digits. 
In summary, overall, in the fourth quarter, we saw further relative strength in the market and benefited from strong year-end spending trends. Now for the year, our pharmaceutical market category achieved 1% growth with the U.S., Europe and India all seeing positive growth. Industrial declined 3% for the full year, and academic and government declined 16%. Notably, our pharma market category grew 10% in the second half compared to the first half decline of 8%, owed in part to strength in small molecules, the industry recovered from lockdowns. Industrial also grew in the second half at 4%, while academic and government declined 12% compared to the first half declines of 10% and 22%, respectively. 
Geographically, for the year, Asia sales were down 4%, with China sales down 8%. Sales in Americas were down 4%, with the U.S. down 2%. Europe sales were up 2%. Notably, all our major geographies grew in the second half of the year, with the U.S. up 4% and Europe up 6%, following first half declines if 9% and 3%, respectively. Our China market grew in the second half, up 11%, reversing much of its sharp 31% decline in the first half of the year. 
Now I would like to share some of the progress we've made in our transformation program as several of the initiatives we're putting into action are starting to contribute to growth. First, I will talk about our instrument replacement initiative, then our progress in contract lab expansion, followed by e-commerce. And lastly, I'll give you a BioAccord update. 
First, as it relates to our instrument replacement initiative, which is the most advanced initiative underway, we delivered our first quarterly LC instrument revenue growth in 2 years, and our LC instrument win/loss was the highest it has been in 3 years. Initial customer feedback has been very positive on the Arc HPLC as well. 
Second, as part of our contract lab expansion initiative, we have made important progress in targeting this high-growth customer group. We have contacted a number of customers globally, particularly in China and have strengthened our value proposition with expanded alternative revenue and service offerings, which have been well received by this segment. It is still early days, but we're pleased with the progress we're making. 
Third, our e-commerce initiative is still in the early stages, but waters.com traffic is up double digits, driven by search engine optimization and paid search. While there isn't a 1:1 relationship between traffic and revenue, increased traffic is an important first step in driving revenue growth through the e-commerce channel. 
In tandem with our e-commerce actions, we've also enhanced our e-procurement platform, on which we have expanded our coverage of customers, leveraging this channel. This supported strong e-commerce -- strong e-procurement growth, indicating that it's now easier to work with Waters.
Fourth, driving launch excellence. BioAccord sales exceeded expectations in the quarter as our market development efforts and our specialist sales model have started to take effect, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Many customers are increasingly adopting BioAccord for manufacturing and several have placed follow-on orders. Once we get BioAccord applications on an enterprise software platform, we believe we will be seeing more follow-on orders. More importantly, customer activity continues to be encouraging, which makes us optimistic about 2021.  
Lastly, I'd like to highlight our efforts to help mitigate the public health crisis. In addition to the significant efforts by our innovation response team, we're encouraged to see Waters consumables specked in on QA/QC methods for COVID vaccines and therapeutics. We're also seeing an uptick in COVID-driven demand for our instruments and consumables. This peaked in the fourth quarter, where COVID revenues contributed an estimated 1 to 2 percentage points to the growth, driven by those pharmaceutical customers developing COVID vaccines and therapeutics, who saw meaningfully higher growth than manufacturers that don't have COVID-related programs. 
In summary, as I wrap up for 2020, we've done a great job at keeping our employees safe and our operations running. Our teams are focused not only on getting products out the door, but we have also assisted our customers engaged in COVID-related efforts. Meanwhile, our base business is showing signs of recovery, and our transformation is well underway. 
Turning to 2021. While the business environment remains uncertain, we look forward to building on the fourth quarter momentum. Mike will provide further details on our outlook for 2021, which is based on 3 key factors. 
One, we're assuming a gradual improvement in customer activity led by the pharma market. Two, we expect all major geographies to perform better than they did in 2020 led by growth in China. Lastly, our near-term growth initiatives are expected to continue to ramp up, led by our LC replacement initiative, which we expect to increasingly contribute to performance. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Silveira for a deeper review of the fourth quarter and 2020 financials and our outlook for 2021. Mike?"

Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 3%, resulting in sales growth of 10% as reported. For the full year, sales declined about 2% in constant currency and as reported. 
Looking at product line growth. Our reoccurring revenue, which represents the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue, increased by 11% in the quarter, while instrument sales increased 4%. For the full year, reoccurring revenue grew 3%, while instrument sales declined 9%. Chemistry revenue were up 14% in the quarter, driven by strong pharma growth. On the service side of our business, revenues were up 10% as customers continued to reopen labs, catch up on performance maintenance, professional services and repair visits. 
As we noted last quarter, reoccurring sales were impacted by 2 calendar -- 2 additional calendar days in the quarter, which resulted in a slight increase in service revenue sales. Looking ahead, there are 5 additional calendar days in the first quarter and 6 fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. 
Breaking fourth quarter product sales down further. Sales related to Waters-branded products and services grew 8%, while sales of TA branded products and services declined 1%. Combined LC and LC-MS instrument sales were up 5%, while TA system sales declined 4%.

Gross margin for the quarter was 59.2%, an increase compared to the 58.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to the higher sales volume and FX. On a full year basis, gross margin was 57.4% compared to 58% in the prior year on lower overall sales volumes in 2020. 
Moving down the fourth quarter P&L. Operating expenses increased by approximately 6% on a constant currency basis and 8% on a reported basis. The increase was primarily attributed to variable expenses related to the strong sales performance. For the year, operating expenses were 1% lower before currency translation and flat after.
In the quarter and for the full year, our effective operating tax rate was 14.9% and 14.8%, respectively, an increase from last year as the comparable period included some favorable discrete items. Net interest expense was $7 million for the quarter, a decrease of about $3 million, as anticipated on lower outstanding debt balances.
Our average share count came in at 62.5 million shares, a reduction of approximately 3% or about 2 million shares lower than in the fourth quarter of last year. This is the result of shares repurchased through the end of the first quarter of 2020, subsequent to which we paused our share repurchase program.
Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter increased 14% to $3.65 in comparison to the $3.20 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $3.49 compared to $3.12 last year. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 1% at $9.05 per share versus $8.99 and last year. On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share were $8.36 versus $8.69 in 2019. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning. 
Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. I would like to summarize our fourth quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excluding special items. In the fourth quarter of 2020, free cash flow grew 52% year-over-year to $240 million after funding $47 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $19 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation. In the fourth quarter, this resulted in $0.30 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. For the full year in 2020, free cash flow generation was $726 million after funding $172 million of capital expenditures. This represents a 26% increase and $0.31 per dollar of sales converted into free cash flow.
Excluded from free cash flow was $70 million related to our investment in our Taunton chemistry operation and a $38 million transition tax payment related to the 2017 U.S. tax reform. Our increased free cash flow is primarily a result of our cost actions -- cost-saving actions and improvements in our cash conversion cycle.
In the fourth quarter, accounts receivable days sales outstanding came in at 70 days, down 7 days compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Inventories decreased by $16 million in comparison to the prior quarter -- prior year quarter, reflecting stronger revenue growth and revised production schedules. 
Waters maintains a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $443 million and debt of $1.4 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $913 million and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.1x at the end of the fourth quarter.
Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent: invest for growth, balance sheet strength and flexibility and return of capital to shareholders. We remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities. As such, our Board of Directors has approved a 2-year extension of our January 2019 share repurchase authorization that was set to expire last month. As of today, we have $1.5 billion remains available under the program for share repurchases.
As we look forward to the year ahead, I'd like to provide some broader context on our thoughts for 2021. The business environment remains uncertain, and we are assuming a gradual improvement in customer activity led by the pharma market. We expect all major geographies to perform better than they did in 2020, led by growth in China. Our outlook does not anticipate a return of lockdown seen in 2020. We had a 1% tailwind from COVID-related revenue in 2020, 3 quarters of which was in the second half of the year. We expect a similar revenue impact in 2021, including a 1% to 2% growth tailwind in Q1. We anticipate the first half growth tailwind will moderate through the remainder of the year. Improved execution on our near-term growth initiatives contributed to our fourth quarter growth, but the quarter also benefited from capital spending that was delayed from the first half into the second half of the year, which we don't expect to continue in 2021.
The second half of 2021 will have to contend with a challenging comp resulting from a revenue shift that took place in 2020. These dynamics support full year 2021 guidance for constant currency sales growth of 5% to 8%. At current rates, the positive currency translation to 2021 sales growth is expected to be 1 to 2 percentage points.
Gross margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of 57.5% to 58.5%. Every year, we look to balance growth, investment and profitability. Accordingly, we expect 2021 operating margins of 28% to 29% based on a combination of growth investments, normalization of COVID-related cost actions and disciplined expense controls.
Moving now below the operating income line. Other key assumptions from our full year guidance are: net interest expense of $35 million to $38 million; a full year tax rate of between 15% and 16%, which includes our new 5-year tax agreement with Singapore that will expire in March 2026; a restart of our share repurchase program in 2021 that will result in an average diluted 2021 share count of 61 million to 61.5 million shares outstanding. Over the course of the year, we will evaluate share repurchase program and provide quarterly updates as appropriate. 
Rolling all of this together, on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are projected in the range of $9.32 to $9.57, which assumes a positive currency impact on full year earnings per share growth of approximately 3 percentage points.
Looking at the first quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 7% to 10%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to increase first quarter sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.60. At current rates, the positive currency impact on first quarter earnings per share growth is expected to be approximately 15 percentage points.
Now I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?"

If you look at the HPLC to UPLC mix of our installed bases, I would say, roughly 53% to 47% HPLC to UPLC. And in terms of dimensionalizing it, remember, we talked about Alliance, in particular, instruments that are now unlimited service. Assuming there are about 8,000 or so of them, we expect 10% to 15% of those to be replaced. The initiative in itself is off to an excellent start. I mean we've contacted over 60% of those customers already, received rather positive feedback.
And I would say a couple of facts. One, our HPLC is, of course, helping quite a bit in the replacement. But what we've seen in Q4 is the highest win/loss ratio that we've seen in over 3 years for our LC instruments. So this bodes well for the initiative, and we're seeing rather positive uptake.
Second, you asked the question on PREMIER. We launched our PREMIER Columns in Q4. And these are especially designed for molecules that are -- that have affinity for metals. And we've designed a nonabsorptive surface, which increases the efficiency of the separation. 
And you'd say, well, what is the application? The application is actually squarely targeted towards larger molecules and oligonucleotides, and the uptake has been excellent. And I would say it's even -- it will get even more interesting when we take the technology and implement it across our UPLC instruments, which is ACQUITY PREMIER, and that's set to launch on February 10. The premarket work has been very, very good. And I expect that to do just as well. So I hope that gives you more clarity on LC and also on PREMIER."

So if I just now break it down. If our initiatives do better than planned, if other end markets recover and we continue to see COVID tailwind, we believe that we will be on the higher end of the guide. And that should set us up very nicely for the future.
As far as the LC instrument replacement cycle is concerned, we're in the early stages of the innings. I mean it's a good start, but it's a start all the same. I don't want us to get overconfident with one data point. I believe the execution is very good. We have a good feedback. We have good feedback from our customers. I do believe, especially with Arc HPLC, the launch of PREMIER, we'll continue to see strength in LC, but I would still want to remain prudent. So as I said, it's one data point.

I think you would agree that, that gives us freedom to act, then we get our processes and systems right, and then we focus on the portfolio. So there would be more to say about the portfolio in the future, but the current assessment suggest the following, right? 
First, if we just look at the instrument portfolio, our mass spec portfolio has been completely refreshed with 5 new launches in 2019 alone. And we've talked a lot about BioAccord, but also our tandem quad portfolio with the Xevo line has done quite well, especially if you look at the uptake for traditional Chinese medicine in China and small molecule organic testing with that portfolio. So the mass spec portfolio, both on tandem quad and high res, I feel good about. Of course, there's always more to do, but it's a very, very good start.
And if I move to LC, we talked a bit about Arc HPLC and PREMIER. Both are significant steps forward for our portfolio. And as I mentioned earlier, we are thinking of how to reimagine the LC instrument, especially in the QA/QC space, and there'll be more to say about that in the next few years. That program is well underway.
If I move into the consumables side, both for small and large molecule pharma, our portfolio is very well set. I won't speak much about the small molecule. I think that is well understood. But on the large molecule side, our ACQUITY Columns, in particular, have been designed for large molecules. And these are for proteins, for peptides, for oligos. And now with the launch of PREMIER, that even strengthens the position further.
So across the portfolio, on the instrument side, on the consumable side and with service, we continue to look for better options. I believe we're doing -- we've done a lot. We're doing a fair bit to continue to refresh the portfolio. And going forward, I mean, there are, of course, things to do to enhance the portfolio, but I don't feel for a second that we are disadvantaged versus competition in the market. So I think, for the short term, I believe with the hand that we have, we can fight pretty well."

And we've talked about this being a function of strong competitors really targeting Waters for a long time and finally making some progress, especially in disrupting typical replacement cycles where you would kind of have the home field advantage in placing the replacement box. I'm just wondering, where do you think you are in the process of taking steps to reverse these trends? How much investment in time is required pursuant to the reversal? And then keeping in mind that it was a pretty strong quarter, should we put much weight on Q4 results in the context of assessing your progress with these efforts?"

And our replacement",333,"Thanks, Doug. Look, it's a good quarter. It's a strong start to our initiatives and especially the LC initiative, which we've talked about a fair bit. The basic assumption is, and as you mentioned, is that there is a replacement cycle. And our replacement cycle of our instruments in the past is -- I mean, we knew about it, and we've been at it for a while, but I think the focus that we have now, and you'd say, ""Well, what are you doing differently?"" I think what we're doing differently from the past, which starts to show -- starts to pay dividends, is that we are using -- we know exactly where these instruments are. We've taken a look at the database. We've targeted our reps to those exact channels -- to those exact customers.
And in addition, armed with Arc HPLC as a new product, in addition to a value proposition with PREMIER, we feel our full portfolio with the LC, with PREMIER, with our service offering is off to a good start in this replacement cycle. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, and I won't speculate too much on the future, but this data point looks good. And leading indicators in terms of orders also look rather good.
Now in terms of how you should think about it in the future, I think I'd rather share the fact after we're done rather than speculating, but all I can say is the data points we have at this point in time look positive, both in terms of how the customers are receiving our value proposition and how we're targeting the customers. So I mean, in general, I would remind you that Waters is an LC company, right? Any time we do something on LC, our whole team, our sales team, our service team, gets super enthusiastic. And we're seeing some of that in the results. So I'll stop there. And of course, happy to answer any follow-ups."

And look, it's -- you somehow answered your question in the last comment. I mean we will not be reactionary to anything. I mean, I think R&D, and having been a researcher myself for a good part of my career, I mean, we want to focus on fundamentals. We want to focus on technology development. And Waters is a technology-oriented company, so we'll stay true to the problem-solving that we have to do.
Now to some facts, right, if you look at the R&D productivity in recent times, the mass spec portfolio has been completely renewed, both on the high-res side as well as on the tandem quad side. And to provide you more color on the tandem quads, we're seeing very good uptake of those, in particular, as I mentioned earlier. In China, we wanted to continue to work on our software on those tandem quads to even increase the uptake in pharma DMPK sort of areas as well. So I feel we have done a good job in refreshing the mass spec portfolio. And we also know what we need to get done specifically, and we are funding those programs very well, especially on the informatics side for mass spec.
BioAccord is another case in point. I mean, as you know, LC-MS and QA/QC is somehow the holy grail in the industry to be able to take large molecules to the same place where small molecules are in release testing. And we have a robust and reliable instrument, BioAccord, which is starting to see very good uptake. And we have a really clear road map in increasing applications and improving the software on that front as well, and that's very well funded. 
If I now turn to the LC side. I mean we've redoubled our effort on that front, both on the commercial side, but also on the R&D side and it's a question of turning dollars to the right to the right programs. And there, on the consumables, in particular, I mean, the launch of PREMIER has been received very well in the market. We're expanding that technology into our full instrument space. And that should be -- that is something that the market is, I think, looking forward to have a nonabsorptive surface for full instruments. And there, again, there is a strong effort on the software side as well to take Empower into the cloud and expand the applications there.
And then finally, if I turn to the service side, there, we are always looking at better value propositions. And here, it's not necessarily a product-based innovation, but it's a service-based innovation. Many of our customers are asking us for more flexible value propositions, especially when it comes to, I would say, almost a la carte service if based on their utilization, and we are offering those value propositions as well.
So I've gone on long, but just to give you a flavor that the R&D programs are based on specifics and not what appears to be popular. And we will not be shy in increasing that funding, and you'll hear more about that as we go forward."

I mean products that require a deeper explanation, products that could benefit from our customers being coached on how to use it, how to develop methods on them. And for BioAccord, in particular, and I'll just use that as an example, that's off to an excellent start, right? So we have our -- we have turned specialty reps, and we've created a specialty reps team and turned them towards specific customers, especially ones with large molecule and oligonucleotide applications. And they've gone in and developed methods with these customers. And in many cases, we have follow-on orders as well.
And to just come back to the facts, I mean, for BioAccord, Q4 was the best quarter since its launch by severalfold. So we think this approach is working. Now in terms of what fraction of the total field force is specialty versus generalist, look, most of our reps have a technical training. And the reason Waters has been successful in the market for so long is because of our technical capabilities and how we are able to partner with our customers. And now we basically trained a few of them on specific methods. I would say we will continue to expand it. If it works more, we'll continue to expand that specialty field force for more complex applications, and BioAccord is just a start. I hope that gives you a bit more clarity. I don't want to quantify the fraction of field force that are on specialty. We will basically -- it's a pilot that seems to be showing results, and we'll continue to expand as there are a larger number of customers and targets."

Excellent questions. I mean I'll give you a general answer to your second question and then let Mike give you a bit of specifics on how we're seeing the margin evolution.
In general, look, a simple way to think about it is consumables and recurring revenues have a bit of a higher margin than instruments. And over time, instruments, as the demand rises, you can see more leverage in the P&L and you have higher units. So hence -- and you'll start to see better and better margins over time, so you start off with a slightly lower margin with instruments, and that goes up over time. And with consumables and informatics, you already see a nice starting point. And so launch of PREMIER, more informatics solutions, better service definitely gave a lift. And instruments at the beginning might start off at a lower starting point, but then would go up rather rapidly as the demand goes up, and we're seeing that already in many of our platforms. So Mike, do you want to comment a bit more on the margins and the evolution, especially on the gross margins?"

So over time, over the next couple of years after a product is introduced, we're typically able to lower the cost to produce the product, which will help the margin significantly.

And then the second question is just you previously have made some comments about seeing some of the largest orders in company history here recently. Was just wondering if you could provide any more color on if that was something you think is a change or sustainable?

You saw in the fourth quarter that recurring revenues were double digits. Instruments were mid-single digits. And I think, going forward, also, we -- I mean, if you just think through what we are thinking, what we are hoping to see in the future, I mean we expect that pharma continues, and you should see a similar sort of mix going forward as well if pharma continues its strength. And as other end markets recover, we expect a bit of upside to it. And if you just turn a bit towards -- I think rather than giving you a ratio, let me give you a bit of specifics on how one could think about it. If you just take -- think of our applications in pharma for both small and large molecules, and let me just give you a bit of the portfolio that goes towards that, right? So for small molecules, I mean, as that rises, especially as generic consumption and products for COVID, especially therapeutics, small molecule therapeutics rise, we see our LC portfolio with the Arc HPLC, in particular, going up. Then if you turn to large molecules, you can start with consumables. And then the reason I'm giving you the specifics is just to give you color that on both fronts, there is reason to believe that we should see some optimistic development.
And on the consumable side, for large molecules first, I mean, our ACQUITY Columns for UPLC have been designed, in particular, for large molecules. This starts with proteins, with peptides, glycans and also oligos. With PREMIER getting launched first as a column, the technology has got very good traction, especially for oligonucleotide applications, and now it goes into the instrument space. So it's rather broad-based if I just take the LC example, both on the UPLC side and the HPLC side. 
And for mass spec, as you already know, BioAccord and our QDa have done pretty well for large molecule applications in Q4. So really, really broad-based. I would not speculate on one or the other, but I would say, Q4 gives you a good indication of what we should see even going forward, if not better. 
Now in terms of large orders and to give you color on my comment on large orders previously, you see with the LC replacement initiatives we've had some customers come in and ask us to replace their full fleet, and that has resulted in some of the largest orders. And this is why I'm rather optimistic about this initiative. So that gives you more color.
On the chemicals piece, I'm not sure what you're referring to on the 14%. So I don't know, Mike, if you have any comments on that, I don't know what that is referring to, the chemicals growth of 14%."

I mean it grew slightly shy of 20% after, I would say, a very difficult first half of the year. And so we're very happy with the momentum, and largely led by pharma, both on the small molecule and large molecule side and a very broad-based growth across the portfolio or across instruments, both mass spec as well as LC consumables and service, especially recurring revenues did super well in -- especially in the pharma -- especially in the pharma segment. So I feel really good about that. 
In terms of changes, I mean, it goes back to what we talked about earlier, really focusing the field on what matters. And as I mentioned earlier, as soon as we utter the words LC at Waters, we have a genuine enthusiasm across the organization. I mean we have not just our portfolio, but our service teams are state-of-the-art. So I think having the organization focus on LC, giving them Arc HPLC as a new product, and it was especially designed for China, in particular, right? So giving them Arc HPLC and PREMIER to go out and have these conversations with the LC customers has been a terrific initiative.
Secondly, I also mentioned our CXO or our contract testing and contract research organization initiative. That's also done rather well in China. Our team has gone out to meet contract manufacturers. We've increased our penetration in contact testing organizations in the food segment. It's, again, one data point, but it's a good data point. I'm reluctant to start extrapolating too much, but it's a good data point that it gives us confidence that activity is at a higher level.
Now as far as incentives are concerned, they are no different than they have been in the past. It's just a question of focus. But given the team's new products, giving them clarity on which customers to go after and working with them to succeed, I think, are the key success factors I would point to."

And on China, look, we talked a bit about in the past about what had caused the slowdown, right? I mean the slowdown was led by the food segment, but also a bit of a slowdown in pharma and our focus on pharma. So again, let me break it down a bit across the different initiatives with pharma. We expect our focus with LC with Arc HPLC, with the launch of Arc HPLC and PREMIER and the replacement initiative should give us good tailwinds in pharma going forward.
Second, for the food segment, we have really focused on expanding our coverage for the contract testing organizations. You remember, I mentioned we were a little bit late in following that trend. The team has gone and reached out to each and every one of those customers. And now we have to make sure that our value propositions work before we start to see meaningful growth in that area.
And then across clinical, China is one of those markets that in the past grew very well in that segment. I mean, this year, we've seen some headwinds, especially on -- especially due to the diversion towards COVID-19 testing. So I expect that to come back. So across the board, we see some good opportunities in China.
Now talking at a bit of a higher level, in the pharma industry in China, if you look at the latest 5-year plan, it calls for having roughly 45% or so of the production for biopharmaceuticals occurring locally in China for China use. And today, that number is around 20 -- between 20% and 25%. So there's a commitment in the Chinese government and the Chinese economy to increase pharma consumption. So we feel rather well placed with our portfolio, with our commercial focus to go after the opportunity in pharma as well as in food.
And from a portfolio perspective, our Arc HPLC was specifically designed for the Chinese LC market. Our tandem quad portfolio is doing rather well for traditional Chinese medicine and food testing and environmental testing in China.

Along with Bryan joining me on this morning's call is Mike Silveira, Waters' Vice President, Controller and Interim CFO.

Along with Bryan joining me on this morning's call is Mike Silveira, Waters' Vice President, Controller and Interim CFO. Some of you may already know Mike, who has been a part of the Waters finance organization for 16 years. And I'm happy to have him joining me on this morning's call. 
I would like to start by thanking our employees around the globe for their hard work and dedication through what has been an extraordinarily difficult year. It is one that has brought significant change and sacrifice. From navigating the pandemic and resulting short-term cost-saving initiatives earlier this year to changes in leadership, the Waters team has responded with drive, determination and an indomitable spirit. I am impressed by and grateful for our team's resilience and commitment to our customers and to each other. 
During today's call, I will provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year operating results as well as an update on the stabilization that we have seen in the LC market and a few factors influencing our thinking for 2021. Mike will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our first quarter and full year financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions. 
Briefly reviewing our operating results for the fourth quarter, revenue grew 10% as reported, 7% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted earnings per share grew 14%. For the full year, revenue declined 2% and adjusted earnings per share was up 1%. This strong finish to the end of a challenging year was driven by the pharmaceutical market improvement, capital spending recovery in the second half of the year, strong execution and early contributions from our near-term growth initiatives. 
Looking more closely at our top line results. First, from a customer perspective. Our largest market category, pharma, was the primary growth driver in the quarter with 15% growth. Our industrial market grew 5%, while academia and government declined 15%. 
Now to geography. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia were up 12%, with China up 19%. Meanwhile, sales in the Americas grew 3% with the U.S. growing 4%, and European sales grew at 6%.  
From a product perspective, our Waters-branded products and services grew approximately 8%, while TA declined by around 1% on a constant currency basis. 
While still navigating the global pandemic, we are seeing clear signs of improving customer activity, positive growth trends in our recurring revenues and an evidence of stabilization in LC instrument demand. Services grew 10%, while consumables business grew approximately 14%, driven largely by global pharma strength, including sales of our recently launched PREMIER Columns, which performed exceedingly well in the first quarter on the market. 
LC instruments grew most -- grew across most of our major geographies with high single-digit growth. This improvement in capital equipment purchasing reflects the combination of the return of some of the planned capital spending that was delayed from the first half of the year, a normal pharma year-end budget flush and early contributions from our LC replacement initiative. 
Following last June's release of the Arc HPLC System in the core HPLC market, with a particular focus on the small molecule development and QA/QC space, we look forward to the continued expansion of our liquid chromatography portfolio. 
On February 10, we will launch ACQUITY PREMIER, a next-generation UPLC system that offers customers an extraordinary breakthrough in efficiency, sensitivity and overall capability. This new system will benefit both large and small molecule discovery and development as well as biomedical research. This new system has even more profound benefits when paired with our ACQUITY PREMIER Columns, which I mentioned earlier and were launched in the fourth quarter. The combined solution will alleviate nonspecific binding absorption losses and provide a significant leap forward with enhanced reproducibility, reduced passivation and an increased confidence in analytical results.
After a very strong third quarter, mass spec sales were about flat in Q4. As you know, the mass spec business can be lumpy, which we saw with biomedical research. There are -- there was also a general softness in clinical diagnostics as budgets were diverted to COVID-19 testing. Notably, however, mass spec sales to pharma customers grew double digits, driven by the strong double-digit growth of both BioAccord and the QDa. 
Finally, QDa, revenues declined low single digits, which was much improved from earlier in the year. We saw the core thermal business start to pick up, driven by market improvement in Asia. In particular, life sciences, including pharma and medical devices, grew double digits. Combined, these comprised approximately 10% to 15% of TA's total revenues. However, this was not enough to offset declines from TA's industrial customers. 
Looking now at our geographies, all major regions grew. The Americas grew low single digits, Europe grew mid-single digits, and Asia grew double digits. In the U.S., the growth was driven by pharma, which was partially offset by declines in material science, environmental and academic and government. Though Latin America continued to decline, it improved meaningfully relative to earlier in the year. 
Europe also experienced strong pharma performance, partially offset by material science, food and academic and government. In both U.S. and Europe, pharma growth was broad-based, including strength in big pharma, large molecule customers, generics and contract labs. 
China had an impressive quarter with strong double-digit growth, driven by continuing acceleration in pharma as well as strong environmental growth. The pharma growth was driven by both small and large molecule customers, including particularly strong growth at contract labs. India also continued to grow double digits. 
In summary, overall, in the fourth quarter, we saw further relative strength in the market and benefited from strong year-end spending trends. Now for the year, our pharmaceutical market category achieved 1% growth with the U.S., Europe and India all seeing positive growth. Industrial declined 3% for the full year, and academic and government declined 16%. Notably, our pharma market category grew 10% in the second half compared to the first half decline of 8%, owed in part to strength in small molecules, the industry recovered from lockdowns. Industrial also grew in the second half at 4%, while academic and government declined 12% compared to the first half declines of 10% and 22%, respectively. 
Geographically, for the year, Asia sales were down 4%, with China sales down 8%. Sales in Americas were down 4%, with the U.S. down 2%. Europe sales were up 2%. Notably, all our major geographies grew in the second half of the year, with the U.S. up 4% and Europe up 6%, following first half declines if 9% and 3%, respectively. Our China market grew in the second half, up 11%, reversing much of its sharp 31% decline in the first half of the year. 
Now I would like to share some of the progress we've made in our transformation program as several of the initiatives we're putting into action are starting to contribute to growth. First, I will talk about our instrument replacement initiative, then our progress in contract lab expansion, followed by e-commerce. And lastly, I'll give you a BioAccord update. 
First, as it relates to our instrument replacement initiative, which is the most advanced initiative underway, we delivered our first quarterly LC instrument revenue growth in 2 years, and our LC instrument win/loss was the highest it has been in 3 years. Initial customer feedback has been very positive on the Arc HPLC as well. 
Second, as part of our contract lab expansion initiative, we have made important progress in targeting this high-growth customer group. We have contacted a number of customers globally, particularly in China and have strengthened our value proposition with expanded alternative revenue and service offerings, which have been well received by this segment. It is still early days, but we're pleased with the progress we're making. 
Third, our e-commerce initiative is still in the early stages, but waters.com traffic is up double digits, driven by search engine optimization and paid search. While there isn't a 1:1 relationship between traffic and revenue, increased traffic is an important first step in driving revenue growth through the e-commerce channel. 
In tandem with our e-commerce actions, we've also enhanced our e-procurement platform, on which we have expanded our coverage of customers, leveraging this channel. This supported strong e-commerce -- strong e-procurement growth, indicating that it's now easier to work with Waters.
Fourth, driving launch excellence. BioAccord sales exceeded expectations in the quarter as our market development efforts and our specialist sales model have started to take effect, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Many customers are increasingly adopting BioAccord for manufacturing and several have placed follow-on orders. Once we get BioAccord applications on an enterprise software platform, we believe we will be seeing more follow-on orders. More importantly, customer activity continues to be encouraging, which makes us optimistic about 2021.  
Lastly, I'd like to highlight our efforts to help mitigate the public health crisis. In addition to the significant efforts by our innovation response team, we're encouraged to see Waters consumables specked in on QA/QC methods for COVID vaccines and therapeutics. We're also seeing an uptick in COVID-driven demand for our instruments and consumables. This peaked in the fourth quarter, where COVID revenues contributed an estimated 1 to 2 percentage points to the growth, driven by those pharmaceutical customers developing COVID vaccines and therapeutics, who saw meaningfully higher growth than manufacturers that don't have COVID-related programs. 
In summary, as I wrap up for 2020, we've done a great job at keeping our employees safe and our operations running. Our teams are focused not only on getting products out the door, but we have also assisted our customers engaged in COVID-related efforts. Meanwhile, our base business is showing signs of recovery, and our transformation is well underway. 
Turning to 2021. While the business environment remains uncertain, we look forward to building on the fourth quarter momentum. Mike will provide further details on our outlook for 2021, which is based on 3 key factors. 
One, we're assuming a gradual improvement in customer activity led by the pharma market. Two, we expect all major geographies to perform better than they did in 2020 led by growth in China. Lastly, our near-term growth initiatives are expected to continue to ramp up, led by our LC replacement initiative, which we expect to increasingly contribute to performance. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Silveira for a deeper review of the fourth quarter and 2020 financials and our outlook for 2021. Mike?"

In the fourth quarter, we recorded net sales of $787 million, an increase of approximately 7% in constant currency. Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 3%, resulting in sales growth of 10% as reported. For the full year, sales declined about 2% in constant currency and as reported. 
Looking at product line growth. Our reoccurring revenue, which represents the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue, increased by 11% in the quarter, while instrument sales increased 4%. For the full year, reoccurring revenue grew 3%, while instrument sales declined 9%. Chemistry revenue were up 14% in the quarter, driven by strong pharma growth. On the service side of our business, revenues were up 10% as customers continued to reopen labs, catch up on performance maintenance, professional services and repair visits. 
As we noted last quarter, reoccurring sales were impacted by 2 calendar -- 2 additional calendar days in the quarter, which resulted in a slight increase in service revenue sales. Looking ahead, there are 5 additional calendar days in the first quarter and 6 fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. 
Breaking fourth quarter product sales down further. Sales related to Waters-branded products and services grew 8%, while sales of TA branded products and services declined 1%. Combined LC and LC-MS instrument sales were up 5%, while TA system sales declined 4%. 
Now I'd like to comment on our fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 59.2%, an increase compared to the 58.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to the higher sales volume and FX. On a full year basis, gross margin was 57.4% compared to 58% in the prior year on lower overall sales volumes in 2020. 
Moving down the fourth quarter P&L. Operating expenses increased by approximately 6% on a constant currency basis and 8% on a reported basis. The increase was primarily attributed to variable expenses related to the strong sales performance. For the year, operating expenses were 1% lower before currency translation and flat after.
In the quarter and for the full year, our effective operating tax rate was 14.9% and 14.8%, respectively, an increase from last year as the comparable period included some favorable discrete items. Net interest expense was $7 million for the quarter, a decrease of about $3 million, as anticipated on lower outstanding debt balances.
Our average share count came in at 62.5 million shares, a reduction of approximately 3% or about 2 million shares lower than in the fourth quarter of last year. This is the result of shares repurchased through the end of the first quarter of 2020, subsequent to which we paused our share repurchase program.
Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter increased 14% to $3.65 in comparison to the $3.20 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $3.49 compared to $3.12 last year. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 1% at $9.05 per share versus $8.99 and last year. On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share were $8.36 versus $8.69 in 2019. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning. 
Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. I would like to summarize our fourth quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excluding special items. In the fourth quarter of 2020, free cash flow grew 52% year-over-year to $240 million after funding $47 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $19 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation. In the fourth quarter, this resulted in $0.30 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. For the full year in 2020, free cash flow generation was $726 million after funding $172 million of capital expenditures. This represents a 26% increase and $0.31 per dollar of sales converted into free cash flow.
Excluded from free cash flow was $70 million related to our investment in our Taunton chemistry operation and a $38 million transition tax payment related to the 2017 U.S. tax reform. Our increased free cash flow is primarily a result of our cost actions -- cost-saving actions and improvements in our cash conversion cycle.
In the fourth quarter, accounts receivable days sales outstanding came in at 70 days, down 7 days compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Inventories decreased by $16 million in comparison to the prior quarter -- prior year quarter, reflecting stronger revenue growth and revised production schedules. 
Waters maintains a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $443 million and debt of $1.4 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $913 million and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.1x at the end of the fourth quarter.
Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent: invest for growth, balance sheet strength and flexibility and return of capital to shareholders. We remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities. As such, our Board of Directors has approved a 2-year extension of our January 2019 share repurchase authorization that was set to expire last month. As of today, we have $1.5 billion remains available under the program for share repurchases.
As we look forward to the year ahead, I'd like to provide some broader context on our thoughts for 2021. The business environment remains uncertain, and we are assuming a gradual improvement in customer activity led by the pharma market. We expect all major geographies to perform better than they did in 2020, led by growth in China. Our outlook does not anticipate a return of lockdown seen in 2020. We had a 1% tailwind from COVID-related revenue in 2020, 3 quarters of which was in the second half of the year. We expect a similar revenue impact in 2021, including a 1% to 2% growth tailwind in Q1. We anticipate the first half growth tailwind will moderate through the remainder of the year. Improved execution on our near-term growth initiatives contributed to our fourth quarter growth, but the quarter also benefited from capital spending that was delayed from the first half into the second half of the year, which we don't expect to continue in 2021.
The second half of 2021 will have to contend with a challenging comp resulting from a revenue shift that took place in 2020. These dynamics support full year 2021 guidance for constant currency sales growth of 5% to 8%. At current rates, the positive currency translation to 2021 sales growth is expected to be 1 to 2 percentage points.
Gross margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of 57.5% to 58.5%. Every year, we look to balance growth, investment and profitability. Accordingly, we expect 2021 operating margins of 28% to 29% based on a combination of growth investments, normalization of COVID-related cost actions and disciplined expense controls.
Moving now below the operating income line. Other key assumptions from our full year guidance are: net interest expense of $35 million to $38 million; a full year tax rate of between 15% and 16%, which includes our new 5-year tax agreement with Singapore that will expire in March 2026; a restart of our share repurchase program in 2021 that will result in an average diluted 2021 share count of 61 million to 61.5 million shares outstanding. Over the course of the year, we will evaluate share repurchase program and provide quarterly updates as appropriate. 
Rolling all of this together, on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are projected in the range of $9.32 to $9.57, which assumes a positive currency impact on full year earnings per share growth of approximately 3 percentage points.
Looking at the first quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 7% to 10%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to increase first quarter sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.60. At current rates, the positive currency impact on first quarter earnings per share growth is expected to be approximately 15 percentage points.

Look, the LC replacement initiative, the one that I introduced in the call earlier, is off to a wonderful -- it's off to a wonderful start. If you look at the HPLC to UPLC mix of our installed bases, I would say, roughly 53% to 47% HPLC to UPLC. And in terms of dimensionalizing it, remember, we talked about Alliance, in particular, instruments that are now unlimited service. Assuming there are about 8,000 or so of them, we expect 10% to 15% of those to be replaced. The initiative in itself is off to an excellent start. I mean we've contacted over 60% of those customers already, received rather positive feedback.
And I would say a couple of facts. One, our HPLC is, of course, helping quite a bit in the replacement. But what we've seen in Q4 is the highest win/loss ratio that we've seen in over 3 years for our LC instruments. So this bodes well for the initiative, and we're seeing rather positive uptake.
Second, you asked the question on PREMIER. We launched our PREMIER Columns in Q4. And these are especially designed for molecules that are -- that have affinity for metals. And we've designed a nonabsorptive surface, which increases the efficiency of the separation. 
And you'd say, well, what is the application? The application is actually squarely targeted towards larger molecules and oligonucleotides, and the uptake has been excellent. And I would say it's even -- it will get even more interesting when we take the technology and implement it across our UPLC instruments, which is ACQUITY PREMIER, and that's set to launch on February 10. The premarket work has been very, very good. And I expect that to do just as well. So I hope that gives you more clarity on LC and also on PREMIER."

So if I just now break it down. If our initiatives do better than planned, if other end markets recover and we continue to see COVID tailwind, we believe that we will be on the higher end of the guide. And that should set us up very nicely for the future.
As far as the LC instrument replacement cycle is concerned, we're in the early stages of the innings. I mean it's a good start, but it's a start all the same. I don't want us to get overconfident with one data point. I believe the execution is very good. We have a good feedback. We have good feedback from our customers. I do believe, especially with Arc HPLC, the launch of PREMIER, we'll continue to see strength in LC, but I would still want to remain prudent. So as I said, it's one data point.

I would say, again, if you remember the turnaround plan was the first focus is on the short-term commercial momentum. I think you would agree that, that gives us freedom to act, then we get our processes and systems right, and then we focus on the portfolio. So there would be more to say about the portfolio in the future, but the current assessment suggest the following, right? 
First, if we just look at the instrument portfolio, our mass spec portfolio has been completely refreshed with 5 new launches in 2019 alone. And we've talked a lot about BioAccord, but also our tandem quad portfolio with the Xevo line has done quite well, especially if you look at the uptake for traditional Chinese medicine in China and small molecule organic testing with that portfolio. So the mass spec portfolio, both on tandem quad and high res, I feel good about. Of course, there's always more to do, but it's a very, very good start.
And if I move to LC, we talked a bit about Arc HPLC and PREMIER. Both are significant steps forward for our portfolio. And as I mentioned earlier, we are thinking of how to reimagine the LC instrument, especially in the QA/QC space, and there'll be more to say about that in the next few years. That program is well underway.
If I move into the consumables side, both for small and large molecule pharma, our portfolio is very well set. I won't speak much about the small molecule. I think that is well understood. But on the large molecule side, our ACQUITY Columns, in particular, have been designed for large molecules. And these are for proteins, for peptides, for oligos. And now with the launch of PREMIER, that even strengthens the position further.
So across the portfolio, on the instrument side, on the consumable side and with service, we continue to look for better options. I believe we're doing -- we've done a lot. We're doing a fair bit to continue to refresh the portfolio. And going forward, I mean, there are, of course, things to do to enhance the portfolio, but I don't feel for a second that we are disadvantaged versus competition in the market. So I think, for the short term, I believe with the hand that we have, we can fight pretty well."

The basic assumption is, and as you mentioned, is that there is a replacement cycle. And our replacement cycle of our instruments in the past is -- I mean, we knew about it, and we've been at it for a while, but I think the focus that we have now, and you'd say, ""Well, what are you doing differently?"" I think what we're doing differently from the past, which starts to show -- starts to pay dividends, is that we are using -- we know exactly where these instruments are. We've taken a look at the database. We've targeted our reps to those exact channels -- to those exact customers.
And in addition, armed with Arc HPLC as a new product, in addition to a value proposition with PREMIER, we feel our full portfolio with the LC, with PREMIER, with our service offering is off to a good start in this replacement cycle. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, and I won't speculate too much on the future, but this data point looks good. And leading indicators in terms of orders also look rather good.
Now in terms of how you should think about it in the future, I think I'd rather share the fact after we're done rather than speculating, but all I can say is the data points we have at this point in time look positive, both in terms of how the customers are receiving our value proposition and how we're targeting the customers. So I mean, in general, I would remind you that Waters is an LC company, right? Any time we do something on LC, our whole team, our sales team, our service team, gets super enthusiastic.

I mean, I think R&D, and having been a researcher myself for a good part of my career, I mean, we want to focus on fundamentals. We want to focus on technology development. And Waters is a technology-oriented company, so we'll stay true to the problem-solving that we have to do.
Now to some facts, right, if you look at the R&D productivity in recent times, the mass spec portfolio has been completely renewed, both on the high-res side as well as on the tandem quad side. And to provide you more color on the tandem quads, we're seeing very good uptake of those, in particular, as I mentioned earlier. In China, we wanted to continue to work on our software on those tandem quads to even increase the uptake in pharma DMPK sort of areas as well. So I feel we have done a good job in refreshing the mass spec portfolio. And we also know what we need to get done specifically, and we are funding those programs very well, especially on the informatics side for mass spec.
BioAccord is another case in point. I mean, as you know, LC-MS and QA/QC is somehow the holy grail in the industry to be able to take large molecules to the same place where small molecules are in release testing. And we have a robust and reliable instrument, BioAccord, which is starting to see very good uptake. And we have a really clear road map in increasing applications and improving the software on that front as well, and that's very well funded. 
If I now turn to the LC side. I mean we've redoubled our effort on that front, both on the commercial side, but also on the R&D side and it's a question of turning dollars to the right to the right programs. And there, on the consumables, in particular, I mean, the launch of PREMIER has been received very well in the market. We're expanding that technology into our full instrument space. And that should be -- that is something that the market is, I think, looking forward to have a nonabsorptive surface for full instruments. And there, again, there is a strong effort on the software side as well to take Empower into the cloud and expand the applications there.
And then finally, if I turn to the service side, there, we are always looking at better value propositions. And here, it's not necessarily a product-based innovation, but it's a service-based innovation. Many of our customers are asking us for more flexible value propositions, especially when it comes to, I would say, almost a la carte service if based on their utilization, and we are offering those value propositions as well.
So I've gone on long, but just to give you a flavor that the R&D programs are based on specifics and not what appears to be popular. And we will not be shy in increasing that funding, and you'll hear more about that as we go forward."

And they've gone in and developed methods with these customers. And in many cases, we have follow-on orders as well.
And to just come back to the facts, I mean, for BioAccord, Q4 was the best quarter since its launch by severalfold. So we think this approach is working. Now in terms of what fraction of the total field force is specialty versus generalist, look, most of our reps have a technical training. And the reason Waters has been successful in the market for so long is because of our technical capabilities and how we are able to partner with our customers. And now we basically trained a few of them on specific methods. I would say we will continue to expand it.

Excellent questions. I mean I'll give you a general answer to your second question and then let Mike give you a bit of specifics on how we're seeing the margin evolution.
In general, look, a simple way to think about it is consumables and recurring revenues have a bit of a higher margin than instruments. And over time, instruments, as the demand rises, you can see more leverage in the P&L and you have higher units. So hence -- and you'll start to see better and better margins over time, so you start off with a slightly lower margin with instruments, and that goes up over time. And with consumables and informatics, you already see a nice starting point. And so launch of PREMIER, more informatics solutions, better service definitely gave a lift. And instruments at the beginning might start off at a lower starting point, but then would go up rather rapidly as the demand goes up, and we're seeing that already in many of our platforms. So Mike, do you want to comment a bit more on the margins and the evolution, especially on the gross margins?"

And then the second question is just you previously have made some comments about seeing some of the largest orders in company history here recently. Was just wondering if you could provide any more color on if that was something you think is a change or sustainable? Or does it just happened to be kind of a one-off here in the most recent couple of months?"

First, on instrument growth versus recurring. You saw in the fourth quarter that recurring revenues were double digits. Instruments were mid-single digits. And I think, going forward, also, we -- I mean, if yo",482,"Steve, thank you for both of those questions. First, on instrument growth versus recurring. You saw in the fourth quarter that recurring revenues were double digits. Instruments were mid-single digits. And I think, going forward, also, we -- I mean, if you just think through what we are thinking, what we are hoping to see in the future, I mean we expect that pharma continues, and you should see a similar sort of mix going forward as well if pharma continues its strength. And as other end markets recover, we expect a bit of upside to it. And if you just turn a bit towards -- I think rather than giving you a ratio, let me give you a bit of specifics on how one could think about it. If you just take -- think of our applications in pharma for both small and large molecules, and let me just give you a bit of the portfolio that goes towards that, right? So for small molecules, I mean, as that rises, especially as generic consumption and products for COVID, especially therapeutics, small molecule therapeutics rise, we see our LC portfolio with the Arc HPLC, in particular, going up. Then if you turn to large molecules, you can start with consumables. And then the reason I'm giving you the specifics is just to give you color that on both fronts, there is reason to believe that we should see some optimistic development.
And on the consumable side, for large molecules first, I mean, our ACQUITY Columns for UPLC have been designed, in particular, for large molecules. This starts with proteins, with peptides, glycans and also oligos. With PREMIER getting launched first as a column, the technology has got very good traction, especially for oligonucleotide applications, and now it goes into the instrument space. So it's rather broad-based if I just take the LC example, both on the UPLC side and the HPLC side. 
And for mass spec, as you already know, BioAccord and our QDa have done pretty well for large molecule applications in Q4. So really, really broad-based. I would not speculate on one or the other, but I would say, Q4 gives you a good indication of what we should see even going forward, if not better. 
Now in terms of large orders and to give you color on my comment on large orders previously, you see with the LC replacement initiatives we've had some customers come in and ask us to replace their full fleet, and that has resulted in some of the largest orders. And this is why I'm rather optimistic about this initiative. So that gives you more color.
On the chemicals piece, I'm not sure what you're referring to on the 14%. So I don't know, Mike, if you have any comments on that, I don't know what that is referring to, the chemicals growth of 14%."

And thanks for all the work that you've put in, in these few months here. So first one, based on what you were saying here, and correct me if I'm wrong, it appears to me that the China pharma recurring revenue sales and especially columns and small molecules and then services grew very strongly in the quarter. Obviously, you've highlighted the growth in China. So wondering what has changed in your approach in China in terms of commercial execution? Or is it largely market-driven growth that we are seeing from across the peers as well? So correct me if I'm wrong on any of those assumptions as to what I'm seeing.
And then that light also, were there any incentives in the fourth quarter that drove this growth in that geography?"

I mean it grew slightly shy of 20% after, I would say, a very difficult first half of the year. And so we're very happy with the momentum, and largely led by pharma, both on the small molecule and large molecule side and a very broad-based growth across the portfolio or across instruments, both mass spec as well as LC consumables and service, especially recurring revenues did super well in -- especially in the pharma -- especially in the pharma segment. So I feel really good about that. 
In terms of changes, I mean, it goes back to what we talked about earlier, really focusing the field on what matters. And as I mentioned earlier, as soon as we utter the words LC at Waters, we have a genuine enthusiasm across the organization. I mean we have not just our portfolio, but our service teams are state-of-the-art. So I think having the organization focus on LC, giving them Arc HPLC as a new product, and it was especially designed for China, in particular, right? So giving them Arc HPLC and PREMIER to go out and have these conversations with the LC customers has been a terrific initiative.
Secondly, I also mentioned our CXO or our contract testing and contract research organization initiative. That's also done rather well in China. Our team has gone out to meet contract manufacturers. We've increased our penetration in contact testing organizations in the food segment. It's, again, one data point, but it's a good data point. I'm reluctant to start extrapolating too much, but it's a good data point that it gives us confidence that activity is at a higher level.
Now as far as incentives are concerned, they are no different than they have been in the past. It's just a question of focus. But given the team's new products, giving them clarity on which customers to go after and working with them to succeed, I think, are the key success factors I would point to."

And on China, look, we talked a bit about in the past about what had caused the slowdown, right? I mean the slowdown was led by the food segment, but also a bit of a slowdown in pharma and our focus on pharma. So again, let me break it down a bit across the different initiatives with pharma. We expect our focus with LC with Arc HPLC, with the launch of Arc HPLC and PREMIER and the replacement initiative should give us good tailwinds in pharma going forward.
Second, for the food segment, we have really focused on expanding our coverage for the contract testing organizations. You remember, I mentioned we were a little bit late in following that trend. The team has gone and reached out to each and every one of those customers. And now we have to make sure that our value propositions work before we start to see meaningful growth in that area.
And then across clinical, China is one of those markets that in the past grew very well in that segment. I mean, this year, we've seen some headwinds, especially on -- especially due to the diversion towards COVID-19 testing. So I expect that to come back. So across the board, we see some good opportunities in China.
Now talking at a bit of a higher level, in the pharma industry in China, if you look at the latest 5-year plan, it calls for having roughly 45% or so of the production for biopharmaceuticals occurring locally in China for China use. And today, that number is around 20 -- between 20% and 25%. So there's a commitment in the Chinese government and the Chinese economy to increase pharma consumption. So we feel rather well placed with our portfolio, with our commercial focus to go after the opportunity in pharma as well as in food.
And from a portfolio perspective, our Arc HPLC was specifically designed for the Chinese LC market. Our tandem quad portfolio is doing rather well for traditional Chinese medicine and food testing and environmental testing in China. So I feel very good from a portfolio perspective and from a commercial perspective on the base we've set, but it's -- as I said, it's a good start. It's a start all the same. So we're a bit prudent about what we want to see in the future."

Along with Bryan joining me on this morning's call is Mike Silveira, Waters' Vice President, Controller and Interim CFO. Some of you may already know Mike, who has been a part of the Waters finance organization for 16 years. And I'm happy to have him joining me on this morning's call. 
I would like to start by thanking our employees around the globe for their hard work and dedication through what has been an extraordinarily difficult year. It is one that has brought significant change and sacrifice. From navigating the pandemic and resulting short-term cost-saving initiatives earlier this year to changes in leadership, the Waters team has responded with drive, determination and an indomitable spirit. I am impressed by and grateful for our team's resilience and commitment to our customers and to each other. 
During today's call, I will provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year operating results as well as an update on the stabilization that we have seen in the LC market and a few factors influencing our thinking for 2021. Mike will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our first quarter and full year financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions. 
Briefly reviewing our operating results for the fourth quarter, revenue grew 10% as reported, 7% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted earnings per share grew 14%. For the full year, revenue declined 2% and adjusted earnings per share was up 1%. This strong finish to the end of a challenging year was driven by the pharmaceutical market improvement, capital spending recovery in the second half of the year, strong execution and early contributions from our near-term growth initiatives. 
Looking more closely at our top line results. First, from a customer perspective. Our largest market category, pharma, was the primary growth driver in the quarter with 15% growth. Our industrial market grew 5%, while academia and government declined 15%. 
Now to geography. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia were up 12%, with China up 19%. Meanwhile, sales in the Americas grew 3% with the U.S. growing 4%, and European sales grew at 6%.  
From a product perspective, our Waters-branded products and services grew approximately 8%, while TA declined by around 1% on a constant currency basis. 
While still navigating the global pandemic, we are seeing clear signs of improving customer activity, positive growth trends in our recurring revenues and an evidence of stabilization in LC instrument demand. Services grew 10%, while consumables business grew approximately 14%, driven largely by global pharma strength, including sales of our recently launched PREMIER Columns, which performed exceedingly well in the first quarter on the market. 
LC instruments grew most -- grew across most of our major geographies with high single-digit growth. This improvement in capital equipment purchasing reflects the combination of the return of some of the planned capital spending that was delayed from the first half of the year, a normal pharma year-end budget flush and early contributions from our LC replacement initiative. 
Following last June's release of the Arc HPLC System in the core HPLC market, with a particular focus on the small molecule development and QA/QC space, we look forward to the continued expansion of our liquid chromatography portfolio. 
On February 10, we will launch ACQUITY PREMIER, a next-generation UPLC system that offers customers an extraordinary breakthrough in efficiency, sensitivity and overall capability. This new system will benefit both large and small molecule discovery and development as well as biomedical research. This new system has even more profound benefits when paired with our ACQUITY PREMIER Columns, which I mentioned earlier and were launched in the fourth quarter. The combined solution will alleviate nonspecific binding absorption losses and provide a significant leap forward with enhanced reproducibility, reduced passivation and an increased confidence in analytical results.
After a very strong third quarter, mass spec sales were about flat in Q4. As you know, the mass spec business can be lumpy, which we saw with biomedical research. There are -- there was also a general softness in clinical diagnostics as budgets were diverted to COVID-19 testing. Notably, however, mass spec sales to pharma customers grew double digits, driven by the strong double-digit growth of both BioAccord and the QDa. 
Finally, QDa, revenues declined low single digits, which was much improved from earlier in the year. We saw the core thermal business start to pick up, driven by market improvement in Asia. In particular, life sciences, including pharma and medical devices, grew double digits. Combined, these comprised approximately 10% to 15% of TA's total revenues. However, this was not enough to offset declines from TA's industrial customers. 
Looking now at our geographies, all major regions grew. The Americas grew low single digits, Europe grew mid-single digits, and Asia grew double digits. In the U.S., the growth was driven by pharma, which was partially offset by declines in material science, environmental and academic and government. Though Latin America continued to decline, it improved meaningfully relative to earlier in the year. 
Europe also experienced strong pharma performance, partially offset by material science, food and academic and government. In both U.S. and Europe, pharma growth was broad-based, including strength in big pharma, large molecule customers, generics and contract labs. 
China had an impressive quarter with strong double-digit growth, driven by continuing acceleration in pharma as well as strong environmental growth. The pharma growth was driven by both small and large molecule customers, including particularly strong growth at contract labs. India also continued to grow double digits. 
In summary, overall, in the fourth quarter, we saw further relative strength in the market and benefited from strong year-end spending trends. Now for the year, our pharmaceutical market category achieved 1% growth with the U.S., Europe and India all seeing positive growth. Industrial declined 3% for the full year, and academic and government declined 16%. Notably, our pharma market category grew 10% in the second half compared to the first half decline of 8%, owed in part to strength in small molecules, the industry recovered from lockdowns. Industrial also grew in the second half at 4%, while academic and government declined 12% compared to the first half declines of 10% and 22%, respectively. 
Geographically, for the year, Asia sales were down 4%, with China sales down 8%. Sales in Americas were down 4%, with the U.S. down 2%. Europe sales were up 2%. Notably, all our major geographies grew in the second half of the year, with the U.S. up 4% and Europe up 6%, following first half declines if 9% and 3%, respectively. Our China market grew in the second half, up 11%, reversing much of its sharp 31% decline in the first half of the year. 
Now I would like to share some of the progress we've made in our transformation program as several of the initiatives we're putting into action are starting to contribute to growth. First, I will talk about our instrument replacement initiative, then our progress in contract lab expansion, followed by e-commerce. And lastly, I'll give you a BioAccord update. 
First, as it relates to our instrument replacement initiative, which is the most advanced initiative underway, we delivered our first quarterly LC instrument revenue growth in 2 years, and our LC instrument win/loss was the highest it has been in 3 years. Initial customer feedback has been very positive on the Arc HPLC as well. 
Second, as part of our contract lab expansion initiative, we have made important progress in targeting this high-growth customer group. We have contacted a number of customers globally, particularly in China and have strengthened our value proposition with expanded alternative revenue and service offerings, which have been well received by this segment. It is still early days, but we're pleased with the progress we're making. 
Third, our e-commerce initiative is still in the early stages, but waters.com traffic is up double digits, driven by search engine optimization and paid search. While there isn't a 1:1 relationship between traffic and revenue, increased traffic is an important first step in driving revenue growth through the e-commerce channel. 
In tandem with our e-commerce actions, we've also enhanced our e-procurement platform, on which we have expanded our coverage of customers, leveraging this channel. This supported strong e-commerce -- strong e-procurement growth, indicating that it's now easier to work with Waters.
Fourth, driving launch excellence. BioAccord sales exceeded expectations in the quarter as our market development efforts and our specialist sales model have started to take effect, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Many customers are increasingly adopting BioAccord for manufacturing and several have placed follow-on orders. Once we get BioAccord applications on an enterprise software platform, we believe we will be seeing more follow-on orders. More importantly, customer activity continues to be encouraging, which makes us optimistic about 2021.  
Lastly, I'd like to highlight our efforts to help mitigate the public health crisis. In addition to the significant efforts by our innovation response team, we're encouraged to see Waters consumables specked in on QA/QC methods for COVID vaccines and therapeutics. We're also seeing an uptick in COVID-driven demand for our instruments and consumables. This peaked in the fourth quarter, where COVID revenues contributed an estimated 1 to 2 percentage points to the growth, driven by those pharmaceutical customers developing COVID vaccines and therapeutics, who saw meaningfully higher growth than manufacturers that don't have COVID-related programs. 
In summary, as I wrap up for 2020, we've done a great job at keeping our employees safe and our operations running. Our teams are focused not only on getting products out the door, but we have also assisted our customers engaged in COVID-related efforts. Meanwhile, our base business is showing signs of recovery, and our transformation is well underway. 
Turning to 2021. While the business environment remains uncertain, we look forward to building on the fourth quarter momentum. Mike will provide further details on our outlook for 2021, which is based on 3 key factors. 
One, we're assuming a gradual improvement in customer activity led by the pharma market. Two, we expect all major geographies to perform better than they did in 2020 led by growth in China. Lastly, our near-term growth initiatives are expected to continue to ramp up, led by our LC replacement initiative, which we expect to increasingly contribute to performance. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Silveira for a deeper review of the fourth quarter and 2020 financials and our outlook for 2021. Mike?"
36475,693203518,2188394,"Waters Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Waters Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we recorded net sales of $787 million, an increase of approximately 7% in constant currency.

In the fourth quarter, we recorded net sales of $787 million, an increase of approximately 7% in constant currency. Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 3%, resulting in sales growth of 10% as reported. For the full year, sales declined about 2% in constant currency and as reported. 
Looking at product line growth. Our reoccurring revenue, which represents the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue, increased by 11% in the quarter, while instrument sales increased 4%. For the full year, reoccurring revenue grew 3%, while instrument sales declined 9%. Chemistry revenue were up 14% in the quarter, driven by strong pharma growth. On the service side of our business, revenues were up 10% as customers continued to reopen labs, catch up on performance maintenance, professional services and repair visits. 
As we noted last quarter, reoccurring sales were impacted by 2 calendar -- 2 additional calendar days in the quarter, which resulted in a slight increase in service revenue sales. Looking ahead, there are 5 additional calendar days in the first quarter and 6 fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. 
Breaking fourth quarter product sales down further. Sales related to Waters-branded products and services grew 8%, while sales of TA branded products and services declined 1%. Combined LC and LC-MS instrument sales were up 5%, while TA system sales declined 4%. 
Now I'd like to comment on our fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 59.2%, an increase compared to the 58.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to the higher sales volume and FX. On a full year basis, gross margin was 57.4% compared to 58% in the prior year on lower overall sales volumes in 2020. 
Moving down the fourth quarter P&L. Operating expenses increased by approximately 6% on a constant currency basis and 8% on a reported basis. The increase was primarily attributed to variable expenses related to the strong sales performance. For the year, operating expenses were 1% lower before currency translation and flat after.
In the quarter and for the full year, our effective operating tax rate was 14.9% and 14.8%, respectively, an increase from last year as the comparable period included some favorable discrete items. Net interest expense was $7 million for the quarter, a decrease of about $3 million, as anticipated on lower outstanding debt balances.
Our average share count came in at 62.5 million shares, a reduction of approximately 3% or about 2 million shares lower than in the fourth quarter of last year. This is the result of shares repurchased through the end of the first quarter of 2020, subsequent to which we paused our share repurchase program.
Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter increased 14% to $3.65 in comparison to the $3.20 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $3.49 compared to $3.12 last year. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 1% at $9.05 per share versus $8.99 and last year. On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share were $8.36 versus $8.69 in 2019. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning. 
Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. I would like to summarize our fourth quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excluding special items. In the fourth quarter of 2020, free cash flow grew 52% year-over-year to $240 million after funding $47 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $19 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation. In the fourth quarter, this resulted in $0.30 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. For the full year in 2020, free cash flow generation was $726 million after funding $172 million of capital expenditures. This represents a 26% increase and $0.31 per dollar of sales converted into free cash flow.
Excluded from free cash flow was $70 million related to our investment in our Taunton chemistry operation and a $38 million transition tax payment related to the 2017 U.S. tax reform. Our increased free cash flow is primarily a result of our cost actions -- cost-saving actions and improvements in our cash conversion cycle.
In the fourth quarter, accounts receivable days sales outstanding came in at 70 days, down 7 days compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Inventories decreased by $16 million in comparison to the prior quarter -- prior year quarter, reflecting stronger revenue growth and revised production schedules. 
Waters maintains a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $443 million and debt of $1.4 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $913 million and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.1x at the end of the fourth quarter.
Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent: invest for growth, balance sheet strength and flexibility and return of capital to shareholders. We remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities. As such, our Board of Directors has approved a 2-year extension of our January 2019 share repurchase authorization that was set to expire last month. As of today, we have $1.5 billion remains available under the program for share repurchases.
As we look forward to the year ahead, I'd like to provide some broader context on our thoughts for 2021. The business environment remains uncertain, and we are assuming a gradual improvement in customer activity led by the pharma market. We expect all major geographies to perform better than they did in 2020, led by growth in China. Our outlook does not anticipate a return of lockdown seen in 2020. We had a 1% tailwind from COVID-related revenue in 2020, 3 quarters of which was in the second half of the year. We expect a similar revenue impact in 2021, including a 1% to 2% growth tailwind in Q1. We anticipate the first half growth tailwind will moderate through the remainder of the year. Improved execution on our near-term growth initiatives contributed to our fourth quarter growth, but the quarter also benefited from capital spending that was delayed from the first half into the second half of the year, which we don't expect to continue in 2021.
The second half of 2021 will have to contend with a challenging comp resulting from a revenue shift that took place in 2020. These dynamics support full year 2021 guidance for constant currency sales growth of 5% to 8%. At current rates, the positive currency translation to 2021 sales growth is expected to be 1 to 2 percentage points.
Gross margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of 57.5% to 58.5%. Every year, we look to balance growth, investment and profitability. Accordingly, we expect 2021 operating margins of 28% to 29% based on a combination of growth investments, normalization of COVID-related cost actions and disciplined expense controls.
Moving now below the operating income line. Other key assumptions from our full year guidance are: net interest expense of $35 million to $38 million; a full year tax rate of between 15% and 16%, which includes our new 5-year tax agreement with Singapore that will expire in March 2026; a restart of our share repurchase program in 2021 that will result in an average diluted 2021 share count of 61 million to 61.5 million shares outstanding. Over the course of the year, we will evaluate share repurchase program and provide quarterly updates as appropriate. 
Rolling all of this together, on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are projected in the range of $9.32 to $9.57, which assumes a positive currency impact on full year earnings per share growth of approximately 3 percentage points.
Looking at the first quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 7% to 10%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to increase first quarter sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.60. At current rates, the positive currency impact on first quarter earnings per share growth is expected to be approximately 15 percentage points.

If you look at the HPLC to UPLC mix of our installed bases, I would say, roughly 53% to 47% HPLC to UPLC. And in terms of dimensionalizing it, remember, we talked about Alliance, in particular, instruments that are now unlimited service. Assuming there are about 8,000 or so of them, we expect 10% to 15% of those to be replaced. The initiative in itself is off to an excellent start. I mean we've contacted over 60% of those customers already, received rather positive feedback.
And I would say a couple of facts. One, our HPLC is, of course, helping quite a bit in the replacement. But what we've seen in Q4 is the highest win/loss ratio that we've seen in over 3 years for our LC instruments. So this bodes well for the initiative, and we're seeing rather positive uptake.
Second, you asked the question on PREMIER. We launched our PREMIER Columns in Q4. And these are especially designed for molecules that are -- that have affinity for metals. And we've designed a nonabsorptive surface, which increases the efficiency of the separation. 
And you'd say, well, what is the application? The application is actually squarely targeted towards larger molecules and oligonucleotides, and the uptake has been excellent. And I would say it's even -- it will get even more interesting when we take the technology and implement it across our UPLC instruments, which is ACQUITY PREMIER, and that's set to launch on February 10. The premarket work has been very, very good. And I expect that to do just as well. So I hope that gives you more clarity on LC and also on PREMIER."

So if I just now break it down. If our initiatives do better than planned, if other end markets recover and we continue to see COVID tailwind, we believe that we will be on the higher end of the guide.

As far as the LC instrument replacement cycle is concerned, we're in the early stages of the innings. I mean it's a good start, but it's a start all the same. I don't want us to get overconfident with one data point. I believe the execution is very good. We have a good feedback. We have good feedback from our customers. I do believe, especially with Arc HPLC, the launch of PREMIER, we'll continue to see strength in LC, but I would still want to remain prudent. So as I said, it's one data point.

I think you would agree that, that gives us freedom to act, then we get our processes and systems right, and then we focus on the portfolio. So there would be more to say about the portfolio in the future, but the current assessment suggest the following, right? 
First, if we just look at the instrument portfolio, our mass spec portfolio has been completely refreshed with 5 new launches in 2019 alone. And we've talked a lot about BioAccord, but also our tandem quad portfolio with the Xevo line has done quite well, especially if you look at the uptake for traditional Chinese medicine in China and small molecule organic testing with that portfolio. So the mass spec portfolio, both on tandem quad and high res, I feel good about. Of course, there's always more to do, but it's a very, very good start.
And if I move to LC, we talked a bit about Arc HPLC and PREMIER. Both are significant steps forward for our portfolio. And as I mentioned earlier, we are thinking of how to reimagine the LC instrument, especially in the QA/QC space, and there'll be more to say about that in the next few years. That program is well underway.
If I move into the consumables side, both for small and large molecule pharma, our portfolio is very well set. I won't speak much about the small molecule. I think that is well understood. But on the large molecule side, our ACQUITY Columns, in particular, have been designed for large molecules. And these are for proteins, for peptides, for oligos. And now with the launch of PREMIER, that even strengthens the position further.
So across the portfolio, on the instrument side, on the consumable side and with service, we continue to look for better options. I believe we're doing -- we've done a lot. We're doing a fair bit to continue to refresh the portfolio. And going forward, I mean, there are, of course, things to do to enhance the portfolio, but I don't feel for a second that we are disadvantaged versus competition in the market. So I think, for the short term, I believe with the hand that we have, we can fight pretty well."

And we've talked about this being a function of strong competitors really targeting Waters for a long time and finally making some progress, especially in disrupting typical replacement cycles where you would kind of have the home field advantage in placing the replacement box. I'm just wondering, where do you think you are in the process of taking steps to reverse these trends? How much investment in time is required pursuant to the reversal?

The basic assumption is, and as you mentioned, is that there is a replacement cycle. And our replacement cycle of our instruments in the past is -- I mean, we knew about it, and we've been at it for a while, but I think the focus that we have now, and you'd say, ""Well, what are you doing differently?"" I think what we're doing differently from the past, which starts to show -- starts to pay dividends, is that we are using -- we know exactly where these instruments are. We've taken a look at the database. We've targeted our reps to those exact channels -- to those exact customers.
And in addition, armed with Arc HPLC as a new product, in addition to a value proposition with PREMIER, we feel our full portfolio with the LC, with PREMIER, with our service offering is off to a good start in this replacement cycle. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, and I won't speculate too much on the future, but this data point looks good. And leading indicators in terms of orders also look rather good.
Now in terms of how you should think about it in the future, I think I'd rather share the fact after we're done rather than speculating, but all I can say is the data points we have at this point in time look positive, both in terms of how the customers are receiving our value proposition and how we're targeting the customers. So I mean, in general, I would remind you that Waters is an LC company, right? Any time we do something on LC, our whole team, our sales team, our service team, gets super enthusiastic. And we're seeing some of that in the results. So I'll stop there. And of course, happy to answer any follow-ups."

And look, it's -- you somehow answered your question in the last comment. I mean we will not be reactionary to anything. I mean, I think R&D, and having been a researcher myself for a good part of my career, I mean, we want to focus on fundamentals. We want to focus on technology development. And Waters is a technology-oriented company, so we'll stay true to the problem-solving that we have to do.
Now to some facts, right, if you look at the R&D productivity in recent times, the mass spec portfolio has been completely renewed, both on the high-res side as well as on the tandem quad side. And to provide you more color on the tandem quads, we're seeing very good uptake of those, in particular, as I mentioned earlier. In China, we wanted to continue to work on our software on those tandem quads to even increase the uptake in pharma DMPK sort of areas as well. So I feel we have done a good job in refreshing the mass spec portfolio. And we also know what we need to get done specifically, and we are funding those programs very well, especially on the informatics side for mass spec.
BioAccord is another case in point. I mean, as you know, LC-MS and QA/QC is somehow the holy grail in the industry to be able to take large molecules to the same place where small molecules are in release testing. And we have a robust and reliable instrument, BioAccord, which is starting to see very good uptake. And we have a really clear road map in increasing applications and improving the software on that front as well, and that's very well funded. 
If I now turn to the LC side. I mean we've redoubled our effort on that front, both on the commercial side, but also on the R&D side and it's a question of turning dollars to the right to the right programs. And there, on the consumables, in particular, I mean, the launch of PREMIER has been received very well in the market. We're expanding that technology into our full instrument space. And that should be -- that is something that the market is, I think, looking forward to have a nonabsorptive surface for full instruments. And there, again, there is a strong effort on the software side as well to take Empower into the cloud and expand the applications there.
And then finally, if I turn to the service side, there, we are always looking at better value propositions. And here, it's not necessarily a product-based innovation, but it's a service-based innovation. Many of our customers are asking us for more flexible value propositions, especially when it comes to, I would say, almost a la carte service if based on their utilization, and we are offering those value propositions as well.
So I've gone on long, but just to give you a flavor that the R&D programs are based on specifics and not what appears to be popular. And we will not be shy in increasing that funding, and you'll hear more about that as we go forward."

I mean products that require a deeper explanation, products that could benefit from our customers being coached on how to use it, how to develop methods on them. And for BioAccord, in particular, and I'll just use that as an example, that's off to an excellent start, right? So we have our -- we have turned specialty reps, and we've created a specialty reps team and turned them towards specific customers, especially ones with large molecule and oligonucleotide applications. And they've gone in and developed methods with these customers. And in many cases, we have follow-on orders as well.
And to just come back to the facts, I mean, for BioAccord, Q4 was the best quarter since its launch by severalfold. So we think this approach is working. Now in terms of what fraction of the total field force is specialty versus generalist, look, most of our reps have a technical training. And the reason Waters has been successful in the market for so long is because of our technical capabilities and how we are able to partner with our customers. And now we basically trained a few of them on specific methods. I would say we will continue to expand it. If it works more, we'll continue to expand that specialty field force for more complex applications, and BioAccord is just a start. I hope that gives you a bit more clarity. I don't want to quantify the fraction of field force that are on specialty. We will basically -- it's a pilot that seems to be showing results, and we'll continue to expand as there are a larger number of customers and targets."

Excellent questions. I mean I'll give you a general answer to your second question and then let Mike give you a bit of specifics on how we're seeing the margin evolution.
In general, look, a simple way to think about it is consumables and recurring revenues have a bit of a higher margin than instruments. And over time, instruments, as the demand rises, you can see more leverage in the P&L and you have higher units. So hence -- and you'll start to see better and better margins over time, so you start off with a slightly lower margin with instruments, and that goes up over time. And with consumables and informatics, you already see a nice starting point. And so launch of PREMIER, more informatics solutions, better service definitely gave a lift. And instruments at the beginning might start off at a lower starting point, but then would go up rather rapidly as the demand goes up, and we're seeing that already in many of our platforms. So Mike, do you want to comment a bit more on the margins and the evolution, especially on the gross margins?"

And then the second question is just you previously have made some comments about seeing some of the largest orders in company history here recently.

You saw in the fourth quarter that recurring revenues were double digits. Instruments were mid-single digits. And I think, going forward, also, we -- I mean, if you just think through what we are thinking, what we are hoping to see in the future, I mean we expect that pharma continues, and you should see a similar sort of mix going forward as well if pharma continues its strength. And as other end markets recover, we expect a bit of upside to it. And if you just turn a bit towards -- I think rather than giving you a ratio, let me give you a bit of specifics on how one could think about it. If you just take -- think of our applications in pharma for both small and large molecules, and let me just give you a bit of the portfolio that goes towards that, right? So for small molecules, I mean, as that rises, especially as generic consumption and products for COVID, especially therapeutics, small molecule therapeutics rise, we see our LC portfolio with the Arc HPLC, in particular, going up. Then if you turn to large molecules, you can start with consumables. And then the reason I'm giving you the specifics is just to give you color that on both fronts, there is reason to believe that we should see some optimistic development.
And on the consumable side, for large molecules first, I mean, our ACQUITY Columns for UPLC have been designed, in particular, for large molecules. This starts with proteins, with peptides, glycans and also oligos. With PREMIER getting launched first as a column, the technology has got very good traction, especially for oligonucleotide applications, and now it goes into the instrument space. So it's rather broad-based if I just take the LC example, both on the UPLC side and the HPLC side. 
And for mass spec, as you already know, BioAccord and our QDa have done pretty well for large molecule applications in Q4. So really, really broad-based. I would not speculate on one or the other, but I would say, Q4 gives you a good indication of what we should see even going forward, if not better. 
Now in terms of large orders and to give you color on my comment on large orders previously, you see with the LC replacement initiatives we've had some customers come in and ask us to replace their full fleet, and that has resulted in some of the largest orders. And this is why I'm rather optimistic about this initiative. So that gives you more color.
On the chemicals piece, I'm not sure what you're referring to on the 14%. So I don't know, Mike, if you have any comments on that, I don't know what that is referring to, the chemicals growth of 14%."

And so we're very happy with the momentum, and largely led by pharma, both on the small molecule and large molecule side and a very broad-based growth across the portfolio or across instruments, both mass spec as well as LC consumables and service, especially recurring revenues did super well in -- especially in the pharma -- especially in the pharma segment. So I feel really good about that. 
In terms of changes, I mean, it goes back to what we talked about earlier, really focusing the field on what matters. And as I mentioned earlier, as soon as we utter the words LC at Waters, we have a genuine enthusiasm across the organization. I mean we have not just our portfolio, but our service teams are state-of-the-art. So I think having the organization focus on LC, giving them Arc HPLC as a new product, and it was especially designed for China, in particular, right? So giving them Arc HPLC and PREMIER to go out and have these conversations with the LC customers has been a terrific initiative.
Secondly, I also mentioned our CXO or our contract testing and contract research organization initiative. That's also done rather well in China. Our team has gone out to meet contract manufacturers. We've increased our penetration in contact testing organizations in the food segment. It's, again, one data point, but it's a good data point. I'm reluctant to start extrapolating too much, but it's a good data point that it gives us confidence that activity is at a higher level.
Now as far as incentives are concerned, they are no different than they have been in the past. It's just a question of focus. But given the team's new products, giving them clarity on which customers to go after and working with them to succeed, I think, are the key success factors I would point to."

The team has gone and reached out to each and every one of those customers. And now we have to make sure that our value propositions work before we start to see meaningful growth in that area.
And then across clinical, China is one of those markets that in the past grew very well in that segment. I mean, this year, we've seen some headwinds, especially on -- especially due to the diversion towards COVID-19 testing. So I expect that to come back. So across the board, we see some good opportunities in China.
Now talking at a bit of a higher level, in the pharma industry in China, if you look at the latest 5-year plan, it calls for having roughly 45% or so of the production for biopharmaceuticals occurring locally in China for China use. And today, that number is around 20 -- between 20% and 25%. So there's a commitment in the Chinese government and the Chinese economy to increase pharma consumption. So we feel rather well placed with our portfolio, with our commercial focus to go after the opportunity in pharma as well as in food.
And from a portfolio perspective, our Arc HPLC was specifically designed for the Chinese LC market. Our tandem quad portfolio is doing rather well for traditional Chinese medicine and food testing and environmental testing in China. So I feel very good from a portfolio perspective and from a commercial perspective on the base we've set, but it's -- as I said, it's a good start. It's a start all the same. So we're a bit prudent about what we want to see in the future."

Along with Bryan joining me on this morning's call is Mike Silveira, Waters' Vice President, Corporate Controller and Interim CFO. 
I would like to start by expressing how grateful I am to our colleagues for their continued hard work and commitment, especially to those who are continuing to experience the devastating effects of the pandemic. We have not yet seen a uniform recovery as there are still many regions around the world that are being ravaged by the pandemic. As many of you are aware, India is facing a particularly dire situation at the moment. Our colleagues and customers there are very much on our minds, and we're working closely with our team in India to ensure safety of our employees and their families, and we're doing all we can to support our customers. 
During today's call, I will provide you a brief overview of our first quarter operating results as well as an update on our 3-phase transformation plan focused on: Number one, regaining our commercial momentum; number two, further strengthening our organization with leadership and performance management; and number three, aligning our portfolio with growth areas. 
Next, I will provide some thoughts on how our business is positioned to drive sustainable growth. Mike will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our updated second quarter -- on our updated second quarter and full year financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions. 
Briefly reviewing our operating results for the first quarter. Revenue grew 31% as reported, 27% on a constant currency basis, and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share grew 99% year-over-year. This strong start to the year was driven by growth across all end markets as we saw continued strength in pharma and earlier-than-expected recovery in non-pharma spending by our customers, new product traction and strong commercial execution by our team. 
Looking more closely at our top line results. First, from a customer end market perspective, all our end markets grew double digits during the first quarter. Our largest market category, pharma, grew 28% in constant currency. Industrial grew 24% and academic and government grew 29%. 
Moving now to our sales performance by geography. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia grew 41%, with China up 109%. Sales in Americas grew 14%, with U.S. growing 13% and sales in Europe grew 25%. 
From an operating segment perspective, our Waters division grew 26%, while TA grew by 28% on a constant currency basis. 
Customer activity continued to improve in the first quarter with pharma leading the way, driving better-than-expected trends and recurring revenues, and a significant growth in instrument revenue. Recurring revenues grew 15%, with services growing 14% and chemistry consumables revenue growing 18%, driven by combined pharma strength and improved industrial demand. LC instruments grew across all of our major geographies and market categories with more than 40% growth. It's encouraging to see both HPLC and UPLC instrument units grow double digits driven by pent-up demand, penetration of the Arc HPLC and strong execution of our LC replacement initiative. The success of the launch of the Arc HPLC in the general purpose HPLC space cannot be understated, and the ACQUITY PREMIER has been received very well by customers since its February launch. 
Mass spec sales were also strong in the first quarter with growth in excess of 50% as demand in the pharma market remained robust. In addition to rebounds, we saw in other markets, including clinical, food and environmental and biomedical research. Demand was solid for our tandem quads in Europe and China, particularly in pharma and in food. 
Finally, to TA, revenue grew 28% as demand rebounded in the core industrial business and strength continued in pharma, medical devices and semiconductors. Growth was robust across all major geographies and product lines with particular strength in thermal and electro force. 
Looking deeper at our sales performance by geography, all major regions grew double digits. China built further on last quarter's strength, more than doubling sales year-over-year. Results were strong across all end markets as China continued its recovery from last year's COVID disruptions. Pharma was particularly strong in China, driven by triple-digit growth in both contract labs and traditional Chinese medicine. Our food business in China also saw meaningful growth driven by a significant rebound in contract testing organizations to the level that were above those we saw in 2018 and in 2019. This is just one quarter and not indicative of a trend, but it demonstrates that the market is recovering and our execution has improved. 
India sales grew double digits for the third consecutive quarter despite worsening conditions and continued pandemic challenges throughout the country. 
Europe experienced broad-based strength across all customer end markets, including meaningful sequential improvements in both industrial and academic and government markets. 
In the U.S., both pharma and industrial markets had strong growth in the quarter. While demand in our academic and government market remains soft, as it lags behind other markets in reopening. 
In summary, we had a great start to the year with strong year-on-year growth that was broadly based than last quarter with impressive performance across all our regions, end markets and product categories. Pharma demand has not subsided and many of our nonpharma markets are now in the process of recovering, which gives us greater confidence as we look to the remainder of the year. 
Now I would like to talk more broadly about our business and its overall direction moving forward, including the strength of the company, the attractiveness of the markets that we serve and our deep commitment to innovation as we look beyond this quarter into the longer term. 
Our 3-phase transformation plan is: Number one, regaining our commercial momentum; number two, strengthening our organization with leadership and performance management; and number three, aligning our portfolio with growth areas. 
Looking at our first priority of regaining our commercial momentum, let me review some initiatives I mentioned previously. First, our instrument replacement initiative. We delivered a significant acceleration in instrument revenue growth to 45%. In February, we launched the ACQUITY PREMIER system, augmenting the already solid placement of Arc HPLC launched in June of 2020, creating new opportunities for instrument replacements. Additionally, we have gained traction with customers to replace aging tandem quad mass spec instruments with newer instruments. 
Second, as part of our CRO CDMO expansion initiatives, we've seen revenue growth accelerate to strong double digits in both these customer segments. Customers continue to perceive us as a strong technical partner as they transfer methods from originators, and they see us as a strong collaborator rather than a competitor. 
Third, our e-commerce initiative has begun to deliver tangible results. Search engine optimization and paid search have led to search impressions that are up more than 40% year-on-year. While not every click translates to immediate revenue, increasing traffic is an important first step in our e-commerce efforts. 
Fourth, driving launch excellence. Let me start with liquid chromatography. While the Arc HPLC is a leader in general purpose HPLC space, I want to focus on the ACQUITY PREMIER. Last year, we launched ACQUITY PREMIER Columns and followed that up with the ACQUITY PREMIER system last quarter. Though we're still in the early stages of the revenue ramp-up for both the columns and the system sales of ACQUITY PREMIER Columns, are significantly outpacing prior successful chemistry launches, including the original ACUITY Columns. 
Turning to mass spec. In 2019, we launched the BioAccord, Cyclic IMS, SYNAPT, TQ-S cronos and a next-generation version of our TQ-S micro. Bearing our tandem cord with ACQUITY PREMIER creates industry-leading reproducibility and sensitivity for challenging assays. With expanding applications of the BioAccord, we've maintained our focus on bringing a versatile, easy-to-use and robust LC-MS system to the QA/QC space. During Q1, we launched a full workflow for peptide multi-attribute method on the new waters_connect platform to enable the monitoring of quality attributes at the peptide level. This adds to already existing simple-to-use applications of peptide mapping, impact subunit mass analysis, released glycan profiling and oligonucleotide mass confirmation. Over the last year, we established a BioAccord into the workflows for characterizing mRNA molecules that have since become vaccines. In fact, BioNTech recognized Waters for our support of its COVID-19 vaccine development and release efforts. Lastly, Cyclic was launched in September of 2019 and is targeted at the most advanced high-resolution mass spec users. Augmenting traditional LC-MS with high-resolution ion mobility, allows us to separate molecules with additional -- with identical molecular rate based on their different shapes. This is now especially relevant for monitoring structural changes in the sugar pattern of the spike protein of the SAR CoV-2 virus. 
We do recognize that we still have a bit of work to do on our mass spec informatics applications, and we're addressing this through the development and rollout of our waters_connect software platform across our full mass spec portfolio. Today, waters_connect supports biopharma characterization and monitoring workflows with a range of capabilities on the BioAccord, Vivo CTO and [ BioOn ] and with the launch of our [ RDA Bench topped off ] in Q1, waters_connect also enables small molecule workflows. We're grateful to have earned the trust and partnership with our customers as we develop further applications and beta test upcoming products and software. 
Next from our TA Instruments division. Last year, we launched the X3 DSC, which offers unique advantages for routine high-throughput labs and R&D, especially in pharma, electronics and advanced materials. The ability of the X3 DSC to deliver high sensitivity measurements of physical properties more quickly than comparable products is enabling these measurements to be more broadly deployed in manufacturing processes where scientists can evaluate multiple formulations in parallel reducing time to market. More time I spent with my R&D colleagues, together with our customers, the more impressed I am with the strength of our deeply, deeply technical culture. 
Moving on to our second priority. You've already seen the planned leadership transitions we announced last month. [ Amol ] will join us as CFO on May 12. Amol has deep experience in [ informatics ] and has led many transformations in his prior roles through both organic and inorganic growth. I would like to sincerely thank Mike Silveira for his 4 months of service as interim CFO. Mike will continue to serve as our Corporate Controller, and I'm pleased to add that Mike will also assume the role of Chief Accounting Officer. 
Secondly, we've established a dedicated Innovation Board, which I will share that includes [indiscernible] from R&D, business development and marketing. The Innovation Board will review unmet needs in markets we serve, assess technology proof of concepts and monitor the execution of top R&D programs. 
Thirdly, I'd like to thank Mike Harrington and Ian King, our SVPs of Global Markets and Global Products, respectively, for their decades of dedication to Waters. Though their retirements are effective July 2, they're graciously offered to service consultants for a period of time to ensure a smooth transition. 
Finally, we welcome our own John Pratt, as the leaders of the Waters Division, where he and Bennett will succeed John at the DA division. Both John and Jan Chang have deep commercial and transformation experience in global leadership [indiscernible] in fast-growing markets such as molecular diagnostics and bioprocessing. 
I'm really pleased with our new team, and I look forward to introducing them to you in the coming months. 
That brings us to our third priority, aligning our portfolio with high-growth areas. While we won't take our eye off commercial execution, which remains our top priority, we have recently started our strategic planning process. Now I'd like to share you -- share with you some high-level thoughts on where we are today. 
Our #1 priority is to continue strengthening the core, meaning LC-MS and materials characterization instruments, informatics, service and consumables. Second, is tapping into faster-growing adjacencies where we can bring our strength of managing compliant data without competing directly with our customers. These adjacencies include opportunities to increase our exposure to biologics, be it in reagents, other instrument technologies or bioprocessing, all in accelerating LC-MS into diagnostics or other high-growth markets. Lastly, we will maintain our long-standing disciplined approach to financial management, capital structure and capital deployment as we are focused on maintaining a top-tier ROIC. 
Over the coming year, I look forward to sharing more with you on our strategy as well as the data points that give us confidence that we have the foundation in place to sustainably grow in this attractive market. 
With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Mike Silveira for a deeper review of the first quarter financials and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Mike?"

In the first quarter, we recorded net sales $609 million, an increase of approximately 27% in constant currency. Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 4%, resulting in sales growth of 31% as reported. 
Looking at product line growth. Our revenue -- our reoccurring revenue, which represents the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue, increased by 15% for the quarter, while instrument sales increased 45%. Chemistry  revenues were up 18% for the quarter, driven by strong pharma market growth and improving industrial demand. 
On the service side of our business, revenues were up 14% as customers continue to reopen labs and catch up on performance maintenance, professional services and repair business. As we noted on our last earnings call, reoccurring sales were impacted by 5 additional calendar days in the quarter, which primarily impacted service revenues. Looking ahead compared to 2020, there is no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days for this year's second or third quarter. However, there are fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Breaking first quarter operating segment sales down further. Sales related to Waters Division sales grew 26%, while TA instruments sales grew 28%. Combined, LC and LC-MS instrument sales were up 47%, while TA system sales grew 34%. 
Now I'd like to comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.2%, a 350 basis point increase compared to 54.7% in the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to an increase in sales volume and favorable FX. 
Moving down the first quarter P&L. Operating expenses increased by approximately 9% on a constant currency basis and 11% on a reported basis. The increase was primarily attributed to higher labor incentive compensation cost and higher depreciation from IT investments we made over the last few years. 
In the first quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 14%, an increase from last year, as compared to the comparable period -- included some favorable discrete items in the prior year. Net interest expense was $7 million for the quarter, a decrease of about $3 million as anticipated on lower average outstanding debt balances. Our average share count came in at 62.6 million shares, flat with the first quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter increased 99% to $2.29 in comparison to the $1.15 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $2.37 compared to $0.86 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning. 
Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet, I would like to summarize our first quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and excluding certain special items. In the first quarter of 2021, free cash flow grew 60% year-over-year to $193 million after funding $40 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $14 million related to the investment in our precision chemistry operation. In the first quarter, this resulted in $0.32 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. Our increased free cash flow was primarily a result of sales growth and better operating margins compared to the prior year. 
In the quarter, accounts receivable days sales outstanding came in at 84 days, down 15 days compared to the first quarter of last year. Inventory decreased by $16 million in comparison to the prior year quarter on higher sales volumes. 
Waters maintains a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares of common stock for $173 million in the first quarter. These capital allocation activities, along with our free cash flow, results in cash and short-term investments of $810 million and debt of $1.7 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $893 million and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1x at the end of the first quarter. 
Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent: Investment growth, maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility and return capital to shareholders. We remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities. And as Udit commented earlier, we have begun a new strategic planning process. As we continue to execute against our priorities, we will evaluate deploying capital to open up attractive and adjacent markets. 
As we look forward to the remainder of the year ahead, I would like to provide some updated context on our thoughts for 2021. One, while the business environment remains subject to volatility, we are seeing good momentum in our market segments, which will help us exceed the 2019 levels. Two, we believe this momentum will continue into the second quarter, but that the strong double-digit growth will mostly occur in the first half of the year due to more challenging comparisons in the second half of the year and the 6 fewer calendar days that we will have in the fourth quarter. Three, we continue to expect that all major geographies will perform better this year than they did in 2020, led by growth in China. Four, our near-term growth initiatives are expected to continue to ramp, led by our LC replacement initiative, which we expect to contribute increasingly to our performance. These dynamics support updated full year 2021 guidance for constant currency sales growth of 8% to 11%. At current rates, the positive currency translation to 2021 sales growth is expected to be approximately 1 to 2 percentage points. 
Gross margin for the full year is expected to be between 57.5% and 58%. Every year, we look to balance growth, investment and profitability. Accordingly, we expect 2021 operating margins of between 28% and 29% based on a combination of investments the normalization of COVID-related cost and disciplined expense controls. 
Moving now below the operating income line. Other key assumptions for the full year guidance are as follows: Net interest expense of $35 million to $38 million, and full year tax rate in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%. The net impact of our share repurchase program in 2021 that will result in an average diluted 2021 share count of 61.5 million to 62 million shares outstanding. Over the course of the year, we will evaluate our share repurchase program and provide quarterly updates as appropriate. Rolling all this together, and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $9.85 to $10.05, which assumes a positive currency impact on full year earnings per share growth of approximately 3 percentage points. 
Looking at the second quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 14% to 16%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to increase second quarter sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25 as a significant prior year COVID cost savings actions start to normalize. At current rate, the positive currency impact on second quarter earnings per share growth is expected to be approximately 1 percentage point. 
Now I'd like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?"

I think you'll have do very sophisticated math, but it's 2% to 3% contribution. And that's quite impressive, especially on the LC side, given the launches just took place, right? So Arc HPLC was launched only in June of last year, smack in the middle of the pandemic, and that has had great uptake, especially in China for general purpose HPLC. And then the ACQUITY PREMIER, the columns were launched last year, and we saw, I would say, absolutely terrific uptake. In fact, better than the ACQUITY launch originally. 
And then finally and then finally, as I look at the mass spec growth, I mean, our replacement initiative is doing well, especially with the launch of our renewed tandem quad portfolio. So really a lot to be excited about on the new product side."

So look, I mean, super happy with China, especially given the pandemic is still not over, and our colleagues have really done a great job of implementing our initiatives, and some of that is contributing to the growth. I mean, it's terrific growth across all segments, especially pharma, which doubled and then you saw industrial also grew very nicely. And academic and government was in the mid-70 percentages, right? 
So -- but that said, what I would argue is pharma is continuing to show strength. Industrial is also starting to get stronger, especially in the TA business. Academic and government on a stacked basis still has some work to do, right? So we still want to make sure that we focus on it as the market recovers. 
And then, I look at the portfolio side, instruments grew very nicely as you again saw from the prepared remarks. And the consumables portion of the business was in the mid-40s in terms of percentage growth. 
Look, as I look at our -- the implementation of our initiatives that I mentioned earlier, they're contributing nicely. We singled out the food market in the past for commentary when we talked about transformation. So let me just comment on that. We saw incredible growth in the contract testing market for food, both in the government segment and with new customers, right? Remember, I spoke about that when we talked about the transformation plan. And with the CDMO segment, some of our best performance is in China. 
And then finally, I have a lot to thank in terms of our -- in terms of our leadership in China. We have a new leader in China and have really a renewed focus on growth. That said, I would caution against taking 2 data points of recovery and saying that we have completely turned the business. We still remain focused, but I'm very happy with the stock. 
I think for your -- I didn't answer your question for the full year. Full year, I think no reason to expect anything less than high teens in China, and that will be a very good stacked growth as well versus last year."

I mean, if we place more instruments, we get more consumable and more service down the line, and we saw a very nice recovery. It is a mix of everything, right? So we saw a recovery -- we've seen continued strength in pharma, but we also saw a nice recovery in industrials and also in academia. 
In terms of the contribution, our initiatives have been doing extremely well, our LC replacement initiative. And now we've added the mass spec initiative as well, is doing super well. And that is now being helped by the launch of Arc HPLC and the ACQUITY PREMIER, which are allowing us to focus both on the general purpose segment, but also on the UPLC segment. So it's very difficult to extract how much is coming from going and finding only replacement and then how much is coming from the new products that are actually helping that conversation. So really added together, it's a very good performance. And also, from a stacked comp basis, it's looking very good as you've already commented, I mean, LC is doing very nicely from a 29 basis -- from a 2019 basis, and mass spec is almost double digits on that front. So really very happy with what we've been able to do on -- do with our initiatives. 
And then finally, on the CRO, CDMO area, I mean, we have had incredible -- in fact, last Friday, I was with incredible conversations with CDMOs, especially last Friday, I was with the CEO of one of the leading CDMOs and they perceive us as very strong partners to help them transfer methods for complex molecules. And this is something that has come more and more to the front end center globally as we talk to many of these customers. Of course, I mean, they're focused on costs. But even more importantly, they're focused on transferring these methods from originators. So I think the initiatives are doing well, but there's a lot more to do there. We've just -- I mean, I would say, in terms of penetration of our instrument space, we're 30% along the way mass spec. I would say, we're about slightly more than that on the LC side. So we still have [indiscernible] there to see more growth."

LC-MS for diagnostics, right? So we work very closely with the U.K. government on the COVID Moonshot program, and we were able to develop LC-MS for -- as a diagnostic tool for detecting pathogens. This is not going to be submitted as an IUO later -- mid this year or later this year. For research use only, at least, initially, but we see incredible traction in that area, and we are investing behind it. So those are the kinds of examples that come to the Innovation Board.

On the end markets, specifically industrial cyclical, recognizing all end markets were pretty solid, I'd love to hear more about what you're seeing in terms of the pickup in cyclical demand. How does that evolve over the course of Q1? And are there signs that demand is picking up in a sustainable way that -- meaning this just isn't a catch-up. It is actually a function of global economic improvement. And if you're seeing signs of that as exemplified for things by things like backlog, are there certain geographies where this is more or less notable? So that's the first topic. 
A second topic is just, again, sorry to go back to guidance, but specifically below the top line as we think about operating spend. When I look at our model for Q1, R&D and SG&A, together, were about $10 million below our forecast. And I think we were the high on The Street for revenue, and you came in $50 million above our forecast. So that was really nice leverage in the model. I'm just wondering, was there any holdback on investment in the early part of the year just given all the uncertainty because it doesn't seem like you're looking at this as the new normal. I say that because it seems like guidance assumes there's going to be an increase in operating investment moving forward over the balance of the year, which I think makes sense given the strength in your business and some of the initiatives you talked about in your prepared remarks. So I guess I'm just hoping you can provide some clarity there. It seems like Q1 operating leverage isn't the new normal just because you want to invest. I just want to make sure we got that right."

I think you rightly note that it is one quarter, and we are seeing a nice rebound. I'm cautious here, right? So we're seeing good conversations with our customers, but the industrial end markets are disparate, right? I mean, they go from polymers to semiconductors and other areas, which inherently are cyclical. We're seeing good demand for hardware, especially on the DA side. But that said, I would say it's one quarter. We're seeing good conversations. I would not start to immediately extrapolate, and this is why we're a bit cautious on prudent on the guidance. 
On a stacked growth basis, when you look at specific regions, I mean, China is almost 20%. Europe is in the mid-teens in industrial, and the U.S. is mid-single digits. So even on a stacked basis, this is a good performance on the industrial end market, but largely driven by a lot of hardware spend. 
Now on academic and government, which is also cyclical, I know you were not asking in particular, but I'll take the opportunity to comment on this already. We saw very good growth, I mean, 29% growth overall, largely driven by what we saw in China, and Europe continued its strength, close to 70% growth. The U.S. is still spotty and recovering. On a stack basis, there's still work to do on China and the U.S. I mean, both are still not positive versus 2019. Europe is. So I think industrial, a little bit more confidence in the overall trend. With academic and government, we're seeing slow return back into the different labs more so in Europe. Definitely in China, but still a bit of hill to climb, and Europe is spotty -- and U.S. is spotty across the country. 
If I move to your guidance question, I will first give you the qualitative remark and then Mike can comment on the numbers as well. We're not holding back any investment, Doug. I mean, in fact, if you look at how much we have approved in terms of operating investment, it's fairly significant in Q1 to start -- to support our initiatives that we already mentioned. So expanding our field force and contract testing, having more informatics folks to build up waters_connect even further and to invest behind our R&D programs. I mentioned, LC-MS already, and there are several others. It's just a question of the recruiting cycle taking a bit of time and people finding the right people and getting them into the system.

So you are going to see some increase in expense as we move through the rest of the year, that catches up with these initiatives that Udit was referring to. This is a gated process. We do look at the projects one on -- we do look at each of the products' initiatives, and depending on what it is, and we have a gated process that we make sure it makes sense before we actually start the process. So it is a gated process, and we will expect not the leverage to be not as good as it was in Q1 the rest of this year."

It's very difficult to translate that, as you know, into the exact impact on revenues. So I won't attempt that, but it's -- in my largest impact is on the consumables side. And especially with newer products, it's worked out extremely well, having the ability to drive more people on to the channel find out more information, leading to purchase and a great uptake for our ACQUITY PREMIER launch. 
Now in terms of the overall plan for e-commerce, I mean, this is just the start, right? So remember, I said early on, that we want to take the hand we have and do the best we can with it at the beginning as we make our plans to revitalize our platforms. And I mentioned a couple of those investments in the previous question as well. So we do believe that investing in a data lake that takes all unstructured and structured data from different parts of the organization and putting that into an easily accessible middle layer will help us service our e-commerce customers better. We do believe investing in content even more is going to lead to better conversion on the e-commerce channel. We do believe investing in mobile is going to lead to a better conversion. So you can see that there are some infrastructural investments that we have started to look at. And as the organization becomes stronger and stronger, we'll start -- you'll start to see us invest in those. So the e-commerce plan as a few phases, the first one was just to get the quick wins, and we're not done with that yet. That's just a start. And there is a long-term plan that will build a world-class e-commerce platform for Waters. I hope that helps."

And when you talk about innings, If you're talking about baseball, probably we're in the third inning. There's a lot more work to do and a lot more to pick up there. And we haven't done that in the past. We haven't replaced our own instruments. So I mean, we are going in, and it's working out super well, especially with the new products being available as well, both on the HPLC side and UPLC side. So we're very happy with where we are there. 
To your question on competitor instruments, definitely, that's the second step. And then there's a third step, everybody and anybody who's using Empower, that probably also hits the competitor side. So there's a large installed base. And any time somebody is trying to replace an HPLC or UPLC, you should expect Waters to be in that conversation, especially -- and this is especially important given that Empower is installed as the most ubiquitous CDS system. So we are going to leverage the strength of Empower to try and make sure that we have a seat at the table virtually everywhere. 
The second thing that I wanted to add is from an instrument perspective, I mean, don't forget mass spec. Mass spec also has an older army of instruments that we've sold over many years. And there, too, we completely renewed our tandem core portfolio in 2019, and we're using that to get in and have conversations with our customers. So that also -- that probably is in your baseball analogy in the first innings. And that's also started off very well. So expect to hear more as the year progresses, and we do intend to make sure that, that continues and gets tracked very carefully. 
And the last piece on that, that I'll add, this is also to a previous question on the areas we're investing in. We've been invested in basically collecting all the data that we have on the installed base, be it Empower-based, be it instrument-based and of course, to automate it and to make it to make it readily usable, you need to invest in technology, and that's what we're doing. So I hope that gives you more color."

Along with Bryan joining me on this morning's call is Michael Silveira, Waters' Vice President, Corporate Controller and Interim CFO.  
I would like to start by expressing how grateful I am to our colleagues for their continued hard work and commitment, especially to those who are continuing to experience the devastating effects of the pandemic. We have not yet seen a uniform recovery as there are still many regions around the world that are being ravaged by the pandemic. 
As many of you are aware, India is facing a particularly dire situation at the moment. Our colleagues and customers, they are very much on our minds, and we're working closely with our team in India to ensure safety of our employees and their families, and we're doing all we can to support our customers.  
During today's call, I will provide you a brief overview of our first quarter operating results as well as an update on our 3-phase transformation plan focused on: Number one, regaining our commercial momentum; number two, further strengthening our organization with leadership and performance management; and number three, aligning our portfolio with growth areas.  
Next, I will provide some thoughts on how our business is positioned to drive sustainable growth. Mike will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our updated second quarter -- on our updated second quarter and full year financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.  
Briefly reviewing our operating results. For the first quarter, revenue grew 31% as reported, 27% on a constant currency basis, and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share grew 99% year-over-year. This strong start to the year was driven by growth across all end markets as we saw continued strength in pharma and earlier-than-expected recovery in non-pharma spending by our customers, new product traction and strong commercial execution by our team.  
Looking more closely at our top line results. First, from a customer end market perspective, all our end markets grew double digits during the first quarter. Our largest market category, pharma, grew 28% in constant currency. Industrial grew 24% and academic and government grew 29%.  
Moving now to our sales performance by geography. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia grew 41%, with China up 109%. Sales in Americas grew 14%, with U.S. growing 13% and sales in Europe grew 25%.  
From an operating segment perspective, our Waters division grew 26%, while TA grew by 28% on a constant currency basis.  
Customer activity continued to improve in the first quarter with pharma leading the way, driving better-than-expected trends and recurring revenues, and a significant growth in instrument revenue. Recurring revenues grew 15%, with services growing 14% and chemistry consumables revenue growing 18%, driven by combined pharma strength and improved industrial demand. 
LC instruments grew across all of our major geographies and market categories with more than 40% growth. It's encouraging to see both HPLC and UPLC instrument units grow double digits driven by pent-up demand, penetration of the Arc HPLC and strong execution of our LC replacement initiative. 
The success of the launch of the Arc HPLC in the general purpose HPLC space cannot be understated, and the ACQUITY PREMIER has been received very well by customers since its February launch.  
Mass spec sales were also strong in the first quarter with growth in excess of 50% as demand in the pharma market remained robust. In addition to rebounds, we saw in other markets, including clinical, food and environmental and biomedical research. Demand was solid for our tandem quads in Europe and China, particularly in pharma and in food.  
Finally, to TA, revenue grew 28% as demand rebounded in the core industrial business and strength continued in pharma, medical devices and semiconductors. Growth was robust across all major geographies and product lines with particular strength in thermal and electro force.  
Looking deeper at our sales performance by geography, all major regions grew double digits. China built further on last quarter's strength, more than doubling sales year-over-year. Results were strong across all end markets as China continued its recovery from last year's COVID disruptions. 
Pharma was particularly strong in China, driven by triple-digit growth in both contract labs and traditional Chinese medicine. 
Our food business in China also saw meaningful growth driven by a significant rebound in contract testing organizations to the level that were above those we saw in 2018 and in 2019. This is just one quarter and not indicative of a trend, but it demonstrates that the market is recovering and our execution has improved. 
India sales grew double digits for the third consecutive quarter despite worsening conditions and continued pandemic challenges throughout the country.  
Europe experienced broad-based strength across all customer end markets, including meaningful sequential improvements in both industrial and academic and government markets.  
In the U.S., both pharma and industrial markets had strong growth in the quarter. While demand in our academic and government market remains soft, as it lags behind other markets in reopening.  
In summary, we had a great start to the year with strong year-on-year growth that was broadly based than last quarter, with impressive performance across all our regions, end markets and product categories. Pharma demand has not subsided and many of our nonpharma markets are now in the process of recovering, which gives us greater confidence as we look to the remainder of the year.  
Now I would like to talk more broadly about our business and its overall direction moving forward, including the strength of the company, the attractiveness of the markets that we serve and our deep commitment to innovation as we look beyond this quarter into the longer term.  
Our 3-phase transformation plan is: Number one, regaining our commercial momentum; number two, strengthening our organization with leadership and performance management; and number three, aligning our portfolio with growth areas.  
Looking at our first priority of regaining our commercial momentum, let me review some initiatives I mentioned previously. First, our instrument replacement initiative. We delivered a significant acceleration in instrument revenue growth to 45%. In February, we launched the ACQUITY PREMIER system, augmenting the already solid placement of Arc HPLC launched in June of 2020, creating new opportunities for instrument replacements. Additionally, we have gained traction with customers to replace aging tandem quad, mass spec instruments with newer instruments.  
Second, as part of our CRO CDMO expansion initiatives, we've seen revenue growth accelerate to strong double digits in both these customer segments. Customers continue to perceive us as a strong technical partner as they transfer methods from originators, and they see us as a strong collaborator rather than a competitor.  
Third, our e-commerce initiative has begun to deliver tangible results. Search engine optimization and paid search have led to search impressions that are up more than 40% year-on-year. While not every click translates to immediate revenue, increasing traffic is an important first step in our e-commerce efforts.  
Fourth, driving launch excellence. Let me start with liquid chromatography. While the Arc HPLC is a leader in general purpose HPLC space, I want to focus on the ACQUITY Premier. Last year, we launched the ACQUITY Premier Columns and followed that up with the ACQUITY Premier System last quarter. Though we're still in the early stages of the revenue ramp-up for both the Columns and the System, sales of ACQUITY Premier Columns, are significantly outpacing prior successful chemistry launches, including the original ACQUITY Columns.  
Turning to mass spec. In 2019, we launched the BioAccord, Cyclic IMS, SYNAPT XS, TQ-S cronos and a next-generation version of our TQ-S micro. Pairing our tandem quads with ACQUITY Premier creates industry-leading reproducibility and sensitivity for challenging assays. With expanding applications of the BioAccord, we've maintained our focus on bringing a versatile, easy-to-use and robust LC-MS system to the QA/QC space. 
During Q1, we launched a full workflow for peptide multi-attribute method on the new waters_connect platform to enable the monitoring of quality attributes at the peptide level. This adds to already existing simple-to-use applications of peptide mapping, impact subunit mass analysis, released glycan profiling and oligonucleotide mass confirmation. 
Over the last year, we established a BioAccord into the workflows for characterizing mRNA molecules that have since become vaccines. In fact, BioNTech recognized Waters for our support of its COVID-19 vaccine development and release efforts. 
Lastly, Cyclic was launched in September of 2019 and is targeted at the most advanced high-resolution mass spec users. Augmenting traditional LC-MS with high-resolution ion mobility, allows us to separate molecules with additional -- with identical molecular weight based on their different shapes. This is now especially relevant for monitoring structural changes in the sugar pattern of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  
We do recognize that we still have a bit of work to do on our mass spec informatics applications, and we're addressing this through the development and rollout of our waters_connect software platform across our full mass spec portfolio. 
Today, waters_connect supports biopharma characterization and monitoring workflows with a range of capabilities on the BioAccord, Xevo, QTof and Vion and with the launch of our RDa BenchTOF in Q1, waters_connect also enables small molecule workflows. We're grateful to have earned the trust and partnership with our customers as we develop further applications and beta test upcoming products and software.  
Next from our TA Instruments division. Last year, we launched the X3 DSC, which offers unique advantages for routine high-throughput labs and R&D, especially in pharma, electronics and advanced materials. The ability of the X3 DSC to deliver high sensitivity measurements of physical properties more quickly than comparable products is enabling these measurements to be more broadly deployed in manufacturing processes where scientists can evaluate multiple formulations in parallel reducing time to market. 
More time I spent with my R&D colleagues together, with our customers, the more impressed I am with the strength of our deeply, deeply technical culture.  
Moving on to our second priority. You've already seen the planned leadership transitions we announced last month. Amol Chaubal will join us as CFO on May 12. Amol has deep experience in pharma and diagnostics and has led many transformations in his prior roles through both organic and inorganic growth. 
I would like to sincerely thank Mike Silveira for his 4 months of service as interim CFO. Mike will continue to serve as our Corporate Controller, and I'm pleased to add that Mike will also assume the role of Chief Accounting Officer.  
Secondly, we've established a dedicated Innovation Board, which I will share that includes leaders from R&D, business development and marketing. The Innovation Board will review unmet needs in markets we serve, assess technology proof of concepts and monitor the execution of top R&D programs. 
Thirdly, I'd like to thank Mike Harrington and Ian King, our SVPs of Global Markets and Global Products, respectively, for their decades of dedication to Waters. Though their retirements are effective July 2, they've graciously offered to service consultants for a period of time to ensure a smooth transition. 
Finally, we welcome our own Jon Pratt, as the leader of the Waters Division; Y. Jianqing Bennett will succeed Jon at the TA division. Both Jon and Jianqing have deep commercial and transformation experience in global leadership roles in fast-growing markets such as molecular diagnostics and bioprocessing. I'm really pleased with our new team, and I look forward to introducing them to you in the coming months. 
That brings us to our third priority, aligning our portfolio with high-growth areas. While we won't take our eye off commercial execution, which remains our top priority, we have recently started our strategic planning process. 
Now I'd like to share you -- share with you some high-level thoughts on where we are today. Our #1 priority is to continue strengthening the core, meaning LC-MS and materials characterization, instruments, informatics, service and consumables. 
Second, its tapping into faster-growing adjacencies where we can bring our strength of managing compliant data without competing directly with our customers. These adjacencies include opportunities to increase our exposure to biologics, be it in reagents, other instrument technologies or bioprocessing, all in accelerating LC-MS into diagnostics or other high-growth markets. 
Lastly, we will maintain our long-standing disciplined approach to financial management, capital structure and capital deployment as we are focused on maintaining a top-tier ROIC. 
Over the coming year, I look forward to sharing more with you on our strategy as well as the data points that give us confidence that we have the foundation in place to sustainably grow in this attractive market. 
With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Mike Silveira for deeper review of the first quarter financials and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Mike?"

Looking at product line growth. Our revenue -- our reoccurring revenue, which represents the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue, increased by 15% for the quarter, while instrument sales increased 45%. Chemistry  revenues were up 18% for the quarter, driven by strong pharma market growth and improving industrial demand. 
On the service side of our business, revenues were up 14% as customers continue to reopen labs and catch up on performance maintenance, professional services and repair visits. 
As we noted on our last earnings call, reoccurring sales were impacted by 5 additional calendar days in the quarter, which primarily impacted service revenues. Looking ahead compared to 2020, there is no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days for this year's second or third quarter. However, there are 6 fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Breaking first quarter operating segment sales down further. Sales related to Waters Division sales grew 26%, while TA Instruments sales grew 28%. Combined, LC and LC-MS instrument sales were up 47%, while TA system sales grew 34%. 
Now I'd like to comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.2%, a 350 basis point increase compared to 54.7% in the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to an increase in sales volume and favorable FX. 
Moving down the first quarter P&L. Operating expenses increased by approximately 9% on a constant currency basis and 11% on a reported basis. The increase was primarily attributed to higher labor incentive compensation cost and higher depreciation from IT investments we made over the last few years. 
In the first quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 14%, an increase from last year, as compared to the comparable period -- included some favorable discrete items in the prior year. 
Net interest expense was $7 million for the quarter, a decrease of about $3 million as anticipated on lower average outstanding debt balances. 
Our average share count came in at 62.6 million shares, flat with the first quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter increased 99% to $2.29 in comparison to the $1.15 last year. 
On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $2.37 compared to $0.86 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning. 
Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet, I would like to summarize our first quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and excluding certain special items. In the first quarter of 2021, free cash flow grew 60% year-over-year to $193 million after funding $40 million of capital expenditures. 
Excluded from free cash flow was $14 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation. In the first quarter, this resulted in $0.32 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. Our increased free cash flow was primarily a result of sales growth and better operating margins compared to the prior year. 
In the quarter, accounts receivable days sales outstanding came in at 84 days, down 15 days compared to the first quarter of last year. Inventory decreased by $16 million in comparison to the prior year quarter on higher sales volumes. 
Waters maintains a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares of common stock for $173 million in the first quarter. These capital allocation activities, along with our free cash flow, results in cash and short-term investments of $810 million and debt of $1.7 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $893 million and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1x at the end of the first quarter. 
Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent: Investment growth; maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility; and return capital to shareholders. We remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities. And as Udit commented earlier, we have begun a new strategic planning process. As we continue to execute against our priorities, we will evaluate deploying capital to open up attractive and adjacent markets. 
As we look forward to the remainder of the year ahead, I would like to provide some updated context on our thoughts for 2021. 
One, while the business environment remains subject to volatility, we are seeing good momentum in our market segments, which will help us exceed the 2019 levels. 
Two, we believe this momentum will continue into the second quarter, but that a strong double-digit growth will mostly occur in the first half of the year due to more challenging comparisons in the second half of the year and the 6 fewer calendar days that we will have in the fourth quarter. 
Three, we continue to expect that all major geographies will perform better this year than they did in 2020, led by growth in China. 
Four, our near-term growth initiatives are expected to continue to ramp, led by our LC replacement initiative, which we expect to contribute increasingly through our performance. These dynamics support updated full year 2021 guidance for constant currency sales growth of 8% to 11%. At current rates, the positive currency translation to 2021 sales growth is expected to be approximately 1 to 2 percentage points. 
Gross margin for the full year is expected to be between 57.5% and 58%. Every year, we look to balance growth, investment and profitability. Accordingly, we expect 2021 operating margins of between 28% and 29% based on a combination of investments, the normalization of COVID-related cost and disciplined expense controls. 
Moving now below the operating income line. Other key assumptions for the full year guidance are as follows: Net interest expense of $35 million to $38 million, a full year tax rate in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%. The net impact of our share repurchase program in 2021 that will result in an average diluted 2021 share count of 61.5 million to 62 million shares outstanding. Over the course of the year, we will evaluate our share repurchase program and provide quarterly updates as appropriate. 
Rolling all this together, and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $9.85 to $10.05, which assumes a positive currency impact on full year earnings per share growth of approximately 3 percentage points. 
Looking at the second quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 14% to 16%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to increase second quarter sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points. 
Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25 as a significant prior year COVID cost savings actions start to normalize. At current rate, the positive currency impact on second quarter earnings per share growth is expected to be approximately 1 percentage point. 
Now I'd like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?"

Now of course, if our initiatives continue to do what they're doing, and we see good execution there, and the other end markets continue to improve, we would be on the higher end of that guide.

I think you'd have do very sophisticated math, but it's 2% to 3% contribution. And that's quite impressive, especially on the LC side, given the launch just took place, right? So Arc HPLC was launched only in June of last year, smack in the middle of the pandemic, and that has had great uptake, especially in China for general purpose HPLC. 
And then the ACQUITY Premier, the Columns were launched last year, and we saw, I would say, absolutely terrific uptake. In fact, better than the ACQUITY launch originally. 
And then finally as I look at the mass spec growth, I mean, our replacement initiative is doing well, especially with the launch of our renewed tandem quad portfolio. So really lot to be excited about on the new product side."

So look, I mean, super happy with China, especially given the pandemic is still not over, and our colleagues have really done a great job of implementing our initiatives, and some of that is contributing to the growth. I mean it's terrific growth across all segments, especially pharma, which doubled and then you saw industrial also grew very nicely. And academic and government was in the mid-70 percentages, right? 
So with that said, what I would argue is, pharma is continuing to show strength. Industrial is also starting to get stronger, especially in the TA business. Academic and government on a stack basis still has some work to do, right? So we still want to make sure that we focus on it as the market recovers. 
And then, I look at the portfolio side, instruments grew very nicely as you again saw from the prepared remarks. And the consumables portion of the business was in the mid-40s in terms of percentage growth. 
Look, as I look at our -- the implementation of our initiatives that I mentioned earlier, they're contributing nicely. We singled out the food market in the past for commentary when we talked about transformation. So let me just comment on that. 
We saw incredible growth in the contract testing market for food, both in the government segment and with new customers, right? Remember, I spoke about that when we talked about the transformation plan. And with the CDMO segment, some of our best performance is in China. 
And then finally, I have a lot to thank in terms of our -- in terms of our leadership in China. We have a new leader in China and have really a renewed focus on growth. That said, I would caution against taking 2 data points of recovery and saying that we have completely turned the business. We still remain focused, but I'm very happy with the stock. 
I think for you -- I didn't answer your question for the full year. Full year, I think no reason to expect anything less than high teens in China, and that will be a very good stacked growth as well versus last year."

I mean and I think there are many things to be happy about on the instrument side, right? I mean if we place more instruments, we get more consumables and more services down the line, and we saw a very nice recovery. It is a mix of everything, right? So we saw a recovery -- we've seen continued strength in pharma, but we also saw a nice recovery in industrials and also in academia. 
In terms of the contribution, our initiatives have been doing extremely well. Our LC replacement initiative. And now we've added the mass spec initiative as well, is doing super well. And that is now being helped by the launch of Arc HPLC and the ACQUITY Premier, which are allowing us to focus both on the general purpose segment, but also on the UPLC segment. 
So it's very difficult to extract how much is coming from -- going and finding only replacement and then how much is coming from the new products that are actually helping that conversation. So really added together, it's a very good performance. 
And also, from a stacked comp basis, it's looking very good as you've already commented, I mean, LC is doing very nicely on a -- from a 29 basis -- from 2019 basis, and mass spec is almost double digits on that front. So really very happy with what we've been able to do on -- do with our initiatives. 
And then finally, on the CRO, CDMO area, I mean, we have had incredible -- in fact, last Friday, I was with incredible conversations with CDMOs, especially, last Friday, I was with the CEO of one of the leading CDMOs. And they perceive us as very strong partners to help them transfer methods for complex molecules. 
And this is something that has come more and more to the front and center globally as we talk to many of these customers. Of course, I mean, they're focused on costs. But even more importantly, they're focused on transferring these methods from originators. 
So I think the initiatives are doing well, but there's a lot more to do there. We've just -- I mean, I would say, in terms of penetration of our instrument space, we're 30% along the way on mass spec. I would say, we're about slightly more than that on the LC side. So we still have fertile ground there to see more growth."

LC-MS for diagnostics, right? So we work very closely with the U.K. government on the COVID Moon Shot programme, and we were able to develop LC-MS for -- as a diagnostic tool for detecting pathogens. This is not going to be submitted as an IUO later -- mid this year or later this year. For research use only, at least, initially, but we see incredible traction in that area, and we are investing behind it. So those are the kinds of examples that come to the Innovation Board. And if we see room to invest, we will. 
Second type of ideas where we invest our platforms, right? So I already mentioned from a commercial perspective, e-commerce, but also taking the disparate data that exists in the organization and putting them into a data lake, right? 
So I would be loathed to tell you, hey, this is the ratio that we're trying to manage. Of course, it's a cost-conscious organization, as you know, from the past. We will not do silly things.

Our HPLC and the ACQUITY Premier, especially helped in having the conversation. Anything -- and we started the program first with our own installed base, then looking at the competitor installed base. And the third step would be to look at everybody and anybody who's using Empower, right? 
So it's a pretty large pool and we have -- we are just, I would say, 1/3 of the way with our own instruments in terms of getting that replacement cycle done. So there's a lot of room there. That said, the conversation is more straightforward. If you have new products, especially the Arc HPLC as well as the ACQUITY Premier. 
And then finally, given our reputation as a solid service company and our service engineers absolutely help. So I think the answer is in your question. It's all of the above. 
For mass spec, we also -- we've also launched a similar program. And there, the success rates are absolutely terrific. We're going after our own installed base from a tandem quad perspective and replacing the older instruments with the newer generation of tandem quads that were introduced in 2019. So nice progress. 
Some of it is the market, but I think a significant amount is our renewed focus on the replacement cycle of older instruments, helped by new products and a broader value proposition. 
As far as pricing and bundling, except pricing is concerned, we have not had to use heck of a lot of pricing to make this happen. People trust the quality that Waters brings and the innovation that we're bringing to them to solve these problems."

From an organic standpoint, I can give you examples. We think the molecular diagnostics space is interesting, and LC-MS is ripe to get into that space. We've made really serious progress in working closely with many academics in the U.K. and the NHS to take LC-MS into the diagnostic space for pathogens with COVID-19. 
We also worked with folks in Sweden on the same topic. And we will introduce LC-MS as a research-use only technique rather in the near future. So organically, we see tremendous opportunity as well. 
And another example would be entering bioprocessing. We're looking at partnerships with leading academic institutions and many of our partners to take LC-MS into the bioprocessing suite and not just leave it in the QA/QC space where we still have room to grow. 
And then finally, on inorganic areas, we're looking at that very, very carefully, and there'll be more to say about it as time progresses. So all of the above."

On the end markets, specifically industrial cyclical, recognizing all end markets were pretty solid, I'd love to hear more about what you're seeing in terms of the pickup in cyclical demand. How does that evolve over the course of Q1? And are there signs that demand is picking up in a sustainable way that -- meaning this just isn't a catch-up. It is actually a function of global economic improvement. And if you're seeing signs of that as exemplified for things I think like backlog, are there certain geographies where this is more or less notable? So that's the first topic. 
A second topic is just, again, sorry to go back to guidance, but specifically, below the top line as we think about operating spend. When I look at our model for Q1, R&D and SG&A, together, were about $10 million below our forecast. And I think we were at the high on The Street for revenue, and it came in $50 million above our forecast. So that was really nice leverage in the model. 
I'm just wondering, was there any holdback on investment in the early part of the year, just given all the uncertainty because it doesn't seem like you're looking at this as the new normal. I say that because it seems like guidance assumes there's going to be an increase in operating investment moving forward over the balance of the year, which I think makes sense, given the strength in your business and some of the initiatives you talked about in your prepared remarks, Udit.
So I guess I'm just hoping you can provide some clarity there. It seems like Q1 operating leverage isn't the new normal just because you want to invest. I just want to make sure we got that right."

First, on the other 2 end markets, industrial and academic and government, I think you rightly note that it is one quarter, and we are seeing a nice rebound. I'm cautious here, right? So we're seeing good conversations with our customers, but the industrial end markets are disparate, right? 
I mean, they go from polymers to semiconductors and other areas, which inherently are cyclical. We're seeing good demand for hardware, especially on the TA side. But that said, I would say it's one quarter. We're seeing good conversations. I would not start to immediately extrapolate, and this is why we're a bit cautious on prudent on the guidance. 
On a stacked growth basis, when you look at specific regions, I think, China is almost 20%. Europe is in the mid-teens in industrial, and the U.S. is mid-single digits. So even on a stacked basis, this is a good performance on the industrial end market, but largely driven by a lot of hardware spend. 
Now on academic and government, which is also cyclical, I know you were not asking in particular, but I'll take the opportunity to comment on this already. 
We saw very good growth, I mean, 29% growth overall, largely driven by what we saw in China. And Europe continued its strength, close to 70% growth. The U.S. is still spotty and recovering. On a stack basis, there's still work to do on China and the U.S. I mean both are still not positive versus 2019. Europe is. So I think industrial, a little bit more confidence in the overall trend. 
With academic and government, we're seeing slow return back into the different labs more so in Europe. Definitely in China, but still a bit of hill to climb, and Europe is spotty -- and U.S. is spotty across the country. 
If I move to your guidance question, I will first give you the qualitative remark and then Mike can comment on the numbers as well. We're not holding back any investment, Doug. And in fact, if you look at how much we have approved in terms of operating investment, it's fairly significant in Q1 to start -- to support our initiatives that we already mentioned. So expanding our field force and contract testing, having more informatics folks to build up waters_connect even further and to invest behind our R&D programs. I mentioned, LC-MS already, and there are several others. It's just a question of the recruiting cycle taking a bit of time and people finding the right people and getting them into the system. So really not holding back there at all. 
Mike, do you want to comment on the numbers?"

From an e-commerce, basically, with just engine optimization and paid search, we saw a 45% increase according to our own numbers, and I know you look at it independently as well on the number of eyeballs coming on to our site. It's very difficult to translate that, as you know, into the exact impact on revenues. So I won't attempt that, but it's -- you can imagine the largest impact is on the consumables side. And especially with newer products, it's worked out extremely well, having the ability to drive more people on to the channel, find out more information, leading to purchase and a great uptake for our ACQUITY Premier launch. 
Now in terms of the overall plan for e-commerce, I mean, this is just the start, right? So remember, I said early on, that we want to take the hand we have and do the best we can with it at the beginning as we make our plans to revitalize our platforms. And I mentioned a couple of those investments in the previous question as well. 
So we do believe that investing in a data lake that takes all unstructured and structured data from different parts of the organization and putting that into an easily accessible middle layer will help us service our e-commerce customers better. 
We do believe investing in content even more is going to lead to better conversion on the e-commerce channel. We do believe investing in mobile is going to lead to a better conversion. So you can see that there are some infrastructural investments that we have started to look at. And as the organization becomes stronger and stronger, we'll start -- you'll start to see us invest in those. So the e-commerce plan as a few phases, the first one was just to get the quick wins, and we're not done with that yet. That's just a start. And there is a long-term plan that will build a world-class e-commerce platform for Waters. Hope that helps."

And when you talk about innings, if you're talking about baseball, probably we're in the third inning. There's a lot more work to do and lot more to pick up there. 
And we haven't done that in the past. We haven't replaced our own instruments. So I mean, we are going in, and it's working out super well, especially with the new products being available as well, both on the HPLC side and UPLC side. So we're very happy with where we are there. 
To your question on competitor instruments, definitely, that's the second step. And then there's a third step, everybody and anybody who's using Empower, that probably also hits the competitors there. So there's a large installed base. And any time somebody is trying to replace an HPLC or UPLC, you should expect Waters to be in that conversation, especially -- and this is especially important given that Empower is installed as the most ubiquitous CDS system. So we are going to leverage the strength of Empower to try and make sure that we have a seat at the table virtually everywhere. 
The second thing that I wanted to add is from an instrument perspective, I mean, don't forget mass spec. Mass spec also has an older army of instruments that we've sold over many years. And there, too, we completely renewed our tandem quad portfolio in 2019, and we're using that to get in and have conversations with our customers. So that also -- that probably is in your baseball analogy in the first innings. And that's also started off very well. 
So expect to hear more as the year progresses, and we do intend to make sure that, that continues and gets tracked very carefully. 
And the last piece on that, that I'll add, this is also to a previous question on the areas we're investing in. We've invested in basically collecting all the data that we have on the installed base, be it Empower-based, be it instrument-based and of course, to automate it and to make it readily usable, you need to invest in technology, and that's what we're doing. So I hope that gives you more color."

Jim was a brilliant and spirited scientist and a pioneer in liquid chromatography. I met Jim the first time in 2019 when",2033,"I would like to start the call on Slide 3 by paying our respects to the founder of our company, Jim Waters, who passed away on May 17. Jim was a brilliant and spirited scientist and a pioneer in liquid chromatography. I met Jim the first time in 2019 when he came to talk to me about the merits of a technology we had acquired in a previous company. We spent hours in front of a whiteboard debating how to manage innovation and, in particular, how the application of certain technology could deliver benefit. Jim continued reaching out to me not just on technology but also on our mutual love for science education and then, more recently, on Waters. Jim's legacy will live on with each and every one of our innovations as we continue to strive to deliver benefits. 
Our teams around the globe have continued to manage admirably through the pandemic, which is still very much with us. Most of all, we've kept the working environment safe for our employees and have remained flexible and resourceful as we continue to support our customers. I remain grateful for the ongoing resilience, commitment and dedication that our team has shown. 
Moving on to Slide 4. During today's call, I will provide a brief overview of our second quarter operating results as well as some commentary on our end markets, geographies and technologies. I will also update you on the progress of our transformation plan. We continue to be focused on 3 primary objectives: number one, regaining our commercial momentum; number two, further strengthening our organization; and number three, building on a core -- on a strong core to access even higher growth areas. Amol will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our updated third quarter and full year financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions. 
As outlined on Slide 5, in the second quarter, our revenue grew 31% as reported and 27% on a constant currency basis, reflecting continued strength in our pharma and industrial end markets with strong demand for both our instrument systems and recurring revenue products across our major geographies. Sales for this quarter represent a 6% compounded average yearly growth versus our 2019 results on a constant currency basis. This translates to a 7% stacked CAGR versus 2019 for the first half of the year, again, on a constant currency basis. 
Our strong top line growth resulted in year-over-year Q2 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share growth of 24% to $2.60 per share. Our top and bottom line performance translated into solid free cash flow performance and allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet. 
Looking more closely at our top line results in the quarter on Slide 6. First, by operating segment, our Waters division grew 27%, while TA grew by 32% on a constant currency basis. By end market, our largest market category, pharma, grew 31% in constant currency; industrial grew 28%; and academia and government grew 7%. Continued strength in sales to pharma customers was broad-based across customer segments, geographies and applications. Late-stage drug development activity drove sales of our Tandem core MS instrument systems such as the Xevo TQ-XS and Xevo TQ-S micro. Small molecule applications in manufacturing QA and QC grew across Asia, Europe and North America and were particularly strong in India. 
Industrial end market growth was also broad-based across geographies and applications, continuing its recovery so far this year. Food testing and environmental demand grew nicely in the quarter, as did our thermal and geometry portfolios. 
Turning to academic and government, which is less than 10% of our business, growth in the U.S. and Europe was partially offset by lumpiness in China. Year-to-date, our primary geographies have all returned to growth versus last year. 
Moving now to our sales performance by geography on a constant currency basis. Sales in Asia grew 28% with China up almost 40% and India up almost 60%. Sales in the Americas grew 28% with the U.S. growing 26% and sales in Europe grew 25%. In the U.S., all end markets had strong year-over-year performance led by pharma and industrial. Academic and government saw a return to growth for the quarter as the market continues to recover. Europe's growth was also broad-based across end markets and sub regions. Overall, pharma drove growth with strong demand in small molecule and large molecule applications. Industrial and academic and government markets continued their recovery, with both having strong quarters and strong starts to the first half of the year. China sales were up sharply in our pharma business, and we had solid growth in our industrial and applied end markets there as well. We're encouraged by our continued strength in the contract labs business due to strong execution of our growth initiatives. In India, sales for the quarter were again very strong even as the country continued to feel the effects from the pandemic. We're really grateful for the hard work and dedication of our colleagues who persevered through these challenging and tragic conditions. 
Trends in Q2 and year-to-date for our LC instrument portfolio is a positive indicator for sustainable growth in consumables and service plans. In the second quarter, LC instruments grew across all major geographies with more than 40% growth driven by our instrument replacement initiatives and new products, especially Arc HPLC and a strong uptake of our Premier instruments, both Arc and ACQUITY art lines. This week, I spent time with customers at our Immerse Innovation Lab in Cambridge discussing the separation and purification of mRNA and oligonucleotide molecules. While mRNA vaccines have developed at a record pace, we are far from solving key issues such as aggregation and selective binding of plasmids and mRNA molecules to various surfaces, something that our Premier technology addresses really well. 
Further strengthening our UPLC portfolio, the Arc system was launched earlier this year for customers who need ultimate sensitivity. The Arc Premier delivered 5-fold improvement in detector sensitivity and tenfold improvement in asset-to-asset decision, helping labs accelerate time to market. 
Mass spec sales grew in excess of 30% driven by demand from pharma research and development and food and environmental applications. This included high resolution systems used for research applications such as the Zero QTof, Tandem courts led by our Xevo TQ-XS and TQS micro systems and our SQD and QDA single-port detectors utilized in high-performance LCMS applications. We introduced the Waters Select Series MRT, a high-resolution mass spectrometer that combines multi-reflecting time-of-flight MRT technology with both enhanced Desi and new MALDI imaging sources. The MRT provides scientists with a unique combination of speed, resolution and mass accuracy especially relevant for applications in photonics. We have been in conversations with customers to see how we can collaborate using MRT to analyze libraries of samples to create a database of proteins and metabolites to further understand the impact of therapeutics on a variety of tissues. 
Sales of precision chemistry columns, sample prep kits and reagents grew 28% driven by increased utilization by our pharma customers and improved industrial demand. Demand for our Premier Columns continues to be strong. Low double-digit 2-year stack growth of chemistry columns revenue in Q2 when compared to our 2019 base underscores the rebound in customer activity, the strong position of our portfolio and building momentum of our e-commerce initiatives. 
Service also showed strong double-digit growth. Our service engineers continue to have good and improved access to our customer sites, and I'm grateful for the way they have served customers while continuing to navigate the challenges of the pandemic. 
Finally, with respect to TA, demand continues to rebound and was balanced across all major geographies and product lines with particular strength in the U.S. and Europe. 
Let me now give you some highlights on our progress with the implementation of our transformation plan on Slide 7. Starting with our first priority, regaining our commercial momentum. We continue to see progress in our instrument replacement initiative. Our recently released Arc HPLC has played an important role in the LC replacement initiative. Its improved mechanical specs and ability to seamlessly transfer networks from Alliance HPLC or other HPLC platforms have been very well received by our customers. We are already crossing a mid-single-digit stack growth versus 2019 on a year-to-date basis in LC. 
With our CRO and CDMO customers, our ability to develop and provide method transfer support continues to be a strong driver of growth. This segment grew 60% on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable period in 2019. Early strength that we saw in China has now been replicated in Europe as well as in the U.S. 
Our e-commerce and recurring revenue attachment initiatives are also starting to boost the momentum observed in our year-to-date 2-year stacked CAGR for chemistry and service revenue. 
Moving on to our second priority on Slide 8. We have strengthened our organization with the addition of Wei Jiang to our Board of Directors. Wei currently serves as President of their pharmaceuticals for China and APAC. His results-driven experience will further expand the perspective of the Board that directly aligns with what is a strategy to accelerate growth and innovation. 
I'm also pleased to welcome Dr. Daniel Rush to Waters as Senior Vice President of Strategy and Transformation. Dan joins us from Bristol-Myers, where he was VP of Worldwide Commercialization Strategy and Innovation. Dan joins several of our other technically trained Executive Committee members with experience in orchestrating transformations and M&A in relevant customer segments like pharma and diagnostics. 
This brings me to our third priority of building our core to drive durable growth. As you will see on Slide 9, Waters already has a strong foundation in large and growing end markets with a leading position of science and innovation in a roughly $65 billion market, a high exposure to end markets that grow around mid-single digits with a deep rooted presence in regulated end markets like QA/QC, a large installed base of instruments with over 50% recurring revenues, a diversified geographic base with over -- almost 40% sales in Asia and industry-leading margins with a strong financial flexibility. So you'll agree with me that this is a solid base to build off. 
Now I'm on Slide 10. We built a team of leaders who have a strong track record of execution. Both Jon Pratt and Jianqing Bennett, Heads of the Waters Division and the TA Division, respectively, are highly experienced commercial leaders and are now very focused on building capabilities to sustain our commercial momentum. 
What gives me most pleasure is that we have started to hit our stride with new product introductions across the portfolio, and these are contributing to our sales momentum already. The leadership that is focused on execution and innovation is preparing us well to further build our portfolio to access even faster-growing adjacencies. We're exploring and nurturing opportunities both organic and inorganic to increase our exposure to biologics, be it bioprocessing reagents or novel modalities. We're actively shaping the promise of LCMS in diagnostics and proteomics discovery applications and advancing lab connectivity applications through our informatics portfolio. High growth areas such as sustainable polymers and renewable energy are a focus of the TA division. 
In summary, we've had a strong start to the year with a broad base -- with broad-based contributions from our end markets, product portfolio and geographies to our revenue growth. In addition to the impressive growth versus our 2020 base of comparison, our business dynamics and customer demand look healthy on a 2-year run rate basis. Markets we serve are in a healthy state, and our geographic regions are rebounding solidly from pandemic lows. We remain focused on the continued progress and success of our short-term initiatives aimed at tactically strengthening our core business. We're confident in the opportunities ahead to bring LCMS products, separations expertise and compliant data management experience into high-growth biopharma and diagnostic applications. I look forward to continuing to share more with you as we progress on these various fronts. 
With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Amol for a deeper review of the second quarter financials and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Amol?"
36475,1673287292,2360399,"Waters Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Waters Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of $682 million in the second quarter, an increase of 27% on in constant currency.

As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of $682 million in the second quarter, an increase of 27% on in constant currency. Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 4%, resulting in reported sales growth of 31%. Looking at the product line growth, our recurring revenue, which represents a combination of chemistry and service revenue, increased by 18% for the quarter, while instrument sales increased 40%. Chemistry revenues were up 28%, and service revenues were up 13%. As we noted in our last earnings call, recurring revenues were not impacted by a difference in calendar days this quarter. Looking ahead, there is no year-over-year difference in the number of days for the third quarter either. However, please note there are 6 fewer days in the fourth quarter of this year compared to 2020. 
Now I would like to comment on our second quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Before I do so, a reminder that in the second quarter of 2020, we took decisive actions to manage our costs as part of our near-term cost savings plan in light of the pandemic. While our COVID cost savings plan was successful, totaling approximately $100 million for 2020,  it does have some implications in our year-over-year comparisons as we normalize from an abnormally low expense base. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 58.9%, down 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2020 driven by 80 basis points foreign exchange headwinds. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, gross margin improved by 70 basis points despite higher instrument mix and COVID cost actions in 2020. This improvement was driven by volume leverage and productivity gains. 
Moving down the P&L. Operating expenses increased by approximately 39% on a constant currency basis and 42% on a reported basis. The increase was primarily attributable to higher labor costs and variable compensation, the majority of which relates to normalization of the prior year cost actions. 
In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 14.8%, a decrease from last year as the comparable period included some unfavorable discrete items. Our average share count came in at 62.2 million shares, approximately flat versus the second quarter of last year. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter increased 24% to $2.60 in comparison to $2.10 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $2.69 compared to $1.98 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of this presentation. 
Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the second quarter of 2021, free cash flow declined 12% year-over-year to $155 million after funding $37 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from the free cash flow was $14 million related to the investment in our Taunton Precision chemistry operations, a $38 million tax reform payment and a $3 million litigation settlement received. In the second quarter, this resulted in $0.23 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. Year-to-date, free cash flow has increased 17% to $348 million. 
In the second quarter, accounts receivable DSO came in at 73 days, down 14 days compared to the second quarter of last year. Inventories increased slightly by $5 million in comparison to the prior year. 
We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 535,000 shares of our common stock for $168 million in the second quarter. At the end of second quarter, our net debt position was $940 million,and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1x, consistent, invest for growth, maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility and return capital to shareholders. We remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities. In addition, we will evaluate deploying capital to well thought out, attractive and adjacent growth opportunities. 
As we look forward to the remainder of the year, I would like to provide you some update on our thoughts for 2021 on Slide 11. In the first half of the year, we saw good momentum in our market segments driven by robust demand and strong commercial execution. We believe that this momentum will continue in the second half of the year, but the comparisons are more challenging. Fourth quarter of 2020 was the first quarter in our transformation journey and was further favorably impacted by higher year-end budget plus spending. In addition, we have 6 fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of this year. We are also keeping a watchful eye on the potential impact of newer COVID variants and the likely disruption they may cause to both supply and demand. We expect our near-term growth initiatives and commercial momentum to contribute meaningfully to our performance. 
These dynamics support updated full year 2021 guidance of 13% to 15% constant currency sales growth. At current rates, the positive currency translation is expected to add approximately 1 to 2 percentage points, resulting in a full year reported sales growth guidance of 14% to 17%. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 58%, and operating margin is expected to be approximately 29%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be $37 million and full year tax rate to be 15%. Average diluted 2021 share count is expected to be approximately 62 million. Throughout the year, we'll evaluate our share repurchase program and provide quarterly updates as appropriate. 
Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $10.50 to $10.70. This includes a positive currency impact of approximately 3 percentage points at today's rates and assumes no adverse demand or supply impact from COVID. 
Looking at the third quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 7% to 9%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to add approximately 1 percentage point, resulting in third quarter reported sales growth guidance of 8% to 10%. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range $2.25 to $2.35. This includes a positive currency impact of approximately 3 percentage point at today's rates and also assumes no adverse demand or supply impact from COVID.

Look, the LC replacement cycle, last time, I said we are in the third innings. Using a baseball analogy, I would say we're now in the seventh inning or so in terms of having tracked down all customers that are relevant for replacement, especially our own and, to some extent, our competitors. I would say we've reached out to almost 80% of our own customers and 20% to 30% of the competitive replacements, both across LC as well as mass spec. And we've recently, as I told you, added the UPLC segment to it as well. 
So really, we talk to the customers really solid feedback. And especially with the introduction of Arc HPLC last year and now the promise of the Arc Premier as well as the Acuity Premier Columns, which are really relevant for high-end separations, we're having very good luck with -- and very good performance with our LC replacement initiative. 
So from an overall contribution perspective, I'd say we should think about it in terms of the stacked growth. So if you just look at our first half of the year, organic constant currency stack growth versus 2019 is roughly 7%. And if you compare it to our peer group over the same period on a stacked basis, we've seen numbers anywhere ranging from about 2.5% to 3% to closer to 5-ish percent. So that, if you take a weighted average, gives you a lead of, let's say, 2% to 3% versus the roughly defined market. 
And I would say part of it is explained by our initiatives, and part of it is explained -- this 2% to 3% lead versus the market, part of it is explained by our outperformance of our initiatives and the LC replacement initiative being a strong contributor to it. And part of it is replaced by really a strong uptake of our new products. 
I hope that gives you a bit of color and some quantification. And the best way to compare it is to just look at the stacked growth versus the overall market. And we are now trending, I think, probably second or third quarter in a row, the market plus organic performance."

So for the second half of the year, stack growth would lead us to between slightly north of 5% to slightly north of 6%, right? So that's -- I mean, a year ago, who would have thought that we would be here already. So we're very -- I mean we're very happy with the ability to provide such a guidance. 
Across the 3 end markets, Pharma goes from strength to strength, and our strong presence in pharma benefits us, as you can see, disproportionately. So we expect that to continue. And on industrial, as you know, it can be quite a lumpy market. But if you again look at the stack growth of industrial, we are slightly higher than our overall average, which is closer to 5%. So we're closer to 6% on a stack basis for industrial growth on a year-to-date basis. So that again bodes well. I mean, again, if you look at it over a longer period of time, it bodes well for what we're seeing on the industrial side, barring any sort of cyclicality due to the pandemic reemerging strongly. We think that strength should continue for the balance of the year. And then finally, academic and government, which is our smallest segment, quite an important one to place, especially our mass spec instruments. For the first half of the year was roughly on a stack base, it was roughly around 17% growth versus last year. And we expect that trend to start emerging even more strongly in the second half of the year. 
So we feel reasonably good across all 3 markets. I mean in the simplest way, despite the pandemic, most of our customers and our teams have figured out how to work through the difficulties. And that's -- there's not 100% access everywhere, but I feel we figured out a way to work through the ups and downs of the pandemic. I hope that gives you some color."

In the instrument piece, Vijay, I mean we are really, really pleased with what we're seeing for 3 reasons. Number one, our initiatives are working extremely well, I mean, having a 40% to 45% growth versus last year. And then more impressively, trending above our long-term average, and we're already at mid-single digits on instrument growth on a stacked basis, bodes very well. 
Second, it's equally important as we look at the recurring revenues and the impact on the recurring revenues, and you start to see some of that impact on the recurring revenues for the first half of the year already, the more -- the larger the instrument placement, the larger the recurring revenues. 
And then finally, the third piece is around innovation. I mean our innovation across, and this is probably the most endearing aspect of the transformation now, our innovation is starting to hit it straight across the portfolio, right? You talked -- you asked about the instruments, so let me focus on that. We introduced Arc HPLC last year, and I've talked several times about its benefit in China and the rest of the world. For the work horse HPLC segment, we launched the Arc and the Acuity Premier, which are also doing extremely well. In fact, ironically, the launch of Acuity Premier has led to even increased demand for I Class and H-class portfolio, which is meant for separating biologics and looking at high-end separations. So the portfolio across LC is really, really revitalized. 
And then on the mass spec side, having introduced new platforms for the Tandem cards in 2019, the latest is the MRT, the multi reflecting tag, and we have a lot of interest from our customers on that front. It's early days on where the sales will land on that. As you know, these are big-ticket items, and they're also dependent upon capital outlays, but I feel very good about where we stand with our instrument initiatives, the instrument replacement initiative, but even more importantly, how innovation is helping us sustain that placement. 
Going forward, I mean jon Pratt and Jianqing will integrate this instrument replacement approach into our commercial execution, so this would not be news starting late this year or early next year. So very happy with where we are.

That said, it's still hard from the outside to tell how much of this is favorable multiyear comparisons versus better execution, keeping in mind that the company really struggled for a few years relative to peers heading into the pandemic. It's obviously a bit of both, and you tried to help cut through this by providing stacked growth figures relative to 2019. But again, even that's noisy given how the company was performing heading into the pandemic. 
So cutting through all of that, what arguably matters most is how we should think about the future outlook for Waters growth at the top line. Your stacked analysis that you talked about in your prepared remarks pointed to 6% to 7% growth at the top line. As we sit here today, based on the progress you've made and just cutting through the comps, are you comfortable asserting that Waters is built to compound revenue growth annually of 6% to 7% moving forward?"

I can't help but laugh with your -- about the overall question, not that I'm making fun of the question. I just -- it's a long -- it's a serious progress in a year.

I can't help but laugh with your -- about the overall question, not that I'm making fun of the question. I just -- it's a long -- it's a serious progress in a year. But to answer your question, legitimately, I would say it has 2 -- if you look at the long-term growth, I won't give you a number. I think it's very difficult to do it. What you can safely assume is our ambition is to remain a top-tier performer especially when you look at the organic growth, right? So we have now, for the last 2, 3 quarters on a stacked basis, have been market plus, and our margins remain at the high end of the industry. So that's our ambition, right? So I mean that's what I'll tell you. Is it 4%, 5%, 6%, I don't know. But if it's 4%, we have the ambition to be higher than 4%. If it's 5%, it is higher and you can go on from there. 
But there are 2 drivers that make me confident -- actually, 3 drivers are making confidence that we can be at the higher end of the market. Number one, we've put a very solid team together with experienced leaders who have shown in the past that they can execute very well above market -- on the above-market growth. And they have experience in, of course, conducting transformations and integrations. So I feel very good about the team we've put together. 
Second, we're starting to develop a rhythm in our execution, and you end up seeing the results, but we see a lot of leading indicators. And I've tried to give you some color around the different initiatives. And these are initiatives that should help us in the longer term. The LC replacement initiative has changed the way we work at Waters or probably brought us back to where Waters started a long time ago in looking at each and every replacement initiative and diligently going after it through our CRM channel. That's a long-term improvement in execution. 
E-commerce, last year, at the same time, we were less -- less than 20% of our consumables went through the e-commerce channel. Today, that number is in excess of 25%. That's in less than a year. And there is a long runway ahead of us in seeing the benefit of that execution. 
We've started to tap into newer customer segments. And again, I mean I was pretty open about how underweighted we were in the CRO, CDMO, food testing segments in China. And there, we've just started to hit the stride. And you can see on a 2-year stack basis that 60% growth on a 1-year stack basis, that's a 40% growth in the same channel. And we are seeing our value proposition resonate very well with our customers. Our sales teams are super excited about what we're hearing from our customers. 
So this -- the execution platforms that we've built, and I've just gone through 3 of these, are going to help us for many, many years to come. 
And the last piece is innovation, which is most enduring to me. I mean we have really been very precise about identifying unmet needs, and this is something definitely I don't take credit for. This has been going on at Waters for a long period of time. It was just starting to rekindle it and focusing us on the right problems to solve. We've seen already the impact of the recent launches in LC. The MRT is strengthening our high-res mass spec portfolio. The Premier launch for the Premier technology for columns could not have come at a better time given the need for continued separation of more complex modalities which have a higher affinity to metal. 
So I feel very good that there's a team in place that has a strong execution track record, both organic and inorganic execution. And the pipeline is starting to hit its stride. And I think that gives me confidence that wherever the market is, we can have the ambition to be a market plus. I hope that gives you color."

I think 2 of the big questions as it relates to Waters are the longer-term growth outlook at the top line, which is why I asked the first question. The other question continues to be where margins can go from here. Recognizing mix, recognizing FX, recognizing you're investing in long-term initiatives, over time, do you think the incrementals can get into the 30s over the next few years?"

Chemistry is double digits, and the recurring revenues are high single digits on a 2-year stack basis. On a 1-year stack basis, it's a double-digit performance.

We have a very disciplined sort of margin management profile within the company. And that as you step back, there are so many opportunities in terms of margins, right? One, as Udit mentioned, there's a huge opportunity in increasing our recurring revenue attachment. And recurring revenue is a higher margin product  between chemistry and service, and that helps expand margin. 
As you look into operations, I mean there's a huge effort underway on operational excellence and our procurement programs, which are starting to deliver, and that would help our margin profile. We have a similar program underway on our service productivity initiatives, and that will expand margin. And then there is the whole area around capability centers, and we haven't really invested in capability centers so far. And that will bring margin expansion. 
Now at the same time, as Udit outlined,  we continue to explore and nurture really fantastic adjacent growth opportunities. And those opportunities will need some investment. So the general plan is to use this margin expansion in some way to fund some of these investment opportunities and yet deliver sort of a steady margin profile. And as these programs deliver growth, you will see margin expansion show up over time."

I think off the bat, I mean, of course, we can't be specific on where the immediate M&A opportunity or the midterm M&A opportunity is for obvious reasons. But from a capital deployment perspective, I mean we remain flexible, right?",405,"Yes. So thanks, Derik. I think off the bat, I mean, of course, we can't be specific on where the immediate M&A opportunity or the midterm M&A opportunity is for obvious reasons. But from a capital deployment perspective, I mean we remain flexible, right? I think that's been our approach and disciplined, right? So this is basically something that you've heard us say many, many times. 
Now in terms of the specific areas where we're interested, of course, given our very strong core, I mean we want to continue to invest in our core. If there are better technologies to perform separations that are dedicated to novel modalities, to biologics, I mean, we are very well placed to nurture those and capture those. And that's an area that we're looking at cheaply. We're looking at augmenting our instruments with automation. We continue to chase that space rather carefully. If I move to informatics, Empower is the leader in chromatography data systems, but we also have the concept of creating a connected lab. And there too, we look for partnerships and expanding our portfolio. That's in the core. 
If you look outside the core, really where we see our technology is going and some of the attractive areas where we see our technology is going is, of course, one of them is bioprocessing, where we think decoupling the process from the product is an imperative. And we believe technologies such as LCMS and technologies such as BioAccord in particular can help us achieve that objective. And we're seeing very good traction on that front especially as we see the instruments earlier and earlier with our customers. So I feel very good about that. 
And then secondly, in -- and I've talked about LCMS in particular, and I'll let Amol comment on this as he gives you his view on capital deployment as well. On LC-MS, in particular, we feel that it's a technology that belongs in diagnostics and enhancing our ability to examine proteins in addition to bringing genomics into that segment. So I feel very good about what we are doing on the LCMS front. It's early days. We've done some pilots.  We think we can do a fair bit organically, but we also might require partnerships. 
So that hopefully gives you a flavor of the areas we're thinking of. Amol, would you want to comment a bit on  how we're thinking about capital deployment?"

We have a new leader for the last few months, and she's been making tremendous changes that have led to acceleration. In the first quarter, you'll remember that the pandemic hit China first, so the first quarter comps were actually weaker than the second quarter in China, and so you see a bit of a comp effect. But fundamentally, all the initiatives that we've launched on a global level are on China speed in China, right? 
So let me explain. From a factual perspective, right, so the second quarter growth was roughly 40% versus the previous year. Starting with instruments, the Arc HPLC was designed for the China market, and it's done very well especially given its better performance than any of the other instruments available in the market. Second, from a consumables perspective, we've seen really good progress in China in -- mostly in the -- even in excess of the instrument growth in some cases. And then finally, on the CRO, CDMO and CTO sort of initiatives, remember, we talked about the food market in the past, and we've said we were underweight in the food market in China. We've seen very good growth there, almost doubling of the business versus the same period last year. And then for the CRO and the CDMO piece are -- the growth that I mentioned was a global growth, meaning 60% on a 2-year stack basis. This in China is -- this turnaround of growth for CRO, CDMO segment started in China. 
So I feel very good about what's happening in China. And we'll just -- I would say we've just begun on looking at newer segments like the contract testing segments, both in food and pharma. We've started to work really efficiently and effectively on our presence and placement of instruments. And I feel very good about what we're going to do on the consumable side as well I hope that gives you a bit of color on what we see in China."

You are replacing your own legacy LC Alliance here. So I'm just trying to understand, what are some other initiatives that you have ongoing including Acuity replacements, Tandem triple pods replacements that you have talked about before. So just how should we think about this level of growth continuing into next year with further replacement cycles because, obviously, mass spec at Tandem Quads and liquidities are -- there's maybe a smaller installed base there than the Arc one.

They should continue for a little bit of time while we work through our own portfolio and then turn our attention to the competitive portfolio as well, which are -- especially on the LC side, whatever is plugged into Empower, we've told our reps that anytime there's a replacement there, we want to be in competition especially if it's a competitive instrument. 
So your question is more around what challenges it creates for the future. First, let me start with the opportunity. The opportunity is that as you have more instruments base, you start to see a better recurring revenue. I think that is the first and the most important piece. The second is on the replacement cycle, this will become more of operandi. As soon as we've worked through our own our own installed base and as we move to our competitors' installed base, our playbook, which has been honed over the last 6 months or so, is now becoming standard operating procedure for our reps around the globe. So it will be -- of course, I mean from a mathematical perspective, the growth on the instrument side has been terrific. I mean we think it's a benefit for our recurring revenues, both service and consumable, but it's becoming now modus operandi as we go forward. So Waters will no longer be letting instruments and perhaps even competitors go after our installed base."

And last week, I was at our Immerse site, Immerse Innovation site in Cambridge Mass, and had an opportunity to talk to several customers, especially ones who are now working in the mRNA space and the SiRNA space. And I would say universally, we're far from having solved the challenges for separating oligonucleotides and mRNA molecules, right? I mean if you just think of the progression there, number one, a large number of -- very large number of compounds in the pipeline that are now leveraging the mRNA technology, and you must have seen some recent acquisitions in the space as well. But if you break the problem down from a separation standpoint, there's the plasmid, there is the mRNA molecule, and then there's also the lipid nanoparticle. For all 3 of these [indiscernible], we are far from having solved the aggregation problem, the problem of affinity to metal surfaces. And as I said earlier, the introduction of the Premier technology couldn't have come at a better time. 
So I believe, given the further investment in the pipeline of molecules in this space, basically oligo-based compounds, our technological focus especially on separations of these complex molecules, first, with the Premier technology and others that we're working on bodes very well for what we see in the future. And I can tell you that I mean customers, while we have delivered -- while the customers and us working together have delivered vaccines in record times, they're very far from having made it an efficient process, so something that is a significant opportunity for Waters from an innovation standpoint as we go forward."

And then just looking at the full year guidance of 58%, it implies that the second half gross margins are below what you did in the first half. How much of this is related to the selling days? Or is there some other dynamic related to investments kind of weighing on the seasonality this year?"

Jim was a brilliant and spirited scientist and a pioneer in liquid chromatography. I met Jim the first time in 2019 when he came to talk to me about the merits of a technology we had acquired in a previous company. We spent hours in front of a whiteboard debating how to manage innovation and, in particular, how the application of certain technology could deliver benefit. Jim continued reaching out to me, not just on technology, but also on our mutual love for science education and then, more recently, on Waters. Jim's legacy will live on with each and every one of our innovations as we continue to strive to deliver benefits.
Our teams around the globe have continued to manage admirably through the pandemic, which is still very much with us. Most of all, we've kept the working environment safe for our employees and have remained flexible and resourceful as we continue to support our customers. I remain grateful for the ongoing resilience, commitment and dedication that our team has shown.
Moving on to Slide 4. During today's call, I will provide a brief overview of our second quarter operating results as well as some commentary on our end markets, geographies and technologies. I will also update you on the progress of our transformation plan. We continue to be focused on 3 primary objectives: number one, regaining our commercial momentum; number two, further strengthening our organization; and number three, building on a core -- on a strong core to access even higher growth areas. Amol will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our updated third quarter and full year financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.
As outlined on Slide 5, in the second quarter, our revenue grew 31% as reported and 27% on a constant currency basis, reflecting continued strength in our pharma and industrial end markets with strong demand for both our instrument systems and recurring revenue products across our major geographies. Sales for this quarter represent a 6% compounded average yearly growth versus our 2019 results on a constant currency basis. This translates to a 7% stacked CAGR versus 2019 for the first half of the year, again, on a constant currency basis. Our strong top line growth resulted in year-over-year Q2 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share growth of 24% to $2.60 per share. Our top and bottom line performance translated into solid free cash flow performance and allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet.
Looking more closely at our top line results in the quarter on Slide 6. First, by operating segment, our Waters Division grew 27%, while TA grew by 32% on a constant currency basis. By end market, our largest market category, pharma, grew 31% in constant currency; industrial grew 28%; and academia and government grew 7%. Continued strength in sales to pharma customers was broad-based across customer segments, geographies and applications. Late-stage drug development activity drove sales of our tandem quad MS instrument systems such as the Xevo TQ-XS and Xevo TQ-S micro. Small molecule applications in manufacturing QA and QC grew across Asia, Europe and North America and were particularly strong in India.
Industrial end market growth was also broad-based across geographies and applications, continuing its recovery so far this year. Food testing and environmental demand grew nicely in the quarter, as did our thermal and geometric portfolios.  
Turning to academic and government, which is less than 10% of our business, growth in the U.S. and Europe was partially offset by lumpiness in China. Year-to-date, our primary geographies have all returned to growth versus last year.
Moving now to our sales performance by geography on a constant currency basis. Sales in Asia grew 28%, with China up almost 40% and India up almost 60%. Sales in the Americas grew 28% with the U.S. growing 26%, and sales in Europe grew 25%. In the U.S., all end markets had strong year-over-year performance led by pharma and industrial. Academic and government saw a return to growth for the quarter as the market continues to recover. Europe's growth was also broad-based across end markets and subregions. Overall, pharma drove growth with strong demand in small molecule and large molecule applications.
Industrial and academic and government markets continued their recovery, with both having strong quarters and strong starts to the first half of the year. China sales were up sharply in our pharma business, and we had solid growth in our industrial and applied end markets there as well. We're encouraged by our continued strength in the contract labs business due to strong execution of our growth initiatives. In India, sales for the quarter were again very strong even as the country continued to feel the effects from the pandemic. We're really grateful for the hard work and dedication of our colleagues who persevered through these challenging and tragic conditions.
Trends in Q2 and year-to-date for our LC instrument portfolio is a positive indicator for sustainable growth in consumables and service plans. In the second quarter, LC instruments grew across all major geographies with more than 40% growth, driven by our instrument replacement initiatives and new products, especially Arc HPLC and a strong uptake of our Premier instruments, both Arc and ACQUITY lines. This week, I spent time with customers at our Immerse innovation lab in Cambridge discussing the separation and purification of mRNA and oligonucleotide molecules. While mRNA vaccines have developed at a record pace, we are far from solving key issues such as aggregation and selective binding of plasmids and mRNA molecules to various surfaces, something that our Premier technology addresses really well.
Further strengthening our UPLC portfolio, the Arc system was launched earlier this year for customers who need ultimate sensitivity. The Arc Premier delivered fivefold improvement in detector sensitivity and tenfold improvement in assay-to-assay precision, helping labs accelerate time to market.
Mass spec sales grew in excess of 30%, driven by demand from pharma research and development and food and environmental applications. This included high-resolution systems used for research applications such as the Xevo QTof, tandem quad led by our Xevo TQ-XS and TQ-S micro systems and our SQD and QDa single quad detectors utilized in high-performance LC-MS applications.
We introduced the Waters SELECT SERIES MRT, a high-resolution mass spectrometer that combines multi-reflecting time-of-flight MRT technology with both enhanced DESI and new MALDI imaging sources. The MRT provides scientists with a unique combination of speed, resolution and mass accuracy especially relevant for applications in proteomics. We have been in conversations with customers to see how we can collaborate using MRT to analyze libraries of samples to create a database of proteins and metabolites to further understand the impact of therapeutics on a variety of tissues.
Sales of precision chemistry columns, sample prep kits and reagents grew 28%, driven by increased utilization by our pharma customers and improved industrial demand. Demand for our Premier Columns continues to be strong. The low double-digit 2-year stack growth of chemistry columns revenue in Q2 when compared to our 2019 base underscores the rebound in customer activity, the strong position of our portfolio and building momentum of our e-commerce initiative.
Service also showed strong double-digit growth. Our service engineers continue to have good and improved access to our customer sites, and I'm grateful for the way they have served customers while continuing to navigate the challenges of the pandemic.
Finally, with respect to TA, demand continues to rebound and was balanced across all major geographies and product lines, with particular strength in the U.S. and Europe.
Let me now give you some highlights on our progress with the implementation of our transformation plan on Slide 7. Starting with our first priority, regaining our commercial momentum. We continue to see progress in our instrument replacement initiative. Our recently released Arc HPLC has played an important role in the LC replacement initiative. Its improved mechanical specs and ability to seamlessly transfer networks from Alliance HPLC or other HPLC platforms have been very well received by our customers. We are already crossing a mid-single-digit stack growth versus 2019 on a year-to-date basis in LC.
With our CRO and CDMO customers, our ability to develop and provide method transfer support continues to be a strong driver of growth. This segment grew 60% on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable period in 2019. Early strength that we saw in China has now been replicated in Europe as well as in the U.S. Our e-commerce and recurring revenue attachment initiatives are also starting to boost the momentum observed in our year-to-date 2-year stacked CAGR for chemistry and service revenue.
Moving on to our second priority on Slide 8. We have strengthened our organization with the addition of Wei Jiang to our Board of Directors. Wei currently serves as President of Bayer Pharmaceuticals for China and APAC. His results-driven experience will further expand the perspective of the Board that directly aligns with what is the strategy to accelerate growth and innovation.
I'm also pleased to welcome Dr. Daniel Rush to Waters as Senior Vice President of Strategy and Transformation. Dan joins us from Bristol Myers, where he was VP of Worldwide Commercialization Strategy and Innovation. Dan joins several of our other technically trained Executive Committee members with experience in orchestrating transformations and M&A in relevant customer segments like pharma and diagnostics.
This brings me to our third priority of building our core to drive durable growth. As you will see on Slide 9, Waters already has a strong foundation in large and growing end markets with a leading position of science and innovation in a roughly $65 billion market, a high exposure to end markets that grow around mid-single digits with a deep rooted presence in regulated end markets like QA/QC, a large installed base of instruments with over 50% recurring revenues, a diversified geographic base with over -- almost 40% sales in Asia and industry-leading margins with a strong financial flexibility. So you'll agree with me that this is a solid base to build off.
Now I'm on Slide 10. We built a team of leaders who have a strong track record of execution. Both Jon Pratt and Jianqing Bennett, Heads of the Waters Division and the TA Division, respectively, are highly experienced commercial leaders and are now very focused on building capabilities to sustain our commercial momentum. What gives me most pleasure is that we have started to hit our stride with new product introductions across the portfolio, and these are contributing to our sales momentum already. The leadership that is focused on execution and innovation is preparing us well to further build our portfolio to access even faster-growing adjacencies.
We're exploring and nurturing opportunities both organic and inorganic to increase our exposure to biologics, be it bioprocessing reagents or novel modalities. We're actively shaping the promise of LC-MS in diagnostics and proteomics discovery applications and advancing lab connectivity applications through our informatics portfolio. High growth areas such as sustainable polymers and renewable energy are a focus of the TA division.  
In summary, we've had a strong start to the year with a broad base -- with broad-based contributions from our end markets, product portfolio and geographies to our revenue growth. In addition to the impressive growth versus our 2020 base of comparison, our business dynamics and customer demand look healthy on a 2-year run rate basis. Markets we serve are in a healthy state, and our geographic regions are rebounding solidly from pandemic lows.
We remain focused on the continued progress and success of our short-term initiatives aimed at tactically strengthening our core business. We're confident in the opportunities ahead to bring LC-MS products, separations expertise and compliant data management experience into high-growth biopharma and diagnostic applications. I look forward to continuing to share more with you as we progress on these various fronts.
With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Amol for a deeper review of the second quarter financials and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Amol?"

As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of $682 million in the second quarter, an increase of 27% in constant currency. Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 4%, resulting in reported sales growth of 31%. Looking at the product line growth, our recurring revenue, which represents combination of chemistry and service revenue, increased by 18% for the quarter, while instrument sales increased 40%. Chemistry revenues were up 28%, and service revenues were up 13%. As we noted in our last earnings call, recurring revenues were not impacted by a difference in calendar days this quarter. Looking ahead, there is no year-over-year difference in the number of days for the third quarter either. However, please note there are 6 fewer days in the fourth quarter of this year compared to 2020.
Now I would like to comment on our second quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Before I do so, a reminder that in the second quarter of 2020, we took decisive actions to manage our costs as part of our near-term cost savings plan in light of the pandemic. While our COVID cost savings plan was successful totaling approximately $100 million for 2020,  it does have some implications in our year-over-year comparisons as we normalize from an abnormally low expense base.
Gross margin for the quarter was 58.9%, down 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2020, driven by 80 basis points foreign exchange headwinds. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, gross margin improved by 70 basis points despite higher instrument mix and COVID cost actions in 2020. This improvement was driven by volume leverage and productivity gains.
Moving down the P&L, operating expenses increased by approximately 39% on a constant currency basis and 42% on a reported basis. The increase was primarily attributable to higher labor costs and variable compensation, the majority of which relates to normalization of the prior year cost actions.
In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 14.8%, a decrease from last year as the comparable period included some unfavorable discrete items. Our average share count came in at 62.2 million shares, approximately flat versus the second quarter of last year.
Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter increased 24% to $2.60 in comparison to $2.10 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $2.69 compared to $1.98 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of this presentation.
Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the second quarter of 2021, free cash flow declined 12% year-over-year to $155 million after funding $37 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from the free cash flow was $14 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations, a $38 million tax reform payment and a $3 million litigation settlement received. In the second quarter, this resulted in $0.23 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. Year-to-date, free cash flow has increased 17% to $348 million.
In the second quarter, accounts receivable DSO came in at 73 days, down 14 days compared to the second quarter of last year. Inventories increased slightly by $5 million in comparison to the prior year. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile.
In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 535,000 shares of our common stock for $168 million in the second quarter. At the end of second quarter, our net debt position was $940 million and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.
Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent: invest for growth, maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility and return capital to shareholders. We remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities. In addition, we will evaluate deploying capital to well thought out, attractive and adjacent growth opportunities.
As we look forward to the remainder of the year, I would like to provide you some update on our thoughts for 2021 on Slide 11. In the first half of the year, we saw good momentum in our market segments driven by robust demand and strong commercial execution. We believe that this momentum will continue in the second half of the year, but the comparisons are more challenging. Fourth quarter of 2020 was the first quarter in our transformation journey and was further favorably impacted by higher year-end budget plus spending. In addition, we have 6 fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of this year. We are also keeping a watchful eye on the potential impact of newer COVID variants and the likely disruption they may cause to both supply and demand. We expect our near-term growth initiatives and commercial momentum to contribute meaningfully to our performance.
These dynamics support updated full year 2021 guidance of 13% to 15% constant currency sales growth. At current rates, the positive currency translation is expected to add approximately 1 to 2 percentage points, resulting in a full year reported sales growth guidance of 14% to 17%. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 58%, and operating margin is expected to be approximately 29%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be $37 million and full year tax rate to be 15%. Average diluted 2021 share count is expected to be approximately 62 million. Throughout the year, we'll evaluate our share repurchase program and provide quarterly updates as appropriate.
Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range $10.50 to $10.70. This includes a positive currency impact of approximately 3 percentage points at today's rates and assumes no adverse demand or supply impact from COVID.
Looking at the third quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 7% to 9%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to add approximately 1 percentage point, resulting in third quarter reported sales growth guidance of 8% to 10%. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range $2.25 to $2.35. This includes a positive currency impact of approximately 3 percentage point at today's rates and also assumes no adverse demand or supply impact from COVID.

Look, the LC replacement cycle, last time, I said we are in the third innings. Using a baseball analogy, I would say we're now in the seventh inning or so in terms of having tracked down all customers that are relevant for replacement, especially our own and, to some extent, our competitors. I would say we've reached out to almost 80% of our own customers and 20% to 30% of the competitive replacements, both across LC as well as mass spec. And we've recently, as I told you, added the UPLC segment to it as well. So really reached out to the customers, really solid feedback. And especially with the introduction of Arc HPLC last year and now the promise of the Arc Premier as well as the ACQUITY Premier Columns, which are really relevant for high-end separations, we're having very good luck with -- and very good performance with our LC replacement initiative.
So from an overall contribution perspective, I'd say we should think about it in terms of the stacked growth. So if you just look at our first half of the year, organic constant currency stacked growth versus 2019 is roughly 7%. And if you compare it to our peer group over the same period on a stacked basis, we've seen numbers anywhere ranging from about 2.5% to 3% to closer to 5-ish percent. So that, if you take a weighted average, gives you a lead of, let's say, 2% to 3% versus the roughly defined market. And I would say part of it is explained by our initiatives, and part of it is explained -- this 2% to 3% lead versus the market, part of it is explained by our outperformance of our initiatives and the LC replacement initiative being a strong contributor to it. And part of it is replaced by really a strong uptake of our new products.

So that's -- I mean, a year ago, who would have thought that we would be here already. So we're very -- I mean, we're very happy with the ability to provide such a guidance. Across the 3 end markets, pharma goes from strength to strength, and our strong presence in pharma benefits us, as you can see, disproportionately. So we expect that to continue. 
And on industrial, as you know, it can be quite a lumpy market. But if you again look at the stack growth of industrial, we are slightly higher than our overall average, which is closer to 5%. So we're closer to 6% on a stack basis for industrial growth on a year-to-date basis. So that again bodes well. I mean, again, if you look at it over a longer period of time, it bodes well for what we're seeing on the industrial side, barring any sort of cyclicality due to the pandemic reemerging strongly. We think that strength should continue for the balance of the year. 
And then finally, academic and government, which is our smallest segment, quite an important one to place, especially our mass spec instruments. For the first half of the year, it was roughly on a stack base -- it was roughly around 17% growth versus last year. And we expect that trend to start emerging even more strongly in the second half of the year.
So feel reasonably good across all 3 markets. I mean, in the simplest way, despite the pandemic, most of our customers and our teams have figured out how to work through the difficulties. I mean, that's -- there's not 100% access everywhere, but I feel we figured out a way to work through the ups and downs of the pandemic. I hope that gives you some color."

In the instrument piece, Vijay, I mean, we are really, really pleased with what we're seeing for 3 reasons. Number one, our initiatives are working extremely well. I mean, having a 40% to 45% growth versus last year and then more impressively, trending above our long-term average, and we're already at mid-single digits on instrument growth on a stack basis, bodes very well.
Second, it's equally important as we look at the recurring revenues and the impact on the recurring revenues, and you start to see some of that impact on the recurring revenues for the first half of the year already, the more -- the larger the instrument placement, the larger the recurring revenues.
And then finally, the third piece is around innovation. I mean, our innovation across -- and this is probably the most endearing aspect of the transformation now, our innovation is starting to hit its stride across the portfolio, right? You talked -- you asked about the instruments, so let me focus on that. We introduced Arc HPLC last year, and I've talked several times about its benefit in China and the rest of the world. For the workhorse HPLC segment, we launched the Arc and the ACQUITY Premier, which are also doing extremely well. In fact, ironically, the launch of ACQUITY Premier has led to even increased demand for I-Class and H-Class portfolio, which is meant for separating biologics and looking at high-end separations. So the portfolio across LC is really, really revitalized.
And then on the mass spec side, having introduced new platforms for the tandem quads in 2019, the latest is the MRT, the Multi Reflecting ToF, and we have a lot of interest from our customers on that front. It's early days on where the sales will land on that. As you know, these are big-ticket items, and they're also dependent upon capital outlays, but I feel very good about where we stand with our instrument initiative, the instrument replacement initiative, but even more importantly, how innovation is helping us sustain that placement.
Going forward, I mean Jon Pratt and Jianqing will integrate this instrument replacement approach into our commercial execution. So this would not be news starting late this year or early next year. So very happy with where we are.  
Amol, on the guide?"

That said, it's still hard from the outside to tell how much of this is favorable multiyear comparisons versus better execution, keeping in mind that the company really struggled for a few years relative to peers heading into the pandemic. It's obviously a bit of both, and you tried to help cut through this by providing stacked growth figures relative to 2019. But again, even that's noisy given how the company was performing heading into the pandemic.
So cutting through all of that, what arguably matters most is how we should think about the future outlook for Waters growth at the top line. Your stacked analysis that you talked about in your prepared remarks pointed to 6% to 7% growth at the top line. As we sit here today, based on the progress you've made and just cutting through the comps, are you comfortable asserting that Waters is built to compound revenue growth annually of 6% to 7% moving forward?"

I can't help but laugh with your -- about the overall question, not that I'm making fun of the question. I just -- it's a long -- it's a serious progress in a year.

I can't help but laugh with your -- about the overall question, not that I'm making fun of the question. I just -- it's a long -- it's a serious progress in a year. But to answer your question, legitimately, I would say it has 2 -- if you look at the long-term growth, I won't give you a number. I think it's very difficult to do it. What you can safely assume is our ambition is to remain a top-tier performer, especially when you look at the organic growth, right? So we have now, for the last 2, 3 quarters on a stacked basis, been market plus, and our margins remain at the high end of the industry. So that's our ambition, right? So I mean, that's what I'll tell you. Is it 4%, 5%, 6%? I don't know. But if it's 4%, we have the ambition to be higher than 4%. If it's 5%, higher, and you can go on from there.
But there are 2 drivers that make me confident -- actually, 3 drivers that make me confidence that we can be at the higher end of the market. Number one, we've put a very solid team together with experienced leaders who have shown in the past that they can execute very well above market -- on the above-market growth. And they have experience in, of course, conducting transformations and integrations. So I feel very good about the team we've put together.
Second, we're starting to develop a rhythm in our execution, and you end up seeing the results, but we see a lot of leading indicators. And I've tried to give you some color around the different initiatives. And these are initiatives that should help us in the longer term. The LC replacement initiative has changed the way we work at Waters or probably brought us back to where Waters started a long time ago in looking at each and every replacement initiative and diligently going after it through our CRM channel. That's a long-term improvement and execution.
E-commerce, last year, at the same time, we were less -- less than 20% of our consumables went through the e-commerce channel. Today, that number is in excess of 25%. That's in less than a year. And there is a long runway ahead of us in seeing the benefit of that execution. We've started to tap into newer customer segments. And again, I mean I was pretty open about how underweighted we were in the CRO, CDMO, food testing segments in China. And there, we've just started to hit the stride. And you can see on a 2-year stack basis, that's 60% growth. On a 1-year stack basis, that's a 40% growth in the same channel. And we are seeing our value proposition resonate very well with our customers. Our sales teams are super excited about what we're hearing from our customers. So this -- the execution platforms that we've built, and I've just gone through 3 of these, are going to help us for many, many years to come.
And the last piece is innovation, which is most endearing to me. I mean, we have really been very precise about identifying unmet needs, and this is something definitely I don't take credit for. This has been going on at Waters for a long period of time. It was just starting to rekindle it and focusing us on the right problems to solve. We've seen already the impact of the recent launches in LC. The MRT is strengthening our high-res mass spec portfolio. The Premier launch for the Premier technology for columns could not have come at a better time, given the need for continued separation of more complex modalities which have a higher affinity to metal.
So I feel very good that there's a team in place that has a strong execution track record, both organic and inorganic execution. And the pipeline is starting to hit its stride. And I think that gives me confidence that wherever the market is, we can have the ambition to be a market plus. Long answer. I hope that gives you color."

I think 2 of the big questions as it relates to Waters are the longer-term growth outlook at the top line, which is why I asked the first question. The other question continues to be where margins can go from here. Recognizing mix, recognizing FX, recognizing you're investing in long-term initiatives, over time, do you think the incrementals can get into the 30s over the next few years?"

We have a very disciplined sort of margin management profile within the company. And then as you step back, there are so many opportunities in terms of margins, right? One, as Udit mentioned, there's a huge opportunity in increasing our recurring revenue attachment rate. And recurring revenue is a higher-margin product between chemistry and service, and that helps expand margin.
As you look into operations, I mean, there's a huge effort underway on operational excellence and our procurement programs, which are starting to deliver, and that would help our margin profile. We have a similar program underway on our service productivity initiatives, and that will expand margin. And then there is the whole area around capability centers, and we haven't really invested in capability centers so far. And that will bring margin expansion.
Now at the same time, as Udit outlined, we continue to explore and nurture really fantastic adjacent growth opportunities. And those opportunities will need some investment. So the general plan is to use this margin expansion in some way to fund some of these investment opportunities and yet deliver sort of a steady margin profile.

But from a capital deployment perspective, I mean, we remain flexible, right? I think that's been our approach and disciplined, right? So this is basically something that you've heard us say many, many times.
Now in terms of the specific areas where we're interested, of course, given our very strong core, I mean, we want to continue to invest in our core. If there are better technologies to perform separations that are dedicated to novel modalities, to biologics, I mean, we are very well placed to nurture those and capture those. And that's an area that we're looking at deeply. We're looking at augmenting our instruments with automation. We continue to chase that space rather carefully.
If I move to informatics, Empower is the leader in chromatography data systems, but we also have the concept of creating a connected lab. And there, too, we look for partnerships and expanding our portfolio. That's in the core.
If you look outside the core, really where we see our technology is going and some of the attractive areas where we see our technology is going is, of course, one of them is bioprocessing, where we think decoupling the process from the product is an imperative. And we believe technologies such as LC-MS and technologies such as BioAccord, in particular, can help us achieve that objective. And we're seeing very good traction on that front, especially as we see the instruments earlier and earlier with our customers. So I feel very good about that.
And then secondly, in -- and I've talked about LC-MS in particular, and I'll let Amol comment on this as he gives you his view on capital deployment as well. On LC-MS, in particular, we feel that it's a technology that belongs in diagnostics and enhancing our ability to examine proteins in addition to bringing genomics into that segment. So I feel very good about what we are doing on the LC-MS front. It's early days. We've done some pilots.  We think we can do a fair bit organically, but we also might require partnerships.

We have a new leader for the last few months, and she's been making tremendous changes that have led to acceleration. In the first quarter, you'll remember that the pandemic hit China first, so the first quarter comps were actually weaker than the second quarter in China, and so you see a bit of a comp effect. But fundamentally, all the initiatives that we've launched on a global level are on China -- speed in China, right?
So let me explain. From a factual perspective, right, so the second quarter growth was roughly 40% versus the previous year. Starting with instruments, the Arc HPLC was designed for the China market, and it's done very well especially given its better performance than any of the other instruments available in the market. Second, from a consumables perspective, we've seen really good progress in China in -- mostly in the -- even in excess of the instrument growth in some cases. And then finally, on the CRO, CDMO and CTO sort of initiatives, remember, we talked about the food market in the past, and we've said we were underweight in the food market in China. We've seen very good growth there, almost doubling of the business versus the same period last year. And then for the CRO and the CDMO piece are -- the growth that I mentioned was a global growth, meaning 60% on a 2-year stack basis. This in China is -- this turnaround of growth for CRO, CDMO segment started in China.
So I feel very good about what's happening in China. And we've just -- I would say we've just begun on looking at newer segments like the contract testing segments, both in food and pharma. We've started to work really efficiently and effectively on our presence and placement of instruments. And I feel very good about what we're going to do on the consumable side as well.

So first one, Udit, it is really around the instrument replacement cycle. My main question there is you pointed to Arc replacement being in the seventh inning, or correct me if I'm wrong, about 8,000 instruments or so. So my question is absolutely, first of all, it's great to see this replacement cycle. But in terms of when we think about next year, this does create tougher compares for 2022. You are replacing your own legacy LC Alliance here. So I'm just trying to understand, what are some other initiatives that you have ongoing including ACQUITY replacements, tandem triple quads replacements that you have talked about before? So just how should we think about this level of growth continuing into next year with further replacement cycles? Because, obviously, mass specs and tandem quads and liquid is -- are -- there's maybe a smaller installed base there than the Arc one. So if you could clarify that for next year, that would be great."

So vary",281,"Sure. Just to first quantify a little bit, right, so we've said there are about 8,000 or so Alliance instruments that require replacements that are our own; 4,000-ish, which is half the number for UPLC ACQUITY; and about 1,000 tandem quads, right? So varying degrees of progress on all of those. They should continue for a little bit of time while we work through our own portfolio and then turn our attention to the competitive portfolio as well, which are -- especially on the LC side, whatever is plugged into Empower, we've told our reps that anytime there's a replacement there, we want to be in competition, especially if it's a competitive instrument.
So your question is more around what challenges it creates for the future. First, let me start with the opportunity. The opportunity is that as you have more instruments-based, you start to see a better recurring revenue. I think that is the first and the most important piece. The second is on the replacement cycle, this will become modus operandi. As soon as we've worked through our own installed base and as we move to our competitors' installed base, our playbook, which has been honed over the last 6 months or so, is now becoming standard operating procedure for our reps around the globe. So it will be -- of course, I mean, from a mathematical perspective, the growth on the instrument side has been terrific. I mean, we think it's a benefit for our recurring revenues, both service and consumables. But it's becoming now modus operandi as we go forward. So Waters will no longer be letting instruments and perhaps even competitors go after our installed base."

And last week, I was at our Immerse site, Immerse innovation site in Cambridge, Mass. And I had an opportunity to talk to several customers, especially ones who are now working in the mRNA space and the siRNA space. And I would say universally, we're far from having solved the challenges for separating oligonucleotides and mRNA molecules, right?
I mean, if you just think of the progression there, number one, a large number of -- very large number of compounds in the pipeline that are now leveraging the mRNA technology, and you must have seen some recent acquisitions in the space as well. But if you break the problem down from a separation standpoint, there's the plasmid, there is the mRNA molecule, and then there's also the lipid nanoparticle. For all 3 of these moieties, we are far from having solved the aggregation problem, the problem of affinity to metal surfaces. And as I said earlier, the introduction of the Premier technology couldn't have come at a better time.
So I believe, given the further investment in the pipeline of molecules in this space, basically oligo-based compounds, our technological focus especially on separations of these complex molecules, first, with the Premier technology and others that we're working on bodes very well for what we see in the future. And I can tell you that, I mean, customers, while we have delivered -- while the customers and us working together have delivered vaccines in record times, they're very far from having made it an efficient process, so something that is a significant opportunity for Waters from an innovation standpoint as we go forward."

Along with Caspar joining me on this morning's call is Amol Chaubal, Waters Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
We have reported another quarter of strong broad-based momentum across our portfolio and geographies. We first thank our over 7,000 colleagues around the globe who represent the indomitable spirit of Waters. Our teams have remained focused on supporting our customers and developing and delivering exciting new products despite the continuing impact of the pandemic. 
September 1 marked 1 year since I joined the company and what a year it has been. I'm often asked what is different. I would first like to talk about what is the same because that is what is giving us the ability to compete more effectively. Our brand stands for deep scientific expertise, a clear understanding of our customers' challenges and courage to invest in game-changing innovation. This remains the same. 
What we have injected with our new leadership team is a stronger focus on execution, a sense of urgency and accountability. We are a work in progress, but the trend is positive. 
Now moving to Slide 3, which summarizes where we are on our journey. Firstly, we're sustaining our commercial momentum with another strong quarter delivering [indiscernible] sales growth of 6%, showing solid business performance with minimal COVID tailwinds. Meanwhile, our commercial initiatives and strong traction of new products like premier columns and instruments and Arc HPLC were well positioned to deliver market cost growth through 2022. Finally, preparing on this momentum by taking decisive steps and solving key problems that are present in higher growth adjacencies like biologics manufacturing. 
I will now provide a brief overview of our third quarter operating results, as well as commentary on our end markets, geographies and technologies. Amol will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our updated financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions. 
Moving now to Slide 4. In the third quarter, our revenue grew 11% as reported and on a constant currency basis, reflecting continued strength in our pharma and industrial end markets, with [indiscernible] demand for our instruments and recurring revenue products. This translates to a 6% stack CAGR for the quarter versus 2019 on a constant currency basis. Year-to-date, revenue has increased 21% with a constant currency tax CAGR versus 2019 also above 6%. 
Our top line growth resulted in Q3 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share of $2.66, growing 23% year-over-year. Year-to-date, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share have grown 39% to $7.54. 
Looking more closely at our top line results for the quarter on Slide 5 in constant currency, first, by operating segment. The Water division grew 9% while DA grew by 27%. By end market, our largest market category, pharma, grew 16%, industrial grew 9%, while academic and government declined by 11%. 
In Pharma, we saw a broad-based continued strength in sales across customer segments, geographies and applications. Specced was both in small molecule and large molecule applications, which both grew in mid-teens for the quarter. Industrial growth was regionally broad and led by our TA business saw strong growth globally in thermal, microcalorimetry and theology. 
Turning to academic and government, which is about 10% of our business, continued strength in Europe was offset by softer performance in China and other regions. 
Moving now to our sales performance by geography, on a constant currency basis, sales in the Americas grew 16%, with the U.S. growing 13%. Sales in Europe grew 8%. Sales in Asia grew 8%, with India over 40% and China sales were down 3%. 
Now to a bit of clarification on China. Demand remains very healthy as does the execution of our initiatives. A shipment of approximately $12 million got delayed at an airport in the last few days of the quarter due to a third-party shipping issue and has been delivered in the first few days of the fourth quarter. Looking therefore at China orders for the quarter, this was up mid-teens year-over-year. So really no challenge from a demand perspective. 
In the U.S., growth was led by a broad-based continued strength in our pharma and industrial end markets. In pharma, we saw strength across our instrument and chemistry portfolios. In Industrial, our Waters and TA businesses both saw strong growth. Europe demand remains robust across all end markets with continued strength in pharma, industrial and academic and government. 
For the quarter, India was our fastest-growing market, driven by very strong growth in instrument sales to our pharma customers. As you know, India is primarily a small molecule and generic market for export and this is indicative of continued strength in global pharmaceutical demand for small molecule drugs. 
At products and services, customer demand for our instruments remain strong after an impressive first half of the year, while recurring revenues also continued to see sustained growth. 
Overall, instrument sales grew 10% for the quarter, driven by robust demand, our improved commercial execution, new product contribution and instrument replacement. In LC, the newly released Arc HPLC continued to see strong growth and uptake of our premier instruments, both Arc and acuity, especially for applications in novel modalities like mRNA and Biologics remain solid. The strength we are seeing in our LC instrument portfolio remains a positive indicator for sustainable future growth in consumables and service. 
In mass spec, demand strength from pharma customers continued with strong demand for our single quad led by users for oligo and biologics purification as well as strength in our tandem quad used in late-stage product development. We're also encouraged by early interest in our Select Series MRT Time-of-Flight platform, which delivered highest quality resolution at fast speeds. 
Now for our recurring revenues, chemistry sales grew 13%, driven by an increase in utilization of our pharma customers, as well as strength in our industrial end markets. Demand for our new premier columns remains strong, while our e-commerce initiative is progressing and making it easier for our customers to do business with us. So far this year, our chemistry consumables have grown almost double digits when compared to our 2019 base. We're pleased that our premier technology is continuing to provide important benefits in separation and purification of mRNA and oligonucleotide molecules, given its unique ability to reduce selective binding of plasmids and mRNA to various services. 
Service also grew double digits again this quarter even as last year's comps have become tougher. On a 2-year stack basis, service grew 7% in constant currency for the quarter and 6% year-to-date. By focusing on our value proposition and commercial execution, we have seen an increase in service plan attachment rates and plan renewals. 
Finally, TA had a great quarter, with sales up almost 30% as demand has rebounded with strong growth across all regions. TA instrument sales have grown at 8% on a 2-year stack basis so far this year driven by strong demand for our thermal instruments used in the analysis of advanced materials, as well as microcalorimetry instrument demand for our pharma and academic customers. 
Moving now to Slide 6. Let me now focus on why we believe that we will continue to deliver market class growth. I think you're used to seeing these initiatives, so let me use the same trade starting from the left-hand side of the slide. In 2021, we expect our instrument replacement initiative to deliver over $30 million in revenue. In 2022, we expect this to become over $40 million, which means an incremental $10 million over 2021. 
Our focus on commercial execution is positively impacting our service business with planned coverage rates having increased by 2% so far this year compared to the first 3 quarters of 2019. In 2022, we think a further 100 basis points of expansion in service plan adoption is attainable. 
Growth in e-commerce adoption also remains strong with chemistry sales through our e-commerce channels approaching roughly 30% versus the 21% we saw in 2019. We expect this to continue reaching over 35% by the end of next year. So far, this year, revenue from contract organizations has grown over 40% versus the comparable period in 2019. Next year, we expect the expect this to grow low double digits for the year versus 2021. 
And new products continue to do well. We are just taking the example of Arc HPLC and Premier to illustrate the point here. Both Arc HPLC and Premier continue to be strong drivers with over $45 million revenue expected from these sources of this year in and separate to the replacement initiative.  In 2022, we are expecting this number to be over $60 million. So in all, these initiatives alone should give us approximately 1% over our base business growth for 2022, which reaffirm our belief in market growth rates. 
Moving now to Slide 7, we operate a strong core business in healthy and durable end markets. This strong foundation provides us a platform for solving critical problems facing our industry, where we can bring our scientific expertise and product portfolio capabilities. 
I would like to say there are 3 areas of focus, which also happen to be in high-growth end markets. First, in the biologics arena on the reagent side and bioseparations. We believe there are significant problems to solve in separating and purifying these newer modalities, having a deeper understanding of reagents coupled with our chemistry expertise will allow us to solve these problems. Second, in bioprocessing, the largest challenge I felt as an engineer in bioprocessing versus small molecule processing was that once you define the process, you got stuck with it because it was in a drug master file. We have to decouple the process from the product. Separately, the process development time scales are longer versus small molecules, given the sheer complexity of attributes you need to measure. A simple and robust tool that can measure multiple attributes as a potential solution. We believe that the bio cohort is the right LCMS tool that can begin to address this challenge. 
Third area is diagnostics, where we need a fast unbiased detection of multiple biomarkers to enable early disease detection.  We believe, again, mass spec has a significant role to play here. 
Moving now on to Slide 8. Let me illustrate what I mean by sharing what we are doing to solve some of the key problems in bioprocessing. Last week, we announced a partnership with[indiscernible], a leader in bioprocessing. We will combine our water Biocare system as a bioprocess analyzers with Sartorius amber bioreactors, giving scientists both faster and at line direct access to advanced quality characterization information. Scientists across [indiscernible] Waters and some of our customers have already shown that the combined offering will shorten product development timelines considerably, taking what currently takes 6 weeks to analyze down to only 2 days. It also lays the foundation for using the BioCore as a bioprocess analyzer for process control and quality testing in the future. BioAccord will be able to master its operation within 1 to 2 weeks. In fact, one of our customers had summer interns use the BioAccord and gave raving reviews on how simple it is to use I have been out of the last for many years, and I will [indiscernible] they were to learn quickly. 
[Audio Gap]
not just cell culture media, while targeting over 250 cell culture media analytics. Separately, we also announced a multiyear collaboration with the University of Delaware to develop technology for analytical characterization of manufacturing processes for biologics and normal modality. Through these partnerships, researchers from both Waters and the University of Delaware will identify and develop solutions that can provide better [indiscernible] sampling, make sensory [indiscernible] analytical instrument improvements and develop data analytics and process control. This partnership will help us expand our capabilities to characterize biological manufacturing processes in order to drive improvements in quality, yield, efficiency and process control. 
In summary, 2021 so far has been a very successful year for Waters. We are laser focused on our commercial execution. The markets we serve are in a healthy state and our geographic regions have rebounded solidly from pandemic lows. Meanwhile, I'm convinced of the great opportunity that lies ahead of us in helping customers solve the most complex problems in our industry. 
With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Amol for a deeper review of third quarter financials and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Amol?"

As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of $659 million in the third quarter, an increase of 11% in constant currency. Reported sales growth was also 11%.

As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of $659 million in the third quarter, an increase of 11% in constant currency. Reported sales growth was also 11%. 
Looking at product line growth, our recurring revenue, which represents the combination of chemistry and service revenue increased by 11% for the quarter, while instrument sales increased 10%. Chemistry revenues were up 13% and service revenues were up 10%. As we noted in our last earnings call, recurring revenues were not impacted by a difference in calendar days this quarter. Looking ahead, there are 6 fewer days in fourth quarter of this year compared to 2020. 
Now I would like to comment on our third quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.9%, as compared to 55.8% in the third quarter of 2020. Improvement was driven primarily by volume leverage and revenue mix. The foreign exchange benefit in the quarter was about 1%. 
Moving down the P&L, operating expenses increased by approximately 17% on a constant currency basis and on a reported basis. The increase was primarily attributable to higher labor cost due to the normalization of prior year cost actions, as well as higher variable compensation on the higher sales volume. 
In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 11.7%, a decrease from last year due to some favorable quarter specific discrete items. Excluding the impact of these discrete items, our year-to-date tax rate is consistent with the prior year. Our average share count came in at 61.9 million shares or about 400,000 less than the third quarter of last year as a result of our share repurchase program. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the third quarter increased 23% to $2.66 in comparison to $2.16 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per diluted share increased to $2.60 compared to $2.03 last year [indiscernible] to non-GAAP earnings a [indiscernible] in the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of this presentation. 
Turning to free cash flow, we define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures. In the third quarter of 2021, free cash flow was $140 million after funding $40 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from the free cash flow was $12 million relating to investment in our content, approximately $0.25 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. 
In the third quarter, accounts receivable DSO came in at 71 days, down 5 days compared to the third quarter of last year and down 2 days compared to the last quarter. Inventory DIO decreased by 13 days compared to the third quarter of last year. Given the higher sales volume, and our proactive measures to secure supply, inventory increased by 62 million. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. 
In terms of returning capital to shareholders, first, we repurchased approximately 369,000 shares of our common stock for 151 million in Q3. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was $958 million, with net debt-to-EBITDA ratio about 1. Our capital deployment priorities are to invest in growth, maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility, return capital to shareholders and to deploy capital to well thought out, attractive and adjacent growth opportunities. 
As we look forward to the remainder of the year, I would like to provide you with some update on our thoughts for 2021 on Slide 11. Throughout this year, we've seen good momentum driven by robust end market demand and strong commercial execution. We believe that this momentum will continue and expect our near-term growth initiatives to continue to contribute meaningfully to our performance. Looking at the fourth quarter, the comparison is more challenging as it was the first quarter in our transformation journey and was further favorably impacted by post lockdown elevated year-end budget [indiscernible] spending. In addition, we have 6 fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of this year. This dynamic supports raising full year 2021 guidance to 15% to 16% constant currency sales growth. 
At current exchange rates, the positive currency translation is expected to add approximately 1 percentage point, resulting in full year reported sales growth guidance of 16% to 17%. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 58% to 59%, and operating margin is expected to be approximately 29% to 30%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be $34 million and full year tax rate to be 14% to 15%. Average diluted 2021 share count is expected to be approximately $62 million. Our share repurchase program will also continue into Q4, and we'll provide quarterly updates as appropriate. 
Rolling all this together on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $10.94 to $11.04. This includes a positive percentage points at today's rate and assumes no material adverse supply impact from COVID.
Looking at the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 5% to 7%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 2 percentage points from $0.40 to $3.50. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately 3 percentage points at today's rates and assumes no material adverse supply impact from COVID.

Before I wrap things up, I would like to make a few comments on our ESG efforts and our core principles to fuel innovation and make a positive impact. This includes doing our part to reduce our environmental footprint and leave the world better than we found it, being representative of the diverse society we live in and providing effective governance that enhances long-term shareholder value. You will see more of our progress in each of these areas in our 2021 sustainability report coming out later this month.
Turning to Slide 10, I was particularly moved recently by the new internship program we developed with Team New England designed to increase access to STEM education for students of all backgrounds. Over the course of 6 weeks, we gave high school students a hands-on learning experience with a mix of science, business and soft skills. Over 70 Waters employees were involved, who gave practical exposure and mentorship. We look forward to continuing these efforts in the future. 
In summary, we continue to be pleased with our performance this year, we're sustaining our commercial momentum with our initiatives which continue to perform well and should provide a multiyear benefit as we continue to strengthen our core. We are continuing to track 6% on a 2-year CAGR -- track 6% on a 2-year CAGR for our revenue in constant currency, showing that our core is strong. We are focused on accelerating innovation to our portfolio and reaching these higher growth rate areas in adjacent markets. 
With that, we will now begin the Q&A answer session. Thank you."

We've always said market plus and what gives us conviction that market plus, the initiatives that we've outlined, including the replacement, including additional penetration in different channels and better launch of new products. So wherever the market is, we expect to be market plus given the initiatives. And in terms of what you should expect for next year, again, the same logic applies, right? If the market is 4, we should be 4 plus if it 5, we should be 5 plus and if it's 6 it should be 6 plus. There's no reason to believe that the market should slow down.

The first, we have to make sure we do more of the same, right? And that's that I feel really good about, especially with the leadership of John Pratt and Ian King really executing even further on our initiatives. Second, feel very good about our ability to bring in new products to the market. They have tremendous, tremendous traction, right, especially the products that we've launched recently, Arc HPLC, the Premier columns, both adding significantly the top line. And the MRT, the Select series MRT, has a lot of interest from our customers across proteomics, across imaging and across many different segments. So we feel very good about what our pipeline is contributing, and there is more to come there. And finally, to your question on M&A, look, I mean, we've outlined the areas of growth we are interested in. And I think what you will see is that we're not just interested in entering these areas [indiscernible]. We are really thinking hard about what are the key problems to solve, right? So as an example, with bioprocessing as an engineer, and freshly minted after finishing my PhD days into my new job. I was ushered into a manufacturing plant where we were still manufacturing vaccines using chicken embryo eggs. So I sat with eggs opening them up, and I won't tell you the rest of the process. The process was designed many, many years ago, probably a decade ago. And the reason that you were -- that you -- and that's how in the [indiscernible] vaccines are still manufactured today. while we have much better technology in cell culture to be able to manufacture the same type of vaccine. And the reason for that sort of conservatism is that the process and the product are indistinguishable in the drug master than you file for biologics. And that's something that we really want to work on. We believe that our collaboration with the University of Delaware will help us make strides in that direction. And I'm super excited about what we just announced with Sartorius. Sartorius is a leader in bioprocessing and they have probably the deepest penetration of small early-stage bioreactors that are used for clone selection. 
And that collaboration has 2 benefits. One, we're able to take the BioAccord and improve a process that takes about 6 weeks down to 2 days. and that's shown in collaboration with Sartoria scientists and our scientists as well as customers. So very excited about that. There are several hundred amber bioreactors out there, and so we hope to be able to take advantage of that. And then secondly, it opens up for Waters a higher growth area where we would have not otherwise entered. I mean in this case, we want to enter with the capabilities that we possess. So feel extremely good about the initiative. So in summary, continuing the commercial momentum; second, recharging innovation; and third, looking to enter these faster growth areas through first partnerships and increasingly open to M&A if it makes sense. But I remind you that for M&A, we are a financially disciplined company. So you won't see us jumping in head first into something that doesn't make."

And then the other 2 pieces are of the supply chain that are -- that have been talked about a lot are inflation. We do see inflation specifically in U.S. labor, but I think we haven't been able to offset price increases with our customers. So hopefully, that gives you enough color on how we see it.

So nothing to sort of point out systemically. Overall, if you look at the market. 
Now the performance is a bit sort of different by region. Europe is doing extremely well, whereas China and the U.S. are a bit slower. And that has to do with the 2 reasons. One, as we pointed out, academic and government is a small portion of our business and historically has not been a huge focus for Waters. We have, with John's arrival, we have started to increase our focus on that segment as well. And if you think about the instruments part of the business, that really depends on deep P&L relationships and customer relationships. And this, over time, had sort of slowed down in many markets. in Europe, we've come out of the gates very well. We've started to reestablish those relationships and you see the impact on the results year-to-date. In U.S. and China, that's work in progress, and we'll give you updates as we go along. I'm optimistic  with the activity I see, especially on e-commerce and in procurement, and you see the results in our consumables business.

Unfortunately, I was learning baseball, so I kept using the baseball analogy and people have talked sense into me to start talking in revenue numbers. So that's why we put that slide together which was Slide 6 in the prepared remarks. Look, we saw, what, say, 1% to 1.5% acceleration on a stacked basis due to the initiatives. And the initiatives were not just the instrument replacement. We saw service attachment increase of aftermarket. We saw e-commerce adoption grow from 20 to 27, 28%. Contract organizations grew, which was a new channel for us, grew roughly 40% over a 2-year basis. And new product contribution also did extremely well. So across the board, 1% to 1.5% sort of benefit over what I would say, the base growth and robust end markets. Next year, we think that's roughly 1% versus the base market growth or whatever the base market growth will be. So for instrument replacement this year, we had roughly $30 million or so of benefit. Next year it will be $40 million, which is $10 million incremental, right? So that's how I would think about it, right? So for service, 200 basis points, another 100 basis points on top. So the 200 basis points already benefits us next year. And then e-commerce goes we can read the chart. So I think that for me is how I would think about 2022 and beyond, right? And as you think about what's happening in beyond, this is now part of our CRM system. This is part of our execution that John Pratt and Ian King are implementing, right? So we now have the full list of HPLC, UPLC as well as the tandem quad in the CRM system that our reps are going through step-by-step and replacing. And this will continue next year and will go on into the year after. Same thing is true for our service attachment rates. We know where the attachment rates are. We're using that database to now go after it. So it has become part of the DNA of the organization. And I think that gives me confidence that we will be able to accelerate also next year. And then finally, new products, as I mentioned, doing very well. MRT has just started to pick up. A lot of interest we've talked about Arc HPLC and Premier doing very well. So we fairly good about that 1% incremental over what any sort of market growth."

So we are seeing even a bigger acceleration relatively speaking, in industrial versus seeing pharma. And I must say we're seeing extremely, extremely good performance out of the PA business, right? So nice performance across the different customer segments, be it in advanced materials, be it batteries where we test slurries for renewable batteries. And I don't need to tell you why that's important these days. Electronics, that's growing in the high teens, double digit. The life science part of our PA business also growing nicely. So in TA, we're seeing really, really good momentum. And again, on a stack basis, even outpacing the overall business roughly 8% or so growth. So I think industrial, we feel that our customers have found a way to work despite the pandemic. Our service engineers and our sales teams have access to many of these customers initially virtually, but in many regions increasingly also physically. Our service engineers, both across Waters and TA are actually more welcome at our customers. And many of their own employees. So industrial has picked up nice strength, and it's true across all geographies. China is doing well. U.S. doing quite -- basically it's really an area of strength and we're lucky to have a business like TA that's kind of pointed in that direction."

LC, even higher than 30%, mass spec slightly shy of 30%. So nothing to choose between the 2 sort of product platforms. But I think it makes more sense to talk about it on a stacked basis. But historically, Waters have seen instrument growth between 3% and 4%. We've sort of steadily now year-to-date stack growth is steadily around 5-ish percent really nice momentum. And this is true both across LC as well as mass spec and not a differentiate the 2. Now you asked about mass spec in particular. In mass spec, the demand is driven by -- across all our portfolios across users in  high res mass spec across our [indiscernible] courts, which are both used the single [indiscernible] used for intact mass and also our [indiscernible] that are used in development as well as environmental. And then, of course, as I mentioned, the BioAccord, we see renewed momentum and a lot of interest in the bioprocessing arena. So mass spec is going from strength to strength. 
Now turning to the second part of your question on new products, as I pointed out on -- in the prepared remarks, right, on HPLC, just focusing on HPLC for a minute, Arc HPLC as well as the premier technology, which includes columns as well as the application of this unique technology to our instruments has led to roughly $45 million in sales in 2021. We expect that to go up to 60-plus million, so about 15 million also incremental. That's in the LC space. On mass spec, new applications for BioAccord. I already mentioned that in the the prepared remarks and the MRT has a lot of interest from many of our customers, especially ones who want to use it in the proteomics space and for imaging with our [indiscernible] technology, which can be used under ambient conditions, which is quite unique. So again, new products. Waters has had a history of introducing game-changing new products. I think what we are doing differently is just making sure that there is a lot of traction once we launch these products, and they're not just [indiscernible]."

Second, it's our initiatives the replacement be do products. And your question is is increased applications.

Second, it's our initiatives the replacement be do products. And your question is is increased applications. And I would break it into 2 parts. One, we are indeed seeing increased application of our technologies in oligonucleotides, in mRNA. So for instance, I met somebody from a leading mRNA company in Cambridge recently, and they basically said, look, the huge aggregation problems with plasma, with the mRNA molecular cells, as well as with the lipid encapsulated mRNA molecule. So they are turning to us to help us help them solve these problems, one, by retaining more samples by using Premier; and two, by using LCMS to elucidate the structures of the molecules themselves. So good application there. And a lot of them being in development and discovery and hopefully, increasingly in QA/QC. 
Second area that I would comment on is the wider application of the BioAccord. You'll recall the product was initially launched really focused on CMS which we still have in QA/QC, we still believe that CMS has a strong place in QC provided the instrument that you have is simple, robust and fast and give you faster results. But that same value proposition is equally relevant in development of -- in early stage, really good application there. With Sartorius that some experiments that takes 6 weeks can now be turned around within [indiscernible] Sartorius lab labs and in several customer labs. So as you can imagine, there's a ton of excitement on that front. And the BioAccord is rather unique here. The results are fast. It's a simple-to-use instrument, even somebody like me can use. A wide range of results not just on cell culture media applications where it's much wider than any, but also on the drug 
[Audio Gap] 
seeing wider application of our technologies and really excited about where LCMS is going, especially the BioAccord with the simplicity and robustness and [indiscernible] in early stage development and bioprocessing."

Along with Caspar joining me on this morning's call is Amol Chaubal, Waters Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  
We have reported another quarter of strong broad-based momentum across our portfolio and geographies. We first thank our over 7,000 colleagues around the globe, who represent the indomitable spirit of Waters. Our teams have remained focused on supporting our customers and developing and delivering exciting new products despite the continuing impact of the pandemic.  
September 1 marked 1 year since I joined the company and what a year it has been. I'm often asked what is different. I would first like to talk about what is the same because that is what is giving us the ability to compete more effectively. Our brand stands for deep scientific expertise, a clear understanding of our customers' challenges and courage to invest in game-changing innovation. This remains the same.  
What we have injected with our new leadership team is a stronger focus on execution, a sense of urgency and accountability. We are a work in progress, but the trend is positive.  
Now moving to Slide 3, which summarizes where we are on our journey. Firstly, we're sustaining our commercial momentum with another strong quarter delivering flat sales growth of 6%, showing solid business performance with minimal COVID tailwinds. Meanwhile, our commercial initiatives and strong traction of new products like premier columns and instruments and Arc HPLC were well-positioned to deliver market cost growth through 2022. 
Finally, preparing on this momentum by taking decisive steps and solving key problems that are present in higher growth adjacencies like biologics manufacturing.  
I will now provide a brief overview of our third quarter operating results, as well as commentary on our end markets, geographies and technologies. Amol will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our updated financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.  
Moving now to Slide 4. In the third quarter, our revenue grew 11% as reported and on a constant currency basis, reflecting continued strength in our pharma and industrial end markets, with balanced demand for our instruments and recurring revenue products. This translates to a 6% stack CAGR for the quarter versus 2019 on a constant currency basis. Year-to-date, revenue has increased 21% with a constant currency tax CAGR versus 2019 also above 6%.  
Our top line growth resulted in Q3 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share of $2.66, growing 23% year-over-year. Year-to-date, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share have grown 39% to $7.54.  
Looking more closely at our top-line results for the quarter on Slide 5 in constant currency, first, by operating segment. The Water division grew 9% while DA grew by 27%. By end market, our largest market category, pharma, grew 16%, industrial grew 9%, while academic and government declined by 11%.  
In Pharma, we saw a broad-based continued strength in sales across customer segments, geographies and applications. [ Specced ] was both in small molecule and large molecule applications, which both grew in mid-teens for the quarter. Industrial growth was regionally broad and led by our TA business, which saw strong growth globally in thermal, microcalorimetry and theology.  
Turning to academic and government, which is about 10% of our business, continued strength in Europe was offset by softer performance in China and other regions.  
Moving now to our sales performance by geography, on a constant currency basis, sales in the Americas grew 16%, with the U.S. growing 13%. Sales in Europe grew 8%. Sales in Asia grew 8%, with India over 40% and China sales were down 3%.  
Now to a bit of clarification on China. Demand remains very healthy as does the execution of our initiatives. A shipment of approximately $12 million got delayed at an airport in the last few days of the quarter due to a third-party shipping issue and has been delivered in the first few days of the fourth quarter. Looking therefore at China orders for the quarter, this was up mid-teens year-over-year. So really no challenge from a demand perspective.  
In the U.S., growth was led by a broad-based continued strength in our pharma and industrial end markets. In pharma, we saw strength across our instrument and chemistry portfolios. In Industrial, our Waters and TA businesses both saw strong growth. Europe demand remains robust across all end markets with continued strength in pharma, industrial and academic and government.  
For the quarter, India was our fastest-growing market, driven by very strong growth in instrument sales to our pharma customers. As you know, India is primarily a small molecule and generic market for export and this is indicative of continued strength in global pharmaceutical demand for small molecule drugs.  
At products and services, customer demand for our instruments remain strong after an impressive first half of the year, while recurring revenues also continued to see sustained growth.  
Overall, instrument sales grew 10% for the quarter, driven by robust demand, our improved commercial execution, new product contribution and instrument replacement. In LC, the newly released Arc HPLC continued to see strong growth and uptake of our premier instruments, both Arc and acuity, especially for applications in novel modalities like mRNA and Biologics remain solid. 
The strength we are seeing in our LC instrument portfolio remains a positive indicator for sustainable future growth in consumables and service.  
In mass spec, demand strength from pharma customers continued with strong demand for our single quad led by users for oligo and biologics purification as well as strength in our tandem quad used in late-stage product development. We're also encouraged by early interest in our Select Series MRT Time-of-Flight platform, which delivered highest quality resolution at fast speeds.  
Now for our recurring revenues, chemistry sales grew 13%, driven by an increase in utilization of our pharma customers, as well as strength in our industrial end markets. Demand for our new premier columns remains strong, while our e-commerce initiative is progressing and making it easier for our customers to do business with us. So far this year, our chemistry consumables have grown almost double digits when compared to our 2019 base. 
We're pleased that our premier technology is continuing to provide important benefits in separation and purification of mRNA and oligonucleotide molecules, given its unique ability to reduce selective binding of plasmids and mRNA to various services.  
Service also grew double digits again this quarter even as last year's comps have become tougher. On a 2-year stack basis, service grew 7% in constant currency for the quarter and 6% year-to-date. By focusing on our value proposition and commercial execution, we have seen an increase in service plan attachment rates and plan renewals.  
Finally, TA had a great quarter, with sales up almost 30% as demand has rebounded with strong growth across all regions. TA instrument sales have grown at 8% on a 2-year stack basis so far this year driven by strong demand for our thermal instruments used in the analysis of advanced materials, as well as microcalorimetry instrument demand for our pharma and academic customers.  
Moving now to Slide 6. Let me now focus on why we believe that we will continue to deliver market class growth. I think you're used to seeing these initiatives, so let me use the same [ trend ] starting from the left-hand side of the slide. In 2021, we expect our instrument replacement initiative to deliver over $30 million in revenue. In 2022, we expect this to become over $40 million, which means an incremental $10 million over 2021.  
Our focus on commercial execution is positively impacting our service business with planned coverage rates having increased by 2% so far this year compared to the first 3 quarters of 2019. In 2022, we think a further 100 basis points of expansion in service plan adoption is attainable.  
Growth in e-commerce adoption also remains strong with chemistry sales through our e-commerce channels approaching roughly 30% versus the 21% we saw in 2019. We expect this to continue reaching over 35% by the end of next year. So far, this year, revenue from contract organizations has grown over 40% versus the comparable period in 2019. Next year, we expect the expect this to grow low double digits for the year versus 2021.  
And new products continue to do well. We are just taking the example of Arc HPLC and Premier to illustrate the point here. Both Arc HPLC and Premier continue to be strong drivers with over $45 million revenue expected from these sources of this year in and separate to the replacement initiative.  
In 2022, we are expecting this number to be over $60 million. So in all, these initiatives alone should give us approximately 1% over our base business growth for 2022, which reaffirm our belief in market plus growth rates.  
Moving now to Slide 7, we operate a strong core business in healthy and durable end markets. This strong foundation provides us a platform for solving critical problems facing our industry, where we can bring our scientific expertise and product portfolio capabilities.  
I would like to say, there are 3 areas of focus, which also happen to be in high-growth end markets. First, in the biologics arena on the reagent side and bioseparations. We believe there are significant problems to solve in separating and purifying these newer modalities, having a deeper understanding of reagents coupled with our chemistry expertise will allow us to solve these problems. 
Second, in bioprocessing, the largest challenge I felt as an engineer in bioprocessing versus small molecule processing was that once you define the process, you got stuck with it because it was in a drug master file. We have to decouple the process from the product. Separately, the process development time scales are longer versus small molecules, given the sheer complexity of attributes you need to measure. 
A simple and robust tool that can measure multiple attributes as a potential solution. We believe that the bio cohort is the right LCMS tool that can begin to address this challenge.  
Third area is diagnostics, where we need a fast unbiased detection of multiple biomarkers to enable early disease detection.  We believe, again, mass spec has a significant role to play here.  
Moving now on to Slide 8. Let me illustrate what I mean by sharing what we are doing to solve some of the key problems in bioprocessing. Last week, we announced a partnership with Sartorius, a leader in bioprocessing. We will combine our water Biocare system as a bioprocess analyzers with Sartorius amber bioreactors, giving scientists both faster and at line direct access to advanced quality characterization information. 
Scientists across Sartorius, Waters and some of our customers have already shown that the combined offering will shorten product development timelines considerably, taking what currently takes 6 weeks to analyze down to only 2 days. It also lays the foundation for using the BioCore as a bioprocess analyzer for process control and quality testing in the future. 
BioAccord is both versatile and easy to use and we expect that process engineers will be able to master its operation within 1 to 2 weeks. In fact, one of our customers had summer interns use the BioAccord and gave raving reviews on how simple it is to use. I'm also an engineer who have been out of the last for many years, and I was able to learn quickly.
Resulting [ configuration ] will allow direct analysis of bulk substance not just cell culture media, while targeting over 250 cell culture media analytics. Separately, we also announced a multiyear collaboration with the University of Delaware to develop technology for analytical characterization of manufacturing processes for biologics and normal modality. 
Through these partnerships, researchers from both Waters and the University of Delaware will identify and develop solutions that can provide better [ aseptic ] sampling, make sensor and analytical instrument improvements and develop data analytics and process control. This partnership will help us expand our capabilities to characterize biological manufacturing processes in order to drive improvements in quality, yield, efficiency and process control.  
In summary, 2021 so far has been a very successful year for Waters. We are laser focused on our commercial execution. The markets we serve are in a healthy state and our geographic regions have rebounded solidly from pandemic lows. Meanwhile, I'm convinced of the great opportunity that lies ahead of us higher growth adjacencies to impact and deliver value by extending our scientific expertise and product portfolio towards helping customers solve the most complex problems in our industry.  
With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Amol for a deeper review of third quarter financials and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Amol?"
36475,1684671600,2421280,"Waters Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Waters Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of [ $659 million ] in the third quarter, an increase of 11% in constant currency. Reported sales growth was also 11%.  Looking at product line growth, our recurring re",967,"Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of [ $659 million ] in the third quarter, an increase of 11% in constant currency. Reported sales growth was also 11%.  
Looking at product line growth, our recurring revenue, which represents the combination of chemistry and service revenue increased by 11% for the quarter, while instrument sales increased 10%. Chemistry revenues were up 13% and service revenues were up 10%.  As we noted in our last earnings call, recurring revenues were not impacted by a difference in calendar days this quarter. 
Looking ahead, there are 6 fewer days in fourth quarter of this year compared to 2020.  
Now I would like to comment on our third quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.9%, as compared to 55.8% in the third quarter of 2020. Improvement was driven primarily by volume leverage and revenue mix. The foreign exchange benefit in the quarter was about 1%.  
Moving down the P&L, operating expenses increased by approximately 17% on a constant currency basis and on a reported basis. The increase was primarily attributable to higher labor cost due to the normalization of prior year cost actions, as well as higher variable compensation on the higher sales volume. 
In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 11.7%, a decrease from last year due to some favorable quarter specific discrete items. Excluding the impact of these discrete items, our year-to-date tax rate is consistent with the prior year. Our average share count came in at 61.9 million shares or about 400,000 less than the third quarter of last year as a result of our share repurchase program. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the third quarter increased 23% to $2.66 in comparison to $2.16 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $2.60 compared to $2.03 last year. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached in the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of this presentation. 
Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment in our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and exclude special items. In the third quarter of 2021, free cash flow was $140 million after funding $40 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from the free cash flow was $12 million relating to investment in our Taunton precision chemistry.  Year-to-date free cash flow has increased to $488 million and at approximately $0.25 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. 
In the third quarter, accounts receivable DSO came in at 71 days, down 5 days compared to the third quarter of last year and down 2 days compared to the last quarter. Inventory DIO decreased by 13 days compared to the third quarter of last year. Given the higher sales volume, and our proactive measures to secure supply, inventory increased by 62 million in comparison to the prior year. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. 
In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 369,000 shares of our common stock for $151 million in Q3. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was $958 million, with net debt-to-EBITDA ratio about 1. Our capital deployment priorities are to invest in growth, maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility, return capital to shareholders and to deploy capital to well thought out, attractive and adjacent growth opportunities. 
As we look forward to the remainder of the year, I would like to provide you with some update on our thoughts for 2021 on Slide 11. Throughout this year, we've seen good momentum driven by robust end market demand and strong commercial execution. We believe that this momentum will continue and expect our near-term growth initiatives to continue to contribute meaningfully to our performance. 
Looking at the fourth quarter, the comparison is more challenging as it was the first quarter in our transformation journey and was further favorably impacted by post lockdown elevated year-end budget plus spending. In addition, we have 6 fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of this year. This dynamic supports raising full year 2021 guidance to 15% to 16% constant currency sales growth. 
At current exchange rates, the positive currency translation is expected to add approximately 1 percentage point, resulting in full year reported sales growth guidance of 16% to 17%. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 58% to 59%, and operating margin is expected to be approximately 29% to 30%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be $34 million and full year tax rate to be 14% to 15%. 
Average diluted 2021 share count is expected to be approximately $62 million. Our share repurchase program will also continue into Q4, and we'll provide quarterly updates as appropriate. 
Rolling all this together on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $10.94 to $11.04. This includes a positive currency impact of approximately 2 percentage points at today's rate and assumes no material adverse supply impact from COVID.
Looking at the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 5% to 7%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 2 percentage points resulting in fourth quarter reported sales growth guidance of 3% to 5%.  Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range $3.40 to $3.50. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately 3 percentage points at today's rates and assumes no material adverse supply impact from COVID.
Now, I would like to turn it back to Udit for summary comments. Udit?"

Before I wrap things up, I would like to make a few comments on our ESG efforts and our core principles to fuel innovation and make a positive impact. This includes doing our part to reduce our environmental footprint and leave the world better than we found it, being representative of the diverse society we live in and providing effective governance that enhances long-term shareholder value. 
You will see more of our progress in each of these areas in our 2021 sustainability report coming out later this month.
Turning to Slide 10, I was particularly moved recently by the new internship program we developed with Team New England designed to increase access to STEM education for students of all backgrounds. Over the course of 6 weeks, we gave high school students a hands-on learning experience with a mix of science, business and soft skills. Over 70 Waters employees were involved, who gave practical exposure and mentorship. We look forward to continuing these efforts in the future. 
In summary, we continue to be pleased with our performance this year, we're sustaining our commercial momentum with our initiatives, which continue to perform well and should provide a multiyear benefit as we continue to strengthen our core. We are continuing to track 6% on a 2-year CAGR [indiscernible] 6% on a 2-year CAGR for our revenue in constant currency, showing that our core is strong. We are focused on accelerating innovation to our portfolio and reaching these higher growth rate areas in adjacent markets. 
With that, we will now begin the Q&A answer session. Thank you."

And we would feel that the transformation is now hitting its stride. So the base business should continue to track along those lines now. 
We've always said market plus and what gives us conviction that market plus, the initiatives that we've outlined, including the replacement, including additional penetration in different channels and better launch of new products. So wherever the market is, we expect to be market plus given the initiatives. And in terms of what you should expect for next year, again, the same logic applies, right? If the market is 4, we should be 4 plus, if it 5, we should be 5 plus, and if it's 6, it should be 6 plus. 
There's no reason to believe that the market should slow down. The -- all our end markets are doing super well. I mean you saw that year-to-date, both pharma and industrial are tracking close to 20%.

The first, we have to make sure we do more of the same, right? And that's, that I feel really good about, especially with the leadership of John Pratt and Ian King really executing even further on our initiatives. Second, feel very good about our ability to bring in new products to the market. They have tremendous, tremendous traction, right, especially the products that we've launched recently, Arc HPLC, the Premier columns, both adding significantly the top line. 
And the MRT, the Select series MRT, has a lot of interest from our customers across proteomics, across imaging and across many different segments. So we feel very good about what our pipeline is contributing, and there is more to come there. And finally, to your question on M&A, look, I mean, we've outlined the areas of growth we are interested in. And I think, what you will see is that we're not just interested in entering these areas really  [indiscernible]. 
We are really thinking hard about what are the key problems to solve, right? So as an example, with bioprocessing as an engineer, and freshly minted after finishing my PhD days into my new job. I was ushered into a manufacturing plant where we were still manufacturing vaccines using chicken embryo eggs. So I sat with eggs opening them up, and I won't tell you the rest of the process. The process was designed many, many years ago, probably a decade ago. 
And the reason that you were -- that you -- and that's how in the [indiscernible] vaccines are still manufactured today. While we have much better technology in cell culture to be able to manufacture the same type of vaccine. And the reason for that sort of conservatism is that the process and the product are indistinguishable in the drug master file that you file for biologics. And that's something that we really want to work on. 
We believe that our collaboration with the University of Delaware will help us make strides in that direction. And I'm super excited about what we just announced with Sartorius. Sartorius is a leader in bioprocessing and they have probably the deepest penetration of small early-stage bioreactors that are used for clone selection. 
And that collaboration has 2 benefits. One, we're able to take the BioAccord and improve a process that takes about 6 weeks down to 2 days. and that's been shown in collaboration with Sartorius scientists and our scientists as well as customers. So very excited about that. There are several hundred amber bioreactors out there, and so we hope to be able to take advantage of that. And then secondly, it opens up for Waters a higher growth area where we would have not otherwise entered. 
I mean in this case, we want to enter with the capabilities that we possess. So feel extremely good about the initiative. So in summary, continuing the commercial momentum; second, recharging innovation; and third, looking to enter these faster growth areas through first partnerships and increasingly open to M&A, if it makes sense. But I remind you that for M&A, we are a financially disciplined company. So you won't see us jumping in head first into something that doesn't make."

We built really strong commercial momentum even in a Food and Environmental markets [indiscernible] super well. So feel extremely good about where we are in China. So nothing really to flag from a demand perspective. 
And on your question on supply chain, look, like everybody else, in fact, like everybody else, we are seeing constraints in shipping in different ports that appears sporadically, right? We don't think it's a systemic issue. It's a sporadic issue. And we are not unique in experiencing those challenges. 
In fact, I was with a few colleagues in different industries last week and virtually everyone is experiencing for us a little bit of unpredictable changes in supply chain. So we're not immune to that. And I think if somebody tells you that they are, they're probably not shipping as much. 
And then the other 2 pieces are of the supply chain that are -- that have been talked about a lot are inflation. We do see inflation specifically in U.S. labor, but I think we haven't been able to offset by price increases with our customers. So hopefully, that gives you enough color on how we see it. 
So China really nothing to flag, no problem at all from a demand perspective and from a supply chain perspective, feeling what everybody else feels, really happy with the way our teams are working to surmount these issues and passing on prices where it makes sense to our customers."

So nothing to sort of point out systemically. Overall, if you look at the market. 
Now the performance is a bit sort of different by region. Europe is doing extremely well, whereas China and the U.S. are a bit slower. And that has to do with 2 reasons. One, as we pointed out, academic and government is a small portion of our business and historically has not been a huge focus for Waters. We have, with John's arrival, we have started to increase our focus on that segment as well. 
And if you think about the instruments part of the business, that really depends on deep [ P&L ] relationships and customer relationships. And this, over time, had sort of slowed down in many markets. In Europe, we've come out of the gates very well. We've started to reestablish those relationships and you see the impact on the results year-to-date.

Unfortunately, I was learning baseball, so I kept using the baseball analogy and people have talked sense into me to start talking in revenue numbers. So that's why we put that slide together, which was Slide 6 in the prepared remarks. Look, we saw, what, say, 1% to 1.5% acceleration on a stacked basis due to the initiatives. And the initiatives were not just the instrument replacement. We saw service attachment increase of aftermarket. 
We saw e-commerce adoption grow from 20 to 27, 28%. Contract organizations grew, which was a new channel for us, grew roughly 40% over a 2-year basis. And new product contribution also did extremely well. So across the board, 1% to 1.5% sort of benefit over what I would say, the base growth and robust end markets. Next year, we think that's roughly 1% versus the base market growth or whatever the base market growth will be. 
So for instrument replacement this year, we had roughly $30 million or so of benefit. Next year it will be $40 million, which is $10 million incremental, right? So that's how I would think about it, right? So for service, 200 basis points, another 100 basis points on top. So the 200 basis points already benefits us next year. And then e-commerce goes and I think, we can read the chart.
So I think that for me is how I would think about 2022 and beyond, right? And as you think about what's happening in beyond, this is now part of our CRM system. This is part of our execution that John Pratt and Ian King are implementing, right? So we now have the full list of HPLC, UPLC as well as the tandem quad in the CRM system that our reps are going through step-by-step and replacing. And this will continue next year and will go on into the year after. 
Same thing is true for our service attachment rates. We know where the attachment rates are. We're using that database to now go after it. So it has become part of the DNA of the organization. And I think that gives me confidence that we will be able to accelerate also next year. And then finally, new products, as I mentioned, doing very well. MRT has just started to pick up. A lot of interest, we've talked about Arc HPLC and Premier doing very well. So we fairly good about that 1% incremental over what would be any sort of market growth."

So we are seeing even a bigger acceleration relatively speaking, in industrial versus seeing pharma. And I must say we're seeing extremely, extremely good performance out of the TA business, right? So nice performance across the different customer segments, be it in advanced materials, be it batteries where we test slurries for renewable batteries. 
And I don't need to tell you why that's important these days. Electronics, that's growing in the high teens, double digit. The life science part of our TA business also growing nicely. So in TA, we're seeing really, really good momentum. And again, on a stack basis, even outpacing the overall business roughly 8% or so growth. So I think industrial, we feel that our customers have found a way to work despite the pandemic. 
Our service engineers and our sales teams have access to many of these customers initially virtually, but in many regions increasingly also physically. Our service engineers, both across Waters and TA are actually more welcome at our customer site and many of their own employees. So industrial has picked up nice strength, and it's true across all geographies. China is doing well.
U.S., Europe, Western Asia doing quite -- basically it's really an area of strength and we're lucky to have a business like TA that's kind of pointed in that direction."

LC, even higher than 30%, mass spec slightly shy of 30%. So nothing to choose between the 2 sort of product platforms. But I think it makes more sense to talk about it on a stacked basis. But historically, Waters have seen instrument growth between 3% and 4%. We've sort of steadily now year-to-date stack growth is steadily around 5-ish percent. 
So really nice momentum. And this is true both across LC as well as mass spec so nothing [indiscernible] differentiate the 2. Now you asked about mass spec in particular. In mass spec, the demand is driven by -- across all our portfolios across users in  high res mass spec across our tandem quad which are both used the single quads are used for intact mass and also our tandem quads that are used in development as well as food and environmental. 
And then, of course, as I mentioned, the BioAccord, we see renewed momentum and a lot of interest in the bioprocessing arena. So mass spec is going from strength to strength. 
Now turning to the second part of your question on new products, as I pointed out on -- in the prepared remarks, right, on HPLC, just focusing on HPLC for a minute, Arc HPLC as well as the premier technology, which includes columns as well as the application of this unique technology to our instruments has led to roughly $45 million in sales in 2021. We expect that to go up to 60-plus million, so about 15 million or so incremental. That's in the LC space. On mass spec, new applications for BioAccord. 
I already mentioned that in the prepared remarks and the MRT has a lot of interest from many of our customers, especially ones who want to use it in the proteomics space and for imaging with our [indiscernible] technology, which can be used under ambient conditions, which is quite unique. So again, new products. Waters has had a history of introducing game-changing new products. I think what we are doing differently is just making sure that there is a lot of traction once we launch these products, and they're not just [indiscernible]."

Second, it's our initiatives be it  replacement, be it [indiscernible] products. And your question is increased applications. And I would break it into 2 parts. One, we are indeed seeing increased application of our technologies in oligonucleotides, in mRNA. 
So for instance, I met somebody from a leading mRNA company in Cambridge recently, and they basically said, look, the huge aggregation problems with plasma, with the mRNA molecular cells, as well as with the lipid encapsulated mRNA molecule. So they are turning to us to help us help them solve these problems, one, by retaining more samples by using Premier; and two, by using LCMS to elucidate the structures of the molecules themselves. 
So good application there. And a lot of them being in development and discovery and hopefully, increasingly in QA/QC. 
Second area that I would comment on is the wider application of the BioAccord. You'll recall the product was initially launched really focused on LCMS, which we still have in QA/QC, we still believe that LCMS has a strong place in QA/QC provided the instrument that you have is simple, robust and fast and give you faster results. But that same value proposition is equally relevant in development of -- in early stage development of complex biologics, and we're seeing really good application there. 
We demonstrated with Sartorius that within some experiments that takes 6 weeks can now be turned around within 2 days and this has been replicated in Sartorius lab, our labs and in several customer labs. So as you can imagine, there's a ton of excitement on that front. And the BioAccord is rather unique here. 
The results are fast. It's a simple-to-use instrument, even somebody like me can use it and it provides you a wide range of results not just on cell culture media applications where it's much wider than any sort of application use today, but also on the drug substance. So seeing wider application of our technologies and really excited about where LCMS is going, especially the BioAccord with the simplicity and robustness and [ peak ] in early stage development and bioprocessing."

And in terms of how much have we clawed back, I mean we think that looking at 3 sort of data points. One, comparing our stacked growth rates, both instrument and consumables with the rest of the industry. Wherever they are comparable products, we feel very good that we are operating well ahead of the market. So it's market plus performance on [indiscernible].
