258181,703353174,2221951,"Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2021",2021-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Coterra Energy Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nora, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Call. As a reminder, on today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, so",1600,"Thank you, Nora, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Call. As a reminder, on today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earnings release. 
Our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020 highlights the resiliency of Cabot's business model, which is a direct result of our industry-leading cost structure, our continued track record of disciplined capital allocation and the exceptional efforts from our employees, especially in the face of the challenges presented in the ongoing pandemic. Despite the headwinds we faced throughout the year due to historically low natural gas prices, we delivered positive net income and our fifth consecutive year of positive free cash flow generation. 
The company recorded full year adjusted net income of $214 million or $0.54 per share, positive free cash flow of $109 million and a return on capital employed of approximately 8%, despite the lowest natural gas price realizations in our 31-year public company history. 
During 2020, we returned $159 million of capital to shareholders through our current dividend, which represents our fifth consecutive year of exceeding our minimum capital return target of 50% of annual free cash flow. We also repaid $87 billion of debt that matured during the year. Our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry with a year-end net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1.4 million. While this is modestly higher than our target leverage ratio of 1 term, we have clear visibility to deleveraging well below our target ratio in 2021, given the improvement in natural gas prices relative to our 25-year low average NYMEX price we experienced in 2020, and our plan to repay our debt that matures this year with a portion of our excess free cash flow. 
For the fourth quarter, Cabot generated $105 million of adjusted net income, or $0.26 per share, and a $123 million of positive free cash flow. We also exceeded our high-end of our production guidance range despite significant strategic price-related curtailments throughout the quarter. 
Our operating expense per unit improved 3% relative to our prior year period and our capital expenditures were in line with our guidance, highlighting our continued commitment to disciplined cost control throughout our operations. We pre-released our year-end proved reserves updated 3 weeks ago, which included the following highlights: 6% growth in total proved reserves, 7% growth in proved developed reserves and a year-over-year improvement in all source finding and development cost, driven by record low drill bit finding and development cost of $0.28 per Mcf. The growth in our reserve base is especially impressive when considering our transition to a maintenance capital program in 2020, that resulted in a 27% decline in capital spending relative to the prior year. 
On the operational front in yesterday's release, we highlighted a significant improvement in our greenhouse gas emissions metric. In 2020, we realized a 58% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions intensity from 3.12 to 1.31 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent. And a 70% reduction in our methane emissions intensity from 0.083% to 0.025%. Our industry-leading efficiency highlights our continued focus on safe, responsible and sustainable operations, which support the goal of reducing total greenhouse gas emissions while achieving energy independence in the United States. 
Staying on the operations for a moment, it would not be a Cabot Oil & Gas conference call if Upper Marcellus was not mentioned. In our third quarter 2020 earnings release, we highlighted 5 Upper Marcellus wells that were placed on production in 2020. And at the time, we're exceeding our expectations of an average EUR per 1,000 lateral feet of 2.7 Bcf. These 5 wells were ultimately booked with an average EUR per 1,000 lateral feet of 2.9 Bcf at the end of 2020, reaffirming our conviction in the productivity and economic opportunity across the Upper Marcellus reservoir. We continue to plan to allocate only a modest amount of capital to the Upper Marcellus annually for the foreseeable future as we focus our capital allocation efforts, first, on the prudent development of our Lower Marcellus reservoir before moving to full development of our Upper Marcellus inventory towards the end of this decade. We remain encouraged by these recent well results and the future development program that our team has put together across the Upper Marcellus at an average lateral length greater than 10,000 feet, which will provide significant well cost savings and further improvements to the economics of this inventory. 
Moving to our program for 2021 in yesterday's release, we reaffirmed our plans to deliver an average net production rate of 2.35 Bcfe per day from a capital program of $530 million to $540 million. Our capital program for 2021 includes 80 net drilled and completed wells at an average lateral length of 7,500 to 7,600 feet. I think the most important thing to highlight from our program this year is a 6% reduction in capital expenditures year-over-year, which is a 32% reduction in spending relative to '19, despite production levels being relatively flat from 2019 to our guidance in 2021. 
On the pricing front, despite the late start to winter, we are optimistic about the backdrop for natural gas prices in '21. On the supply side, dry gas production is still well below prior year levels, and we do not currently expect a significant rebound in volumes throughout the year as producers across the industry are focused on free cash flow generation, balance sheet repair and capital returns to shareholders over production growth. 
Natural gas demand continues to be strong, led by robust U.S. LNG exports, a trend we expect to continue throughout the year as global storage continues to be drawn down due to colder winter weather and demand recovery as economies continue to reopen. This week's storage withdrawal is expected to be the largest weekly withdrawal since January of 2018, which would put current storage levels 8% below the 5-year average and 12% lower than the prior year. This is a dramatic turn of events relative to even a month ago when storage levels were 9% higher than the 5-year average. 
Storage levels at the end of the winter season are currently forecast to be approximately 1.5 Tcf, which is 17% below the 5-year average and 26% lower than the prior year. We believe the tighter market conditions this year will require higher NYMEX prices this summer to drive incremental gas to coal switching in order to balance the market, and could result in the lowest end of October storage levels since 2018. That year, lower storage levels resulted in a significant spike in winter NYMEX prices to levels materially higher than the current forward curve. 
On the regional pricing front, year-to-date, the average Leidy cash price and our average power netback prices are approximately 70% higher than the same period last year. East storage levels at the end of the winter season are currently projected to be significantly lower than our prior year, which reduces the likelihood of experiencing the wider basis differentials we realized during the last 4 months of 2020. The weighted average differential guidance we issued for 2021 of $0.50 to $0.55 is slightly wider than the $0.44 differential we realized in 2020. This is primarily driven by the floor prices in several of our long-term sales agreement, which are now realizing less of a premium in this considerably higher NYMEX price environment as compared to last year. 
However, the most important dynamic to consider is a significant year-over-year improvement in our expected realized natural gas prices implied by the year-to-date pricing and the annual recur in yesterday's release. We updated our capital return framework to include a base plus supplemental dividend strategy. We plan to continue to deliver our regular quarter base dividend while supplementing these regular quarter-based dividends with an annual supplemented -- supplemental dividend in order to achieve our minimum capital return target of at least 50% of our annual free cash flow. Given the volatility and seasonality of natural gas prices, our free -- our cash flow throughout the year, any supplemental dividend expected to be declared and paid in the fourth quarter beginning this year. Any excess free cash flow above the 50% minimum capital return target will be utilized by enhancing the balance sheet, additional supplemental dividends or optimistic share repurchases depending on the market conditions. 
This year, the first priority for excess free cash flow above our minimum capital return target will be the repayment of $188 million of current debt maturities, which includes $88 million tranche we prepaid in January and a $100 million tranche that matures in September. Our new capital return framework highlights our continued focus on returning a significant portion of our free cash flow to shareholders while also preserving our balance sheet strength. The supplemental component of this dividend approach allows us to focus on sustainable capital return as appropriately tailored for where we are in the natural gas price cycle. We also expect to continue to grow our base dividend over time as we have done 5x since 2017. I believe our track record to returning far exceeds our returning -- of returning far in excess of our minimal capital return target should reinforce our commitment to enhancing shareholder return over time. 
With that, Nora, I'm happy to open it up for any questions."

The regionals have not changed. There -- they didn't roll out. They didn't improve. So we're still looking at somewhat of the same type levels that we experienced in 2020. But on our corporate differential, the answer behind the reason the -- it has increased slightly from the previous year really has to do with the impact that our floor contracts have in the -- our contracts with fixed prices and floors against a lower price NYMEX we experienced in 2020. To say it differently, as you increase NYMEX prices, that differential will spread slightly just due to the impact of those floors and fixed prices."

The thought behind it is we're in a very cyclical industry, and things can change as evidenced by how 2020 started for pricing and where it went. And again, nobody is planning on another pandemic. But our view of this -- and is to keep it within the year of that were our measurement period. So that's the thought around the fourth quarter. In other words, by mid-week in November and last week of November, where we know where our December pricing is and we know where our expenses are, we know mostly where our investments are. We're going to have a pretty good idea where the report card is going to fall out. And what we may need to do in an estimation format in that supplemental bucket to get to the 50% return level, and that keeps it in the same year as the measurement period. That's the rationale that we're following. We -- and different people or different companies are going to do it different ways. We did not want to carry it into the following year and have a quarterly payment that if gas prices went way south and the market was on its heels that all of a sudden that we've got some commitment that was created in better times that we now have to borrow money or do something, and it hurts the next year. We want to keep it in the measurement period. So right now, the initial plan is to always do it in the fourth quarter, late in the fourth quarter. Handle it within the year. Obviously, there's always the optionality that if the year is setting up and it's just very robust. Maths example, to me, is if we had $7 gas prices for half the year, would you wait till the fourth quarter? Probably not in that scenario. But the intent right now is a very methodical end of year kind of true-up of that 50% target."

The objective is going to be clear, and I don't see anything getting in the way of the objective and that is to lay out significantly longer average lateral lengths greater than what we are drilling in the Lower Marcellus right now and certainly going to be greater than the Upper Marcellus -- I mean greater than the Lower Marcellus and greater than 10,000 feet. 
So when you look at the efficiencies from that drilling perspective, you can kind of do the math today. I would also add that I would hope that we continue as an industry to develop efficient techniques, best practices that will allow the drill curve to get better completion techniques to improve. And as we allocate a small portion of our capital moving forward to the Upper Marcellus. We continue to learn and enhance our anticipated completion techniques for the Upper Marcellus. We've always indicated that the Upper Marcellus is about 75% of the Upper Marcellus -- I mean, the Lower Marcellus. And we don't see anything that would take from that from a reservoir perspective. We think we can close the gap, the differential in the -- in what the deliverables from a reservoir perspective in the Upper Marcellus would be to the Lower Marcellus by longer laterals, more efficient completion techniques and all the things we're learning as we go. We do -- we think it will be towards the -- before we shift to the Upper Marcellus development, we think it's going to be towards the end of the -- this decade. And we think we have drilling locations that will carry us beyond the 2040 period for the Upper Marcellus. We're confident that we're going to be able to improve the economics of the Upper compared to the Lower and stand by."

In our Lower Marcellus, we continue to try to lay in our Lower Marcellus in the entire developed area that we currently have. There'll be some areas that bring our average down, just simply by us going back into really early drilling areas where we didn't have long laterals. Our pads were a little bit closer together that those type of, say, if we drill a 6- or 8-well pad in an area where we have to drill reduced lateral lengths just by virtue of fitting in between some older drilling locations. That will keep our Lower lateral lengths, our Lower Marcellus lateral lengths, lower than we anticipate in the Upper."

We have done that ever since I've been here, and we'll continue to do that and we'll continue to vet what's out there. We look at our pool, our assets that we have. We look at the EUR per 1,000, the margin that we are able to obtain with our assets, and we like exactly the assets we have. We look out there and compare the Appalachian assets in other areas. And we still see Cabot's assets, including the Upper Marcellus, as being a better asset from the standpoint of what the deliverables are in the -- in what the reserves can provide. I mean what the reservoir can provide. So when you think about how we would look at an asset outside of Cabot's footprint, we do kind of an accretion dilution analysis. If instead of, for example, our last 5 Marcellus wells, we booked at 2.9 Bcf per 1,000-foot. If we see assets out there that are -- and you all can do the numbers, you can look at the type curves. You can look at the peer numbers on their the reserves per 1,000-foot of lateral. And you're not going to get -- in general, you're not going to get that same quality of rock. We've been blessed by it. That's not a not a slam on peers at all. I think peers do a great job with their operation. But nevertheless, when we look at how we allocate capital and the efficiency of our capital allocation, we take all of this into consideration before we spend money out there, someplace else versus our capital allocation program back to shareholders."

And then just if I don't fully answer your question by time I end, I'll get back to you. But as you're aware, on our revision, 30% of our revision was related to the pricing and 5-year PUD development rule. And when we look at the parent-child mitigation efforts and its impact on our revisions. That's not a unique to Cabot, it's an industry-wide objective on mitigation on parent-child. In 2020, the impact on Cabot was about 1.6% of our PDP, which was down 45% from our parent-child impact in 2019. I think we'll continue to improve significantly in 2021 with our mitigation efforts. Some of those efforts we've talked about in the past, some are new. Our placement where we land in our new drilling relative to the offset is being scrutinized very closely now. The reduction of fluid and proppant levels is being implemented on all of the wells that had the offset drilling. We're setting the retrievable bridge plugs, tubing and cap strings and the offset wells, and that has helped considerably. 
Most recently, and we feel like this is making a significant difference, we have increased the number of clusters by 2x to 3x per stage, and we're seeing a fairly dramatic increase. An example, several examples, really would be the results from our most recent design that we've used on 4 pads, saw only 2 out of 30 wells directly offset from these new completions slightly impacted. So that's a significant difference from what we were seeing previously. Additionally, and you're aware of this, but we do have planned workovers for our 2021 program for the affected wells. And we do anticipate that this work will help to reestablish impacted reserves. And we have taken care -- and take in consideration all of what we're currently seeing, Brian, in our current PUD booking and our booking across the field."

And so I'm looking at that versus the number of wells you turned online. I mean this would be a net basis. So you turned on 70 wells, and so that would be assuming each one was bounded, which is probably not exactly right, but that puts an upper limit. You've got about 140 possibly affected wells. And so I guess what I'm really driving at is that if every well were affected, that would be -- but probably not every well is affected. So I'm just kind of wondering, particularly with respect to your comments about workovers going to remediating some of this. In my kind of -- am I getting reasonably reasonably accurate or am I wildly off base in thinking that what's happening here is that you've got a couple of your -- you got some fraction of your offset wells that are old or older vintage PDP wells that are just getting like completely knocked off with water hits. And if that's the case, it was saying probably not that big a deal because you're able to go back in with the workover, just get the water off and the wells come back and the reserves come back. Is that in the right quadrant?"

And Charles, one of the things you're -- I appreciate your rearview mirror math on kind of how it happened. But keep in mind, I think going forward, I think you need to maybe focus more on what we saw in our last 4 pads that we drilled by stretching out the cluster spacing. Not stretching out the cluster spacing, adding more clusters to a stage, how we landed the wells and how we have been able to -- along the entire track of a lateral we'll lay out. We don't think it's going to affect the entire lateral length of any given well because we have the offset landing zones and we are mitigating the new wells we drill with the landing zones at the offset wells. And we will -- in areas where we feel like we have a fairly direct offset by -- in the landing areas, we are implementing this new technique of 2x or 3x greater clusters in a stage, reduce fluids and proppants in those particular stages. And in the last 4 pads, that out of the 30 direct offset wells that we saw with the number of completions that we had, we only saw 2 wells impacted. So I think rolling forward, I don't think you can use historic math to calculate what we would see as the impacts rolling forward. We think it is going to continue to be reduced like we did from '19 to '20. We think we're going to see a significant decrease from '20 to '21 on PDP revisions as a result of what I'm talking about."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Call. As a reminder, on today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, so",1596,"Thank you, Nora, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Call. As a reminder, on today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earnings release. 
Our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020 highlight the resiliency of Cabot's business model, which is a direct result of our industry-leading cost structure, our continued track record of disciplined capital allocation and the exceptional efforts from our employees, especially in the face of the challenges presented in the ongoing pandemic. Despite the headwinds we faced throughout the year due to historically low natural gas prices, we delivered positive net income and our fifth consecutive year of positive free cash flow generation. 
The company recorded full year adjusted net income of $214 million or $0.54 per share, positive free cash flow of $109 million and a return on capital employed of approximately 8%, despite the lowest natural gas price realizations in our 31-year public company history. 
During 2020, we returned $159 million of capital to shareholders through our current dividend, which represents our fifth consecutive year of exceeding our minimum capital return target of 50% of annual free cash flow. We also repaid $87 billion of debt that matured during the year. Our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry with a year-end net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1.4. While this is modestly higher than our target leverage ratio of 1 term, we have clear visibility to deleveraging well below our target ratio in 2021, given the improvement in natural gas prices relative to our 25-year low average NYMEX price we experienced in 2020, and our plan to repay our debt that matures this year with a portion of our excess free cash flow. 
For the fourth quarter, Cabot generated $105 million of adjusted net income, or $0.26 per share, and $123 million of positive free cash flow. We also exceeded our high-end of our production guidance range despite strategic price-related curtailments throughout the quarter. 
Our operating expense per unit improved 3% relative to our prior year period and our capital expenditures were in line with our guidance, highlighting our continued commitment to disciplined cost control throughout our operations. We pre-released our year-end proved reserves updated 3 weeks ago, which included the following highlights: 6% growth in total proved reserves, 7% growth in proved developed reserves and a year-over-year improvement in all source finding and development cost, driven by record low drill bit finding and development cost of $0.28 per Mcf. The growth in our reserve base is especially impressive when considering our transition to a maintenance capital program in 2020 that resulted in a 27% decline in capital spending relative to the prior year. 
On the operational front in yesterday's release, we highlighted a significant improvement in our greenhouse gas emissions metric. In 2020, we realized a 58% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions intensity from 3.12 to 1.31 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent and a 70% reduction in our methane emissions intensity from 0.083% to 0.025%. Our industry-leading efficiency highlights our continued focus on safe, responsible and sustainable operations, which support the goal of reducing total greenhouse gas emissions while achieving energy independence in the United States. 
Staying on the operations for a moment, it would not be a Cabot Oil & Gas conference call if Upper Marcellus was not mentioned. In our third quarter 2020 earnings release, we highlighted 5 Upper Marcellus wells that were placed on production in 2020. And at the time, we're exceeding our expectations of an average EUR per 1,000 lateral feet of 2.7 Bcf. These 5 wells were ultimately booked with an average EUR per 1,000 lateral feet of 2.9 Bcf at the end of 2020, reaffirming our conviction in the productivity and economic opportunity across the Upper Marcellus reservoir. We continue to plan to allocate only a modest amount of capital to the Upper Marcellus annually for the foreseeable future as we focus our capital allocation efforts, first, on the prudent development of our Lower Marcellus reservoir before moving to full development of our Upper Marcellus inventory towards the end of this decade. We remain encouraged by these recent well results and the future development program that our team has put together across the Upper Marcellus at an average lateral length greater than 10,000 feet, which will provide significant well cost savings and further improvements to the economics of this inventory. 
Moving to our program for 2021 in yesterday's release, we reaffirmed our plans to deliver an average net production rate of 2.35 Bcfe per day from a capital program of $530 million to $540 million. Our capital program for 2021 includes 80 net drilled and completed wells at an average lateral length of 7,500 to 7,600 feet. I think the most important thing to highlight from our program this year is a 6% reduction in capital expenditures year-over-year, which is a 32% reduction in spending relative to '19, despite production levels being relatively flat from 2019 to our guidance in 2021. 
On the pricing front, despite the late start to winter, we are optimistic about the backdrop for natural gas prices in '21. On the supply side, dry gas production is still well below prior year levels, and we do not currently expect a significant rebound in volumes throughout the year as producers across the industry are focused on free cash flow generation, balance sheet repair and capital returns to shareholders over production growth. 
Natural gas demand continues to be strong, led by robust U.S. LNG exports, a trend we expect to continue throughout the year as global storage continues to be drawn down due to colder winter weather and demand recovery as economies continue to reopen. This week's storage withdrawal is expected to be the largest weekly withdrawal since January of 2018, which would put current storage levels 8% below the 5-year average and 12% lower than the prior year. This is a dramatic turn of events relative to even a month ago when storage levels were 9% higher than the 5-year average. 
Storage levels at the end of the winter season are currently forecast to be approximately 1.5 Tcf, which is 17% below the 5-year average and 26% lower than the prior year. We believe the tighter market conditions this year will require higher NYMEX prices this summer to drive incremental gas to coal switching in order to balance the market, and could result in the lowest end of October storage levels since 2018. That year, lower storage levels resulted in a significant spike in winter NYMEX prices to levels materially higher than the current forward curve. 
On the regional pricing front, year-to-date, the average Leidy cash price and our average power netback prices are approximately 70% higher than the same period last year. East storage levels at the end of the winter season are currently projected to be significantly lower than our prior year, which reduces the likelihood of experiencing the wider basis differentials we realized during the last 4 months of 2020. The weighted average differential guidance we issued for 2021 of $0.50 to $0.55 is slightly wider than the $0.44 differential we realized in 2020. This is primarily driven by the floor prices in several of our long-term sales agreement, which are now realizing less of a premium in this considerably higher NYMEX price environment as compared to last year. 
However, the most important dynamic to consider is a significant year-over-year improvement in our expected realized natural gas prices implied by the year-to-date pricing and the [indiscernible] in yesterday's release. We updated our capital return framework to include a base plus supplemental dividend strategy. We plan to continue to deliver our regular quarter base dividend while supplementing these regular quarter-based dividends with an annual supplemented -- supplemental dividend in order to achieve our minimum capital return target of at least 50% of our annual free cash flow. Given the volatility and seasonality of natural gas prices, our free -- our cash flow throughout the year, any supplemental dividend expected to be declared and paid in the fourth quarter beginning this year. Any excess free cash flow above the 50% minimum capital return target will be utilized for enhancing the balance sheet, additional supplemental dividends or optimistic share repurchases, depending on the market conditions. 
This year, the first priority for excess free cash flow above our minimum capital return target will be the repayment of $188 million of current debt maturities, which includes $88 million tranche we prepaid in January and a $100 million tranche that matures in September. Our new capital return framework highlights our continued focus on returning a significant portion of our free cash flow to shareholders while also preserving our balance sheet strength. The supplemental component of this dividend approach allows us to focus on sustainable capital return as appropriately tailored for where we are in the natural gas price cycle. We also expect to continue to grow our base dividend over time as we have done 5x since 2017. I believe our track record to returning far exceeds -- returning -- of returning far in excess of our minimal capital return target should reinforce our commitment to enhancing shareholder return over time. 
With that, Nora, I'm happy to open it up for any questions."

The thought behind it is, you know we're in a very cyclical industry, and things can change as evidenced by how 2020 started for pricing and where it went. And again, nobody is planning on another pandemic. But our view of this -- and -- is to keep it within the year of -- that were -- our measurement period. So that's the thought around the fourth quarter. In other words, by mid-week in November and last week of November, where we know what our December pricing is and we know where our expenses are, we know mostly where our investments are. We're going to have a pretty good idea where the report card is going to fall out. And what we may need to do in an estimation format in that supplemental bucket to get to the 50% return level, and that keeps it in the same year as the measurement period. That's the rationale that we're following. 
We -- and different people or different companies are going to do it different ways. We did not want to carry it into the following year and have a quarterly payment that if gas prices went way south and the market was on its heels, that all of a sudden that we've got some commitment that was created in better times that we now have to borrow money or do something, and it hurts the next year. We want to keep it in the measurement period. So right now, the initial plan is to always do it in the fourth quarter, late in the fourth quarter. Handle it within the year. Obviously, there's always the optionality that if the year is setting up and it's just very robust. Matt's example to me is if we had $7 gas prices for half the year, would you wait till the fourth quarter? Probably not in that scenario. But the intent right now is a very methodical end of year kind of true-up of that 50% target."

So we're right at 50%. And ironically, they're very close numbers, too, in terms of -- if you took the floor price and swaps on our financial. They average about $2.70.

That plan is to play out and do a geographic evaluation of all the sticks that we have. And we've done that for the majority of the field. They're continuing to vet cultural issues, picking pad sites and all that. The objective is going to be clear, and I don't see anything getting in the way of the objective and that is to lay out significantly longer average lateral lengths greater than what we are drilling in the Lower Marcellus right now and certainly going to be greater than the Upper Marcellus -- I mean greater than the Lower Marcellus and greater than 10,000 feet. 
So when you look at the efficiencies from that drilling perspective, you can kind of do the math today. I would also add that I would hope that we continue as an industry to develop efficient techniques, best practices that will allow the drill curve to get better completion techniques to improve. And as we allocate a small portion of our capital moving forward to the Upper Marcellus, we continue to learn and enhance our anticipated completion techniques for the Upper Marcellus. We've always indicated that the Upper Marcellus is about 75% of the Upper Marcellus -- I mean, the Lower Marcellus. And we don't see anything that would take from that from a reservoir perspective. We think we can close the gap, the differential in the -- in what the deliverables from a reservoir perspective in the Upper Marcellus would be to the Lower Marcellus by longer laterals, more efficient completion techniques and all the things we're learning as we go. We do -- we think it will be towards the -- before we shift to the Upper Marcellus development, we think it's going to be towards the end of the -- this decade. And we think we have drilling locations that will carry us beyond the 2040 period for the Upper Marcellus. We're confident that we're going to be able to improve the economics of the Upper compared to the Lower and stand by."

Our pads were a little bit closer together that those type of, say, if we drill a 6- or 8-well pad in an area where we have to drill reduced lateral lengths just by virtue of fitting in between some older drilling locations.

We have done that ever since I've been here, and we'll continue to do that and we'll continue to vet what's out there. We look at our pool, our assets that we have. We look at the EUR per 1,000, the margin that we are able to obtain with our assets, and we like exactly the assets we have. We look out there and compare the Appalachian assets in other areas. And we still see Cabot's assets, including the Upper Marcellus, as being a better asset from the standpoint of what the deliverables are in the -- in what the reserves can provide. I mean what the reservoir can provide. So when you think about how we would look at an asset outside of Cabot's footprint, we do kind of an accretion dilution analysis. If instead of, for example, our last 5 upper Marcellus wells, we booked at 2.9 Bcf per 1,000-foot. If we see assets out there that are -- and you all can do the numbers, you can look at the type curves. You can look at the peer numbers on their reserves per 1,000-foot of lateral. And you're not going to get -- in general, you're not going to get that same quality of rock. We've been blessed by it. That's not a slam on peers at all. I think peers do a great job with their operation.

And then just if I don't fully answer your question by time I end, I'll get back to you. But as you're aware, on our revision, 30% of our revision was related to the pricing and 5-year PUD development rule. And when we look at the parent-child mitigation efforts and its impact on our revisions. That's not unique to Cabot, it's an industry-wide objective on mitigation on parent-child. In 2020, the impact on Cabot was about 1.6% of our PDP, which was down 45% from our parent-child impact in 2019. I think we'll continue to improve significantly in 2021 with our mitigation efforts. Some of those efforts we've talked about in the past, some are new. Our placement where we land in our new drilling relative to the offset is being scrutinized very closely now. The reduction of fluid and proppant levels is being implemented on all of the wells that had the offset drilling. We're setting the retrievable bridge plugs, tubing and cap strings and the offset wells, and that has helped considerably. 
Most recently, and we feel like this is making a significant difference, we have increased the number of clusters by 2 to 3x per stage, and we're seeing a fairly dramatic increase. An example, several examples, really would be the results from our most recent design that we've used on 4 pads, saw only 2 out of 30 wells directly offset from these new completions slightly impacted. So that's a significant difference from what we were seeing previously. Additionally, and you're aware of this, but we do have planned workovers for our 2021 program for the affected wells. And we do anticipate that this work will help to reestablish impacted reserves. And we have taken care -- and taken into consideration all of what we're currently seeing, Brian, in our current PUD booking and our booking across the field."

And the one challenge with the private placement market, while we've always been able to get a lower coupon in that market to the tune of 100 to 150 basis points every time we enter that market, that comes with a prepayment penalty of treasuries plus 50. And with the interest rate environment where it's at today to make up that coupon, it is just a noneconomic decision to kind of refi that now from that perspective. And it doesn't make sense to go get debt right now at a low rate and just park it on your balance sheet in cash. So that's one dynamic. The other thing I would add, and Matt can fill in here. But our last private placement was done in 2014, and we did some 7-year money, which we'll pay off this year. We did some 10-year money, which is that 2024 tranche and the 2026 tranche. And when you look at that, that was all 3% money. So it's very competitive with -- maybe we can get slightly better now, but it's very competitive rates at which we have it. The one that's kind of out of market is the 2023 $62 million, still has that prepayment penalty. So that's the dynamic that's going on as it relates to our debt."

And our Board has been quite proactive in supporting the increased base dividend level. I would just say from a conservative perspective, that's why we added the supplemental dividend. From a conservative perspective, we don't want to get caught whipsawed into an irrational market that has blown out the basis in all the basins. And our realizations are punitive that would require us to dig into our facility to pay dividends. 
Again, I think industry has learned its lesson from the past. I think shareholders have made it clear what the expectation is for prudent operations and managing capital allocation. And if we continue to see that rationalization, I think the shareholders are going to reward it handsomely."

But keep in mind, I think going forward, I think you need to maybe focus more on what we saw in our last 4 pads that we drilled by stretching out the cluster spacing. Not stretching out the cluster spacing, adding more clusters to a stage, how we landed the wells and how we have been able to -- along the entire track of a lateral we'll lay out. We don't think it's going to affect the entire lateral length of any given well because we have the offset landing zones and we are mitigating the new wells we drill with the landing zones at the offset wells. And we will -- in areas where we feel like we have a fairly direct offset by -- in the landing areas, we are implementing this new technique of 2 or 3x greater clusters in a stage, reduce fluids and proppants in those particular stages. And in the last 4 pads, that out of the 30 direct offset wells that we saw with the number of completions that we had, we only saw 2 wells impacted. 
So I think rolling forward, I don't think you can use historic math to calculate what we would see as the impacts rolling forward. We think it is going to continue to be reduced like we did from '19 to '20. We think we're going to see a significant decrease from '20 to '21 on PDP revisions as a result of what I'm talking about."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Call. As a reminder, on today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, so",1596,"Thank you, Nora, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Call. As a reminder, on today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earnings release. 
Our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020 highlight the resiliency of Cabot's business model, which is a direct result of our industry-leading cost structure, our continued track record of disciplined capital allocation and the exceptional efforts from our employees, especially in the face of the challenges presented in the ongoing pandemic. Despite the headwinds we faced throughout the year due to historically low natural gas prices, we delivered positive net income and our fifth consecutive year of positive free cash flow generation. 
The company recorded full year adjusted net income of $214 million or $0.54 per share, positive free cash flow of $109 million and a return on capital employed of approximately 8%, despite the lowest natural gas price realizations in our 31-year public company history. 
During 2020, we returned $159 million of capital to shareholders through our current dividend, which represents our fifth consecutive year of exceeding our minimum capital return target of 50% of annual free cash flow. We also repaid $87 billion of debt that matured during the year. Our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry with a year-end net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1.4. While this is modestly higher than our target leverage ratio of 1 term, we have clear visibility to deleveraging well below our target ratio in 2021, given the improvement in natural gas prices relative to our 25-year low average NYMEX price we experienced in 2020, and our plan to repay our debt that matures this year with a portion of our excess free cash flow. 
For the fourth quarter, Cabot generated $105 million of adjusted net income, or $0.26 per share, and $123 million of positive free cash flow. We also exceeded our high-end of our production guidance range despite strategic price-related curtailments throughout the quarter. 
Our operating expense per unit improved 3% relative to our prior year period and our capital expenditures were in line with our guidance, highlighting our continued commitment to disciplined cost control throughout our operations. We pre-released our year-end proved reserves updated 3 weeks ago, which included the following highlights: 6% growth in total proved reserves, 7% growth in proved developed reserves and a year-over-year improvement in all source finding and development cost, driven by record low drill bit finding and development cost of $0.28 per Mcf. The growth in our reserve base is especially impressive when considering our transition to a maintenance capital program in 2020 that resulted in a 27% decline in capital spending relative to the prior year. 
On the operational front in yesterday's release, we highlighted a significant improvement in our greenhouse gas emissions metric. In 2020, we realized a 58% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions intensity from 3.12 to 1.31 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent and a 70% reduction in our methane emissions intensity from 0.083% to 0.025%. Our industry-leading efficiency highlights our continued focus on safe, responsible and sustainable operations, which support the goal of reducing total greenhouse gas emissions while achieving energy independence in the United States. 
Staying on the operations for a moment, it would not be a Cabot Oil & Gas conference call if Upper Marcellus was not mentioned. In our third quarter 2020 earnings release, we highlighted 5 Upper Marcellus wells that were placed on production in 2020. And at the time, we're exceeding our expectations of an average EUR per 1,000 lateral feet of 2.7 Bcf. These 5 wells were ultimately booked with an average EUR per 1,000 lateral feet of 2.9 Bcf at the end of 2020, reaffirming our conviction in the productivity and economic opportunity across the Upper Marcellus reservoir. We continue to plan to allocate only a modest amount of capital to the Upper Marcellus annually for the foreseeable future as we focus our capital allocation efforts, first, on the prudent development of our Lower Marcellus reservoir before moving to full development of our Upper Marcellus inventory towards the end of this decade. We remain encouraged by these recent well results and the future development program that our team has put together across the Upper Marcellus at an average lateral length greater than 10,000 feet, which will provide significant well cost savings and further improvements to the economics of this inventory. 
Moving to our program for 2021 in yesterday's release, we reaffirmed our plans to deliver an average net production rate of 2.35 Bcfe per day from a capital program of $530 million to $540 million. Our capital program for 2021 includes 80 net drilled and completed wells at an average lateral length of 7,500 to 7,600 feet. I think the most important thing to highlight from our program this year is a 6% reduction in capital expenditures year-over-year, which is a 32% reduction in spending relative to '19, despite production levels being relatively flat from 2019 to our guidance in 2021. 
On the pricing front, despite the late start to winter, we are optimistic about the backdrop for natural gas prices in '21. On the supply side, dry gas production is still well below prior year levels, and we do not currently expect a significant rebound in volumes throughout the year as producers across the industry are focused on free cash flow generation, balance sheet repair and capital returns to shareholders over production growth. 
Natural gas demand continues to be strong, led by robust U.S. LNG exports, a trend we expect to continue throughout the year as global storage continues to be drawn down due to colder winter weather and demand recovery as economies continue to reopen. This week's storage withdrawal is expected to be the largest weekly withdrawal since January of 2018, which would put current storage levels 8% below the 5-year average and 12% lower than the prior year. This is a dramatic turn of events relative to even a month ago when storage levels were 9% higher than the 5-year average. 
Storage levels at the end of the winter season are currently forecast to be approximately 1.5 Tcf, which is 17% below the 5-year average and 26% lower than the prior year. We believe the tighter market conditions this year will require higher NYMEX prices this summer to drive incremental gas to coal switching in order to balance the market, and could result in the lowest end of October storage levels since 2018. That year, lower storage levels resulted in a significant spike in winter NYMEX prices to levels materially higher than the current forward curve. 
On the regional pricing front, year-to-date, the average Leidy cash price and our average power netback prices are approximately 70% higher than the same period last year. East storage levels at the end of the winter season are currently projected to be significantly lower than our prior year, which reduces the likelihood of experiencing the wider basis differentials we realized during the last 4 months of 2020. The weighted average differential guidance we issued for 2021 of $0.50 to $0.55 is slightly wider than the $0.44 differential we realized in 2020. This is primarily driven by the floor prices in several of our long-term sales agreement, which are now realizing less of a premium in this considerably higher NYMEX price environment as compared to last year. 
However, the most important dynamic to consider is a significant year-over-year improvement in our expected realized natural gas prices implied by the year-to-date pricing and the [indiscernible] in yesterday's release. We updated our capital return framework to include a base plus supplemental dividend strategy. We plan to continue to deliver our regular quarter base dividend while supplementing these regular quarter-based dividends with an annual supplemented -- supplemental dividend in order to achieve our minimum capital return target of at least 50% of our annual free cash flow. Given the volatility and seasonality of natural gas prices, our free -- our cash flow throughout the year, any supplemental dividend expected to be declared and paid in the fourth quarter beginning this year. Any excess free cash flow above the 50% minimum capital return target will be utilized for enhancing the balance sheet, additional supplemental dividends or optimistic share repurchases, depending on the market conditions. 
This year, the first priority for excess free cash flow above our minimum capital return target will be the repayment of $188 million of current debt maturities, which includes $88 million tranche we prepaid in January and a $100 million tranche that matures in September. Our new capital return framework highlights our continued focus on returning a significant portion of our free cash flow to shareholders while also preserving our balance sheet strength. The supplemental component of this dividend approach allows us to focus on sustainable capital return as appropriately tailored for where we are in the natural gas price cycle. We also expect to continue to grow our base dividend over time as we have done 5x since 2017. I believe our track record to returning far exceeds -- returning -- of returning far in excess of our minimal capital return target should reinforce our commitment to enhancing shareholder return over time. 
With that, Nora, I'm happy to open it up for any questions."

Is this kind of a onetime annual payment or might you take that pass and say, pay it quarterly in '22? I'm just trying to understand a little bit more behind the mechanics and how to cast it back to shareholders?"

The thought behind it is, you know we're in a very cyclical industry, and things can change as evidenced by how 2020 started for pricing and where it went. And again, nobody is planning on another pandemic. But our view of this -- and -- is to keep it within the year of -- that were -- our measurement period. So that's the thought around the fourth quarter. In other words, by mid-week in November and last week of November, where we know what our December pricing is and we know where our expenses are, we know mostly where our investments are. We're going to have a pretty good idea where the report card is going to fall out. And what we may need to do in an estimation format in that supplemental bucket to get to the 50% return level, and that keeps it in the same year as the measurement period. That's the rationale that we're following. 
We -- and different people or different companies are going to do it different ways. We did not want to carry it into the following year and have a quarterly payment that if gas prices went way south and the market was on its heels, that all of a sudden that we've got some commitment that was created in better times that we now have to borrow money or do something, and it hurts the next year. We want to keep it in the measurement period. So right now, the initial plan is to always do it in the fourth quarter, late in the fourth quarter. Handle it within the year. Obviously, there's always the optionality that if the year is setting up and it's just very robust. Matt's example to me is if we had $7 gas prices for half the year, would you wait till the fourth quarter? Probably not in that scenario. But the intent right now is a very methodical end of year kind of true-up of that 50% target."

That plan is to play out and do a geographic evaluation of all the sticks that we have. And we've done that for the majority of the field. They're continuing to vet cultural issues, picking pad sites and all that. The objective is going to be clear, and I don't see anything getting in the way of the objective and that is to lay out significantly longer average lateral lengths greater than what we are drilling in the Lower Marcellus right now and certainly going to be greater than the Upper Marcellus -- I mean greater than the Lower Marcellus and greater than 10,000 feet. 
So when you look at the efficiencies from that drilling perspective, you can kind of do the math today. I would also add that I would hope that we continue as an industry to develop efficient techniques, best practices that will allow the drill curve to get better completion techniques to improve. And as we allocate a small portion of our capital moving forward to the Upper Marcellus, we continue to learn and enhance our anticipated completion techniques for the Upper Marcellus. We've always indicated that the Upper Marcellus is about 75% of the Upper Marcellus -- I mean, the Lower Marcellus. And we don't see anything that would take from that from a reservoir perspective. We think we can close the gap, the differential in the -- in what the deliverables from a reservoir perspective in the Upper Marcellus would be to the Lower Marcellus by longer laterals, more efficient completion techniques and all the things we're learning as we go. We do -- we think it will be towards the -- before we shift to the Upper Marcellus development, we think it's going to be towards the end of the -- this decade. And we think we have drilling locations that will carry us beyond the 2040 period for the Upper Marcellus.

Our pads were a little bit closer together that those type of, say, if we drill a 6- or 8-well pad in an area where we have to drill reduced lateral lengths just by virtue of fitting in between some older drilling locations.

We look at the EUR per 1,000, the margin that we are able to obtain with our assets, and we like exactly the assets we have. We look out there and compare the Appalachian assets in other areas. And we still see Cabot's assets, including the Upper Marcellus, as being a better asset from the standpoint of what the deliverables are in the -- in what the reserves can provide. I mean what the reservoir can provide. So when you think about how we would look at an asset outside of Cabot's footprint, we do kind of an accretion dilution analysis. If instead of, for example, our last 5 upper Marcellus wells, we booked at 2.9 Bcf per 1,000-foot. If we see assets out there that are -- and you all can do the numbers, you can look at the type curves. You can look at the peer numbers on their reserves per 1,000-foot of lateral. And you're not going to get -- in general, you're not going to get that same quality of rock. We've been blessed by it. That's not a slam on peers at all.

And when we look at the parent-child mitigation efforts and its impact on our revisions. That's not unique to Cabot, it's an industry-wide objective on mitigation on parent-child. In 2020, the impact on Cabot was about 1.6% of our PDP, which was down 45% from our parent-child impact in 2019. I think we'll continue to improve significantly in 2021 with our mitigation efforts. Some of those efforts we've talked about in the past, some are new. Our placement where we land in our new drilling relative to the offset is being scrutinized very closely now. The reduction of fluid and proppant levels is being implemented on all of the wells that had the offset drilling. We're setting the retrievable bridge plugs, tubing and cap strings and the offset wells, and that has helped considerably. 
Most recently, and we feel like this is making a significant difference, we have increased the number of clusters by 2 to 3x per stage, and we're seeing a fairly dramatic increase. An example, several examples, really would be the results from our most recent design that we've used on 4 pads, saw only 2 out of 30 wells directly offset from these new completions slightly impacted. So that's a significant difference from what we were seeing previously. Additionally, and you're aware of this, but we do have planned workovers for our 2021 program for the affected wells. And we do anticipate that this work will help to reestablish impacted reserves.

And it doesn't make sense to go get debt right now at a low rate and just park it on your balance sheet in cash. So that's one dynamic. The other thing I would add, and Matt can fill in here. But our last private placement was done in 2014, and we did some 7-year money, which we'll pay off this year. We did some 10-year money, which is that 2024 tranche and the 2026 tranche. And when you look at that, that was all 3% money. So it's very competitive with -- maybe we can get slightly better now, but it's very competitive rates at which we have it.

And we do anticipate to be competitive across the board. And looking at the -- with our balance sheet, allows us to look at those higher yields as we move forward. And our Board has been quite proactive in supporting the increased base dividend level. I would just say from a conservative perspective, that's why we added the supplemental dividend. From a conservative perspective, we don't want to get caught whipsawed into an irrational market that has blown out the basis in all the basins. And our realizations are punitive that would require us to dig into our facility to pay dividends.

Not stretching out the cluster spacing, adding more clusters to a stage, how we landed the wells and how we have been able to -- along the entire track of a lateral we'll lay out. We don't think it's going to affect the entire lateral length of any given well because we have the offset landing zones and we are mitigating the new wells we drill with the landing zones at the offset wells. And we will -- in areas where we feel like we have a fairly direct offset by -- in the landing areas, we are implementing this new technique of 2 or 3x greater clusters in a stage, reduce fluids and proppants in those particular stages. And in the last 4 pads, that out of the 30 direct offset wells that we saw with the number of completions that we had, we only saw 2 wells impacted. 
So I think rolling forward, I don't think you can use historic math to calculate what we would see as the impacts rolling forward.

Thank you for joining Cabot's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. As a reminder, on today's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations.

for joining Cabot's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. As a reminder, on today's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earnings release. 
Our results for the first quarter demonstrate Cabot's ability to deliver significant growth and profitability and free cash flow in a more normalized natural gas price environment than what we experienced during 2020. Our adjusted net income and free cash flow increased by over 175% relative to the prior year period, driven in large part by a 34% increase in realized natural gas prices. Our free cash flow of $138 million was our highest level since the first quarter of 2019 and represented Cabot's 17th quarter with positive free cash flow over the last 20 quarters, all while fully covering our quarterly base dividend and the repayment of $88 million of senior notes that matured during the quarter. 
While higher realized prices were the primary driver of our stronger financial metrics, we also delivered another exceptional quarter operationally, with our production of 2.29 Bcf per day exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range, our CapEx coming in below expectations, and our operating expenses per unit improving relative to the prior year period despite higher G&A expenses related to a onetime charge associated with our recent early retirement program. 
Our balance sheet remains as strong it has ever been, with less than $900 million of net debt as of quarter end, resulting in a net leverage ratio of approximately 1x trailing 12-month EBITDA. This leverage ratio is expected to further improve throughout the year due to an increasing cash flow profile resulting from a higher natural gas price environment this year compared to the 25-year NYMEX low we experienced in 2020. Our fortress balance sheet provides significant financial flexibility and will allow us to continue to return a significant amount of our free cash flow to shareholders this year and for years to come. This uniquely differentiates us from so many in our industry today, who are approaching the inflection of positive free cash flow generation, but will be forced to utilize that free cash flow for significant balance sheet repair in medium term as opposed to capital return to shareholders. 
On the topic of capital returns, yesterday we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly base dividend to $0.11 per share, which on an annualized basis represents a base dividend yield of 2.6%. And as we highlighted on our year-end call, we are fully committed to a base plus supplemental dividend strategy, which incorporates a growing base dividend and an annual supplemental dividend to arrive at our minimum capital return target of at least 50% of our annual free cash flow. Based on the current natural gas price outlook for this year, we expect to generate excessive free cash flow above our minimum capital return target and our debt repayment. This excess free cash flow is anticipated to be earmarked for additional capital returns, including opportunistic share repurchases, especially given the recent equity underperformance and/or incremental supplemental dividends as we have provided in the last few years. 
On the operations front, Cabot has implemented a focused stage-by-stage completion design along each newly drilled wellbore to maximize production and minimize potential impacts to adjacent parent wells. Based on an in-depth engineering and geologic analysis of each offset well, our team develops a customized, segmented completion design for each new well lateral. Design variables include the volume of fluid pump, [ profit] concentration, cluster spacing and the treating rate for each section along the wellbore. This concept was utilized on each of the 4 pads and 21 wells that were placed on production in the first quarter, with 2 to 4 different completion designs utilized in various sections of each lateral. 
Additional safeguards were also employed to protect the 33 parent wells, which partially or fully offset these 21 new wells. Safeguards included the use of deep set retrievable bridge plug and the installation of tubing and capillary strings in parent wells when bringing them back online. Our customized completion design in conjunction with offset mitigation measures to protect parent wells yielded very positive results. 
Collectively, our new wells on these 4 pads are meeting pre-drill expectations, while the offset group of parent wells are producing above pre-drill test rates. We have seen very little impact to the parent wells, with only 3 of the 33 parent wells having a combined impact of only 2 million cubic foot per day. 
We are very pleased with these results. To remain on operations, Cabot has implemented another program enhancement operation. Cabot recently initiated a well pad compression program, which incorporates clean burn emission control systems. To date, we have installed compression on 6 of our pads. The pad compression -- compressors are to achieve a 10% to 15% pressure reduction at each of our installations, resulting in increased production rates and an EUR uplift of 5 to 15 Bcf per pad, all while delivering triple-digit rates of return and an average finding cost below $0.20 per Mcf for the incremental reserves. We currently have plans for 5 additional pad compression installations this year. 
On the pricing front, we remain confident in our constructive outlook on natural gas pricing in both the short and midterm, while we anticipate some near-term pressure on local basis differentials during the shoulder months. And as pipeline maintenance programs kick in, we expect to experience a much more bullish summer of 2021 and winter of 2021/'22 than our outlook at this time last year. 
To begin, the global LNG supply and demand outlook this year is far more robust than what we experienced during the summer of 2020. U.S. LNG exports are currently averaging over 11 Bcf per day, an increase of 3 Bcf per day relative to the same period last year. Additionally, exports to Mexico continued to improve and recently set a record of over 7 Bcf per day, an increase of approximately 2 Bcf per day year-over-year, resulting in strong tailwinds for natural gas demand as we move into the second half of the year. 
On the supply side, we continue to see capital discipline throughout most basins, including Appalachia where production volumes are roughly half or roughly flat year-over-year and about 2.5 Bcf per day lower than the peak levels from fall of 2020. Despite higher natural gas prices, the rig count in Appalachia is down slightly relative to the same period last year, highlighting our belief that capital discipline across the basin remains intact. 
More broadly, dry gas production across the Lower 48 remains about 1.5 Bcf per day below levels from the same period in 2020, and approximately 5 Bcf per day below pre-pandemic levels from late 2019. Currently, Lower 48 natural gas storage levels are 302 Bcf less than last year and 40 Bcf below the 5-year average. More importantly, the Northeast and Midwest, 2 regions that materially affect Northeast pricing and summer demand, are collectively 162 Bcf below last year, and that deficit is expected to widen over the next couple of weeks. 
As we look towards the end of season in October, storage levels are forecast to be around 3.5 Tcf or approximately 400 Bcf below October 2020 levels, setting up a much stronger scenario for the winter of 2021/2022. 
The 2021 NYMEX futures currently sits around $0.80 higher than the 2020 level. Though only a portion of the Cabot gas is affected, a widening basis in the Northeast has created some near-term headwinds for local prices. However, we are still expecting a material increase in our realized price year-over-year. This will result in a significant expansion of free cash flow and returns on and above capital. 
The recent widening was primarily due to a major pipeline replacement project scheduled for May on behalf of the Leidy South expansion project. However, we are optimistic that summer demand for LNG and storage will negate this project weakness in basis. Moreover, with the completion of the Leidy South expansion project, which includes 580 million cubic foot per day of new takeaway out of the basin and this is scheduled for December 1 in service, our expectation is Northeast differentials should return to a more moderate level. 
In yesterday's release, we reaffirmed our full year 2021 plan to deliver an average net production rate of 2.3 Bcf net per day from a capital program of $530 million to $540 million. We also provided a second quarter 2021 production guidance range of 2.225 to 2.227 Bcf per day. The second quarter production guidance implies a slight sequential decline relative to the first quarter, which is a result of lower activity levels and capital spending during the winter season. Activity levels are expected to increase in the second and third quarter, resulting in sequential growth during the second half of the year, primarily during the fourth quarter in anticipation of higher natural gas prices in the winter and in service of the Leidy South expansion project. 
While we all share the frustration regarding Cabot's recent underperformance, I firmly believe our expectations for outsized capital returns this year, which is underpinned by our disciplined capital program resulting in significant free cash flow expansion, will become more appreciated with time and continued execution. However, we remain fully committed to continuing our evaluation of all opportunities to further enhance shareholder value over time. 
And with that, Angie, I'll be more than happy to open the floor up for questions."

So when you talk about the M&A space and you look at how you put together a transaction that can be a win-win transaction, it's not easy to find that point in time to be able to make it work. 
I can assure you that Cabot has not done anything in our -- we've traded sideways while there's been significant volatility in our and our peers' stock from way below us to exceeding us in the, say, the last 6 months. And it's been a stark contrast once you had support in the commodity price, you got out of the window of concern about over-leveraged companies and their outcome and their attention to their balance sheet. The beta plays and the torque in that investment by investors has carried the day, and it's been significant. 
Cabot, with a clean balance sheet and cash flow for 17 out of 20 quarters, was -- that was yesterday. And we recognize that there's opportunity out there in the market. We are conscious of it. We evaluate it. We are not sitting on our laurels. We have discussion in our boardroom. We had discussions in our boardroom this week about this topic. In fact, it was the majority of the conversation. 
So we're fully aware of kind of where we sit. We know the disappointment in Cabot's performance, share value performance. I happen to be a large shareholder also. I'm hacked off about it. And I'm not going to sit on my laurels, and the team's not. And we plan on looking for that best avenue to enhance shareholder value."

It's incremental 250,000 a day from the 330,000 a day [ action] piece come from the West, and that's over in the [ more -- the Seneca area. ]
But the basis differential for May did get whacked a little bit because of the construction project that's required to build out that project. It's actually just a 6-mile replacement pipe that has to install this month. Kind of a one-shot and then that piece of the puzzle will be fixed. But overall you've got to keep in mind too that Cabot's exposure to local basis is really not as great as I think a lot of people believe. 
In our investor guide, it's out on the website today, you'll see a [ chart and table ] that kind of outlines our distribution for our product. If you look closely at that, our volumes, there's over 50% of those volumes is tied to NYMEX or fixed price. And then we have about 10% that's tied to power. That's roughly 70%. Then we have about 15% or so of our gas volumes that head out on the East Coast to get priced off of different bases, locations, not in-basin locations sort of like that. 
And then you add our cash piece then, which is completely different than local basis, for first of the month sales of roughly 10%. You really whittle down our basis exposure, in local basis exposure, to roughly 15%, or maybe 15% to 18% depending on the time of the year. 
So yes, we're disappointed about the May differential blowout, if you will, due to a pipeline project that everyone knew was going to take place. But then again, that project also prohibits any gas going into the Leidy storage fields for the month of May. So we [ won't] have a pickup on gas sales per storage in June and the rest of the summer up there. And with the -- no supply increases and all the other factors that we mentioned were, our expectations are a strong summer and a strong winter on price."

We have, and I'll let Scott talk about our program a little bit, but we have our dividend and the variable piece, supplemental. And we do expect that in light of the horizon and the picture we're painting both from demand, LNG, Mexico, the rationalization of capital allocated in the basin, we're going to expect favorable pricing.

Leo, I think as we see in this industry, there's lots of volatility. We do think it's teed up very positively. As Dan alluded to, we have out been -- generous outsized what that historically has been the buyback. 
The supplemental dividend, the plan as -- from a formulaic perspective as you lay out or commented on, is designed that once we get through the third quarter call and we get into the fourth quarter, midway through the fourth quarter and identify what that pricing is going to be, we'll know our pricing in early December. So we'll have a pretty good idea on our revenue stream for the full year. We're not that complicated. 
So we'll be able to -- and that's why we targeted and telegraphed that December will be the time of the supplemental dividend payment is because we'll have most of our ducks in a row. Obviously, December won't be closed, but 11 of the 12 months will be closed, and we'll have pricing for the 12 months. So that's kind of the timing and the thought process for that.
In terms of the buybacks, and picking up on Josh's question also, again we will be opportunistic as we were before. I think one thing is we've got the strongest balance sheet we've ever had. If the market were to move against us, it's not catastrophic for us because we're able to weather any storm that can be thrown at us. 
At the same time, we're going to be very methodical in our thought process around this return. And I think if I was a betting man, I would make sure that -- well, I'd make sure I would kind of lean towards the fact that you should probably expect something in excess of 50%. And the 50% is our minimum commitment, as we've said. And when you look back at the history, as Dan alluded to, we far exceeded that."

But 8 wells coming on at the end of a quarter have, in essence, very little impact on production in that quarter.  So you're looking at a week delay is at a 200 million a day pad is 1.4 Bcf. 
So that is how to fine-tune it like that, it's not always easy for us to cover our cadence or to smooth out our cadence because we don't have 10 rigs running. We don't have 5 or 6 frac crews. We don't have that mix of pad where you can balance out a new pad coming on at various different times. We're more lumpy just by the nature of being a very low capital intensity company. 
It's a good news, but when we report and we get granular on the cadence, it's kind of hard to use that metric with Cabot. Just simply because just like we're going to see this year in the second quarter, third quarter, we're going to start bringing on a lot more stages than we have through the first quarter, and we're going to start ramping up. 
So that's -- I understand where you're going with it. And I would love to be able to smooth it out, Charles. But that's some of what I deal with and the frustration I have on trying to report on a quarterly basis. And when I read the tie between the number of wells brought on and how inefficient or the lack of production tied to the number of wells brought on, I look up and say, well, maybe we need to put in there exactly when those wells came on in a month to be able to have a better tie."

Our units' setup, there are various configurations by nature of Pennsylvania. And our lateral lengths, number of stages when you tie a well count is not as systematic as it would be if you had, and what I hope to be able to do, in the Upper Marcellus which I think is going to be more systematic than the drilling that we now have in the Lower Marcellus, where we drilled 10,000-foot laterals and we'll have consistent number of stages in our clean map in the Upper Marcellus, which will gain efficiencies for that project. 
In the unit configurations and what we've drilled in the lower right now as we come back through the field to fill in, the number of frac stages in each well is going to be more variable with our program right now until we get into the upper. That affects exactly the cadence and the type of pads that we bring on along with the timing of those pads. 
So -- and I'm trying to answer the question on expectation and some of the variables that go into that expectation. To sum it up in a different way, we're not concerned about what we're seeing on results of our wells. In fact, we're more pleased with what we're seeing now on the offset impacts that had affected what we had seen in the rearview mirror a little bit in 2020, latter part of '19 and 2020 when we had more of an impact on the parent wells. And being able to unload those parent wells and some of the impacts we had with frac hits on those parent wells in the latter part of '19 and latter part of '20, that did affect our forecasting and how we would look at the measurement of the results and to tie back to the number of wells we brought on. 
Moving forward, assuming our results stay consistent as we have with our surgical completions, we don't expect now to have that impact as we bring on completions from the child wells. We do expect now to get a more immediate impact and uplift and similar production return to the parent wells after our completion of the child. So we're hoping that we are mitigating that concern."

And I'm going to have you repeat the first question, David. You were breaking up on me a little bit. 
But we feel good about what we've seen and our expectation about replication. The 4 pads, 21 wells, again when we steer our wells on the child drilling, we're know exactly what our landing points are. We're trying to mitigate the impacts also with picking our landing zones on the parent wells. And as I've already indicated the variables we're using on the completion. 
So we do anticipate positive results. We think that is going to certainly be a metric that will enhance our program, simply by not having the impact that we saw in the latter part of '19 and some of our wells on 20. We saw not only was it difficult to bring some of those wells back on, and we took provisions on some of those wells. 
And keep in mind, some of those wells that we took provisions on, we think certainly have the ability to come back on. It's just when we see it, we report it as we see it. But we do and have seen some of the wells continue to improve back from the frac impact that we received. 
So we're optimistic going forward. We do think that if we look back and look at that as a negative surprise in 2020, we hope we've mitigated that in 2021 reporting results.

So I don't mean to say trust us, but I think we have a good track record of returning and being very disciplined. 
But quite honestly, I'll be -- the buyback program of old, I think Matt and I had this debate. I think every share I bought or instructed him to buy back has been bought at a higher price than we've recently been at. So that kind of hits a little bit of the pause button going, okay, where does this settle in at? Because we are in a different dynamic.
In terms of your initial question, we had shareholders a year ago, again in the thick of COVID, saying, ""We want all E&P companies to be 0 debt."" That's not our path. And I think the market has quickly reverted as people were able to extend out their maturities, repay debt as Dan said in the script. 
And we're on different footing as an industry even with the ESG focus, than we were and have been in a very long period of time.

As a reminder, on today's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in yesterday's earning release.
Our results for the first quarter demonstrate Cabot's ability to deliver significant growth and profitability and free cash flow in a more normalized natural gas price environment than what we experienced during 2020. Our adjusted net income and free cash flow increased by over 175% relative to the prior year period, driven in large part by a 34% increase in realized natural gas prices. Our free cash flow of $138 million was our highest level since the first quarter of 2019 and represented Cabot's 17th quarter with positive free cash flow over the last 20 quarters, all while fully covering our quarterly base dividend and the repayment of $88 million of senior notes that matured during the quarter.
While higher realized prices were the primary driver of our stronger financial metrics, we also delivered another exceptional quarter operationally with our production of 2.29 Bcf per day, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range. Our CapEx coming in below expectations and our operating expenses per unit improving relative to the prior year period despite higher G&A expenses related to a onetime charge associated with our recent early retirement program.
Our balance sheet remains as strong it has ever been, with less than $900 million of net debt as of quarter end, resulting in a net leverage ratio of approximately 1x trailing 12-month EBITDA. This leverage ratio is expected to further improve throughout the year due to an increasing cash flow profile resulting from a higher natural gas price environment this year compared to the 25-year NYMEX low we experienced in 2020.
Our fortress balance sheet provides significant financial flexibility and will allow us to continue to return a significant amount of our free cash flow to shareholders this year and for years to come. This uniquely differentiates us from so many in our industry today who are approaching the inflection of positive free cash flow generation, but will be forced to utilize that free cash flow for significant balance sheet repair in medium term as opposed to capital return to shareholders.
On the topic of capital returns, yesterday, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly base dividend to $0.11 per share, which on an annualized basis represents a base dividend yield of 2.6%. As we highlighted on our year-end call, we are fully committed to a base plus supplemental dividend strategy, which incorporates a growing base dividend and an annual supplemental dividend to arrive at our minimum capital return target of at least 50% of our annual free cash flow.
Based on the current natural gas price outlook for this year, we expect to generate excessive free cash flow above our minimum capital return target and our debt repayment. This excess free cash flow is anticipated to be earmarked for additional capital returns, including opportunistic share repurchases, especially given the recent equity underperformance and/or incremental supplemental dividends as we have provided in the last few years.
On the operations front, Cabot has implemented a focused stage-by-stage completion design along each newly drilled wellbore to maximize production and minimize potential impacts to adjacent parent wells. Based on an in-depth engineering and geologic analysis of each offset well, our team develops a customized, segmented completion design for each new well lateral.
Design variables include the volume of fluid pump, profit concentration, cluster spacing and the treating rate for each section along the wellbore. This concept was utilized on each of the 4 pads and 21 wells that were placed on production in the first quarter with 2 to 4 different completion designs utilized in various sections of each lateral.
Additional safeguards were also employed to protect the 33 parent wells, which partially or fully offset these 21 new wells. Safeguards included the use of deep-set retrievable bridge plug and the installation of tubing and capillary strings in parent wells when bringing them back online. Our customized completion design in conjunction with offset mitigation measures to protect parent wells yielded very positive results.
Collectively, our new wells on these 4 pads are meeting pre-drill expectations, while the offset group of parent wells are producing above pre-drill test rates. We have seen very little impact to the parent wells with only 3 of the 33 parent wells having a combined impact of only 2 million cubic foot per day. We are very pleased with these results.
To remain on operations, Cabot has implemented another program enhancement operation. Cabot recently initiated a well pad compression program, which incorporates clean burn emission control systems. To date, we have installed compression on 6 of our pads. The pad compression -- compressors are to achieve a 10% to 15% pressure reduction at each of our installations, resulting in increased production rates and an EUR uplift of 5 to 15 Bcf per pad, all while delivering triple-digit rates of return and an average finding cost below $0.20 per Mcf for the incremental reserves. We currently have plans for 5 additional pad compression installations this year.
On the pricing front, we remain confident in our constructive outlook on natural gas pricing in both the short and midterm while we anticipate some near-term pressure on local basis differentials during the shoulder months. And as pipeline maintenance programs kick in, we expect to experience a much more bullish summer of 2021 and winter of 2021/'22 than our outlook at this time last year.
To begin, the global LNG supply and demand outlook this year is far more robust than what we experienced during the summer of 2020. U.S. LNG exports are currently averaging over 11 Bcf per day, an increase of 3 Bcf per day relative to the same period last year. Additionally, exports to Mexico continued to improve and recently set a record of over 7 Bcf per day, an increase of approximately 2 Bcf per day year-over-year, resulting in strong tailwinds for natural gas demand as we move into the second half of the year.
On the supply side, we continue to see capital discipline throughout most basins, including Appalachia where production volumes are roughly half -- roughly flat year-over-year and about 2.5 Bcf per day lower than the peak levels from fall of 2020. Despite higher natural gas prices, the rig count in Appalachia is down slightly relative to the same period last year, highlighting our belief that capital discipline across the basin remains intact.
More broadly, dry gas production across the Lower 48 remains about 1.5 Bcf per day, below levels from the same period in 2020 and approximately 5 Bcf per day below pre-pandemic levels from late 2019. Currently, Lower 48 natural gas storage levels are 302 Bcf less than last year and 40 Bcf below the 5-year average. More importantly, the Northeast and Midwest, 2 regions that materially affect Northeast pricing and summer demand, are collectively 162 Bcf below last year, and that deficit is expected to widen over the next couple of weeks.
As we look towards the end of season in October, storage levels are forecast to be around 3.5 Tcf or approximately 400 Bcf below October 2020 levels, setting up a much stronger scenario for the winter of 2021/2022. The 2021 NYMEX futures currently sits around $0.80 higher than the 2020 level. Though only a portion of the Cabot gas is affected, a widening basis in the Northeast has created some near-term headwinds for local prices.
However, we are still expecting a material increase in our realized price year-over-year. This will result in a significant expansion of free cash flow and returns on and above capital. The recent widening was primarily due to a major pipeline replacement project scheduled for May on behalf of the Leidy South expansion project. However, we are optimistic that summer demand for LNG and storage will negate this project weakness in basis.
Moreover, with the completion of the Leidy South expansion project, which includes 580 million cubic foot per day of new takeaway out of the basin and this is scheduled for December 1 in service, our expectation is Northeast differentials should return to a more moderate level.
In yesterday's release, we reaffirmed our full year 2021 plan to deliver an average net production rate of 2.3 Bcf net per day from a capital program of $530 million to $540 million. We also provided a second quarter 2021 production guidance range of 2.225 to 2.227 Bcf per day. The second quarter production guidance implies a slight sequential decline relative to the first quarter, which is a result of lower activity levels and capital spending during the winter season. Activity levels are expected to increase in the second and third quarter, resulting in sequential growth during the second half of the year, primarily during the fourth quarter in anticipation of higher natural gas prices in the winter and in service of the Leidy South expansion project.
While we all share the frustration regarding Cabot's recent underperformance, I firmly believe our expectations for outsized capital returns this year, which is underpinned by our disciplined capital program resulting in significant free cash flow expansion, will become more appreciated with time and continued execution. However, we remain fully committed to continuing our evaluation of all opportunities to further enhance shareholder value over time.
And with that, Angie, I'll be more than happy to open the floor up for questions."

I can assure you that Cabot has not done anything in our -- we've traded sideways while there's been significant volatility in our peers' stock from way below us to exceeding us in the, say, the last 6 months. And it's been a stark contrast once you had support in the commodity price, you got out of the window of concern about overleveraged companies and their outcome and their attention to their balance sheet. The [ beta ] plays and the torque in that investment by investors has carried the day, and it's been significant.
Cabot, with a clean balance sheet and cash flow for 17 out of 20 quarters, was -- that was yesterday. And we recognize that there's opportunity out there in the market. We are conscious of it. We evaluate it. We are not sitting on our laurels. We have discussion in our boardroom. We had discussions in our boardroom this week about this topic. In fact, it was the majority of the conversation.
So we're fully aware of kind of where we sit. We know the disappointment in Cabot's performance, share value performance. I happen to be a large shareholder also. I'm hacked off about it.

It's incremental 250,000 a day from [indiscernible] the 330,000 a day [ expansion ] piece come from the West, and that's over in the more -- the cheap Seneca area.
But the basis differential for May did get whacked a little bit because of the construction project that's required to build out that project. It's actually just a 6-mile replacement pipe that -- have to install this month, kind of a one-shot and then that piece of the puzzle will be fixed. But overall, you've got to keep in mind too that Cabot's exposure to local basis is really not as great as I think a lot of people believe.
In our investor guide, it's out on the website today, you'll see a pie chart or at least a table that kind of outlines our distribution for our products. If you look closely at that, our volumes, there's over 50% of those volumes that's tied to NYMEX or fixed price. And then we have about 10% that's tied to power. That's roughly 70%. Then we have about 15% or so of our gas volumes that head out on the East Coast to get priced off of differentials in basis, locations, not in-basin locations, sort of like that.
And then you add our cash piece then, which is completely different than local basis, for first of the month sales of roughly 10%. You really whittle down our basis exposure and local basis exposure to roughly 15% or maybe 15% to 18% depending on the time of the year.
So yes, we're disappointed about the May differential blowout, if you will, due to a pipeline project that everyone knew was going to take place. But then again, that project also prohibits any gas going into the Leidy storage fields for the month of May.
So we won't have a pickup on gas sales per storage in June and the rest of the summer up there. And with the -- no supply increases and all the other factors that we mentioned were, our expectations are a strong summer and a strong winter on price."

You can look at our history. And we have been, in the last few years, fairly generous on -- and rightfully so, generous on returning a large portion in much greater than 50% of our free cash flow back to shareholders.
We have -- and I'll let Scott talk about our program a little bit, but we have our dividend and the variable piece, supplemental. And we do expect that in light of the horizon and the picture we're painting both from the demand, LNG, Mexico, the rationalization of capital allocated in the basin, we're going to expect favorable pricing.

Leo, I think as we see in this industry, there's lots of volatility. We do think it's teed up very positively. As Dan alluded to, we have out -- been generous, outsized what that historically has been the buyback.
The supplemental dividend, the plan as -- from a formulaic perspective as you lay out or commented on, is designed that once we get through the third quarter call and we get into the fourth quarter, midway through the fourth quarter and identify what that pricing is going to be, we'll know our pricing in early December. So we'll have a pretty good idea on our revenue stream for the full year. We're not that complicated.
So we'll be able to -- and that's why we targeted and telegraphed that December will be the time of the supplemental dividend payment is because we'll have most of our ducks in a row. Obviously, December won't be closed, but 11 of the 12 months will be closed, and we'll have pricing for the 12 months. So that's kind of the timing and the thought process for that.
In terms of the buybacks, and picking up on Josh's question also, again we will be opportunistic as we were before. I think one thing is we've got the strongest balance sheet we've ever had. If we -- if the market were to move against us, it's not catastrophic for us because we're able to weather any storm that can be thrown at us.
At the same time, we're going to be very methodical in our thought process around this return. And I think if I was a betting man, I would make sure that -- well, I'd make sure I would kind of lean towards the fact that you should probably expect something in excess of 50%. The 50% is our minimum commitment, as we've said. And when you look back at the history, as Dan alluded to, we far exceeded that."

And we'll be between 1.5 and 2 frac crews.
So anytime we are out there, and it takes so few wells and pads to be able to maintain our forecast levels of production. If we drill an 8-well pad, and that pad whether it's for weather or for whatever reason, if it's delayed, say, 200 million a day, it's delayed for a week. 200 million a day delayed for a week and say that occurred at the very end of the quarter.
We report when we bring those wells on at the end of the quarter as new wells brought on. Kind of like we did this quarter, bringing on 21 wells. But if that 8-well pad comes on the last week of the quarter, it's reflected as a quarter completion. But 8 wells coming on at the end of a quarter have, in essence, very little impact on production in that quarter. So you're looking at -- a week delay is, at a 200 million a day pad, is 1.4 Bcf.

We don't have that mix of pads where you can balance out a new pad coming on at various different times. We're more lumpy just by the nature of being a very low capital intensity company.
It's a good news, but when we report and we get granular on the cadence, it's kind of hard to use that metric with Cabot just simply because -- just like we're going to see this year in the second quarter, third quarter, we're going to start bringing on a lot more stages than we have through the first quarter, and we're going to start ramping up.
So that's -- I understand where you're going with it. And I would love to be able to smooth it out, Charles. But that's some of what I deal with and the frustration I have on trying to report on a quarterly basis. And when I read the tie between the number of wells brought on and how inefficient or the lack of production tied to the number of wells brought on, I look up and say, well, maybe we need to put in there exactly when those wells came on in a month to be able to have a better tie."

Our units set us up there, our various configurations by nature of Pennsylvania.
And our lateral lengths, number of stages, when you tie it to a well count, it's not as systematic as it would be if you had, and what I hope to be able to do, in the Upper Marcellus, which I think is going to be more systematic than the drilling that we now have in the Lower Marcellus, where we drilled 10,000-foot laterals and we'll have consistent number of stages in our clean map in the Upper Marcellus, which will gain efficiencies for that project.
In the unit configurations and what we've drilled in the Lower right now, as we come back through the field to fill in, the number of frac stages in each well is going to be more variable with our program right now until we get into the Upper. That affects exactly the cadence and the type of pads that we bring on along with the timing of those pads.
So -- and I'm trying to answer the question on expectation and some of the variables that go into that expectation. To sum it up in a different way, we're not concerned about what we're seeing on results of our wells. In fact, we're more pleased with what we're seeing now on the offset impacts that had affected what we had seen in the rearview mirror a little bit in 2020 -- latter part of '19 and 2020 when we had more of an impact on the parent wells. And being able to unload those parent wells and some of the impacts we had with frac hits on those parent wells in the latter part of '19 and latter part of '20, that did affect our forecasting and how we would look at the measurement of the results and to tie back to the number of wells we brought on.
Moving forward, assuming our results stay consistent as we have with our surgical completions, we don't expect now to have that impact as we bring on completions from the child wells. We do expect now to get a more immediate impact and uplift and similar production return to the parent wells after our completion of the child. So we're hoping that we are mitigating that concern."

The Leidy South project is -- it takes our production down from Northeast PA into the Washington, D.C. area now to a location called River Road.

However, I'll also say there are several projects in the works. I know you're familiar with PennEast and the recent news on regarding it and their Supreme Court case on eminent domain. And then I'm sure you're aware that Transco also announced regional energy access, which is a close to 1 Bcf a day of pipeline that's basically a brownfield project to existing right of ways.

And I'm going to have you repeat the first question, David. You were breaking up on me a little bit.
But we feel good about what we've seen and our expectation about replication. The 4 pads, 21 wells, again, when we steer our wells on the child drilling, we know exactly what our landing points are and we're trying to mitigate the impacts also with picking our landing zones on the parent wells and as I've already indicated, the variables we're using on the completion.
So we do anticipate positive results. We think that is going to certainly be a metric that will enhance our program, simply by not having the impact that we saw in the latter part of '19 and some of our wells on 20. We saw -- not only was it difficult to bring some of those wells back on, and we took revisions on some of those wells.
And keep in mind, some of those wells that we took provisions on, we think certainly have the ability to come back on. It's just when we see it, we report it as we see it. But we do and have seen some of the wells continue to improve back from the frac impact that we received.
So we're optimistic going forward. We do think that if we look back and look at that as a negative surprise in 2020, we hope we've mitigated that in 2021 reporting results. And David, I'm going to have to ask you for the -- repeating the first question."

So I don't mean to say trust us, but I think we have a good track record of returning and being very disciplined.
But quite honestly, I'll be -- the buyback program of old, I think Matt and I had this debate. I think every share I bought or instructed him to buy back has been bought at a higher price than we've recently been at. So that kind of hits a little bit of the pause button going, okay, where does this settle in at? Because we are in a different dynamic.
In terms of your initial question, we had shareholders a year ago, again in the thick of COVID, saying, ""We want all E&P companies to be 0 debt."" That's not our path. And I think the market has quickly reverted as people were able to extend out their maturities, repay debt, as Dan said in the script.

As a reminder, on today's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in this morning's earnings release. Our results for the second quarter 2021 reinforced the positive theme from our first quarter results with a significant increase in realized prices year-over-year driving exponential growth in our financial metrics. Our adjusted net income for the quarter was $105 million or $0.26 per share, which represents over a fivefold increase in adjusted earnings per share relative to the prior year period, driven primarily by a 35% increase in our realized natural gas prices. During the quarter, we also delivered positive free cash flow of $64 million, our 18th quarter of positive free cash flow over the last 21 quarters, resulting in a $127 million improvement in free cash flow relative to the second quarter of 2020. 
During the second quarter, we returned over 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders through our base quarterly dividend as we continue to emphasize our strategic focus on returning a majority of our free cash flow to shareholders. We continue to improve on our industry-leading cost structure during the quarter as demonstrated by a 2% year-over-year improvement of all-in operating expenses to $1.41 per Mcfe, excluding a $6.2 million of expenses during the second quarter related to the pending merge with Cimarex Energy, our unit cost improved by relative to prior year period. 
Production for the second quarter of 2021 was 1% below our guidance range due to a longer-than-anticipated maintenance related midstream downtime primarily resulting from one of our third-party providers compression station.  And operational delays during the quarter that pushed the timing of certain wells down on production to later in the second quarter and into the first part of the third quarter. 
Our production volumes for the third quarter to date have averaged approximately 2.3 Bcf per day, a 4% increase relative to our second quarter production levels. We incurred $166 million of capital expenditure during the second quarter, a 5% reduction relative to the prior year period. Our Capital for the quarter was in line with our prior guidance for higher activity levels in the second and third quarters, which are expected to result in sequential production growth during the second half of this year, primarily during the fourth quarter in anticipation of higher realized natural gas prices and the in-service of the Leidy South expansion project. 
We also drilled 5 more net wells and completed 121 more stages than originally planned during the second quarter, highlighting continued efficiency gains in our operations. Our balance sheet remains as strong as ever with less than $900 million of net debt as of quarter end, resulting in a net leverage ratio of less than 1x trailing 12-month EBITDA. We expect to continue to reduce our absolute debt levels during the third quarter through the repayment of $100 million tranche of debt maturing in September. 
On the pricing front, our bullish thesis for natural gas prices entering this year has continued to materialize, resulting in significant year-over-year gains in natural gas prices across North America. Through July 2021, NYMEX prices have risen 61% compared to the same time frame in 2020, while IT prices have increased by 43% over the same period. Despite transitory pipeline maintenance and outages that resulted in wider regional basis differentials during the second quarter of 2021, we have recently witnessed forward prices and cash prices across Appalachia sales locations beginning to compress and trend back to their historic pricing relationships. 
We have updated our full year differential guidance of $0.50 to $0.55 to $0.70 to $0.75, primarily as a result of the impact of higher anticipated NYMEX prices relative to our fixed price sales agreement and to a lesser extent, wider regional basis differentials. Our prior differential guidance from our first quarter earnings release in late April was based on a [ $2.75 ] NYMEX for the year. While our updated guidance is based on an average NYMEX price of approximately [ $3.35 ] implied by actual year-to-date and the future curve for the balance of the year. At the midpoint of our updated guidance range, our pre-hedged natural price realizations are now expected to be 18% higher than our prior year guidance from late April and 60% higher than our actual 2020 price realizations. 
Third quarter 2021 differentials are expected to widen relative to the second quarter with a tightening expected in the fourth quarter. We are extremely encouraged by natural gas prices for the balance of the year, where the current NYMEX futures are averaging over $4. Despite wider differentials in the Northeast during the second quarter, we are optimistic about a strong improvement in local in the second half of the year, driven by our expectation for continued strength in regional gas demand, flat production profiles across the Appalachia Basin and a significant reduction in east storage levels, which are currently 17% below 2020 levels and 8% below the 5-year average. Of equal importance, we are very optimistic on the impact of the Leidy South expansion project that is projected to be placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2021 and will deliver 580 million cubic foot per day of Northeast Pennsylvania production volumes to the mid-Atlantic market area while further improving Cabot's realized pricing. 
Additionally, the PennEast and Regional East access expansion projects are projected to be in service between 2022 and 2024, which will move even more supply out of the basin and into growing demand markets. As we look forward to 2022,  we are extremely encouraged by the improvement in the [indiscernible] [ '22 ] NYMEX futures to approximately [ $3.50 ] or 34% increase since the beginning of the year. we are currently unhedged in 2022, providing significant exposure to a strong natural gas price environment that supports an improving cash flow profile. In this morning's release, we reaffirmed our full year stand-alone 2021 plan to deliver an average net production rate of [ $2.35 ] Bcf per day from a capital program of the $530 million to $540 million. 
Our capital guidance range for the year remain unchanged despite the increase in our expected net well drilled -- net wells drilled from 80 to 85 resulting from our continued drilling efficiencies. We also provided our third quarter 2021 production guidance range of [ $2.275 ] to [ $2.325 ] Bcf per day. The third quarter guidance range implies sequential production growth of 4% relative to the second quarter at the midpoint, while we anticipate approximately 10% of sequential production growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter coinciding with higher winter natural gas prices and the in-service of the Leidy South expansion project. 
Third quarter capital expenditures are expected to decrease relative to the second quarter with a greater sequential decline anticipated in the fourth quarter, driven by lower activity levels as we enter the winter season. Operationally, we continue to execute our program in line with guidance. 
While financially, our outlook for 2021 is much stronger as a result of higher expected realized prices. Based on current strip, our stand-alone free cash flow for the second half of the year is expected to be approximately 2x our first half free cash flow, excluding the impact of merger-related expenses. I also want to provide a brief update on our pending merge with Cimarex as we are excited as ever about the compelling strategic and financial benefits of our merge, and we continue to make progress towards closing the fourth quarter of 2021. As I noted, when announced the transaction in May. We carefully studied the long-term benefits of expanding geographically beyond the Marcellus Shale and adding more scale and balance to our operation. The pending merge will accelerate our strategy and create an industry-leading operator with geographic and commodity diversity, scale, financial strength to thrive in today's market and over the long-term across the commodity price cycles. 
With the addition of Cimarex oil assets in the Permian and Anadarko basins to our natural gas assets in the Marcellus Shale, we will be a more resilient company with scale and strong positions in the premier oil and gas basins in the United States. Together, we will have top quality assets and the lowest cost of supply profile relative to our upstream peers, which will facilitate free cash flow generation, shareholder value creation and an accelerated return of capital to shareholders. With our increased footprint, we will have complementary oil exposure with low-cost, high-margin assets, and we'll be positioned to capture opportunities from both near-term oil demand and long-term natural gas transition fuel demand. Compared to Cabot stand-alone, the combined business will be able to return substantially more capital to shareholders, especially in light of the improvement in natural gas prices and, to a lesser extent, oil prices since the deal was announced in late May. 
This best-in-class capital profile return will be driven by a high-quality portfolio that delivers significant free cash flow through cycles, a very low cost of supply through consolidation of Cabot and Cimarex top-tier teams and assets and a reduced cost of capital due to increased scale, a strong balance sheet and increased liquidity. In short, combining Cimarex, with Cimarex will create a clearly differentiated energy company with a strong financial foundation and the right assets, exposure and capital allocation flexibility to deliver peer-leading capital returns while maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
As a stronger, more resilient company, we will be well positioned to generate substantial free cash flow through commodity cycles facilitate best-in-class capital returns and deliver enhanced shareholder value. I would like to acknowledge the incredible work and dedication of our employees.
I believe we have the best employees in the world, and I have been inspired by their commitment over the last year. To our cabin employees, you have my deepest appreciation. Looking ahead, we remain on track to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2021 shortly after receiving shareholder approval. We look forward to continuing to engage with our shareholders in the weeks ahead regarding the benefits of the pending merge. This transaction builds on and accelerates the strategy we have been executing and I hope you will share our excitement and enthusiasm for the future. Together with Cimarex, we intend to deliver superior, long-term value creation for our shareholders and other stakeholders. And [ Phylis ], with that, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

But with the cadence that had been set up for our 2021 program, which was done certainly a while back,  the timing of just when we bring on those locations is what enhances that fourth quarter production growth. And keep in mind, it's by design somewhat to be able to take advantage of the anticipated fourth quarter increase in pricing.  But it was also designed in anticipation of the Leidy South coming online and commissioning. So by design, but keep in mind, when we have just so few pads that we bring on during the year, we're -- and you've seen it in the past, how if you delay 3 or 4 or 5 days, bringing on a big pad, it can either enhance your production on any given quarter or slightly reduce your production on any given quarter, but it is a very, very narrow period of time that, that's disruptive one way or the other. But this fourth quarter increase it was somewhat by design on the cadence of us accelerating our capital this year upfront and kind of dissipating a little bit towards the back end into the winter months."

And our hedge committee meets on a fairly regular basis to have that discussion.  We've been bullish for the reasons we're all aware where natural gas prices have been going.

For [indiscernible] the other shipper on the project, it's [ $330,000 ] a day from the western side of Easter Northeast PA.  For Cabot, the expansion involved a couple of new compressor stations and some expansion of existing stations. Those projects are pretty much complete.  A little bit of testing to be done and some -- excuse me, regulatory approvals to wrap that up. We do anticipate a full hand service on December 1.  However, there could be some volumes available prior to that. We blocking out sometime during August. For the rest of the project that includes some pipe replacement, it's on schedule. We do have bimonthly updates with Williams from Transco and everything is on schedule. 
So incrementally speaking for Cabot, it does move quite a bit of volume out of in-basin pricing down to the Atlantic -- Mid-Atlantic area. For the most part, we've already secured markets. We have some opportunities and some options yet they're going to wait and see on. So we'll pick up primarily the difference between mid-Atlantic pricing and in-basin pricing, although our expectations that ones in-basin pricing will materially improve with the low Eastern storage levels and other fundamentals."

All that said, as -- back to your original question, the rate is $0.50 per MMBtu for Cabot on our end, we get out of the basin down to the mid-Atlantic market.

What changes that dynamic is the announcement of the merger, but also all the things that we've laid out in anticipation of the closing of the merger, the special dividend and those aspects.

And so right now, the shareholders like to see a significant amount of free cash flow. They also like to see a strong balance sheet we're able to deliver both of those, but I would only be speculating as far as maybe the timing of those lines when they would be commissioned and what the macro market is way out in front of us to answer that. 
I can say this if you just wanted to drill wells and drill them for a long time and bring in the equipment and frac crews to be able to get that done to increase production, it could increase significantly from where it is today. And I mean, significantly. But I'm not going to speculate on the amount where it might go in the next couple of years."

The impact of the demand across the country currently with record exports in the Mexico and obviously, a very robust LNG export market that is fairly consistent day in, day out. You got a few hiccups here and there with fault and maintenance and things like that. But it's been fun over the last couple of years to watch this demand increase. Even in the Pacific Northwest, you mentioned the Canadian imports it's been interesting  to watch as we see hydro up there and the commission it's in more exports from Canada head in that direction and then to the upper Midwest.  That's actually influenced the storage levels in the upper Midwest. I think they're somewhere well over 100 Bcf flow this time last year, same as the e-store levels. 
So your question about how high can it go is a good question. And in our hedge committee meetings, of course, we think about that or we thought we wish about that. And it's -- fundamentally, we're set up for good year-over-year capital that were in place. And yes, we had a good winter in certain spots of the country this year. It will take the system, and there will be price increases.  We're prepared to meet our commitments of our customers. Source levels will not get to where they were at this time last year. It's a well-known fact. So how high can it go is relative, particularly in the New York market, the Boston market, the Chicago market and other areas that do like the amount of storage that we had last year. So if I -- for the gambler or a speculator, I don't know if there is a cap necessarily for $4, $5, $6, we have seen $8 in non-new work market in the past. So I think it's all on the table at this point."

Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. As a reminder, on today's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our commen",1779,"Thank you, Phyllis, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. As a reminder, on today's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures were provided in this morning's earnings release.
Our results for the second quarter 2021 reinforced the positive theme from our first quarter results, with a significant increase in realized prices year-over-year driving exponential growth in our financial metrics. Our adjusted net income for the quarter was $105 million or $0.26 per share, which represents over a fivefold increase in adjusted earnings per share relative to the prior year period, driven primarily by a 35% increase in our realized natural gas prices. During the quarter, we also delivered positive free cash flow of $64 million, our 18th quarter of positive free cash flow over the last 21 quarters, resulting in a $127 million improvement in free cash flow relative to the second quarter of 2020.
During the second quarter, we returned over 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders through our base quarterly dividend as we continue to emphasize our strategic focus on returning a majority of our free cash flow to shareholders. We continue to improve on our industry-leading cost structure during the quarter as demonstrated by a 2% year-over-year improvement of all-in operating expenses to $1.41 per Mcfe, excluding a $6.2 million of expenses during the second quarter related to the pending merge with Cimarex Energy, our unit cost improved by 4% relative to prior year period.
Production for the second quarter of 2021 was 1% below our guidance range due to a longer-than-anticipated maintenance-related midstream downtime primarily resulting from one of our third-party providers compression station and operational delays during the quarter that pushed the timing of certain wells down on production to later in the second quarter and into the first part of the third quarter.
Our production volumes for the third quarter to date have averaged approximately 2.3 Bcf per day, a 4% increase relative to our second quarter production levels. We incurred $166 million of capital expenditure during the second quarter, a 5% reduction relative to the prior year period. Our capital for the quarter was in line with our prior guidance for higher activity levels in the second and third quarters, which are expected to result in sequential production growth during the second half of this year, primarily during the fourth quarter in anticipation of higher realized natural gas prices and the in service of the Leidy South Expansion Project.
We also drilled 5 more net wells and completed 121 more stages than originally planned during the second quarter, highlighting continued efficiency gains in our operations. Our balance sheet remains as strong as ever with less than $900 million of net debt as of quarter end, resulting in a net leverage ratio of less than 1x trailing 12-month EBITDA. We expect to continue to reduce our absolute debt levels during the third quarter through the repayment of $100 million tranche of debt maturing in September.
On the pricing front, our bullish thesis for natural gas prices entering this year has continued to materialize, resulting in significant year-over-year gains in natural gas prices across North America. Through July 2021, NYMEX prices have risen 61% compared to the same time frame in 2020, while Leidy prices have increased by 43% over the same period. Despite transitory pipeline maintenance and outages that resulted in wider regional basis differentials during the second quarter of 2021, we have recently witnessed forward prices and cash prices across Appalachia's sales locations beginning to compress and trend back to their historic pricing relationships.
We have updated our full year differential guidance of $0.50 to $0.55 to $0.70 to $0.75, primarily as a result of the impact of higher anticipated NYMEX prices relative to our fixed price sales agreement and to a lesser extent, wider regional basis differentials. 
Our prior differential guidance from our first quarter earnings release in late April was based on a $2.75 NYMEX for the year. While our updated guidance is based on an average NYMEX price of approximately $3.35 implied by actual year-to-date and the future curve for the balance of the year. At the midpoint of our updated guidance range, our pre-hedged natural price realizations are now expected to be 18% higher than our prior year guidance from late April and 60% higher than our actual 2020 price realizations.
Third quarter 2021 differentials are expected to widen relative to the second quarter with a tightening expected in the fourth quarter. We are extremely encouraged by natural gas prices for the balance of the year, where the current NYMEX futures are averaging over $4. Despite wider differentials in the Northeast during the second quarter, we are optimistic about a strong improvement in local in the second half of the year, driven by our expectation for continued strength in regional gas demand, flat production profiles across the Appalachian basin and a significant reduction in east storage levels, which are currently 17% below 2020 levels and 8% below the 5-year average. 
Of equal importance, we are very optimistic on the impact of the Leidy South Expansion Project that is projected to be placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2021 and will deliver 580 million cubic foot per day of Northeast Pennsylvania production volumes to the Mid-Atlantic market area, while further improving Cabot's realized pricing. 
Additionally, the PennEast and Regional East Access expansion projects are projected to be in service between 2022 and 2024, which will move even more supply out of the basin and into growing demand markets. As we look forward to 2022, we are extremely encouraged by the improvement in the Cal '22 NYMEX futures to approximately $3.50 or 34% increase since the beginning of the year. We are currently unhedged in 2022, providing significant exposure to a strong natural gas price environment that supports an improving cash flow profile. In this morning's release, we reaffirmed our full year stand-alone 2021 plan to deliver an average net production rate of 2.35 Bcf per day from a capital program of the $530 million to $540 million. 
Our capital guidance range for the year remain unchanged despite the increase in our expected net well drilled -- net wells drilled from 80 to 85 resulting from our continued drilling efficiencies. We also provided our third quarter 2021 production guidance range of 2.275 to 2.325 Bcf per day. The third quarter guidance range implies sequential production growth of 4% relative to the second quarter at the midpoint, while we anticipate approximately 10% of sequential production growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter coinciding with higher winter natural gas prices and the in-service of the Leidy South Expansion Project.
Third quarter capital expenditures are expected to decrease relative to the second quarter with a greater sequential decline anticipated in the fourth quarter, driven by lower activity levels as we enter the winter season. Operationally, we continue to execute our program in line with guidance, while financially, our outlook for 2021 is much stronger as a result of higher expected realized prices. Based on current strip, our stand-alone free cash flow for the second half of the year is expected to be approximately 2x our first half free cash flow, excluding the impact of merger-related expenses. 
I also want to provide a brief update on our pending merge with Cimarex as we are excited as ever about the compelling strategic and financial benefits of our merge, and we continue to make progress towards closing the fourth quarter of 2021. As I noted, when announced the transaction in May, we carefully studied the long-term benefits of expanding geographically beyond the Marcellus Shale and adding more scale and balance to our operation. The pending merge will accelerate our strategy and create an industry-leading operator with geographic and commodity diversity, scale, financial strength to thrive in today's market and over the long-term across the commodity price cycles.
With the addition of Cimarex oil assets in the Permian and Anadarko basins to our natural gas assets in the Marcellus Shale, we will be a more resilient company with scale and strong positions in the premier oil and gas basins in the United States. Together, we will have top-quality assets and the lowest cost of supply profile relative to our upstream peers, which will facilitate free cash flow generation, shareholder value creation and an accelerated return of capital to shareholders. With our increased footprint, we will have complementary oil exposure with low-cost, high-margin assets, and we'll be positioned to capture opportunities from both near-term oil demand and long-term natural gas transition fuel demand. Compared to Cabot stand-alone, the combined business will be able to return substantially more capital to shareholders, especially in light of the improvement in natural gas prices and, to a lesser extent, oil prices since the deal was announced in late May. 
This best-in-class capital profile return will be driven by a high-quality portfolio that delivers significant free cash flow through cycles, a very low cost of supply through consolidation of Cabot's and Cimarex's top-tier teams and assets and a reduced cost of capital due to increased scale, a strong balance sheet and increased liquidity. In short, combining the Cimarex (sic) [ Cabot ] with Cimarex will create a clearly differentiated energy company with a strong financial foundation and the right assets, exposure and capital allocation flexibility to deliver peer-leading capital returns while maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
As a stronger, more resilient company, we will be well positioned to generate substantial free cash flow through commodity cycles, facilitate best-in-class capital returns and deliver enhanced shareholder value. 
I would like to acknowledge the incredible work and dedication of our employees. I believe we have the best employees in the world, and I have been inspired by their commitment over the last year. To our Cabot employees, you have my deepest appreciation. Looking ahead, we remain on track to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2021 shortly after receiving shareholder approval. We look forward to continuing to engage with our shareholders in the weeks ahead regarding the benefits of the pending merge. This transaction builds on and accelerates the strategy we have been executing and I hope you will share our excitement and enthusiasm for the future. Together with Cimarex, we intend to deliver superior, long-term value creation for our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
And Phyllis, with that, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions."

With the cadence that the North Group has set up and Phil Stalnaker is here with us this morning. But with the cadence that had been set up for our 2021 program, which was done certainly a while back, the timing of just when we bring on those locations is what enhances that fourth quarter production growth. And keep in mind, it's by design somewhat to be able to take advantage of the anticipated fourth quarter increase in pricing. But it was also designed in anticipation of the Leidy South coming online and commissioning. 
So by design, but keep in mind, when we have just so few pads that we bring on during the year, we're -- and you've seen it in the past how -- if you delay 3 or 4 or 5 days bringing on a big pad, it can either enhance your production on any given quarter or slightly reduce your production on any given quarter. But it is a very, very narrow period of time that, that's disruptive one way or the other. But this fourth quarter increase was somewhat by design on the cadence of us accelerating our capital this year upfront and kind of dissipating a little bit towards the back end into the winter months."

So we're keeping a close eye on that. 
Do I think we'll have some hedge volumes in 2022 at some point? Yes, I do. And our Hedge Committee meets on a fairly regular basis to have that discussion. We've been bullish for the reasons we're all aware where natural gas prices have been going. We're also aware that the capital constraint that is being demonstrated by industry is constructive to the macro environment. And we look forward to that continuing certainly for Cabot.

And for Cabot, it's an incremental 250,000 a day out of the in-basin area. For Seneca and the other shipper on the project, it's 330,000 a day from the western side of Northeast PA. For Cabot, the expansion involved a couple of new compressor stations and some expansion of existing stations. Those projects are pretty much complete. A little bit of testing to be done and some regulatory approvals to wrap that up. We do anticipate a full hand service on December 1. However, there could be some volumes available prior to that. We will likely find that out sometime during August. For the rest of the project that includes some pipe replacement, it's on schedule. We do have bimonthly updates with Williams and Transco and everything is on schedule. 
So incrementally speaking for Cabot, it does move quite a bit of volume out of in-basin pricing down to the Atlantic -- Mid-Atlantic area. For the most part, we've already secured markets. We have some opportunities and some options yet they're going to wait and see on. So we'll pick up primarily the difference between Mid-Atlantic pricing and in-basin pricing, although our expectation is in-basin pricing will materially improve with the low eastern storage levels and other fundamentals."

I spoke earlier about the pipe replacement on the Leidy system or the Leidy South Expansion. That was a huge issue in May of this year, did not affect Cabot operationally but in the basin, we saw the differentials drop from about $0.80 down to $1.80, not really for any good reason, but the markets did not anticipate the duration of the pipe replacement by Transco.
All that said, as -- back to your original question, the rate is $0.50 per MMBtu for Cabot on our end. If we get out of the basin down to the Mid-Atlantic market, that compares to a $0.65 rate that we currently have on the Atlantic Sunrise project, which was the -- of course, the original foundation pipeline."

Our stand-alone commitment to return 50% in cash, still plenty of availability to make that. 
What changes that dynamic is the announcement of the merger, but also all of the things that we've laid out in anticipation of the closing of the merger, the special dividend and those aspects. We want to make sure and manage our capital in this transitionary period so that when we come out together by the end of the year, early fourth quarter close, but by the time we report at the end of the year, we're still as rock solid on the balance sheet.

It's also been preannounced for the transaction.

Can you talk about what you ultimately think creates a ceiling on natural gas and that scenario historically, we've thought about gas to coal substitution as the balancing item but with as much coal-fired capacity having been shut as it has that mechanism might not be as pronounced, but you also have the potential for Canadian gas flow, for example, or shutting down the LNG arm.

The impact of the demand across the country currently with record exports in Mexico and obviously, a very robust LNG export market that is fairly consistent day in, day out, you have a few hiccups here and there with fall and maintenance and things like that. But it's been fun over the last couple of years to watch this demand increase. Even in the Pacific Northwest, you mentioned the Canadian imports it's been interesting to watch as we see hydro up there and the commission that's in more exports from Canada head in that direction and then to the upper Midwest. That's actually influenced the storage levels in the upper Midwest. I think they're somewhere well over 100 Bcf flow this time last year, same as the east storage levels. 
So your question about how high can it go is a good question. And in our Hedge Committee meetings, of course, we think about that or we've done a wish about that. And it's -- fundamentally, we're set up for good year-over-year capital that's put in place. And yes, we had a good winter in certain spots of the country this year. It will tax the system, and there will be price increases. We're prepared to producing to our commitments with our customers. Storage levels will not get to where they were at this time last year. It's a well-known fact. So how high can it go is relative, particularly in the New York market, the Boston market, the Chicago market and other areas that do like the amount of storage that we had last year. So if I was a gambler or a speculator, I don't know if there is a cap necessarily for $4, $5, $6, we have seen $8 in non-New York market in the past. So I think it's all on the table at this point."

We have Matt Kerin for Finance, another overarching business issues, including marketing and of course, Scott, who will be making some prepared remarks. 
The closing of the Cabot and Cimarex merger occurred on October 1 as a result legacy Cimarex will not report third quarter financials. I'm pleased to report that Cortera Energy is well underway with the integration of our 2 legacy companies. As you can imagine, a merger of equals between Cimarex and Cabot is not an easy task. We've been full court press since May. We have functional teams working around the clock to integrate accounting, information systems, production reporting, safety protocol, land systems, operations, marketing, legal and human resources. Each of these teams are tasked with identifying and implementing best-in-class systems and processes. Our approach is all Coterra all go forward. That's not the way we've done it here is not an acceptable answer. We've made great strides and will hit the ground running as we head into 2022. 
And I want to salute our exceptional people from both legacy organizations who are coming together to form a new better Cortera from 2 outstanding legacy companies. We all share an enthusiasm and commitment to create the very best E&P company in our industry. I have great confidence that we will exceed our lofty expectations. Speaking of confidence,  this morning's announcement that we are accelerating our first variable dividend underscores and demonstrates this confidence. Coterra is built to deliver superior financial returns through the cycles. This morning's announced base and accelerated variable dividend totals a combined $0.30 per share, coupled with the $0.50 special dividend we paid on October 22, the company will return $0.80 per share during the fourth quarter. 
As these moves demonstrate we are committed to our owners. Cotera owners benefit from assets that are second to none a pristine balance sheet and asset diversity that will sustain and preserve our cash flow through commodity cycles. Our owners also benefit from our ongoing discipline to allocate capital to its most productive use and continually challenge the status quo. Although Coterra is barely 1 month old, we have some excellent operational results to discuss this morning. 
On a pro forma basis, Cortera produced 645,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 81.500 barrels of oil per day during the third quarter. As promised, we are on track to exit 2021 with oil rates that are 30% greater year-over-year compared to fourth quarter 2020. We brought 61 wells online during the quarter and are currently running 7 rigs and will average 4 completion crews during the fourth quarter. Five of our rigs are in the Delaware Basin, 2 rigs are in Susquehanna County of Northeast Pennsylvania. We benefited nicely from higher commodity prices during the quarter. 
This was true across the board oil, gas and natural gas liquid prices were significantly higher during Q3 and have continued to strengthen. More on that later. We continue to see excellent productivity and deliverability from our Northeast Pennsylvania assets. 
Slide 8 in the investor deck we posted this morning, highlights our ongoing activity level and sustainable production volumes in Northeast Pennsylvania. Our Pennsylvania operation is impressive on all fronts.  We continue to make remarkable drilling progress and are bringing projects online faster than predicted. Faster drilling has meant that we can drill more wells with the same number of rigs, resulting in 4 additional wells drilled during 2021. 
When acceleration occurs owing to operational excellence, it's a nice problem to have. We're also moving 7 additional completions into late fourth quarter '21 from early '22, pushing our planned Marcellus capital slightly above the upper end of our previously issued annual guidance range. As a result, we will have additional volumes coming online around year-end to take advantage of strong Appalachian winter pricing. We continue to see a significant increase in capital efficiency in our Delaware Basin assets. 
Slide 9 of our investor presentation highlights recent development projects in Culberson County. As we've previously discussed, we are observing that relaxed spacing and modestly upsize completions can significantly improve low-level returns and in many instances, we cover the same amount of oil per drilling spacing unit than more dense well spacing. We are achieving increased productivity per well similar section recoveries and increased PV10 with substantially lower capital per drilling spacing unit. 
We are also seeing excellent results from our loan 2021 Anadarko development, the 5-well Carroll Elder, which targets the Woodford Shale. Slide 11 in our deck illustrates the uplift we have seen with relaxed spacing and improved completions. Our Anadarko team has assembled a deep inventory of projects that are highly competitive for capital. I would also like to make a few comments regarding our ESG performance. Coterra, like both legacy companies before it is deeply committed to making ESG performance a top priority. Our industry has grand engineering challenges, and we embrace these challenges wholeheartedly. Coterra is dedicated to be a top performer in ESG metrics to be transparent in our communication and to aim higher than state and federal requirements. We will be an industry leader in ESG performance. As we look ahead into '22 and beyond, Coterra is well positioned to generate consistent returns. We have the flexibility to pivot in response to market constraints and opportunities, commodity price swings and operational advances. Our capital allocation philosophy is supported by 3 pillars: geographic diversity, commodity diversity and economic windage, geographic diversity and commodity diversity are self-explanatory. Economic windage is provided by having assets that provide some of the highest margins in our business. High margins and the low cost structure mean that returns are preserved through downdrafts in commodity prices. These pillars are our fundamental attribute and a competitive advantage of Coterra. Our capital discipline, diversity and flexibility underwrite our ability to generate outsized returns and accelerate return of capital to our owners. With that, I will turn the call over to Scott."
258181,1685191114,2422898,"Coterra Energy Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Coterra Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. As you mentioned, given the merger closed in the beginning of the fourth quarter, the reported third quarter financials for Coterra Energy only reflect the results of legacy Cabot for this reporting period. However, my comments will include k",635,"Thanks, Tom. As you mentioned, given the merger closed in the beginning of the fourth quarter, the reported third quarter financials for Coterra Energy only reflect the results of legacy Cabot for this reporting period. However, my comments will include key items for legacy Cimarex also. And I would specifically like to draw attention to the following financial and operational highlights for the third quarter. Legacy Cabot generated discretionary cash flow of $309 million in the quarter including merger-related expenses, which was driven by a 69% increase in realized natural gas prices compared to the same quarter a year ago. 
Looking ahead, realized natural gas prices are anticipated to increase substantially in the fourth quarter of '21, driven by the expectation for the highest average quarterly NYMEX price we have experienced since the fourth quarter of 2008.  The combined Cabot and Cimarex free cash flow for the quarter totaled $387 million, which also included merger-related cost of $100 million. Legacy Cabot's production for the third quarter was 2.36 billion cubic feet per day, which was 2% above the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. Legacy Cimarex production for the quarter was 251,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 81,500 barrels per day of oil production. 
Legacy Cabot incurred a total of $171 million of capital expenditures in the third quarter while legacy Cimarex incurred $165 million of capital expenditures in the third quarter, excluding capitalized expenses. I would also note that moving forward, Coterra will be reporting under the successful efforts accounting method that legacy Cabot utilized, which does not capitalize G&A and interest expenses. During the third quarter, legacy Cabot repaid $100 million of senior notes that matured in September, reducing our principal long-term debt to $949 million. 
On a combined basis, Coterra exited the third quarter with a cash balance of $1.1 billion and principal long-term debt of $2.9 billion before adjustments for purchase accounting. Our strong balance sheet provides significant financial flexibility and allows for industry-leading capital returns through the cycles as evidenced by the special dividend we made -- paid excuse me, in October and the acceleration of our variable dividend that was announced in this morning's release. Now a few comments on guidance. Our fourth quarter '21 combined production and expense guidance assumes that we achieve results that meet our previously issued stand-alone annual guidance. Of note, we are reaffirming our fourth quarter oil guidance which assumes 30% year-over-year growth, as Tom highlighted earlier. 
Our full year '21 combined capital is expected to be at the high end of the ranges due to increased efficiencies and an accelerated an acceleration of completions in late fourth quarter. Obviously, due to the timing of these actions, the increase in capital is expected to have no effect on '21 production volumes but will benefit 22 volumes, taking advantage of the strong commodity price environment we find ourselves in. 
In the Permian, we are maintaining a second crew during fourth quarter '21 to complete a Lea County project versus our original annual guidance midpoint, which assumed we would drop to 1 crew in the fourth quarter. In Appalachia, we plan to drill an additional 4 wells and completed an additional 7 wells during 2021. These completions are set to come online near year-end. During the first quarter of '22, we plan to maintain 2 completion crews in the Permian and average just over 1 completion crew in the Marcellus. 
We plan to issue formal '22 guidance early next year. The combined financial strength and free cash flow generation potential of Coterra that was originally envisioned when contemplating this combination is illustrated in these results, and has been further supported by the tailwinds from the improving commodity price backdrop. 
With that, Matt, I will turn it over to you for Q&A."

As you saw in the release this morning or in the investor deck, we did add some Cabot hedges around the time of the transaction as we saw the and followed the path of kind of wide collars. And I think that's still a great approach. But we'll be the positive on the market that's out in front of us that Matt talked about is we have the ability to be very offensive in terms of -- on our front foot around the hedge decision versus being in a defensive posture, trying to protect things. 
The other dynamic I would add, and Tom and I had a conversation probably a month ago is the fact that Coterra also changes that hedge decision from the perspective of its balance sheet, and its overall financial wherewithal that there isn't as much when we were separate organizations that need to hedge as much, but we will still use it opportunistically."

I'll just say there's going to be 1 word that will guide us into 2022, and that's discipline. And we're going to be disciplined in our capital. We're going to be disciplined in our capital allocation. And we're going to be disciplined in our use of funds, and we're going to look seriously at buyback, you have to.

We also have to think strategically about it because historically, when prices are good, your values are up even if you're at a discount from your peers. When the prices move down, then all of a sudden you bought shares at a higher price. All you got to do is look at the average cost of the legacy balance sheet of Cabot as to what that intrinsic value of the shares on the balance sheet. So it's also part of the economic decision. To the question -- the rhetorical question, the answer required is, do you kind of leave that cash on the balance sheet and take advantage of that buyback in more lean times than where we find ourselves today, that will be all part of the discussion, Matt."

We look at our returns fully burdened, including all overhead, all associated costs, including legacy land. And we look at that, we modeled the Carol elder as being highly competitive within our portfolio. Now you mentioned Loanrock, but we've got a portfolio of opportunities within our Anadarko asset. There's kind of 3 major areas: Lone Rock being one, the updip kind of near the merge classically is another. And then we've got a really nice opportunity on our Western friends. All of those are highly competitive for capital. You asked about inventory. Our team has done a nice job of presenting a really healthy inventory of mile 3-mile horizontal well opportunities. There'll be a slice of that in 2022. I don't, at this point, can't telegraph how big it slides. But I'll say it offers tremendous flexibility from a capital allocation standpoint to have that third basin that has competitive returns. Because, as you know, from time to time, there have been market constraints, both in Appalachia and in the Permian and having that third highly profitable area is a tremendous safety valve that we offer our owners.

It's the outcome of years of deep science understanding our incremental well level deliverability. A lot of work went into this. I'll just give you an example, and I don't want to get specific on geography. But we have a project going on right now that's slowing back where we have drilled 9 wells in the Upper Wolfcamp and next door is an operator we really respect that drill 12. As we analyze those 2 projects, our volumes are right on top of theirs because the geology is the same. The pressure is the same, the phase and the reservoir is the same.  And we are recovering an equivalent amount of oil on our project compared to our neighbors. When we analyze our neighbors project, we think it's a 100% rate of return. So if that's all you had were the wells you drilled and the volumes you flow back, you would have a victory party and you'd celebrate 100% rate of return. Our returns are significantly higher than that 100%. And if we didn't have the well level detail, we would have missed that. And I think a lot of operators that don't do the science, we'll look at the sum total of project output and stop there with their analysis and very analyzes the this opportunity."

Is there -- Are there areas like the Anadarko or they just not optimized from a capital perspective? Or would this have to be an opportunity that really just sort of augment near-term free cash per share? Well, I would put this in the embarrassment of Rich's category, where when we look at our inventory, we have some things that are years down the road in our inventory but there are others for whom they would jump at the opportunity to confidently invest at those returns. And so when we look at that, we say, if something isn't going to get drilled for the next 8 or 10 years, and yet it has a return profile that would be highly enticing to an outside party, we look at the opportunity to accelerate that value.

Let's kind of see how this shakes out because we do, as you pointed out, have the ability to continue to return with the variable dividend structure that we put in place. And let me add on that. Remember, the legacy Cabot 1 was once a year that Coterra, because of the financial wherewithal is going to do that assessment every single quarter, which gets dividends back in the hands of shareholders quicker. And so again, we're all in favor of growing the base dividend but in a methodical way. You'll remember I said in my history, I'm all for it. And I never want to get too far over our skis where we would ever have to ratchet it back. And in this legal enterprise in 31 years of paying a dividend has never had to call that audible or even reduce it, and we want to continue to build from that point."

And then in aggregation, so you can most efficiently deploy your infrastructure dollars both gas gathering and compression, saltwater disposal on oil gathering is also important. I think beyond that, certainly, procurement is an important scale topic. But quite frankly, I think scale can be overblown. I think once you check those boxes and you have a really great operational team that you're down to very small differences between certainly huge companies and scrappy little companies. Scale alone were the answer, I think the majors would have the lowest cost structure in our business. And clearly, that's not the case. And so I think scale is important.  But it's important to a point. In each of our 3 basins, we have the opportunity to have the lowest cost structure, and that's our challenge. We don't use scale as an excuse. We think we've got what we need to deliver lowest cost. Now I want to say 1 other thing. Our vendors are our partners and they need to make significant living as well. They need to show up with well-maintained equipment, a commitment to safety and well-trained crews. And so we understand some of this inflation is an inevitable outcome of good partnerships.

I'll make a few introductory remarks followed by Scott, who will walk us through third quarter financials and fourth quarter guidance. 
We have quite a crew in the room today, and I just want to make sure you know who is in the room because we may be directing questions to them given the complexity of our release. Blake Sirgo is here for operations; Dan Guffey is here for financial planning and analysis; we have Todd Roemer, our Chief Accounting Officer; we have Matt Kerin for Finance and other overarching business issues, including marketing; and of course, Scott, who will be making some prepared remarks. 
The closing of the Cabot and Cimarex merger occurred on October 1. As a result, legacy Cimarex will not report third quarter financials. 
I'm pleased to report that Coterra Energy is well underway with the integration of our 2 legacy companies. As you can imagine, a merger of equals between Cimarex and Cabot is not an easy task. We've been full court press since May. We have functional teams working around the clock to integrate accounting, information systems, production reporting, safety protocol, land systems, operations, marketing, legal and human resources. Each of these teams are tasked with identifying and implementing best-in-class systems and processes. 
Our approach is all Coterra, all go forward. That's not the way we've done it here is not an acceptable answer. We've made great strides and we'll hit the ground running as we head into 2022. 
I want to salute our exceptional people from both legacy organizations who are coming together to form a new, better Coterra from 2 outstanding legacy companies. We all share an enthusiasm and commitment to create the very best E&P company in our industry. I have great confidence that we will exceed our lofty expectations. 
Speaking of confidence, this morning's announcement that we are accelerating our first variable dividend underscores and demonstrates this confidence. Coterra is built to deliver superior financial returns through the cycles. This morning's announced base and accelerated variable dividend totals a combined $0.30 per share. Coupled with the $0.50 special dividend we paid on October 22, the company will return $0.80 per share during the fourth quarter. 
As these moves demonstrate, we are committed to our owners. Coterra owners benefit from assets that are second to none, a pristine balance sheet and asset diversity that will sustain and preserve our cash flow through commodity cycles. Our owners also benefit from our ongoing discipline to allocate capital to its most productive use and continually challenge the status quo. 
Although Coterra is barely 1 month old, we have some excellent operational results to discuss this morning. On a pro forma basis, Coterra produced 645,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 81,500 barrels of oil per day during the third quarter. As promised, we are on track to exit 2021 with oil rates that are 30% greater year-over-year compared to fourth quarter 2020. 
We brought 61 wells online during the quarter and are currently running 7 rigs and will average 4 completion crews during the fourth quarter. Five of our rigs are in the Delaware Basin, 2 rigs are in Susquehanna County of Northeast Pennsylvania. We benefited nicely from higher commodity prices during the quarter. This was true across the board. Oil, gas and natural gas liquid prices were significantly higher during Q3 and have continued to strengthen. More on that later. 
We continue to see excellent productivity and deliverability from our Northeast Pennsylvania assets. 
Slide 8 in the investor deck we posted this morning highlights our ongoing activity level and sustainable production volumes in Northeast Pennsylvania. Our Pennsylvania operation is impressive on all fronts. We continue to make remarkable drilling progress and are bringing projects online faster than predicted. Faster drilling has meant that we can drill more wells with the same number of rigs, resulting in 4 additional wells drilled during 2021. 
When acceleration occurs owing to operational excellence, it's a nice problem to have. We're also moving 7 additional completions into late fourth quarter '21 from early '22, pushing our planned Marcellus capital slightly above the upper end of our previously issued annual guidance range. As a result, we will have additional volumes coming online around year-end to take advantage of strong Appalachian winter pricing. 
We continue to see a significant increase in capital efficiency in our Delaware Basin assets. 
Slide 9 of our investor presentation highlights recent development projects in Culberson County. As we've previously discussed, we are observing that relaxed spacing and modestly upsized completions can significantly improve low-level returns and, in many instances, recover the same amount of oil per drilling spacing unit than more dense well spacing. We are achieving increased productivity per well, similar section recoveries and increased PV10 with substantially lower capital per drilling spacing unit. 
We are also seeing excellent results from our lone 2021 Anadarko development, the 5-well Carel/Elder, which targets the Woodford Shale. Slide 11 in our deck illustrates the uplift we have seen with relaxed spacing and improved completions. Our Anadarko team has assembled a deep inventory of projects that are highly competitive for capital. 
I would also like to make a few comments regarding our ESG performance. Coterra, like both legacy companies before it, is deeply committed to making ESG performance a top priority. Our industry has grand engineering challenges, and we embrace these challenges wholeheartedly. Coterra is dedicated to be a top performer in ESG metrics, to be transparent in our communication and to aim higher than state and federal requirements. We will be an industry leader in ESG performance. 
As we look ahead into '22 and beyond, Coterra is well positioned to generate consistent returns. We have the flexibility to pivot in response to market constraints and opportunities, commodity price swings and operational advances. 
Our capital allocation philosophy is supported by 3 pillars: geographic diversity, commodity diversity and economic windage. Geographic diversity and commodity diversity are self-explanatory. Economic windage is provided by having assets that provide some of the highest margins in our business. High margins and a low cost structure mean that returns are preserved through downdrafts in commodity prices. These pillars are our fundamental attribute and a competitive advantage of Coterra. Our capital discipline, diversity and flexibility underwrite our ability to generate outsized returns and accelerate return of capital to our owners. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Scott."

As you mentioned, given the merger closed in the beginning of the fourth quarter, the reported third quarter financials for Coterra Energy only reflect the results of legacy Cabot for this reporting period. However, my comments will include k",635,"Thanks, Tom. As you mentioned, given the merger closed in the beginning of the fourth quarter, the reported third quarter financials for Coterra Energy only reflect the results of legacy Cabot for this reporting period. However, my comments will include key items for legacy Cimarex also. 
I would specifically like to draw attention to the following financial and operational highlights for the third quarter. Legacy Cabot generated discretionary cash flow of $309 million in the quarter, including merger-related expenses, which was driven by a 69% increase in realized natural gas prices compared to the same quarter a year ago. Looking ahead, realized natural gas prices are anticipated to increase substantially in the fourth quarter of '21, driven by the expectation for the highest average quarterly NYMEX price we have experienced since the fourth quarter of 2008. 
The combined Cabot and Cimarex free cash flow for the quarter totaled $387 million, which also included merger-related cost of $100 million. Legacy Cabot's production for the third quarter was 2.36 billion cubic feet per day, which was 2% above the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. Legacy Cimarex production for the quarter was 251,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 81,500 barrels per day of oil production. 
Legacy Cabot incurred a total of $171 million of capital expenditures in the third quarter while legacy Cimarex incurred $165 million of capital expenditures in the third quarter, excluding capitalized expenses. I would also note that moving forward, Coterra will be reporting under the successful efforts accounting method that legacy Cabot utilized, which does not capitalize G&A and interest expenses. 
During the third quarter, legacy Cabot repaid $100 million of senior notes that matured in September, reducing our principal long-term debt to $949 million. On a combined basis, Coterra exited the third quarter with a cash balance of $1.1 billion and principal long-term debt of $2.9 billion before adjustments for purchase accounting. 
Our strong balance sheet provides significant financial flexibility and allows for industry-leading capital returns through the cycles as evidenced by the special dividend we made -- paid, excuse me, in October and the acceleration of our variable dividend that was announced in this morning's release. 
Now a few comments on guidance. Our fourth quarter '21 combined production and expense guidance assumes that we achieve results that meet our previously issued stand-alone annual guidance. Of note, we are reaffirming our fourth quarter oil guidance, which assumes 30% year-over-year growth, as Tom highlighted earlier. 
Our full year '21 combined capital is expected to be at the high end of the ranges due to increased efficiencies and an accelerate -- an acceleration of completions in late fourth quarter. Obviously, due to the timing of these actions, the increase in capital is expected to have no effect on '21 production volumes but will benefit '22 volumes, taking advantage of the strong commodity price environment we find ourselves in. 
In the Permian, we are maintaining a second crew during fourth quarter '21 to complete our Lea County project versus our original annual guidance midpoint, which assumed we would drop to 1 crew in the fourth quarter. 
In Appalachia, we plan to drill an additional 4 wells and complete an additional 7 wells during 2021. These completions are set to come online near year-end. 
During the first quarter of '22, we plan to maintain 2 completion crews in the Permian and average just over 1 completion crew in the Marcellus. We plan to issue formal '22 guidance early next year. 
The combined financial strength and free cash flow generation potential of Coterra that was originally envisioned when contemplating this combination is illustrated in these results and has been further supported by the tailwinds from the improving commodity price backdrop. 
With that, Matt, I will turn it over to you for Q&A."

I fundamentally believe that the only competitive advantage a company has in the long run is its culture and the quality of its people, and I have been wholly impressed with the Coterra organization from top to bottom. We have people that are energized, really talented, willing to look at problems anew and they bring an absolute commitment that's humbling to me in leading this organization. 
I've made 2 trips to the field in Pennsylvania, and I have been nothing sort of blown away by the quality of that operation and the dedication of our organization to work with the local community in providing this absolutely necessary resource in a way that is, I think, community friendly.

Obviously, we've seen a pretty big uptick in the forward curve over the last couple of months, which we think will certainly be beneficiary for Coterra going forward given the lack of hedging in place right now for 2022. 
If you kind of look at the U.S. storage levels currently, we're about 10% below last year's levels and about 4% to 5% below the 5-year averages. And more specifically to where legacy Cabot operates in the Marcellus, we see similar trends in both the Eastern and Midwest storage levels. So both for the broader NYMEX benchmark, but as well as local basis, we feel really strong about where we sit entering the winter months and certainly going into 2022."

But Tom, myself and Jeff Hutton, our legacy marketing person, will be part of the hedge committee going forward. As you saw in the release this morning or in the investor deck, we did add some Cabot hedges around the time of the transaction as we saw the -- and followed the path of kind of wide collars. And I think that's still a great approach. 
But we'll be -- the positive on the market that's out in front of us that Matt talked about is we have the ability to be very offensive in terms of -- on our front foot around the hedge decision versus being in a defensive posture, trying to protect things. 
The other dynamic I would add, and Tom and I had a conversation probably a month ago is the fact that Coterra also changes that hedge decision from the perspective of its balance sheet and its overall financial wherewithal that there isn't as much when we were separate organizations, the need to hedge as much, but we will still use it opportunistically."

We're going to model it. I'll just say there's going to be one word that will guide us into 2022, and that's discipline.

We also have to think strategically about it because historically, when prices are good, your values are up even if you're at a discount from your peers. When the prices move down, then all of a sudden you bought shares at a higher price. All you got to do is look at the average cost of the legacy balance sheet of Cabot as to what that intrinsic value of the shares on the balance sheet. 
So it's also part of the economic decision. To the question -- the rhetorical question, no answer required is, do you kind of leave that cash on the balance sheet and take advantage of that buyback in more lean times than where we find ourselves today?

There's kind of 3 major areas: Lone Rock being one; the up dip kind of near the merge classically is another; and then we've got a really nice opportunity on our Western fringe. All of those are highly competitive for capital. 
You asked about inventory. Our team has done a nice job of presenting a really healthy inventory of mile 3-mile horizontal well opportunities. There'll be a slice of that in 2022. I don't, at this point, can't telegraph how big a slice. But I'll say it offers tremendous flexibility from a capital allocation standpoint to have that third basin that has competitive returns. Because, as you know, from time to time, there have been market constraints, both in Appalachia and in the Permian, and having that third highly profitable area is a tremendous safety valve that we offer our owners.

So I think let us kind of get together and figure out and look out in the next couple of years, but I would suspect a portion of that $1.3 billion will be paid back and a portion will be refinanced. I don't think -- nobody is looking to go to 0 debt in the organization. But maybe my gut and Tom and I, in fairness, have not talked about this, but a target level of absolute debt around $2 billion versus $3 billion kind of feels like it's in the sweet spot."

But we have a project going on right now that's flowing back, where we have drilled 9 wells in the Upper Wolfcamp and next door is an operator we really respect that's drilled 12. As we analyze those 2 projects, our volumes are right on top of theirs because the geology is the same, the pressure is the same, the phase and the reservoir is the same. And we are recovering an equivalent amount of oil on our project compared to our neighbor's. 
When we analyze our neighbor's project, we think it's a 100% rate of return. So if that's all you had were the wells you drilled and the volumes you flowed back, you would have a victory party and you'd celebrate 100% rate of return. Our returns are significantly higher than that 100%. And if we didn't have the well level detail, we would have missed that.

Legacy Cabot had a base dividend increase in the spring of 2021. And then on announcement in May, there was a second dividend increase going from the $0.11 to the $0.125 that was memorialized right now in this first Coterra dividend that was announced. 
We're firm believers in a plan to rationally grow the base dividend over time. But with having just done 2 and knowing that we're in a very robust commodity price environment, let's kind of see how this shakes out because we do, as you pointed out, have the ability to continue to return with the variable dividend structure that we put in place. And let me add on that. Remember, the legacy Cabot 1 was once a year that Coterra, because of the financial wherewithal, is going to do that assessment every single quarter, which gets dividends back in the hands of shareholders quicker. 
And so again, we're all in favor of growing the base dividend, but in a methodical way. You'll remember I said in my history, I'm all for it. And I never want to get too far over our skis where we would ever have to ratchet it back. And in this legal enterprise in 31 years of paying a dividend has never had to call that audible or even reduce it, and we want to continue to build from that point."

You had some discussion of cost inflation, and it sounds like you anticipate being able to use operational efficiencies to offset some of that going forward. I just wonder, does that play into your thinking at all around whether strategically Coterra or the industry broader is going to need to inch back towards thinking more about scale. The focus has been so much on efficiency, maintenance drilling. But if there is steady cost inflation, at some point, it seems that the thinking does start to head more over towards perhaps operations over a narrower set of basins or just other things that lead you to sort of maximize the potential for scale."

If you can get 2 or 3-mile laterals, there's tremendous cost savings there. So aggregating your land to be able to do that is critically important. And then in aggregation, so you can most efficiently deploy your infrastructure dollars both gas gathering and compression, saltwater disposal and oil gathering is also important. 
I think beyond that, certainly, procurement is an important scale topic. But quite frankly, I think scale can be overblown. I think once you've checked those boxes and you have a really great operational team that you're down to very small differences between certainly huge companies and scrappy little companies. If scale alone were the answer, I think the majors would have the lowest cost structure in our business. And clearly, that's not the case. 
And so I think scale is important. But it's important to a point. In each of our 3 basins, we have the opportunity to have the lowest cost structure, and that's our challenge. We don't use scale as an excuse. We think we've got what we need to deliver lowest cost. 
Now I want to say one other thing. Our vendors are our partners and they need to make significant living as well. They need to show up with well-maintained equipment, a commitment to safety and well-trained crews. And so we understand some of this inflation is an inevitable outcome of good partnerships. And so of course, we're going to complain like crazy, but we're also going to be supportive of our vendors."
