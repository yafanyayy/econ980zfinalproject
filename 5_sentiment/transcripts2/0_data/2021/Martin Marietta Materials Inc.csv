We sincerely hope that you and your families remain safe and healthy. By all accounts, 2020 was extraordinary for Martin Marietta. We're proud to have extended our long track record",703,"Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. We sincerely hope that you and your families remain safe and healthy. By all accounts, 2020 was extraordinary for Martin Marietta. We're proud to have extended our long track record of financial, operational and safety excellence, particularly in a year filled with unprecedented disruption. Martin Marietta set new performance records, delivering our most profitable year and the best safety performance in our company's history. These impressive results demonstrate our resilient business model and our team's commitment to Martin Marietta's vision and successful execution of our proven strategic operating analysis and review or store plan. 
As noted, today's discussion focuses on our full year results and 2021 outlook. Before doing so, I'll highlight a few notable takeaways from our record-setting fourth quarter. Importantly, we achieved solid shipment and pricing growth across all product lines as construction activity stabilized from the spring and summer months when we saw a greater impact from COVID-19. These top line improvements, along with our steadfast focus on cost controls, resulted in 7% growth in consolidated total revenues; 20% growth in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA; and a 40% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
For the full year, we established new records for products and services revenues, profitability and adjusted EBITDA. Specifically, full year consolidated products and services revenues increased to $4.4 billion. Consolidated gross profit increased 6% to $1.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% to nearly $1.4 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $11.54, an 18% improvement. Martin Marietta's 2020 results marked the ninth consecutive year of growth in these financial metrics. 
Operating our business safely sets the foundation for our long-standing financial success. Martin Marietta's industry-leading safety performance continues to trend near or exceed world-class safety levels. We achieved a 25% reduction in total reportable incidents across the enterprise in 2020, and for the fourth consecutive year, we achieved a company-wide world-class lost time incident rate. 
These superior financial and safety results are directly attributable to the dedication and agility of our nearly 9,000 talented employees. I'm extraordinarily proud of how our team managed the challenges and disruptions caused by the pandemic, while remaining focused on being good wingmen, working safely and efficiently together and seamlessly meeting our diverse stakeholders' needs. With that overview, let's now turn to our full year operating performance. 
Aggregate shipments declined 2% to nearly 187 million tons, reflecting anticipated lower infrastructure shipments in portions of North Carolina, reduced energy sector demand and headwinds from COVID-19 disruptions. However, in line with broader macroeconomic trends, full year aggregate shipments to the residential market increased, benefiting from healthy single-family housing activity. Aggregates average selling price increased 4% on a mix adjusted basis, in line with our expectations. Importantly, all divisions contributed to this solid growth, a testament to this product line's resilient pricing power and our leading market positions in attractive geographies. The disciplined execution of our locally driven pricing strategy, along with attractive underlying market fundamentals will continue to support sustainable pricing growth moving forward. 
Our cement operations established new records for shipments, which increased 2% to nearly 4 million tons. Large project activity supported underlying product demand in both North and South Texas throughout the year, offsetting weakness in the energy sector. Pricing increased 3% on a mix adjusted basis, demonstrating the resilient price fundamentals of core products in the state of Texas. We expect our cement business will continue to benefit from favorable shipment and pricing trends, supported by tight supply and healthy demand in Texas, diversified customer backlogs and April 2021 price increases. 
Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready-mixed concrete shipments increased 3%, excluding shipments from acquired operations and from our Southwest division's former concrete business in Arkansas, Louisiana and Eastern Texas, which we divested in January 2020. Concrete pricing increased 2%. 
Our Colorado asphalt and paving business established a new record for asphalt shipments, increasing 15% to 3 million tons. This growth reflected solid underlying product demand together with carryover work following a weather challenged 2019. Asphalt pricing increased nearly 3%. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our full year financial results and liquidity. Jim?"
31153,701866424,2200653,"Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. We concluded 2020 with the highest full year adjusted EBITDA margin in Martin Marietta's history.

We concluded 2020 with the highest full year adjusted EBITDA margin in Martin Marietta's history. Driving this achievement was our Building Materials business, which delivered record products and services revenues of $4.2 billion, a 1% increase, and record product gross profit of $1.2 billion, a 7% increase. Our Upstream Materials businesses, namely, aggregates and cement, established all-time records for both full year product revenues and gross profit. Aggregates product gross margin expanded 130 basis points to 30.6%, a new record, and unit profitability improved 8%. These accomplishments, which resulted from strong pricing gains, disciplined cost management and lower diesel fuel costs demonstrate the cost flexibility and resiliency of our aggregates-led business. 
The Cement business benefited from the planned kiln maintenance outage that occurred through the end of 2019. The timing of that outage resulted in some expenses being recognized in 2019 versus early in 2020. More importantly, that and other capital investments have dramatically improved our cement operations. We achieved 90% kiln reliability this year, up from 82% in 2019, which facilitated increased throughput and fixed cost absorption at both our Midlothian and Hunter plants. These factors, combined with mix adjusted pricing strength and lower fuel costs contributed to the 510 basis point improvement in Cement product gross margin to 37.8%. 
Our targeted downstream businesses also delivered solid full year financial results. Ready-Mixed concrete product gross margin increased 10 basis points to 8.4% as pricing growth offset higher raw material costs. Asphalt and paving achieved gross profit of $60 million and a 100 basis point improvement in gross margin, driven by double-digit revenue growth. Our Magnesia Specialties business returned to revenue and profitability growth during the fourth quarter. The 12% top line improvement in the quarter, however, was not enough to offset demand declines experienced earlier in the year. As a result, full year product revenues decreased 12% to $221 million. We anticipate fourth quarter strength in line with chemicals demand to continue in 2021, now that steel utilization has rebounded from last summer's COVID-19-driven trough and our cobalt customers are resuming activity. Impressively, product gross margin improved 80 basis points to 40.6% as we proactively responded to lower shipments with effective cost control measures. 
Turning now to cash generation, capital allocation and liquidity. Martin Marietta ended 2020 with the strongest cash generation in our history. Operating cash flow of $1.05 billion increased 9%, driven by earnings growth. We continue to balance our long-standing disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and preserving financial flexibility to further enhance shareholder value. Our priorities remain focused on value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the consistent return of capital to shareholders while maintaining our investment-grade rating profile. 
For 2020, we invested $360 million of capital into our business and returned $190 million to shareholders through both an increased dividend and the first quarter repurchase of 211,000 shares of our common stock. In August 2020, our Board approved a 4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, underscoring its continued confidence in our future performance and continuing Martin Marietta's track record of dividend growth. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned more than $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. 
We ended 2020 with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.9x, slightly below our target leverage range of 2 to 2.5x, which offers us the flexibility to pursue accretive investment opportunities. Our solid balance sheet, combined with $1.1 billion of availability on our credit facilities, provides the financial strength from Martin Marietta to respond and to execute on disciplined capital allocation priorities and continue profitably growing our business. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward to discuss our 2021 outlook."
31153,701866424,2200653,"Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Looking ahead, we believe 2021 will be a year in which we see a return to a more normalized state as underlying demand fundamentals reset and the nation's economy regains momentum. We remain confident in Martin Marietta's attractive business",989,"Thanks, Jim. Looking ahead, we believe 2021 will be a year in which we see a return to a more normalized state as underlying demand fundamentals reset and the nation's economy regains momentum. We remain confident in Martin Marietta's attractive business drivers and are encouraged by accelerating long-term secular trends across our 3 primary end-use markets and key geographies. We expect these trends to drive construction-led aggregates intensive growth. 
Infrastructure activity, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways, roads and streets, continues to prove resilient. With the 1-year extension of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, or FAST Act, at current funding levels, state and local governments have the visibility needed to plan, design and award transportation projects through the 2021 construction season. Importantly, estimated fiscal 2021 lettings for our top 5 departments of transportation, or DOTs, are currently above or near prior year levels. Keep in mind, our top 5 states: Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, are disproportionately important to us, representing 71% of our 2020 Building Materials business total revenues. 
Additionally, DOTs were recently granted nearly $10 billion of targeted relief as part of the Coronavirus Response and Relief Act passed in December 2020 to help offset pandemic-driven transportation revenue shortfalls. This funding assistance has the benefit of no state matching requirements. Based on preliminary estimates, over $2 billion of this assistance will be apportioned to Martin Marietta's top 5 states. 
Over the medium to long term, we anticipate voter-approved state and local transportation measures and passage of a comprehensive federal transportation program package to promote multiyear growth in product demand. In November 2020, voters sent a powerful message of support for state and local transportation investment approving 94% of ballot measures, the highest ever approval rating. These initiatives are estimated to generate an additional $14 billion in onetime and recurring transportation funding, of which 82% is in Texas, our top revenue-generating state. 
Bipartisan support exists for new surface transportation legislation aimed at increasing funding levels not seen in over 15 years, with both the United States House of Representatives and Senate previously advancing proposed bills. We believe this 117th Congress creates a path toward advancing a notable increase in funding over the FAST Act. We're optimistic that agreement on a new bill could be reached this summer, generating meaningful benefits in 2022 and beyond. 
We expect increased infrastructure investment to provide volume stability and drive aggregate shipments in that end-use closer to our 10-year historical average of 43% of our total shipments. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 36% of 2020 shipments. 
Nonresidential construction should continue to benefit from accelerating e-commerce and remote work trends that require increased investment in heavy industrial warehouses and data centers, particularly in our key metros of Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin, Denver, Des Moines, Indianapolis, Charlotte and Atlanta. Importantly, this type of construction tends to be more aggregates-intensive than light commercial construction due to the size, scale and structure of these projects. Light commercial and retail construction will remain comparatively challenged until COVID-19 vaccines are more widely distributed. Over the longer term, light nonresidential activity will benefit from the attractive collateral effects of strong single-family residential trends. Aggregate shipments to the nonresidential market accounted for 34% of 2020 shipments. 
Single-family housing is poised for multiyear growth returning to more normalized levels during this economic cycle. We believe Martin Marietta's leading southeastern and southwestern footprint positions the company to be a notable beneficiary of these trends given underbuilt conditions, favorable population and employment dynamics, land availability, mild climates and lower cost of living in these regions. Single-family housing is 2 to 3x where aggregates-intensive than multifamily construction, given the ancillary nonresidential and infrastructure needs of new suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 24% of 2020 shipments. 
In summary, we're confident in the fundamental strength and underlying drivers of our business. As disclosed in today's release, we've returned to providing full year annual guidance. We currently expect 2021 aggregate shipment growth to range from up 1% to up 4%, reflecting single-family housing strength, expanded infrastructure investment and heavy industrial projects of scale that will support our near-term shipment levels. We remain confident that our favorable pricing trends are sustainable, supported by improved contractor confidence and healthy customer backlogs. 
For 2021, we expect annual aggregates price increases, which become effective from January 1 to April 1, to increase in a range of up 3% to up 5%. Combined with contributions from our Cement, Downstream and Magnesia Specialties businesses, on a consolidated basis, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion. Keep in mind, when comparing this guidance range to prior year, we're not anticipating the same level of nonrecurring gains from land sales and divested surplus assets as seen in 2020. 
To conclude, we're proud of our 2020 record financial results and industry-leading safety performance. We're also extremely optimistic about our future. Martin Marietta has a strong foundation, thanks to our solid balance sheet and the investments we've made in our assets, people and capabilities. Due to our work over the last several years, Martin Marietta is uniquely well positioned to capitalize on the emerging growth trends that are expected to support steady and sustainable construction activity over the long term. 
Importantly, the disciplined execution of our strategic plan, coupled with our pricing discipline, operational excellence, prudent capital allocation and adherence to robust health protocols will continue to enhance Martin Marietta's solid foundation for enduring success. As we move forward, we have the resources, team and capabilities to drive value-enhancing growth. We're confident in Martin Marietta's opportunities to build on our successful track record of strong financial, operational and safety performance and remain focused on delivering superior returns for investors while meeting and exceeding our commitments to our other stakeholders, including our customers, employees and communities.

We'll walk through it. And let's talk about cement and pricing first. Number one, to see the cement price performance in Texas this year was actually affirming. If we go back over time and remember",586,"Well, Happy New Year to you, Kathryn, that's a mouthful. We'll walk through it. And let's talk about cement and pricing first. Number one, to see the cement price performance in Texas this year was actually affirming. If we go back over time and remember how we spoke about cement when we acquired it with TXI. We indicated we believe Texas cement pricing would start to act like aggregate pricing. That's exactly what we saw in this quarter. What I think is doubly important about that and impressive, keep in mind, for much of the year, we were not in a position to go and see our customers. So to see that type of performance on a mix adjusted basis is actually quite impressive. Keep in mind too, although you don't see it in the numbers, if we're looking at type 1 and type 2 cement, that was actually selling for closer to 4% up as opposed to 3% up. So if we're really looking at the bread-and-butter products, it looks really quite impressive. If we look at overall cement dynamics in the state, Texas is a nice place to be in any heavy side building materials business. Because particularly for cement right now, demand outstrips supply, and that's always a good place to start. We think that's particularly going to be the case as we go through the year in North Texas this year. So again, that feeds directly into our operations in Midlothian. Equally, the marketplace that we're seeing around Hunter is actually quite attractive as well. What we see from a volume perspective has been driven by a series of things. One, by some big jobs. So in the north, we're seeing Loop 12. We're seeing I 635, which is also known as the LPG. If you go down towards South Texas, what's going on relative to the Grand Parkway has been nicely generative or utilizing cement and ready-mix and aggregates and all the way through. So we think the outlook is frankly as good as we just saw in Q4. 
If you're looking really more to what potential air pockets could be, I'll tell you very candidly, in Texas, we don't see it, Kathryn. A couple of things lead me to believe that one, the FY '21 lettings in Texas are actually 25% over where they were last year. In other words, we're looking for about $9.5 billion worth of lettings. The other 2 pieces to keep in mind is the 2021 revenue streams that we're seeing either coming through Prop 7 and Prop 1 in Texas are really quite healthy. So we're looking at transfers of about $2.5 billion this year relative to Prop 7 and about $1.2 billion relative to Prop 1. Something else that's worth keeping in mind, too, is when we were looking at the COVID relief that's called different DOTs, Texas was the recipient of almost $914 million. Again, we spoke to the fact that those have not come encumbered with any particular state match. So for a state that already found itself in a very good position to have that extra money come in as well gives us a sense that we're in a very, very good place. As an ultimate reminder, Texas has rained a fund of $10.5 billion that they have not tapped. So as we're looking at Texas, both near term, medium-term and long term, we like very much what we see. So I hope that's responsive to your series of questions, Kathryn."

And also, it appear that maybe there's limited operating leverage in that guidance as well. I'm just wondering if that's maybe some of the kiln expenses from 2020 that got pulled into 2019 if those come back and maybe that's way you leave on the leverage. And just if I could also add to that, you must be feeling some pinch points in terms of capacity in cement at this point. And I'm just wondering how you're thinking longer term about your capacity footprint. Do you flex your shipments with import tons? Or do you invest capital either organically or through acquisitions in building your capacity? Or maybe you're just happy with what you've got. If you could talk about that."

Thank you very much for your questions. We'll start with respect to pricing. So as we think about pricing in the Texas marketplace today, what we're seeing are price increases out there that have been put out. We put out a $9 a ton price increase effective in April. We've seen others that customers have shown us that have been closer to $6. So I think that gives you at least some boies to think about relative to pricing for the year. I think equally, as we look at the likelihood of price increases hitting in different percentages, clearly, North Texas is going to look stronger than South Texas is. Central is going to be just fine. I think to your point, if it's going to be tight anywhere this year on cement tonnage, it's likely more in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, meaning Midlothian. And so we'll just have to watch that as the year goes on. One thing I would ask you to do is, and that is you asked a very good question around capacity in Texas because you're going back to the notion that right now, demand is outstripping supply. As you know, we have an analyst and Investor Day that's coming up later this month. We're going to talk about some of the very specific capital initiatives that we have underway. And I would ask you to wait and listen to what we have to say about that particular process when we're talking to you live later in the month relative to our cement outlook and our aggregates outlook in Texas. 
With respect to some of the other numbers that you mentioned, you're entirely right relative to rhythm and cadence around kiln maintenance. We did have a relatively lower number of kiln maintenance in 2020. If we're looking at the overall kiln maintenance spend in 2020, it was about $19.7 million. As we're looking to see what it's going to be into the new year, we are looking at a number that's going to be somewhat higher than that. We're looking more at about a $22.7 million number for total kiln maintenance in '21. And so we're looking at some of those puts and takes. But I think that gives you a sense of do we have capacity issues that we need to think about longer and medium term? Yes, we do. Are we in a circumstance that pricing is doing what we thought it would? It absolutely is. Are the dollars that we've put into the kilns having them run at a higher rate of efficiency? There's no doubt that they are. So if we're looking at kiln reliability, as Jim commented in his commentary, they ran at 90% kiln reliability in the year just ended. The year before, it's at 82%. So we like very much the way that business is going operationally, the way that business is going commercially and what we feel like its future is. So David, I hope that was responsive to your question."

As you indicated, we've walked through what some of the numbers look like in Texas. As Jim indicated in his prepared remarks, if we look at Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, those states comprise around 71% of our revenue. So if those states are going well, a lot of things good happens for Martin Marietta. As I indicated, I won't go back through all the details that we hit, but we're looking at Texas lettings up 25%. Let's go through the others and I think that will give you a sense of why we've got the degree of confidence that we do. Colorado, which, as you know, in '20 had just a spectacular year. I mean, you heard us reference the fact that our asphalt and paving business in that state had a record year. We're looking at a DOT program in Colorado that we believe is going to be flat year-over-year. And what I'm about to tell you is when we're looking at our top 5 states, yet the worst that we're seeing anywhere is flat, that's not a bad place to be coming off of a record year. So if we're looking at the $10 billion COVID stimulus, about $134 million of those dollars is finding its way to Colorado, which we believe is to bring their DOT program up about even with where it was last year.  
Now by contrast, our home state, North Carolina, did not have a particularly good year. Last year. We think North Carolina DOT is in a far better position. And as you know, if we look at this state, historically, it has not only been one of our most profitable. It's been one of our most consistent as well. So we think North Carolina is trending back into an area that makes much more sense for us. To give you a sense of what that means, the FY '21 lettings projection is about $1.3 billion. That's $670 million better than I think people would have expected when they were looking at it last year. The other thing that's important to keep in mind is North Carolina did issue $700 million of build in C bonds. So again, as we're looking at the near-term future of North Carolina, we're really very pleased with that.  One thing I will mention as well, the NC First Commission, which I was a part of here in North Carolina, looked at really how North Carolina needs to think about its investment in infrastructure over the next 10 years. And our view was they needed to put at least $20 billion more in infrastructure in the state. So the state is looking at ways to do that. But that's clearly longer term than just this year. 
If we go to Georgia, again, we think Georgia is relatively flat year-over-year. But if you look at where that state has been sequentially, if we go back to 2016, you'll see a budget that's gone from about $1.7 billion to one that's about $2.1 billion. And then the other thing to keep in mind is Georgia still has ahead of it the major mobility investment program. And the overall goal of that is to have a number of very large projects, about $12 billion to be more specific, underway by 2025 and completed by 2030. 
And then, of course, the last of the top 5 states is Florida, they're looking at their spending to increase about 20% year-over-year. So again, if we look at the top 5, Texas is better. North Carolina is better. Florida is better and Colorado and Georgia are broadly flat. So when we look at that type of trajectory on something that's around 71% of our revenues in those states, I think that's part of what gives us the confidence that we have and the volume outlook that we've offered today."

I think we've got a good sense of what public is going to look like, and we think public is going to look better. And I think we have a good sense of what residential is going to look like, and residential is going to look better. And residential is particularly going to look better with respect to single-family. We believe single-family as a percentage of overall housing will return to more normalized percentages. In other words, it's going to be about 80% of  housing in the United States. And when we see single-family housing at 1 million starts or 1.1 million or 1.2 million, I will tell you, that's a pretty healthy place for our business. Because here's what happens. That's evidence of new neighborhoods being built. And so if you think about 2 cities that are important to us, think about Atlanta and think about Dallas, both tend to be north-south cities, both tend to be growing more north than south. So what that means is, years ago, you were growing north from Dallas to Plano, now you're growing from Dallas to Frisco and now you're going to be moving north from Frisco to North of Frisco. As we see new communities come in Brisco or as they go into Alpharetta or other places north of Atlanta, new communities need the follow-on effect that you get in nonresidential. Now history tells us, depending on geography, that can have a 6 to, let's call it, an 18-month lag behind it. If we're seeing single-family growth in communities and you've got a 6-month lag on that, that can start pushing you toward the higher end of our volume guidance. Because if we think about the different end uses, res infrastructure is going to be better. Residential is going to be better, particularly single-family. As we land on non res, as we said comparatively the toughest of the 3 end users, the heavy side of that, we believe, is going to be good with warehousing, data, et cetera, all of which are very aggregates-intensive. So some of the swing side to the upper end of that is going to be relative to the drag along effect of the light portion of nonres that we believe will follow continued single-family growth. So that was a mouthful. And I apologize if that was a mouthful, but I hope that was followable."

What I would say is, if you look at what M&A has done for Martin Marietta through the store years, and by that, I mean, from 2010 today. M&A has been our preferred methodology growth. It has served us and our owners well. We think it will continue to serve us well. When we think about M&A, we think about it in a long-term strategic view. At the same time, we're not going to go into transactions that we know are not going to be near term attractive deals for SEDAR. In fairness, typically, we're not going to take tax rates much into account in the way that we're looking at M&A.. Because we feel like getting the right deal in the right market is the most important thing that we can do for our company near term and long term. It allows our teams to grow. It allows our company to grow. It lets us grow into markets that we think will be attractive, and at the end of the day, where we believe we can have leading positions. As you'll recall, we have a leading position in 90% of our markets today. 10 years ago, we had a leading position in 65% of our markets. We're going to be looking at M&A through 2 different lenses. We're going to be looking at it in bolt-on acquisitions in markets that we currently exist. But equally, we will look at potential platform acquisitions in markets in which we would like to grow. As a reminder, and we've not been shy about this, we've long talked about the 2050 regional planning that shows what growth is going to look like in the United States between now and 2050. And the short answer is the country is going to add about 140 million people over that time period, and 70% of them will land in 1 of 11 mega regions. And so if you watch the mega regions and see what -- where they are. If you look at our footprint, the likelihood is we will continue to want to be focused in those mega regions, either with bolt-ons or with platforms. Relative to our M&A pipeline and our team, they would like to sleep more. But the short answer is they're very busy people right now. They are very talented people. And we're very grateful for them. And our intention is to do all that we can to keep them tired and hungry."

Experience tells me that contractors are finishing a year in which they don't have good confidence in the next year. Rather than hurry up, they tend to slow down because they want to make sure that they have plenty of work for their workforces as they come into a new year. What I would say too is, I think that's certainly possible, Nishchal. But I equally think what we're seeing, particularly relative to single-family housing and what's tending to follow it.

What I would say is the customer backlogs are looking fairly similar in many respects to where they were last year. One thing that's worth remembering is the backlogs really, at this time of the year for customers, only represent about 20% to 35% what people really think their shipment needs are going to be. But what I would say is overall aggregate tons are modestly up as we talk to our customers right now. If we look at cement tons, they're actually up double digits right now. If we look at magnesia specialties, they're actually up double digits as well. So I think part of what's important to remember, Phil, is we're going into '21, 2 parts of our business that have historically been very good, steady parts of our business, meaning North Carolina in Magnesia Specialties did not have the best years in '20 and are both looking at considerably better years coming into the year in '21. So as we're looking at overall backlogs, they look really quite good for us. The only area that our backlogs are notably off would be in portions of Colorado. And what we're seeing in Colorado, and I think this goes back to your question, is actually right now a very good level of bidding activity in that state. So as we mentioned, we're coming off what was a record year last year in Colorado. And we anticipate it coming into '21, that would almost have to be modestly slower. As I indicated in some of the earlier questions, with some of the COVID money that is coming to Colorado, DOT numbers are broadly even, and now we're seeing much better fitting activity. So I guess what I have to say on that, Phil, is more to come. But I try to give you what we feel like is a good March across the enterprise to give you a sense of where we think customer backlogs are."

If I think about end uses, here's the way I would think about it. I'd rather just talk about from a 4-year perspective, Courtney, because I think that's probably a more directionally appropriate way to look at, at least from my seat in the bus. Infrastructure ended up last year to about 36% for us. Non-res was tight for infrastructure at 36%, and residential was at 24%. So that gives you a pretty good snapshot of what volumes look like for the year. What I would tell you is, I think 36% for infrastructure is awfully low. That said, an end-use that ought to be in the low to mid-40s. I certainly believe with what we're starting to see from our leading states right now, and again, we've not built in a long-term highway bill into anything that we're talking about relative to '21. But if our states continue investing the way that they are and we see a long-term bill come through from the federal government, we think that 36% moves up toward the 40% number and maybe even ahead of that, that would feel more logical to us. If we look at nonres at 36%, that's an odd one to me, and I'll tell you why. Historically, if we looked at non-res, it would have been very consistent at about 30% of our volume. And that would have historically been a pretty clear defining break with non-res light being about half of that and non-res heavy being about half of that overall 30%. Year just ended, it was 36%. But here's what's happened. Clearly, the light portion of nonres has gone down, the heavy portion of non-res has gone up. But the irony is the heavy portion of non-res is really heavy right now. So what we're seeing is in data warehousing and the other delivery products that we're having, the sheer aggregates intensity of heavy non-res is richer than we've ever seen before. That is actually serving to fill, in large measure, the tonnage hole that would otherwise be left when we look at what's happened to hospitality, retail, et cetera. So that gives you a sense of where that is. Now residential last year at 24% is a relatively high number. That's probably the highest single res number that we've ever seen. To give you a sense of what it looked like, at absolute May dear is about 7%. And now what's happening is we're seeing res at 24% of our volume, but we're not seeing residential starts at a particularly high level, at least relative to a 50-year snapshot of it. What I think is most telling is back to the portion of the dialogue that we had before relative to what's happening with single-family residential within the overall residential snapshot. In the recovery that ended with COVID's arrival, single-family housing was about 67% of overall housing activity. If we look at what a 20-, 30-year averages, it tends to be closer to 80%. That's what we're starting to see today. So again, as we think about what end uses look like on a percentage basis for '20 and the way that we think they're trending for '21, again, infrastructure, 36% in '20; non res, 36%; res, 24%. As we move into '21, should we see infrastructure move up? I think we probably should. Will we see non-res move around a little bit, but probably not huge numbers, probably so. Do we think res will be pretty consistent? The answer is yes. I also think it's worth noting that the railroads have said that they intend to be back to relatively normal levels of maintenance and repair as we come into the year. That's important because the ChemRock/Rail portion of our business, which covers not only the rail portion but what we sell to farmers as agricultural line in the Midwestern United States can be 8%, 9%, 10% portion of our business. As agricultural prices have continued to get better, our outlook for ag line, I think, will continue to improve. So Courtney, I threw a lot of data at you for the first time on the call. I apologize for that, but I hope that was helpful."

I mean to give you a sense of it, if we look at the COVID relief dollars all by themselves, out of the $10 billion, we're looking at $900 million, Texas; $134 million to Colorado; $260 million to North Carolina; Georgia is getting $323 million; Florida is getting $473 million; Iowa, $123 million; Indiana, $238 million; South Carolina, $167 million; Maryland, $150 million; and Nebraska, $72 million. So those are nice, big numbers going to those states. So if we look at what they're going to be able to do with that in '21, we think they're going to be able to put most of that to work. To the extent that we see a highway bill that is in some form of pass by the time we get, let's call it, toward half year. We believe you start seeing some degree of pull-through in that in '22. But we equally believe what you're going to see is a nice built from that in '22. And we believe that's going to give at least the single biggest, most consistent in use that we have a nice multiyear run. What I think can happen, Garik, is this notion of having perhaps infrastructure funding at levels that we haven't seen ever before and the nicest increase that we've seen in 15 years, together with what we feel like in our footprint is going to be a continued expansion in single-family housing. And then also following these corridors of commerce that we've so intentionally built our business around, we think it does set the industry generally up but we think it set Martin Marietta specifically up for what could be a very nice multiyear volume trend. So Garik, I hope that was helpful."

I guess what I would say, Adam, is it all depends on the ware. We're specifically driven by markets, what we think are attractive markets, the position that we would have in that market and what we think we can do with the business. So here's the way I would encourage you to think about that. When we swapped out of the River business, when we swapped out of a pure stone business and we swapped into a vertically integrated marketplace, we didn't do that on that day because we lost any conviction in aggregates. This is an aggregates-led company. So what you should always expect us to do, wherever we're looking at M&A is for it to be aggregates-led. That's the important thing to remember. But what I think you and I recognize is there are some markets in the United States that do tend to be vertically integrated. And if you want to be in an attractive market that's vertically integrated, you better be in a position that you have competencies around stone, and at times, ready-mix, and at times, hot mix asphalt. So would we consider it? Of course, we would consider it. But are we going to be very picky about the market? We will. And I think what you've seen from our track record is when we go and do that, what we've been able to do is add considerable shareholder value in the process."

It's good to hear your voice, and hope you're well in the U.K. Paul, I think if we look at where our downstream businesses are, that's what gives us the confidence in those. Keep in mind, we have downstream businesses in Colorado where we have ready-mix and we have asphalt, and we have downstream in Texas where we have ready-mix only. And I think what we're seeing is, particularly in Texas, a good amount of bidding not only on private work that's tied into residential but also in public work on some large projects. So as we look at what we believe is happening in that marketplace, even despite what can be some of the raw materials cost particularly on the energy side, I think we feel like that we can maintain those. Equally, if we look at our business in Colorado, that's really one of the better ready-mix markets in the United States. We see actually a pretty significant delta in read- mix pricing in Colorado versus what we see in ready-mix pricing in most of Texas. And again, the hot mix asphalt and paving business that we have in Colorado, I think, is really one of the better hot mix asphalt and pavement businesses in the United States. It's got very high barriers to entry in that marketplace. And part of what we're seeing in that marketplace, too, although we're not experiencing it, but others are, Paul, there are some depletion scenarios on stone that are underway in portions of the front range. Martin Marietta is not affected by that. We've got nice long-term reserve positions. But what we've done in that marketplace to one, have good long-term reserve positions. But number two, make sure we have a nicely spread out distribution system is what's going to allow us to maintain margins in those downstream businesses. At the same time, part of what you'll see, if you look at the downstream businesses, is the raw materials piece of it does appear to be going up. And in large measure, that's because we're selling ourselves some raw materials in those businesses. And we recognize that the value of aggregates is very valuable, and it's getting more valuable each year. And we're going to make sure that even when we're doing those internally, we're doing it in a very equitable fashion because we want to treat our internal customers and our external customers exactly the same way, Paul. So hopefully, that's helpful."

The fact is we haven't seen anything coming through right now that we feel like it's going to be widely disruptive to what we're doing. I don't think we're going to see considerably more ESG factors built into maybe not 1 big bill. I think you're going to see it built into most bills that come through. And by the way, we're perfectly okay with that. If you think of it from this perspective. One, a lot of it's going to be geared towards safety activities. You can see what our numbers are. We do that extraordinarily well. The other thing that I would tell you, you can go and look at the sustainability report that we put out, what you'll find out is that to the extent that we have greenhouse gases, we have 400 operations across the United States. Really, only 4 of them have any degree of notable GHG issues and that means 84% of our GHG issues come from 4 locations, which tell us that we've already set out really robust targets between now and 2030 on how we intend to deal with those, and we publish those annually. So as we're sitting here looking at what we feel like could be a higher regulatory market, we don't feel like we're seeing things right now that will be negatively impacting our business. Do I think it might make barriers to entry more difficult in our business, in the back, it may. Is that something to lament? I'll leave that to you. If you've got 90 years of reserves at current extraction rates, I'm not sure that's something that we're particularly concerned about today. 
The other thing that I will say is, to the extent that it increases costs, the simple fact is we can usually deal with that on the commercial side because we would typically see pricing going up. And the other thing that I would say is at least right now, our customer base is not complaining about a lack of available employees. What you remember, Stanley, is a couple of years ago, there's a trucking shortage. There was a labor shortage. Right now, we're not seeing that in our space. So logistics are working relatively well, and contractors are in a position that they can do what they need to with their projects day in and day out. So hopefully, that do tick off the items that you listed, Stanley?"

Thank you for the question. If you go across our footprint and you look at what cost of goods sold look like for us, the primary thing that you're going to see is the single biggest cost of goods sold that we have is labor. It's our employees. Then you're going to find a series of others that tend to be in the aggregates business around 12% to 15% of our COGS. That will be things like supplies, other inventories, what's happening with respect to maintenance and repair, et cetera. So if we go back over time and look at what we have done relative to our employee base, the way that we pay them, the tenure that they have, we don't see an inflation situation relative to wages that is anything that we're concerned about. With respect to maintenance and repair, what you'll see as well is if you go over let's call it the SOR years, you'll find that we've been very consistent with the way that we deployed capital in our business. What you'll see from that is the continuing thoughtful management of maintenance and repair. Now one thing that you will see that went up a bit last year is some degrees of DD&A. And DD&A was up in large measure due to what we have done to invest responsibly in the business. So the one item, and I'll ask Jim to speak to it very specifically, that we think could be a bit of a headwind this year is relative to energy and more specifically with respect to diesel fuel. Because clearly, we've seen that move around a little bit. Diesel fuel was a fairly notable tailwind for our company and for our industry all during 2020 that persisted into Q4. So I'll ask Jim to speak to that. The other thing I'll ask Jim to speak to is what we saw relative to the sale of some excess properties last year that will likely not repeat. So I think from an inflation perspective, that's going to talk you about energy, but I also want you modeling to be thinking about what we're not going to do or at least replicate relative to land sales."

That's the average price that was out there in 2019. So effectively, we're going back to that level of diesel pricing as far as we can tell. So that's already in the forecast, and frankly, that we're holding on to our margins from 2020 and slightly building on those. So we're content in that environment to maintain margins and then offset diesel pricing. As it relates to the land hill gains that Ward referred to, we had those very large gains in 2020, $70 million worth of gains. Those were hard fought and very much enjoy, but they are not going to be repeating this year. So as you model out your numbers, we just ask that you look at 2020 EBITDA as a core, maybe pull up as land sale gains and not build on those as repeating into 2021."

And several years ago, I remember, we we",528,"Happy to, Timna. So thank you so much for the question. It's good to hear your voice. Our capital priorities haven't changed, and that is the -- we feel like the best first on our spend is on the right transaction. And several years ago, I remember, we were coming into a year and we said that we thought it could be a year of some notable transactions for the industry. I think the prospect is this could be a year of some notable transactions. We've tried to have ourselves financially and regulatorily in a position that if large transactions or notable transactions or attractive ones came along, we would be in a place that we could play. So if we think about our best first dollar spent that's it. Next, we're looking at assuring that we're investing responsively in the business. And if you look at what we've been able to do through cycles relative to CapEx, and as Jim was just indicating, we think we have treated the business really quite well. And if we look at what that has allowed us to do relative to our cost performance, we think that we have been largely outperforming. And then third, to your point, and your very good question is, a return of cash to shareholders. And we've done that through 2 very different ways, Timna. Number one, we've had a meaningful and a sustainable dividend. And we think both of those words are really important. So one thing to keep in mind, I believe we're the only heavy signed building materials company who can say this, we've never cut a dividend. So the fact is we've been able to maintain a dividend all the way through cycles. And what's important is this company, even in August, when the world was faced with all the uncertainties from COVID-19, we raised our dividend by 4%. If you go back and look at where we were the year before that or the year before that, you'll find even bigger increases. So clearly, our Board is going to come back and look at the dividend in August. As you recall as well, when we bought TXI, we issued 20 million shares of stock to combine the companies together. Shortly after that, our Board took the view, okay, our shareholders were good enough to give us license to go and do this with a very high percentage shareholder vote. We're going to make sure over time, opportunistically, we come back and take that dilution back. And we've been on that journey. We've got about 15 million shares left in that authorization. We want to continue chipping away on that. But the conversations we've had with our shareholders have tended to be, if you have the ability to do the right deal, that's where we want you to be. And these are conversations that we're always very frontal with our shareholders because they're our owners at the end of the day. And we want to make sure that we're meeting their needs and their expectations. But that's the priorities. That's how we're looking at it, Timna. So again, I hope that's helpful."

Last year when most companies were withdrawing guidance, they were certainly encouraged to be forward-leaning and be even more forthcoming into what they might see in the coming months.

And our practice has always been, if we had guidance in place to make sure that we were really sticking very close within the 4 walls of the quarter in which we're addressing. So I'll talk a little bit -- well, I'll talk a lot more about January when we're together and we're reporting the full -- the quarter results.

The other business that performed extraordinarily well last year, and this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, is the business that we have in Maryland in the aftermath of the Bluegrass transaction. Again, Maryland got $150 million coming into that marketplace as well. So we've talked about how important Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida are, those are 1 through 5.

At the end of the day, we really don't want to see DOT having to move snow off roads in North Carolina. So I think it's a practical matter of seeing resurfacing projects go, seeing the $700 million from billed NC bonds and utilizing that and a much healthier bidding circumstance on top of the backlogs that we have make weathering what we've already done much better. And I think it does outline a much brighter 2021 and certainly 2022 and beyond in North Carolina. So we feel like we have been through the toughest period by far.

We sincerely hope that you and your families remain safe and healthy. By all accounts, 2020 was extraordinary for Martin Marietta. We're proud to have extended our long track record of financial, operational and safety excellence, particularly in a year filled with unprecedented disruption. Martin Marietta set new performance records, delivering our most profitable year and the best safety performance in our company's history. These impressive results demonstrate our resilient business model and our team's commitment to Martin Marietta's vision and successful execution of our proven strategic operating analysis and review or store plan. 
As noted, today's discussion focuses on our full year results and 2021 outlook. Before doing so, I'll highlight a few notable takeaways from our record-setting fourth quarter. Importantly, we achieved solid shipment and pricing growth across all product lines as construction activity stabilized from the spring and summer months when we saw a greater impact from COVID-19. These top line improvements, along with our steadfast focus on cost controls, resulted in 7% growth in consolidated total revenues; 20% growth in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA; and a 40% increase in diluted earnings per share. 
For the full year, we established new records for products and services revenues, profitability and adjusted EBITDA. Specifically, full year consolidated products and services revenues increased to $4.4 billion. Consolidated gross profit increased 6% to $1.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% to nearly $1.4 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $11.54, an 18% improvement. Martin Marietta's 2020 results marked the ninth consecutive year of growth in these financial metrics. 
Operating our business safely sets the foundation for our long-standing financial success. Martin Marietta's industry-leading safety performance continues to trend near or exceed world-class safety levels. We achieved a 25% reduction in total reportable incidents across the enterprise in 2020, and for the fourth consecutive year, we achieved a company-wide world-class lost time incident rate. 
These superior financial and safety results are directly attributable to the dedication and agility of our nearly 9,000 talented employees. I'm extraordinarily proud of how our team managed the challenges and disruptions caused by the pandemic, while remaining focused on being good wingmen, working safely and efficiently together and seamlessly meeting our diverse stakeholders' needs. With that overview, let's now turn to our full year operating performance. 
Aggregate shipments declined 2% to nearly 187 million tons, reflecting anticipated lower infrastructure shipments in portions of North Carolina, reduced energy sector demand and headwinds from COVID-19 disruptions. However, in line with broader macroeconomic trends, full year aggregate shipments to the residential market increased, benefiting from healthy single-family housing activity. Aggregates average selling price increased 4% on a mix adjusted basis, in line with our expectations. Importantly, all divisions contributed to this solid growth, a testament to this product line's resilient pricing power and our leading market positions in attractive geographies. The disciplined execution of our locally driven pricing strategy, along with attractive underlying market fundamentals will continue to support sustainable pricing growth moving forward. 
Our cement operations established new records for shipments, which increased 2% to nearly 4 million tons. Large project activity supported underlying product demand in both North and South Texas throughout the year, offsetting weakness in the energy sector. Pricing increased 3% on a mix adjusted basis, demonstrating the resilient price fundamentals of core products in the state of Texas. We expect our cement business will continue to benefit from favorable shipment and pricing trends, supported by tight supply and healthy demand in Texas, diversified customer backlogs and April 2021 price increases. 
Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready mixed concrete shipments increased 3%, excluding shipments from acquired operations and from our Southwest division's former concrete business in Arkansas, Louisiana and Eastern Texas, which we divested in January 2020. Concrete pricing increased 2%. 
Our Colorado asphalt and paving business established a new record for asphalt shipments, increasing 15% to 3 million tons. This growth reflected solid underlying product demand together with carryover work following a weather challenged 2019. Asphalt pricing increased nearly 3%. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our full year financial results and liquidity. Jim?"

We concluded 2020 with the highest full year adjusted EBITDA margin in Martin Marietta's history. Driving this achievement was our Building Materials business, which delivered record products and services revenues of $4.2 billion, a 1% increase, and record product gross profit of $1.2 billion, a 7% increase. 
Our Upstream Materials businesses, namely, aggregates and cement, established all-time records for both full year product revenues and gross profit. Aggregates product gross margin expanded 130 basis points to 30.6%, a new record, and unit profitability improved 8%. These accomplishments, which resulted from strong pricing gains, disciplined cost management and lower diesel fuel costs demonstrate the cost flexibility and resiliency of our aggregates-led business. 
The Cement business benefited from the planned kiln maintenance outage that occurred through the end of 2019. The timing of that outage resulted in some expenses being recognized in 2019 versus early in 2020. More importantly, that and other capital investments have dramatically improved our cement operations. We achieved 90% kiln reliability this year, up from 82% in 2019, which facilitated increased throughput and fixed cost absorption at both our Midlothian and Hunter plants. These factors, combined with mix adjusted pricing strength and lower fuel costs contributed to the 510 basis point improvement in cement product gross margin to 37.8%. 
Our targeted downstream businesses also delivered solid full year financial results. Ready mixed concrete product gross margin increased 10 basis points to 8.4% as pricing growth offset higher raw material costs. Asphalt and paving achieved gross profit of $60 million and a 100 basis point improvement in gross margin, driven by double-digit revenue growth. 
Our Magnesia Specialties business returned to revenue and profitability growth during the fourth quarter. The 12% top line improvement in the quarter, however, was not enough to offset demand declines experienced earlier in the year. As a result, full year product revenues decreased 12% to $221 million. We anticipate fourth quarter strength in line with chemicals demand to continue in 2021, now that steel utilization has rebounded from last summer's COVID-19-driven trough and our cobalt customers are resuming activity. Impressively, product gross margin improved 80 basis points to 40.6% as we proactively responded to lower shipments with effective cost control measures. 
Turning now to cash generation, capital allocation and liquidity. Martin Marietta ended 2020 with the strongest cash generation in our history. Operating cash flow of $1.05 billion increased 9%, driven by earnings growth. We continue to balance our long-standing disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and preserving financial flexibility to further enhance shareholder value. Our priorities remain focused on value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the consistent return of capital to shareholders while maintaining our investment-grade rating profile. 
For 2020, we invested $360 million of capital into our business and returned $190 million to shareholders through both an increased dividend and the first quarter repurchase of 211,000 shares of our common stock. In August 2020, our Board approved a 4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, underscoring its continued confidence in our future performance and continuing Martin Marietta's track record of dividend growth. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned more than $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. 
We ended 2020 with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.9x, slightly below our target leverage range of 2 to 2.5x, which offers us the flexibility to pursue accretive investment opportunities. 
Our solid balance sheet, combined with $1.1 billion of availability on our credit facilities, provides the financial strength for Martin Marietta to respond to, then execute on disciplined capital allocation priorities and continue profitably growing our business. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward to discuss our 2021 outlook."
31153,701866424,2201015,"Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Looking ahead, we believe 2021 will be a year in which we see a return to a more normalized state as underlying demand fundamentals reset and the nation's economy regains momentum. We remain confident in Martin Marietta's attractive business",988,"Thanks, Jim. Looking ahead, we believe 2021 will be a year in which we see a return to a more normalized state as underlying demand fundamentals reset and the nation's economy regains momentum. We remain confident in Martin Marietta's attractive business drivers and are encouraged by accelerating long-term secular trends across our 3 primary end-use markets and key geographies. We expect these trends to drive construction-led aggregates intensive growth. 
Infrastructure activity, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways, roads and streets, continues to prove resilient. With the 1-year extension of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, or FAST Act, at current funding levels, state and local governments have the visibility needed to plan, design and award transportation projects through the 2021 construction season. Importantly, estimated fiscal 2021 lettings for our top 5 departments of transportation, or DOTs, are currently above or near prior year levels. Keep in mind, our top 5 states: Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, are disproportionately important to us, representing 71% of our 2020 Building Materials business total revenues. 
Additionally, DOTs were recently granted nearly $10 billion of targeted relief as part of the Coronavirus Response and Relief Act passed in December 2020 to help offset pandemic-driven transportation revenue shortfalls. This funding assistance has the benefit of no state matching requirements. Based on preliminary estimates, over $2 billion of this assistance will be apportioned to Martin Marietta's top 5 states. 
Over the medium to long term, we anticipate voter-approved state and local transportation measures and passage of a comprehensive federal transportation program package to promote multiyear growth in product demand. In November 2020, voters sent a powerful message of support for state and local transportation investment, approving 94% of ballot measures, the highest ever approval rating. These initiatives are estimated to generate an additional $14 billion in onetime and recurring transportation funding, of which 82% is in Texas, our top revenue-generating state. 
Bipartisan support exists for new surface transportation legislation aimed at increasing funding levels not seen in over 15 years, with both the United States House of Representatives and Senate previously advancing proposed bills. We believe this 117th Congress creates a path toward advancing a notable increase in funding over the FAST Act. We're optimistic that agreement on a new bill could be reached this summer, generating meaningful benefits in 2022 and beyond. 
We expect increased infrastructure investment to provide volume stability and drive aggregate shipments in that end-use closer to our 10-year historical average of 43% of our total shipments. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 36% of 2020 shipments. 
Nonresidential construction should continue to benefit from accelerating e-commerce and remote work trends that require increased investment in heavy industrial warehouses and data centers, particularly in our key metros of Dallas/Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin, Denver, Des Moines, Indianapolis, Charlotte and Atlanta. Importantly, this type of construction tends to be more aggregates-intensive than light commercial construction due to the size, scale and structure of these projects. Light commercial and retail construction will remain comparatively challenged until COVID-19 vaccines are more widely distributed. Over the longer term, light nonresidential activity will benefit from the attractive collateral effects of strong single-family residential trends. Aggregate shipments to the nonresidential market accounted for 34% of 2020 shipments. 
Single-family housing is poised for multiyear growth returning to more normalized levels during this economic cycle. We believe Martin Marietta's leading southeastern and southwestern footprint positions the company to be a notable beneficiary of these trends given underbuilt conditions, favorable population and employment dynamics, land availability, mild climates and lower cost of living in these regions. Single-family housing is 2 to 3x more aggregates-intensive than multifamily construction, given the ancillary nonresidential and infrastructure needs of new suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 24% of 2020 shipments. 
In summary, we're confident in the fundamental strength and underlying drivers of our business. As disclosed in today's release, we've returned to providing full year annual guidance. We currently expect 2021 aggregates shipment growth to range from up 1% to up 4%, reflecting single-family housing strength, expanded infrastructure investment and heavy industrial projects of scale that will support our near-term shipment levels. We remain confident that our favorable pricing trends are sustainable, supported by improved contractor confidence and healthy customer backlogs. For 2021, we expect annual aggregates price increases, which become effective from January 1 to April 1, to increase in a range of up 3% to up 5%. 
Combined with contributions from our Cement, Downstream and Magnesia Specialties businesses, on a consolidated basis, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.350 billion to $1.450 billion. Keep in mind, when comparing this guidance range to prior year, we're not anticipating the same level of nonrecurring gains from land sales and divested surplus assets as seen in 2020. 
To conclude, we're proud of our 2020 record financial results and industry-leading safety performance. We're also extremely optimistic about our future. Martin Marietta has a strong foundation, thanks to our solid balance sheet and the investments we've made in our assets, people and capabilities. Due to our work over the last several years, Martin Marietta is uniquely well positioned to capitalize on the emerging growth trends that are expected to support steady and sustainable construction activity over the long term. 
Importantly, the disciplined execution of our strategic plan, coupled with our pricing discipline, operational excellence, prudent capital allocation and adherence to robust health protocols will continue to enhance Martin Marietta's solid foundation for enduring success. As we move forward, we have the resources, team and capabilities to drive value-enhancing growth. We're confident in Martin Marietta's opportunities to build on our successful track record of strong financial, operational and safety performance and remain focused on delivering superior returns for investors while meeting and exceeding our commitments to our other stakeholders, including our customers, employees and communities.

If you could discuss the pricing dynamics you saw in the quarter, and importantly, your thoughts on both volume and pricing going forward.

We'll walk through it. And let's talk about cement and pricing first. Number one, to see the cement price performance in Texas this year was actually affirming. If we go back over time and remember",589,"Well, Happy New Year to you, Kathryn, that's a mouthful. We'll walk through it. And let's talk about cement and pricing first. Number one, to see the cement price performance in Texas this year was actually affirming. If we go back over time and remember how we spoke about cement when we acquired it with TXI, we indicated we believe Texas cement pricing would start to act like aggregate pricing. That's exactly what we saw in this quarter. What I think is doubly important about that and impressive, keep in mind, for much of the year, we were not in a position to go and see our customers. So to see that type of performance on a mix adjusted basis is actually quite impressive. Keep in mind too, although you don't see it in the numbers, if we're looking at type 1 and type 2 cement, that was actually selling for closer to 4% up as opposed to 3% up. So if we're really looking at the bread-and-butter products, it looks really quite impressive. If we look at overall cement dynamics in the state, Texas is a nice place to be in any heavy side building materials business. Because particularly for cement right now, demand outstrips supply, and that's always a good place to start. We think that's particularly going to be the case as we go through the year in North Texas this year. So again, that feeds directly into our operations in Midlothian. Equally, the marketplace that we're seeing around Hunter is actually quite attractive as well. What we see from a volume perspective has been driven by a series of things. One, by some big jobs. So in the north, we're seeing Loop 12. We're seeing I-635, which is also known as the LBJ. If you go down towards South Texas, what's going on relative to the Grand Parkway has been nicely generative or utilized in cement and ready mix and aggregates and all the way through. So we think the outlook is frankly as good as we just saw in Q4.
If you're looking really more to what potential air pockets could be, I'll tell you very candidly, in Texas, we don't see it, Kathryn. A couple of things lead me to believe that. One, the FY '21 lettings in Texas are actually 25% over where they were last year. In other words, we're looking for about $9.5 billion worth of lettings. The other 2 pieces to keep in mind is the 2021 revenue streams that we're seeing either coming through Prop 7 and Prop 1 in Texas are really quite healthy. So we're looking at transfers of about $2.5 billion this year relative to Prop 7 and about $1.2 billion relative to Prop 1. Something else that's worth keeping in mind, too, is when we were looking at the COVID relief that's gone to different DOTs, [indiscernible] was the recipient of almost $914 million. Again, we spoke to the fact that those did not come encumbered with any particular state match. So for a state that already found itself in a very good position to have that extra money come in as well gives us a sense that we're in a very, very good place. As an ultimate reminder, Texas has a rainy day fund of $10.5 billion that they have not tapped. So as we're looking at Texas, both near term, medium-term and long term, we like very much what we see. So I hope that's responsive to your series of questions, Kathryn."

And also, it appeared that maybe there's limited operating leverage in that guidance as well. I'm just wondering if that's maybe some of the kiln expenses from 2020 that got pulled into 2019, if those come back and maybe that's way you rolled it on the leverage. And just if I could also add to that, you must be feeling some pinch points in terms of capacity in cement at this point. And I'm just wondering how you're thinking longer term about your capacity footprint. Do you flex your shipments with import tons? Or do you invest capital either organically or through acquisitions in building your capacity? Or maybe you're just happy with what you've got. If you could talk about that."

Thank you very much for your questions. We'll start with respect to pricing. So as we think about pricing in the Texas marketplace today, what we're seeing are price increases out there that have been put out. We put out a $9 a ton price increase effective in April. We've seen others that customers have shown us that have been closer to $6. So I think that gives you at least some boies to think about relative to pricing for the year. I think equally, as we look at the likelihood of price increases hitting in different percentages, clearly, North Texas is going to look stronger than South Texas is. Central is going to be just fine. I think to your point, if it's going to be tight anywhere this year on cement tonnage, it's likely more in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, meaning Midlothian. And so we'll just have to watch that as the year goes on. One thing I would ask you to do is, and that is you asked a very good question around capacity in Texas because you're going back to the notion that right now, demand is outstripping supply. As you know, we have an Analyst and Investor Day that's coming up later this month. We're going to talk about some of the very specific capital initiatives that we have underway. And I would ask you to wait and listen to what we have to say about that particular process when we're talking to you live later in the month relative to our cement outlook and our aggregates outlook in Texas.
With respect to some of the other numbers that you mentioned, you're entirely right relative to rhythm and cadence around kiln maintenance. We did have a relatively lower number of kiln maintenance in 2020. If we're looking at the overall kiln maintenance spend in 2020, it was about $19.7 million. As we're looking to see what it's going to be into the new year, we are looking at a number that's going to be somewhat higher than that. We're looking more at about a $22.7 million number for total kiln maintenance in '21. And so we're looking at some of those puts and takes. But I think that gives you a sense of do we have capacity issues that we need to think about longer and medium term? Yes, we do. Are we in a circumstance that pricing is doing what we thought it would? It absolutely is. Are the dollars that we've put into the kilns having them run at a higher rate of efficiency? There's no doubt that they are. So if we're looking at kiln reliability, as Jim commented in his commentary, they ran at 90% kiln reliability in the year just ended. The year before, it's at 82%. So we like very much the way that business is going operationally, the way that business is going commercially and what we feel like its future is. So David, I hope that was responsive to your question."

And with that mix becoming closer to the historic average, even directionally that way implies decent volume growth in that end market.

As you indicated, we've walked through what some of the numbers look like in Texas. As Jim indicated in his prepared remarks, if we look at Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, those states comprise around 71% of our revenue. So those states are going well, a lot of things good happens for Martin Marietta. As I indicated, I won't go back through all the details that we hit, but we're looking at Texas lettings up 25%. Let's go through the others and I think that will give you a sense of why we've got the degree of confidence that we do. 
Colorado, which, as you know, in '20 had just a spectacular year. I mean, you heard us reference the fact that our asphalt and paving business in that state had a record year. We're looking at a DOT program in Colorado that we believe is going to be flat year-over-year. And what I'm about to tell you is when we're looking at our top 5 states, yet the worst that we're seeing anywhere is flat, that's not a bad place to be coming off of a record year. So if we're looking at the $10 billion COVID stimulus, about $134 million of those dollars is finding its way to Colorado, which we believe is to bring their DOT program up about even with where it was last year. Now by contrast, our home state, North Carolina, did not have a particularly good year. Last year. We think North Carolina DOT is in a far better position. And as you know, if we look at this state, historically, it has not only been one of our most profitable. It's been one of our most consistent as well. So we think North Carolina is trending back into an area that makes much more sense for us. To give you a sense of what that means, the FY '21 lettings projection is about $1.3 billion. That's $670 million better than I think people would have expected when they were looking at it last year. The other thing that's important to keep in mind is North Carolina did issue $700 million of build in C bonds. So again, as we're looking at the near-term future of North Carolina, we're really very pleased with that. One thing I will mention as well, the NC FIRST Commission, which I was a part of here in North Carolina, looked at really how North Carolina needs to think about its investment in infrastructure over the next 10 years. And our view was they needed to put at least $20 billion more in infrastructure in the state. So the state is looking at ways to do that. But that's clearly longer term than just this year. 
If we go to Georgia, again, we think Georgia is relatively flat year-over-year. But if you look at where that state has been sequentially, if we go back to 2016, you'll see a budget that's gone from about $1.7 billion to one that's about $2.1 billion. And then the other thing to keep in mind is Georgia still has ahead of it the major mobility investment program. And the overall goal of that is to have a number of very large projects, about $12 billion to be more specific, underway by 2025 and completed by 2030. And then, of course, the last of the top 5 states is Florida, they're looking at their spending to increase about 20% year-over-year. So again, if we look at the top 5, Texas is better. North Carolina is better. Florida is better and Colorado and Georgia are broadly flat. So when we look at that type of trajectory on something that's around 71% of our revenues in those states, I think that's part of what gives us the confidence that we have and the volume outlook that we've offered, Trey."

Obviously, Q2 and particularly Q3 were the 2 quarters that were most impacted by COVID. By the time we got to Q4, in many respects, we had a lot of this figured out.

I think we've got a good sense of what public is going to look like, and we think public is going to look better. I think we have a good sense of what residential is going to look like, and residential is going to look better. And residential is particularly going to look better with respect to single-family. We believe single-family as a percentage of overall housing will return to more normalized percentages. In other words, it's going to be about 80% of housing in the United States. And when we see single-family housing at 1 million starts or 1.1 million or 1.2 million, I will tell you, that's a pretty healthy place for our business. Because here's what happens. That's evidence of new neighborhoods being built. And so if you think about 2 cities that are important to us, think about Atlanta and think about Dallas, both tend to be north-south cities, both tend to be growing more north than south. So what that means is, years ago, you were growing north from Dallas to Plano, now you're growing from Dallas to Frisco and now you're going to be moving north from Frisco to north of Frisco. As we see new communities come in Brisco or as they go into Alpharetta or other places north of Atlanta. New communities need the follow-on effect that you get in nonresidential. Now history tells us, depending on geography, that can have a 6 to, let's call it, an 18-month lag behind it. If we're seeing single-family growth in communities and you've got a 6-month lag on that, that can start pushing you toward the higher end of our volume guidance. Because if we think about the different end uses, res infrastructure is going to be better. Residential is going to be better, particularly single-family. As we land on nonres, as we said comparatively the toughest of the 3 end users, the heavy side of that, we believe, is going to be good, with warehousing, data, et cetera, all of which are very aggregates-intensive. So some of the swing side to the upper end of that is going to be relative to the drag along effect of the light portion of nonres that we believe will follow continued single-family growth. So that was a mouthful. And I apologize if that was a mouthful, but I hope that was followable."

And the short answer is the country is going to add about 140 million people over that time period, and 70% of them will land in 1 of 11 mega regions. And so if you watch the mega regions and see what -- where they are. If you look at our footprint, the likelihood is we will continue to want to be focused in those mega regions, either with bolt-ons or with platforms. Relative to our M&A pipeline and our team, they would like to sleep more. But the short answer is they're very busy people right now. They are very talented people. And we're very grateful for them.

So I think that's certainly a possibility. What I think we saw more of though was the build of some momentum and saw nice momentum going into 4. Experience tells me that contractors are finishing a year in which they don't have good confidence in the next year. Rather than hurry up, they tend to slow down because they want to make sure that they have plenty of work for their workforces as they come into a new year. What I would say too is, I think that's certainly possible, Nishu. But I equally think what we're seeing, particularly relative to single-family housing and what's tending to follow it. And then the overall health of the DOTs in the states in which we are operating, I think those are coalescing to give nice momentum in 4 that we believe persists into '21."

What I would say is, the customer backlogs are looking fairly similar in many respects to where they were last year. One thing that's worth remembering is the backlogs really, at this time of the year for customers, only represent about 20% to 35% what people really think their shipment needs are going to be. But what I would say is overall aggregate tons are modestly up as we talk to our customers right now. If we look at cement tons, they're actually up double digits right now. If we look at Magnesia Specialties, they're actually up double digits as well. So I think part of what's important to remember, Phil, is we're going into '21, 2 parts of our business that have historically been very good, steady parts of our business, meaning North Carolina in Magnesia Specialties did not have the best years in '20 and are both looking at considerably better years coming into the year in '21. So as we're looking at overall backlogs, they look really quite good for us. The only area that our backlogs are notably off would be in portions of Colorado. And what we're seeing in Colorado, and I think this goes back to your question, is actually right now a very good level of bidding activity in that state. So as we mentioned, we're coming off what was a record year last year in Colorado. And we anticipate it coming into '21, that would almost have to be modestly slower. As I indicated in some of the earlier questions, with some of the COVID money that is coming to Colorado, DOT numbers are broadly even, and now we're seeing much better fitting activity. So I guess what I have to say on that, Phil, is more to come. But I try to give you what we feel like is a good march across the enterprise to give you a sense of where we think customer backlogs are."

We had picked up very recently some volume on one of those projects in South Texas. So again, I think there are no big surprises, and there's nothing markedly different there than we spoke of as we really ramped up the year last year. Although it does look near term modestly brighter on some of the commitments that had been made over the last few weeks."

If I think about end uses, here's the way I would think about it. I'd rather just talk about for your perspective, Courtney, because I think that's probably a more directionally appropriate way to look at, at least from my seat on the bus. Infrastructure ended up last year to about 36% for us. Nonres was tied for infrastructure at 36%, and residential was at 24%. So that gives you a pretty good snapshot of what volumes look like for the year. What I would tell you is, I think 36% for infrastructure is awfully low. That said, an end use that ought to be in the low to mid-40s. I certainly believe with what we're starting to see from our leading states right now, and again, we've not built in a long-term highway bill into anything that we're talking about relative to '21. But if our states continue investing the way that they are and we see a long-term bill come through from the federal government, we think that 36% moves up toward the 40% number and maybe even ahead of that, that would feel more logical to us. If we look at nonres at 36%, that's an odd one to me, and I'll tell you why. Historically, if we looked at nonres, it would have been very consistent at about 30% of our volume. And that would have historically been a pretty clear defining break with nonres light being about half of that and nonres heavy being about half of that overall 30%. Year just ended, it was 36%. But here's what's happened. Clearly, the light portion of nonres has gone down, the heavy portion of nonres has gone up. But the irony is the heavy portion of nonres is really heavy right now. So what we're seeing is in data warehousing and the other delivery products that we're having, the sheer aggregates intensity of heavy nonres is richer than we've ever seen before. That is actually serving to fill, in large measure, the tonnage hole that would otherwise be left when we look at what's happened to hospitality, retail, et cetera. So that gives you a sense of where that is. 
Now residential last year at 24% is a relatively high number. That's probably the highest single res number that we've ever seen. To give you a sense of what it looked like, at absolute made here is about 7%. And now what's happening is we're seeing res at 24% of our volume, but we're not seeing residential starts at a particularly high level, at least relative to a 50-year snapshot of it. What I think is most telling is back to the portion of the dialogue that we had before relative to what's happening with single-family residential within the overall residential snapshot. In the recovery that ended with COVID's arrival, single-family housing was about 67% of overall housing activity. If we look at what a 20-, 30-year average is, it tends to be closer to 80%. That's what we're starting to see today. 
So again, as we think about what end uses look like on a percentage basis for '20 and the way that we think they're trending for '21, again, infrastructure, 36% in '20; nonres, 36%; res, 24%. As we move into '21, should we see infrastructure move up? I think we probably should. Will we see nonres move around a little bit, but probably not huge numbers? Probably so. Do we think res will be pretty consistent? The answer is yes. I also think it's worth noting that the railroads have said that they intend to be back to relatively normal levels of maintenance and repair as we come into the year. That's important because the ChemRock/Rail portion of our business, which covers not only the Rail portion but what we sell to farmers as agricultural line in the Midwestern United States can be 8%, 9%, 10% portion of our business. As agricultural prices have continued to get better, our outlook for ag line, I think, will continue to improve. So Courtney, I threw a lot of data at you for the first time on a call. I apologize for that, but I hope that was helpful."

I think that was a great question. So I would say several things. One, I do think most DOTs today have utilized their engineering and planning and eminent domain resources over the last several years to have themselves in a position that they're better placed than I would say at any time in my career to be able to take these funds and move with them. And I think part of that is going to be underscored by what they're going to be doing with the COVID relief dollars they've gotten as well. I mean to give you a sense of it, if we look at the COVID relief dollars all by themselves, out of the $10 billion, we're looking at $900 million to Texas; $134 million to Colorado; $260 million to North Carolina; Georgia is getting $323 million; Florida is getting $473 million; Iowa, $123 million; Indiana, $238 million; South Carolina, $167 million; Maryland, $150 million; and Nebraska, $72 million. So those are nice, big numbers going to those states. 
So if we look at what they're going to be able to do with that in '21, we think they're going to be able to put most of that to work. To the extent that we see a highway bill that is in some form of pass by the time we get, let's call it, toward half year. We believe you start seeing some degree of pull-through in that in '22. But we equally believe what you're going to see is a nice build from that in '22. And we believe that's going to give at least the single biggest, most consistent in use that we have, a nice multiyear run. What I think can happen, Garik, is this notion of having perhaps infrastructure funding at levels that we haven't seen ever before and the nicest increase that we've seen in 15 years, together with what we feel like in our footprint is going to be a continued expansion in single-family housing. And then also following these corridors of commerce that we've so intentionally built our business around, we think it does set the industry generally up but we think it sets Martin Marietta specifically up for what could be a very nice multiyear volume trend. So Garik, I hope that was helpful."

I guess what I would say, Adam, is it all depends on the where. We're specifically driven by markets, what we think are attractive markets, the position that we would have in that market and what we think we can do with the business. So here's the way I would encourage you to think about that. When we swapped out of the River business, when we swapped out of a pure stone business and we swapped into a vertically integrated marketplace, we didn't do that on that day because we lost any conviction in aggregates. This is an aggregates-led company. So what you should always expect us to do, wherever we're looking at M&A is for it to be aggregates-led. That's the important thing to remember. But what I think you and I recognize is there are some markets in the United States that do tend to be vertically integrated. And if you want to be in an attractive market that's vertically integrated, you better be in a position that you have competencies around stone, and at times, ready mix, and at times, hot mix asphalt. So would we consider it? Of course, we would consider it. But are we going to be very picky about the market? We will. And I think what you've seen from our track record is when we go and do that, what we've been able to do is add considerable shareholder value in the process."

It's good to hear your voice, and hope you're well in the U.K. Paul, I think if we look at where our downstream businesses are, that's what gives us the confidence in those. Keep in mind, we have downstream businesses in Colorado where we have ready mix and we have asphalt, and we have downstream in Texas where we have ready mix only. And I think what we're seeing is, particularly in Texas, a good amount of bidding not only on private work that's tied into residential but also in public work on some large projects. So as we look at what we believe is happening in that marketplace, even despite what can be some of the raw materials cost particularly on the energy side, I think we feel like that we can maintain those. Equally, if we look at our business in Colorado, that's really one of the better ready mix markets in the United States. We see actually a pretty significant delta in ready mix pricing in Colorado versus what we see in ready mix pricing in most of Texas. And again, the hot mix asphalt and paving business that we have in Colorado, I think, is really one of the better hot mix asphalt and pavement businesses in the United States. It's got very high barriers to entry in that marketplace. And part of what we're seeing in that marketplace, too, although we're not experiencing it, but others are, Paul, there are some depletion scenarios on stone that are underway in portions of the front range. Martin Marietta is not affected by that. We've got nice long-term reserve positions. But what we've done in that marketplace to one, have good long-term reserve positions. But number two, make sure we have a nicely spread out distribution system is what's going to allow us to maintain margins in those downstream businesses. At the same time, part of what you'll see, if you look at the downstream businesses, is the raw materials piece of it does appear to be going up. And in large measure, that's because we're selling ourselves some raw materials in those businesses. And we recognize that the value of aggregates is very valuable, and it's getting more valuable each year. And we're going to make sure that even when we're doing those internally, we're doing it in a very equitable fashion because we want to treat our internal customers and our external customers exactly the same way, Paul. So hopefully, that's helpful."

The fact is we haven't seen anything coming through right now that we feel like it's going to be widely disruptive to what we're doing. I do think we're going to see considerably more ESG factors built into maybe not 1 big bill. I think you're going to see it built into most bills that come through. And by the way, we're perfectly okay with that. If you think of it from this perspective. One, a lot of it's going to be geared towards safety activities. You can see what our numbers are. We do that extraordinarily well. The other thing that I would tell you, you can go and look at the sustainability report that we put out, what you'll find out is that to the extent that we have greenhouse gases, we have 400 operations across the United States. Really, only 4 of them have any degree of notable GHG issues and that means 84% of our GHG issues come from 4 locations, which tell us that we've already set out really robust targets between now and 2030 on how we intend to deal with those, and we publish those annually. So as we're sitting here looking at what we feel like could be a higher regulatory market, we don't feel like we're seeing things right now that will be negatively impacting our business. Do I think it might make barriers to entry more difficult in our business, in the back? It may. Is that something to lament? I'll leave that to you. If you've got 90 years of reserves at current extraction rates, I'm not sure that's something that we're particularly concerned about today.
The other thing that I will say is, to the extent that it increases costs, the simple fact is we can usually deal with that on the commercial side because we would typically see pricing going up. And the other thing that I would say is at least right now, our customer base is not complaining about a lack of available employees. What you remember, Stanley, is a couple of years ago, there was a trucking shortage. There was a labor shortage. Right now, we're not seeing that in our space. So logistics are working relatively well, and contractors are in a position that they can do what they need to with their projects day in and day out. So hopefully, that tick off the items that you listed, Stanley."

Thank you for the question. If you go across our footprint and you look at what cost of goods sold look like for us, the primary thing that you're going to see is the single biggest cost of goods sold that we have is labor. It's our employees. Then you're going to find a series of others that tend to be in the aggregates business around 12% to 15% of our COGS. That will be things like supplies, other inventories, what's happening with respect to maintenance and repair, et cetera. So if we go back over time and look at what we have done relative to our employee base, the way that we pay them, the tenure that they have, we don't see an inflation situation relative to wages that is anything that we're concerned about. 
With respect to maintenance and repair, what you'll see as well is if you go over let's call it the SOAR years, you'll find that we've been very consistent with the way that we deployed capital in our business. What you'll see from that is the continuing thoughtful management of maintenance and repair. Now one thing that you will see that went up a bit last year is some degrees of DD&A. And DD&A was up in large measure due to what we have done to invest responsibly in the business. So the one item, and I'll ask Jim to speak to it very specifically, that we think could be a bit of a headwind this year is relative to energy and more specifically with respect to diesel fuel. Because clearly, we've seen that move around a little bit. Diesel fuel was a fairly notable tailwind for our company and for our industry all during 2020 that persisted into Q4. So I'll ask Jim to speak to that. The other thing I'll ask Jim to speak to is what we saw relative to the sale of some excess properties last year that will likely not repeat. So I think from an inflation perspective, that's going to talk you about energy, but I also want you modeling to be thinking about what we're not going to do or at least replicate relative to land sales."

That's the average price that was out there in 2019. So effectively, we're going back to that level of diesel pricing as far as we can tell. So that's already in the forecast, and frankly, we're holding on to our margins from 2020 and slightly building on those. So we're content in that environment to maintain margins and then offset diesel pricing. 
As it relates to the land sale gains that Ward referred to, we had those very large gains in 2020, $70 million worth of gains. Those were hard fought and very much enjoy, but they are not going to be repeating this year. So as you model out your numbers, we just ask that you look at 2020's EBITDA as a core, maybe pull out those land sale gains and not build on those as repeating into 2021."

Our capital priorities haven't changed, and that is the -- we feel like the best first on our spend is on the right transaction. And several years ago, I remember, we were coming into a year and we said that we thought it could be a year of some notable transactions for the industry. I think the prospect is this could be a year of some notable transactions. We've tried to have ourselves financially and regulatorily in a position that if large transactions or notable transactions or attractive ones came along, we would be in a place that we could play. So if we think about our best first dollar spent that's it. 
Next, we're looking at assuring that we're investing responsively in the business. And if you look at what we've been able to do through cycles relative to CapEx, and as Jim was just indicating, we think we have treated the business really quite well. And if we look at what that has allowed us to do relative to our cost performance, we think that we have been largely outperforming. And then third, to your point, and your very good question is, a return of cash to shareholders. And we've done that through 2 very different ways, Timna. Number one, we've had a meaningful and a sustainable dividend. And we think both of those words are really important. So one thing to keep in mind, I believe we're the only heavy signed building materials company who can say this, we've never cut a dividend. So the fact is we've been able to maintain a dividend all the way through cycles. And what's important is this company, even in August, when the world was faced with all the uncertainties from COVID-19, we raised our dividend by 4%. If you go back and look at where we were the year before that or the year before that, you'll find even bigger increases. So clearly, our Board is going to come back and look at the dividend in August. As you recall as well, when we bought TXI, we issued 20 million shares of stock to combine the companies together. Shortly after that, our Board took the view, okay, our shareholders were good enough to give us license to go and do this with a very high percentage shareholder vote. We're going to make sure over time, opportunistically, we come back and take that dilution back. And we've been on that journey. We've got about 15 million shares left in that authorization. We want to continue chipping away on that. But the conversations we've had with our shareholders have tended to be, if you have the ability to do the right deal, that's where we want you to be. And these are conversations that we're always very frontal with our shareholders because they're our owners at the end of the day. And we want to make sure that we're meeting their needs and their expectations. But that's the priorities. That's how we're looking at it, Timna. So again, I hope that's helpful."

Last year when most companies were withdrawing guidance, they were certainly encouraged to be forward-leaning and be even more forthcoming into what they might see in the coming months. Part of what we're so pleased with is we feel like we're back in a more normalized state, trending to an even more normalized state and because of that, we've reinstituted guidance. And our practice has always been, if we had guidance in place to make sure that we were really sticking very close within the 4 walls of the quarter in which we're addressing. So I'll talk a little bit -- well, I'll talk a lot more about January when we're together and we're reporting the full -- the quarter results. I'll say this much, part of what we thought was important was ending the year with momentum, and we thought that we would see it carry into the year.

The other business that performed extraordinarily well last year, and this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, is the business that we have in Maryland in the aftermath of the Bluegrass transaction. Again, Maryland got $150 million coming into that marketplace as well. So we've talked about how important Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida are, those are 1 through 5.

At the end of the day, we really don't want to see DOT having to move snow off roads in North Carolina. So I think it's a practical matter of seeing resurfacing projects go, seeing the $700 million from billed NC bonds and utilizing that and a much healthier bidding circumstance on top of the backlogs that we have make weathering what we've already done much better. And I think it does outline a much brighter 2021 and certainly 2022 and beyond in North Carolina. So we feel like we have been through the toughest period by far.

Supported by our team's steadfast commitment to safe and efficient operations, price discipline and operational excellence, we established first quarter records for revenues, profits and safety. Both building materials and magnesia specialties benefited from strengthening product demand. Specifically, consolidated products and services revenues increased 3% to $922 million, consolidated gross profit increased 23% to $175 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased of 37% to $204 million and diluted earnings per share grew over 2.5x to $1.04. We also achieved the best first quarter safety performance in Martin Marietta's history with company-wide lost time and total injury incident rates exceeding or trending at world class levels. At the same time, we are thoughtfully executing on our SOAR growth priorities to enhance our geographic footprint and grow our business. As announced in this morning's release, we successfully completed the acquisition of Tiller Corporation the leading aggregates and hot mix asphalt supplier in the Minneapolis St. Paul region and welcomed more than 200 talented employees to the Martin Marietta team. Tiller provides an upstream materials platform in one of the largest and fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the Midwest and expands and complements the product offerings of our existing operations in surrounding markets. Tiller's cultural fit, attracted margins and value over volume operating philosophy directly aligned with our central division operations. We expect a seamless and successful integration.
Now let's turn to the company's first quarter operating performance. The Building Materials business saw strengthening product demand from single-family housing growth, infrastructure investment and notable heavy industrial projects of scale in our key geographies. Our aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete business in Texas, our largest revenue-generating state experienced temporary disruptions from February's historic winter ice storm and subfreezing temperatures. Additionally, our aggregates and downstream operations in Colorado, our second largest state by revenues, faced a challenging comparison as our results in the same period last year, benefited from unseasonably favorable weather conditions in the Rocky mountains. Overall, aggregate shipments declined 3%, in line with our expectations, given return to typical first quarter seasonality factors and the largely non-COVID-19 impacted prior year quarter. Notably, East Group aggregate shipments increased as the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida and Maryland, benefited from strong residential and heavy industrial nonresidential activity. This growth offset lower shipments in the Midwest from more seasonal construction activity and reduced wind energy projects. While underlying product demand remains robust, unfavorable winter weather conditions in both Texas and Colorado and a softer energy sector market resulted in an 8% decline in West group shipments. Aggregates average selling price increased 3.4% or 2.5% on a mix adjusted basis. These pricing gains supported by our locally driven pricing strategy, highlight contractor confidence and underlying construction activity in the attractive markets that we serve. East Group pricing increased 4% with both East and Central divisions contributing solid growth geographic mix from a lower percentage of higher-priced long-haul shipments limited to West Group's pricing gain to 2%. Our Cement business delivered strong first quarter operating performance and shipment growth despite the disruptions from February's historic storm, I'm extremely grateful to our teams, their actions to proactively winterize and take our plants offline, allowed us to quickly return to normal production capacity post storm. To that effect, our cement operations established an all-time record from monthly shipments in March, demonstrating the robust demand and construction activity throughout the Texas triangle. Mix adjusted pricing grew 2% during the quarter. Annual cement prices went into effect April 1 and have garnered widespread support in both North and South Texas. We expect our Cement business will continue to benefit from favorable market trends supported by continued market type as in Texas and diversified customer backlogs.
Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Our ready mixed concrete operations established a first quarter record for shipments, which increased nearly 27% to 2 million cubic yards. Large nonresidential projects and incremental volume from operations acquired late last year contributed to double-digit shipment growth in Texas, which more than offset weather-related shipment declines in Colorado. Concrete pricing declined 2%, reflecting geographic mix from a higher percentage of lower-priced Texas shipments.
Our Colorado asphalt and paving business lost production days from a return to more typical winter weather conditions versus the prior year period, resulting in reduced asphalt shipments. As well pricing, however, improved 8%. Colorado market fundamentals remained strong, supported by healthy bidding activity and overall customer optimism.
Looking ahead, we remain confident that Martin Marietta's attractive market fundamentals and accelerating long-term secular trends across our 3 primary end-use markets will drive sustainable construction led, aggregates intensive growth for the foreseeable future. We are encouraged by the recent initial gold steps to advance much needed infrastructure investment and a general consensus for success or legislation to the fixing America's surface transportation, or Fast Act in the coming months. With both congressional chambers working on their own reauthorization proposals, we're optimistic that a Fast Act replacement and increased funding levels will be passed before its expiration in September generating meaningful shipment benefits in 2022 and beyond. In the meantime, state and local infrastructure funding remains resilient. Estimated fiscal 2021 lettings for our top 5 state departments of transportations or dots, are currently above or near prior year levels. Keep in mind, our top 5 states, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, are disproportionately important to our business, representing 71% of total revenues for our 2020 building materials. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 30% of first quarter shipments, well below our 10-year historical average of 43%. The nonresidential construction continues to benefit from increased investment in aggregates intensive heavy industrial warehouses and data centers, broadly offsetting weakness in the more COVID-19 impacted like commercial and retail sectors. Light nonresidential activity should benefit from the attractive drag along effects of strong single-family residential growth in the longer term, in some regions, we're now seeing early signs of that recovery. Aggregates shipments to the nonresidential market accounted for 37% of first quarter shipments. Martin Marietta's leading southeastern and southwestern footprint positions our company to benefit from single-family housing growth given underbilled conditions, favorable population and employment dynamics, land availability, mild climates and lower cost of living in these regions. Importantly, single-family housing is 2 to 3x where aggregates intensive than multifamily construction given the ancillary nonresidential and infrastructure needs to build out new suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 27% of first quarter shipments.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our first quarter financial results. Jim?"

Surpassing the previous record set in the first quarter of 2007. The Building Materials business established first quarter records for revenues and profitability. Products and services revenues increased 3% and to $857 million, while gross profit increased 25% to $148 million. We continue to drive sustainable and best-in-class aggregates unit profitability growth through the combination of price discipline and operational excellence. For the quarter, aggregates gross profit per ton shipped improved 34% to $3.28 and product gross margin expanded 490 basis points to 21.3% despite lower shipment volumes. In addition to pricing gains, lower contract services and internal freight costs contributed to these improvements. Our cement operations benefited from a 3% top line improvement. However, extended kiln downtime, reduced production levels and nearly $7 million of incremental energy and other costs all directly due to February's Texas deep freeze, led to a 1,160-basis point degradation in product gross margins. While these weather disruptions were headwinds to our first quarter results, our cement business is well positioned to benefit from growing demand and tight supply and remains on track to achieve its full year guidance. Ready mixed concrete product gross margin improved 520 basis points to 8.3%, driven by double-digit shipment growth and lower delivery and raw material costs. Magnesia specialties continued to benefit from improving domestic steel production and global demand for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $65 million, a 9% increase. Higher shipment and production levels, combined with ongoing cost management, resulted in product gross margins of 43.5% and which matched the first quarter record established in the prior year.
Now a look at our cash generation and capital allocation. The first quarter was a record for cash generation. Operating cash flows of $192 million increased 80%, driven by earnings growth and a reduction in working capital. We continue to balance our disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business. While maintaining a healthy balance sheet and financial flexibility. Our priorities remain focused on value enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the consistent return of capital to shareholders. All while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating profile. We continue to prioritize high-returning capital projects, focused on growing sales and increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion. Full year capital expenditures are expected to range from $425 million to $475 million. Additionally, since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned nearly $1.9 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. Our first quarter earnings and cash generation were both records. As a result, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio stood at 1.8x as of March 31, slightly below our target leverage range of 2 to 2.5x.
As Ward highlighted, our disciplined execution of SOAR 2025 is underway. Last week, we completed the Tiller acquisition. We expect this acquisition to be immediately accretive to earnings and cash flow and contribute $170 million of revenues and $60 million of adjusted EBITDA in the remaining 8 months of 2021. We financed the transaction using a combination of cash on our balance sheet and drawing an accounts receivable credit facility.
Our full year 2021 guidance remains unchanged from the guidance provided in February and excludes the expected contribution of the Tiller acquisition. That said, we will revisit our 2021 guidance when we report our half year results.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward."

One, the guidance that we've reaffirmed this morning is simply our heritage guidance. So again, we've given you revenue and EBITDA numbers for tiller which you would need to go and add, obviously, to the heritage guidance to get what the effective guidance would be today. So that math is there. It's very easy to do. And the other thing that we've not done is changed guidance for the year here based on Q1. So remember, we're in an outdoor sport, and this has been January, February and March, and our view was changing it after those 3 months feels a bit premature to us. And again, I think we came out with guidance at the beginning of the year that was modestly ahead of where others have come out as well. So I think we have seen some degrees of guidance change today. But I think in many respects, it's been an effort to more balance where we were when we came out at the beginning of the year. So that's where we are relative to heritage guidance, please to add to that, what we've given you with respect to tiller. As Jim said in his prepared remarks, we will come back at half year and revisit guidance. One of the things, obviously, I think we'll be revisiting will be what is happening with cement. As you know, Kathryn, that's the second part of your question. We only have cement in Texas. And I'll draw several things to your attention. Number one, if we're looking at our backlogs in cement, the backlog in cement year-over-year are actually up pretty considerably. We're seeing cement tons up 24%. So number one, that's a nice takeaway. Number two, the results that we turned in for the first quarter were despite the fact that, that business was effectively shut down for 11 days in February when Texas up with some unseasonably cold weather. We incurred about $7 million of expenses in semi business tied directly to energy and other pure production costs. We also had some inefficiencies that came from that. That ended up giving us effectively nearly a $14 million headwind, simply driven by that 11-day period. The other thing that I'll point out is, obviously, we do have a price increase that went into effect on April 1 that's at $8 a ton in that marketplace. The other thing that we have done, recognizing that it's going to be tight in Texas this year on cement. We have put out a letter in the marketplace, and we've let our customers know that we're anticipating another $8 a ton price increase in September. So again, as we come back and give you some very specific answers to your question on cement and then ticking and tying that back to the guidance question. These are all a number of the variables that we will take into account as we revisit guidance at half year."

It's accretive to cash and earnings in year 1. That's a nice place to start when we're thinking Tiller. If we think about to the SOAR process, keep in mind, we've long said that we have a leading position in 90% of our markets. Would that lead you to conclude that in 10% of the markets were not 1 or 2 this was 1 of the 10% of the markets. So again, we like the Minneapolis, St. Paul Marketplace. We wanted to be a leader in that marketplace. Through our SOAR process, we had identified Minneapolis, St. Paul as an MSA in which we wanted to grow. We had identified Tiller specifically as a target that we wanted to see if we could bring into Martin Marietta. And there are several reasons for that. Number one, if we look at Minneapolis, St. Paul, it's the 12th largest MSA in terms of aggregate consumption in the United States. So one of the things that got my attention was when I saw that they're actually more aggregates consumed in Minneapolis, St. Paul, than there are in Charlotte, which was not something that I think is intuitive to a lot of people. The other thing that's worth noting is Minnesota maintains the nation's fifth largest highway system, and they've got a budget of about $3.8 billion, and about 90% of that goes to highways purchasing roads. So we like the way that they invest in that place. The other thing that I would say is this is a leading upstream business. It's aggregates led. It does have hot mix, but I want to be really clear here, Trey. It's not a laid out business. They're producing blacktop that's basically being sold to contractors. So historically, Tiller has operated through a couple of subsidiaries, Barton Sandy Gravel, and that's literally their Sandy Gravel business and then a business called Commercial Asphalt. So those 2 businesses really comprise what they have. It's about 15-plus sites in the twin cities area. They've got a 30-year average pit life at their different locations. And again, they have an EBITDA there that learns very, very nicely with what we have in the Central division. So back to SOAR, back to leading positions and in markets that we feel like are going to be attractive near-term and long term, that's what Tiller brings this organization. The other thing that I would say is, philosophically, the organizations are extraordinarily well aligned. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we closed on that Friday, and we were absolutely thrilled to bring several hundred people from Tiller into the Martin Marietta organization track."

What I would say is we're not updating guidance right now simply because it's Q1. Obviously, we're very excited about what we saw in Q1. We're really excited about the fact that places like North Carolin VOT are back. The other thing that we're seeing in Q1 that I think we'll continue to see through the year as price fell through very, very nicely. You saw that. The other thing that I think we know we saw in Q1 was very good cost performance. I anticipate that we will continue to see good cost performance throughout the year. I think that's where you can have some degrees of give and take. The fact was diesel is likely to become an increasing headwind as we go through the year. Frankly, in Q1, it wasn't much of a headwind. It wasn't much of a tailwind either, but if we look at some of the cost buckets in which we saw a nice outperformance year-over-year, freight, moving material from a producing location to a yard was actually nicely better year-over-year. Now if we see more sales going out of sales yards as the year goes on, obviously, that freight number would move. So with revenue, a number of things have moved with that. What I'll tell you as well as contract services were down. In other words, there were some stripping and other components that were down. Repairs were down, and we think those are likely the types of things that we will be able to hold on to. And I think that's evidence of good capital spend. Equally, we saw lower personnel costs. If you recall, last year, we did do some restructuring that was not necessarily COVID related, the timing of it just worked out very, very nicely. So what I would encourage you not to do is, again, take the guidance that we've not changed and then just assume everything continues in a linear fashion. Again, that's why we want to come back at half year and address it. But again, I like the pricing dynamics that we're seeing in both aggregates and in cement. I think our teams have done an extraordinary job relative to costs. Again, if you're looking at gross profit per ton in the quarter, and you saw that going up at 34.5%. If you're looking cash gross profit per ton to growth, I mean, we were almost 23% on that from what I can tell, that looks like best-in-class types of metrics. So again, we're -- we feel very good about where we sit right now. And to be clear, we feel good about the balance of the year."

And as you know, our view typically is to live very tightly within the quarters. And we were doing that in large part because people were removing guidance last year. So I won't go into April, per se. I will say, clearly, there was nice momentum coming into Q1. Relative to pricing, but I would say is there are no surprises. On the aggregates piece of it, it's working exactly the way that we would have anticipated and the way that we planned. You saw the breakdown between reported and mix adjusted, as we talked about the quarter, again, reported up 3.4%, mix adjusted at 2.5%. Again, that's very much within the guide that we've given. I do think it's possible this year that you might see some aggregate tightness in certain markets on certain sizes. It's hard to tell at this moment, but I certainly think that, that's possible. If we see some of that, I think we could see some very discrete price changes maybe on a size basis later in the year. All of that's relative to aggregates. If we're speaking of cement, it's obviously a different circumstance. So keep in mind, this is not a nationwide cement business. This is a Texas Cement business. Cement is tight in Texas. We feel very good about the $8 increase that we put into effect on April 1. We expect all of that, for example, the stick in the North Texas market. We think most of that is going to stick in the central market as well. And again, as I think I indicated before, our intention -- stated intention, published intention by letters to our customers is another $8 a ton price increase on September 1 and to give you a sense of it, that's going to be the first midyear that we believe that market is going to see since 2014. So I think that gives you a good sense of at least the degree of confidence that we have in pricing in that market standing."

If we go through our business, we're not seeing significant hits from inflation as we look at it again. So if we think about the buckets that will be cost for us, our single biggest bucket is going to be personnel. I mean the biggest thing that we're going to be able to flex there is what overtime hours look like in some markets because we largely have the teams in place that we need to put the material on the ground. The other thing that on some occasions, can be a bit of a challenge in some circumstances be freight, as we indicated in the first quarter, freight was actually down because we're seeing less moved by rail. I mean, if that goes up later in the year, what I would suggest to you is that's probably going to be a relatively high-class problem. So we're certainly not concerned about that. Again, we've got a good set of vendors. We have a good supply chain in place. Most of our supply chain is domestic. We think that very much cuts in our favor. So again, as we're looking at our overall cost profile, so I'm very happy to report to you. We don't see anything on the cost profile that we feel like is going to be anything in a particular moment. I'll turn it to Jim to see if he has anything he'd like to add to that."

One, look, Tiller, if we were talking about Tiller 10 years ago, we would actually beginning a lot of details on Tiller because it would have been material to this company 10 years ago. It's not material today. So Tiller, a very nice acquisition, but having done Tiller number one, it's important to state that, that doesn't do anything to draw down our firepower for the rest of the year. So let's start with that notion. So we've done one. It's completely consistent with SOAR, and we like it very much. Number two, the pipeline of deals that we're looking at is a pretty robust pipeline right now. And I will share with you some of them are larger than Tiller. Some of them are smaller than to so it's impossible to know exactly how any of those will go. I think our team has consistently had a very disciplined approach to M&A. That's what you will continue to see us do. I do think we were very clear in outlining areas in which we wanted to grow during Analyst and Investor Day and making sure that we went to those markets where we did not have a leading position and seeing if we could find a way to a leading position in those markets what's important. And again, that's completely consistent with what we did in Tiller. With respect to timing, I'm not necessarily seeing people wanting to get things closed necessarily faster. I think most of them are more focused on either generational changes within a company or they're focused with a different strategy that they may be looking toward. Everybody is focused, as you would imagine, that's our week on value. And so the conversations around that are important. Equally are the synergies that we feel like we can pull out of transaction. So obviously, we're measuring those very carefully. And I think if we go back over time and look at the value that we've been able to deliver, whether it was on TXI or River for the Rockies or what we did with Bluegrass or otherwise. I think our track record there is good, and it's certainly our hope to be busy on the M&A front for the rest of the year. But what I would suggest to you in that respect is there's more to come."

I think infrastructure is going to become increasingly better. And I would say that because if we're looking at our top 5 states, which again, are going to be over 70% of our revenue. When we think about what that looks like. I mean Texas fiscal year 2021 letting levels of $1.5 billion from a tech top perspective is a 22% increase from where it was in 2020, and that's a very attractive number. Equally, if we look at NCDOT, their fiscal year 2021 blending schedules are projected at $1.3 billion, and that's up from $670 million. So again, those are big movements. And even , which you know David, has long had a very attractive infrastructure budget is indicating higher learnings this year and they're emphasizing projects that they feel like are ready to go. So if we come back to a couple of states that are also important to us, Georgia and Colorado, those states, we're seeing is relatively flat year-over-year. But I think something that's worth keeping in mind is a lot of the COVID-19 economic relief that went to the dots are about to find their way into the system as well. So keep in mind, Colorado got $134 million in that process. And Georgia got $323 million in that process. So we think infrastructure is going to continue to get increasingly attractive. And depending on what happens in D.C., it could really become increasingly attractive next year. I think the thing that will continue to be moved by is how solid the non-res market is. And you can see it in the percentages that we talked about in today's release, the market for industrial, logistics and data center facilities continues to flourish. And clearly, that's benefiting from the critical role that these facilities play in supporting business operations, and we think we're incredibly well positioned to serve markets like Atlanta, DFW, Austin, San Antonio, Des Moines, Omaha, Indianapolis and others. What's important there, though, David, is we're seeing what we thought we would see, but we're seeing it modestly earlier. And that is, if you recall, when we gave our guidance at the beginning of the year, our view was we thought we would start to see some green shoots in light non-res and have to. I think the words we used where we thought we would start to see that inflect then we still do. But what's encouraging is we're seeing some of that in some markets even earlier than we would have thought. So for example, if we're looking in Atlanta today, clearly, Atlanta is seeing a significant uptick in corporate relocations and expansions, which plays well into the light piece of it. Equally, Colorado is seeing good light commercial in office and retail, and that's starting to pick up now. And that's an area that we knew would come because it's going to follow housing with a lag, we just thought the lag might be a little bit longer. And then importantly, as we're looking at residential today, we think Martin Marietta with the southeast, southwestern footprint. Is particularly well positioned to benefit from what's happening with housing. So again, if we put housing in context, the 30-year average for single-family starts is $1 million. So if we consider that a 3 is a key threshold for what we think is normalized aggregates focused demand, where we think we're going to be for the next several years. And that dimension is pretty exciting because we talked about at the Analyst Investor Day that there's a correlation between single-family starts and aggregates intensity with a 1 year lag, that's at about 99%. And if you look at the March 2021 seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing in the United States for single family starts, it was at $1.2 million. And again, the last time we saw numbers like that, were back in 2007 and back in 2001. And by the way, we like the way the market was looking at both of those times. So I think infrastructure is clearly getting better we think non-res and the heavy sign is attractive right now, but we think light is getting better. And we think housing, but in particular, single-family housing in Martin Marietta markets is really being held back only by availability today. And again, when we're trying to rank problems, David, that's probably a high-class problem."

And clearly, the cement commentary that I offered was different than that because we are already seeing tightness in a very large market in Texas. But back to your commentary, what we've long said is pricing on a percentage tends to follow volume to a degree on a percentage with a bit of a lag. So Garik, if you're looking at the marketplace, and you're saying, look, I know you've got a markup going on in-house T&I on an infrastructure bill. You've got a markup going on in Senate EPW on an infrastructure bill. It looks like something is going to happen. It looks like something is going to happen this year. It looks like whatever that something is, is likely to be the biggest something that we've seen in 15 years. I think that bodes well. If we go back to the commentary that I was just offering to David, in his question relative to non-res and res, we think that's probably pretty healthy too. So I think coming back to the proposition that you're offering, if the volume is going to be there, I do think it gives the opportunity for there to be pricing ahead of what we've seen over the last several years because keep in mind, that's been very much in a volume muted environment. So the pricing that we just offered you through the course of this conversation is with aggregate volume is actually down 3% in the quarter. And by the way, we anticipated that. So I think the proposition that you've offered is right. I think there's still more to watch and more to come, but I have a hard time thinking that what you posed isn't, where we would think about it, Garik."

If you're looking for things that will be a headwind. I think the biggest single headwind the industry will likely face will be diesel fuel. So remember last year, energy was quite low. But if we think about what we're seeing, we think pricing is going to continue to be very attractive for us. We think geographic mix is likely to be attractive for us this year because keep in mind, we had a record year last year with North Carolina really sitting on the bench. And North Carolina is not sitting on the bench at all anymore. We equally believe that our aggregates business in Texas and our cement business in Texas is going to perform very, very well this year. We think Colorado is going to have a very attractive year. The only thing that's wrong in Colorado in '21 is that Colorado had a super '20. So keep in mind, they had a very wet '19 that deferred work from '19 into '20. And then they literally had the perfect storm in '20 with beautiful weather and a late winter setting in so I think Jim is giving you a good sense, of course, some of the good guys and bad guys are. I think there are a lot more good guys than bad guys. So I think 1 more good guy, I want to make sure we call out because they really don't get the credit that they deserve is what we think is happening with respect to Magnesia Specialties as well. And again, this is a real differentiator for Martin Marietta. Q1 revenues of $65 million represents almost a 9% increase over the prior year. And that's led by what Jim was referring to earlier, so it's a nice year research and steel industry. So if we're looking at domestic steel, that's rebounded now to 78% capacity keep in mind, when we were about half year last year, that was a 51% utilization. So again, we're seeing even in that line of our business, a very nice recovery and we're seeing record Q1 gross profit in that business. But importantly, we're seeing record margin percentages in that business that correspond with what it was seeing a year ago in Q1. So we feel like both on the Magnesia Specialties business and the materials business, we're at a very attractive place where there's going to be more of this goodness that goes forward, then we're going to get back."

And the short answer is, look, if we look that $10 billion of the COVID economic release that's already out there. We talked about some of the dollars that had gone specifically to places like Georgia, $323 million and in Colorado. And I mean, to put some more context to it, if we look at Texas, that was $914 million, North Carolina, $260 million, in Florida it's $473 million, even in a state like Indiana, $238 million. So these are dollars that can move needles. Answer to number one, do we see that a decent piece of it going late '21 or into '22, I think the answer is yes, we do. Do we think we're going to see a new highway build at notably higher numbers, either through the reauthorization process or other processes, we believe that we will. We think that will likely impact '22, but we think that's probably likely to be even more impactful by the time we get to '23. Now with respect to the ability to meet what that need is going to be, I would say, several things: One, contractors have been hiring because they had the ability to hire during periods of time when labor was tighter in other places. So we believe contractors are going to be in a position to meet this amped up need in an appropriate and responsible ways. Importantly, from a material supply perspective, what I can tell you is we have a business that would have the ability should we need to, to put about 250 million tons of material on the ground. And if you look at what we produced and sold last year, I'd say it was 180-some materials -- tons of materials. So our ability to ramp up, if we needed to, is there, it's present. And what's important to state, and I think this goes back to the essence of your question, Mike, we would not have to put notable capital in to do it. We might have to run some longer hours to do it. But we could certainly do that without having to go deep to the well on CapEx. So I hope that helps."

Number one, I",590,"Look, you're right, ESG is clearly taking up a new form of debate, both in the United States and as you're well aware, internationally. I would say several things. I do think there are opportunities for Martin Marietta as we go through that. Number one, I think resilient construction is going to be an important part of any dialogue relative to ESG. And I think we can demonstrate that the types of constructions in which we will participate tend to meet that criteria, number one. Number two, if we're looking at when farms and when generation of power, 1 of the things that we called out specifically last year, we were seeing -- I think it was in Q4 tonnage was down over 1 million tons just in our Midwest Division because we had seen that division not having as much tonnage go out to 1 energy projects because some tax credits that historically had been in place had expired. So we're seeing more tax credits going toward wind energy, and we believe that we will. We think the opportunities are there for that. I think another area of focus is likely to be relative to water and into infrastructure that's underground. And I think people are particularly sensitive to degrees of water that communities are simply losing on a year in, year out basis, we think our products are going to be vitally important in that as well. Now with respect to green and recycle, and how that's going to work in different markets and the degree to which recycle concrete or otherwise could become more ubiquitous. I would offer several things. One, specifications are still going to be drawn up by, obviously, our friends at ASTM, the federal government in different state dots. Keep in mind, cross stone is an essential element in the manufacturer of ready mix concrete. It's essential in hub mix asphalt. At least in the recycled asphalt paving that we see. The primary component of recycle that's valuable to contractors and that, it's not so much the stone but rather the bitumen or the liquid asphalt that's in that. So we think we'll continue to see that. But even most state dots that are aggressive with what can be used on wrap or recycled asphalt saving, it's 25% or 30%. And so we don't think that's going to be a significant replacement for aggregates. And equally, while you can have certain degrees of crushed concrete that can serve as a commercial base. In most instances, it will still not meet a clean stone specification for use in heavy highway airport or other work. The other thing to remember, Paul, and this is so important. And that is despite the fact that our company has seen a nice increase and a steady increase in pricing over time. We're still selling aggregates on average for, let's call it, $14, $15 a ton. It's very difficult to have even a green product that can substitute for aggregates, that's going to be a cost-effective product in that respect because even when people are utilizing recycled concrete, oftentimes, there's rebar in that concrete, which means the crushing process tends to be quite complicated. So you asked me what time it was. I probably told you how to build a clock, but it's a great question, and it's complicated. It's something we've given a lot of thought to, but we have a lot of resilience around the view that this is an industry that is here for a long time."

Thanks to the company's",1176,"Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. As evidenced by our first quarter results and successful targeted growth initiatives, it's clear that Martin Marietta is off to an impressive start in 2021. Thanks to the company's differentiated business model and proven strategic operating analysis and review plan, what we refer to as SOAR, we remain well positioned for continued success. As we look to the remainder of 2021 and beyond, we expect to build on a track record of strong financial, operational, integrated and safety performance. 
Supported by our team's steadfast commitment to safe and efficient operations, price discipline and operational excellence, we established first quarter records for revenues, profits and safety. Both Building Materials and Magnesia Specialties benefited from strengthening product demand. Specifically, consolidated products and services revenues increased 3% to $922 million, consolidated gross profit increased 23% to $175 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 37% to $204 million and diluted earnings per share grew over 2.5x to $1.04. 
We also achieved the best first quarter safety performance in Martin Marietta's history with company-wide lost time and total injury incident rates exceeding or trending at world class levels. At the same time, we are thoughtfully executing on our SOAR growth priorities to enhance our geographic footprint and grow our business. As announced in this morning's release, we successfully completed the acquisition of Tiller Corporation the leading aggregates and hot mix asphalt supplier in the Minneapolis St. Paul region and welcomed more than 200 talented employees to the Martin Marietta team. Tiller provides an upstream materials platform in one of the largest and fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the Midwest and expands and complements the product offerings of our existing operations in surrounding markets. Tiller's cultural fit, attracted margins and value over volume operating philosophy directly aligned with our central division operations. We expect a seamless and successful integration.
Now let's turn to the company's first quarter operating performance. The Building Materials business saw strengthening product demand from single-family housing growth, infrastructure investment and notable heavy industrial projects of scale in our key geographies. Our aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete business in Texas, our largest revenue-generating state experienced temporary disruptions from February's historic winter ice storm and subfreezing temperatures. Additionally, our aggregates and downstream operations in Colorado, our second largest state by revenues, faced a challenging comparison as our results in the same period last year, benefited from unseasonably favorable weather conditions in the Rocky Mountains. 
Overall, aggregate shipments declined 3%, in line with our expectations, given return to typical first quarter seasonality factors and the largely non-COVID-19 impacted prior year quarter. Notably, East Group aggregate shipments increased as the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida and Maryland, benefited from strong residential and heavy industrial nonresidential activity. This growth offset lower shipments in the Midwest from more seasonal construction activity and reduced wind energy projects. While underlying product demand remains robust, unfavorable winter weather conditions in both Texas and Colorado and a softer energy sector market resulted in an 8% decline in West group shipments. Aggregates average selling price increased 3.4% or 2.5% on a mix adjusted basis. These pricing gains supported by our locally driven pricing strategy, highlight contractor confidence and underlying construction activity in the attractive markets that we serve. East Group pricing increased 4% with both East and Central divisions contributing solid growth, geographic mix from a lower percentage of higher-priced long-haul shipments limited to West Group's pricing gain to 2%. 
Our cement business delivered strong first quarter operating performance and shipment growth despite the disruptions from February's historic storm, I'm extremely grateful to our teams, their actions to proactively winterize and take our plants offline, allowed us to quickly return to normal production capacity post storm. To that effect, our cement operations established an all-time record from monthly shipments in March, demonstrating the robust demand and construction activity throughout the Texas triangle. Mix adjusted pricing grew 2% during the quarter. Annual cement prices went into effect April 1 and have garnered widespread support in both North and South Texas. We expect our Cement business will continue to benefit from favorable market trends supported by continued market type as in Texas and diversified customer backlogs.
Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Our ready mixed concrete operations established a first quarter record for shipments, which increased nearly 27% to 2 million cubic yards. Large nonresidential projects and incremental volume from operations acquired late last year contributed to double-digit shipment growth in Texas, which more than offset weather-related shipment declines in Colorado. Concrete pricing declined 2%, reflecting geographic mix from a higher percentage of lower-priced Texas shipments.
Our Colorado asphalt and paving business lost production days from a return to more typical winter weather conditions versus the prior year period, resulting in reduced asphalt shipments. As well pricing, however, improved 8%. Colorado market fundamentals remained strong, supported by healthy bidding activity and overall customer optimism.
Looking ahead, we remain confident that Martin Marietta's attractive market fundamentals and accelerating long-term secular trends across our 3 primary end-use markets will drive sustainable, construction led, aggregates intensive growth for the foreseeable future. We are encouraged by the recent initial bold steps to advance much needed infrastructure investment and a general consensus for success or legislation to the fixing America's surface transportation, or FAST Act in the coming months. With both congressional chambers working on their own reauthorization proposals, we're optimistic that a FAST Act replacement and increased funding levels will be passed before its expiration in September generating meaningful shipment benefits in 2022 and beyond.  
In the meantime, state and local infrastructure funding remains resilient. Estimated fiscal 2021 lettings for our top 5 state departments of transportations or DOTs, are currently above or near prior year levels. Keep in mind, our top 5 states, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, are disproportionately important to our business, representing 71% of total revenues for our 2020 Building Materials business. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 30% of first quarter shipments, well below our 10-year historical average of 43%. 
The nonresidential construction continues to benefit from increased investment in aggregates intensive heavy industrial warehouses and data centers, broadly offsetting weakness in the more COVID-19 impacted like commercial and retail sectors. Light nonresidential activity should benefit from the attractive drag along effects of strong single-family residential growth in the longer term, in some regions, we're now seeing early signs of that recovery. Aggregates shipments to the nonresidential market accounted for 37% of first quarter shipments. Martin Marietta's leading southeastern and southwestern footprint positions our company to benefit from single-family housing growth given underbilled conditions, favorable population and employment dynamics, land availability, mild climates and lower cost of living in these regions. Importantly, single-family housing is 2 to 3x where aggregates intensive than multifamily construction given the ancillary nonresidential and infrastructure needs to build out new suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 27% of first quarter shipments.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our first quarter financial results. Jim?"

Surpassing the previous record set in the first quarter of 2007. The Building Materials business established first quarter records for revenues and profitability. Products and services revenues increased 3% and to $857 million, while gross profit increased 25% to $148 million. We continue to drive sustainable and best-in-class aggregates unit profitability growth through the combination of price discipline and operational excellence. 
For the quarter, aggregates gross profit per ton shipped improved 34% to $3.28 and product gross margin expanded 490 basis points to 21.3% despite lower shipment volumes. In addition to pricing gains, lower contract services and internal freight costs contributed to these improvements. Our cement operations benefited from a 3% top line improvement. However, extended kiln downtime, reduced production levels and nearly $7 million of incremental energy and other costs all directly due to February's Texas deep freeze, led to a 1,160 basis point degradation in product gross margins. While these weather disruptions were headwinds to our first quarter results, our cement business is well positioned to benefit from growing demand and tight supply and remains on track to achieve its full year guidance. 
Ready mixed concrete product gross margin improved 520 basis points to 8.3%, driven by double-digit shipment growth and lower delivery and raw material costs. Magnesia specialties continued to benefit from improving domestic steel production and global demand for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $65 million, a 9% increase. Higher shipment and production levels, combined with ongoing cost management, resulted in product gross margins of 43.5% and which matched the first quarter record established in the prior year. 
Now a look at our cash generation and capital allocation. The first quarter was a record for cash generation. Operating cash flows of $192 million increased 80%, driven by earnings growth and a reduction in working capital. We continue to balance our disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business. While maintaining a healthy balance sheet and financial flexibility. Our priorities remain focused on value enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the consistent return of capital to shareholders. All while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating profile. We continue to prioritize high-returning capital projects, focused on growing sales and increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion. Full year capital expenditures are expected to range from $425 million to $475 million. Additionally, since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned nearly $1.9 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. Our first quarter earnings and cash generation were both records. As a result, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio stood at 1.8x as of March 31, slightly below our target leverage range of 2 to 2.5x. 
As Ward highlighted, our disciplined execution of SOAR 2025 is underway. Last week, we completed the Tiller acquisition. We expect this acquisition to be immediately accretive to earnings and cash flow and contribute $170 million of revenues and $60 million of adjusted EBITDA in the remaining 8 months of 2021. We financed the transaction using a combination of cash on our balance sheet and drawing an accounts receivable credit facility. 
Our full year 2021 guidance remains unchanged from the guidance provided in February and excludes the expected contribution of the Tiller acquisition. That said, we will revisit our 2021 guidance when we report our half year results. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward."

One, the guidance that we've reaffirmed this morning is simply our heritage guidance. So again, we've given you revenue and EBITDA numbers for Tiller which you would need to go and add, obviously, to the heritage guidance to get what the effective guidance would be today. So that math is there. It's very easy to do. And the other thing that we've not done is changed guidance for the year here based on Q1. So remember, we're in an outdoor sport, and this has been January, February and March, and our view was changing it after those 3 months feels a bit premature to us. And again, I think we came out with guidance at the beginning of the year that was modestly ahead of where others have come out as well. So I think we have seen some degrees of guidance change today. But I think in many respects, it's been an effort to more balance where we were when we came out at the beginning of the year. 
So that's where we are relative to heritage guidance, please to add to that, what we've given you with respect to Tiller. As Jim said in his prepared remarks, we will come back at half year and revisit guidance. One of the things, obviously, I think we'll be revisiting will be what is happening with cement. As you know, Kathryn, that's the second part of your question. We only have cement in Texas. And I'll draw several things to your attention. Number one, if we're looking at our backlogs in cement, the backlog in cement year-over-year are actually up pretty considerably. We're seeing cement tons up 24%. So number one, that's a nice takeaway. Number two, the results that we turned in for the first quarter were despite the fact that, that business was effectively shut down for 11 days in February when Texas dealt with some unseasonably cold weather. We incurred about $7 million of expenses in cement business tied directly to energy and other pure production costs. We also had some inefficiencies that came from that. That ended up giving us effectively nearly a $14 million headwind, simply driven by that 11-day period. 
The other thing that I'll point out is, obviously, we do have a price increase that went into effect on April 1. That's at $8 a ton in that marketplace. The other thing that we have done, recognizing that it's going to be tight in Texas this year on cement, we have put out a letter in the marketplace, and we've let our customers know that we're anticipating another $8 a ton price increase in September. So again, as we come back and give you some very specific answers to your question on cement and then ticking and tying that back to the guidance question. These are all a number of the variables that we will take into account as we revisit guidance at half year."

If we think about to the SOAR process, keep in mind, we've long said that",461,"I'll happy to. You led off with the right thing about is, look, we see this. It's accretive to cash and earnings in year 1. That's a nice place to start when we're thinking Tiller. If we think about to the SOAR process, keep in mind, we've long said that we have a leading position in 90% of our markets. Would that lead you to conclude that in 10% of the markets we're not 1 or 2. This was one of the 10% of the markets. So again, we like the Minneapolis, St. Paul Marketplace. We wanted to be a leader in that marketplace. Through our SOAR process, we had identified Minneapolis, St. Paul as an MSA in which we wanted to grow. We had identified Tiller specifically as a target that we wanted to see if we could bring into Martin Marietta. And there are several reasons for that. Number one, if we look at Minneapolis, St. Paul, it's the 12th largest MSA in terms of aggregate consumption in the United States. So one of the things that got my attention was when I saw that they're actually more aggregates consumed in Minneapolis, St. Paul, than there are in Charlotte, which was not something that I think is intuitive to a lot of people. 
The other thing that's worth noting is Minnesota maintains the nation's fifth largest highway system, and they've got a budget of about $3.8 billion, and about 90% of that goes to highways purchasing roads. So we like the way that they invest in that place. The other thing that I would say is this is a leading upstream business. It's aggregates led. It does have hot mix, but I want to be really clear here, Trey. It's not a laid out business. They're producing Blacktop that's basically being sold to contractors. So historically, tiller has operated through a couple of subsidiaries, Garwood Sand & Gravel, and that's literally their Sand and Gravel business and then a business called Commercial Asphalt. So those 2 businesses really comprise what they have. It's about 15-plus sites in the twin cities area. They've got a 30-year average pot life at their different locations. And again, they have an EBITDA there that lends very, very nicely with what we have in the Central division. So back to SOAR, back to leading positions and in markets that we feel like are going to be attractive near-term and long term, that's what Tiller brings this organization. The other thing that I would say is, philosophically, the organizations are extraordinarily well aligned. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we closed on that Friday, and we were absolutely thrilled to bring several hundred people from Tiller into the Martin Marietta organization, Trey."

What I would say is we're not updating guidance right now simply because it's Q1. Obviously, we're very excited about what we saw in Q1. We're really excited about the fact that places like North Carolina DOT are back. The other thing that we're seeing in Q1 that I think we'll continue to see through the year as price fell through very, very nicely. You saw that. The other thing that I think we know we saw in Q1 was very good cost performance. I anticipate that we will continue to see good cost performance throughout the year. I think that's where you can have some degrees of give and take. The fact was diesel is likely to become an increasing headwind as we go through the year. Frankly, in Q1, it wasn't much of a headwind. It wasn't much of a tailwind either, but if we look at some of the cost buckets in which we saw a nice outperformance year-over-year, freight, moving material from a producing location to a yard was actually nicely better year-over-year. Now if we see more sales going out of sales yards as the year goes on, obviously, that freight number would move. So with revenue, a number of things have moved with that. What I'll tell you as well as contract services were down. In other words, there were some stripping and other components that were down. Repairs were down, and we think those are likely the types of things that we will be able to hold on to. And I think that's evidence of good capital spend. 
Equally, we saw lower personnel costs. If you recall, last year, we did do some restructuring that was not necessarily COVID related, the timing of it just worked out very, very nicely. So what I would encourage you not to do is, again, take the guidance that we've not changed and then just assume everything continues in a linear fashion. Again, that's why we want to come back at half year and address it. But again, I like the pricing dynamics that we're seeing in both aggregates and in cement. I think our teams have done an extraordinary job relative to costs. Again, if you're looking at gross profit per ton in the quarter, and you saw that going up at 34.5%. If you're looking cash gross profit per ton to growth, I mean, we were almost 23% on that from what I can tell, that looks like best-in-class types of metrics. So again, we're -- we feel very good about where we sit right now. And to be clear, we feel good about the balance of the year."

And as you know, our view typically is to live very tightly within the quarters. And we were doing that in large part because people were removing guidance last year. So I won't go into April, per se. I will say, clearly, there was nice momentum coming into Q1 relative to pricing, but I would say is there are no surprises. On the aggregates piece of it, it's working exactly the way that we would have anticipated and the way that we planned. You saw the breakdown between reported and mix adjusted, as we talked about the quarter, again, reported up 3.4%, mix adjusted at 2.5%. Again, that's very much within the guide that we've given. I do think it's possible this year that you might see some aggregate tightness in certain markets on certain sizes. It's hard to tell at this moment, but I certainly think that, that's possible. If we see some of that, I think we could see some very discrete price changes maybe on a size basis later in the year. All of that's relative to aggregates. If we're speaking of cement, it's obviously a different circumstance. 
So keep in mind, this is not a nationwide cement business. This is a Texas cement business. Cement is tight in Texas. We feel very good about the $8 increase that we put into effect on April 1. We expect all of that, for example, the stick in the North Texas market. We think most of that is going to stick in the central market as well. And again, as I think I indicated before, our intention -- stated intention, published intention by letters to our customers is another $8 a ton price increase on September 1 and to give you a sense of it, that's going to be the first midyear that we believe that market is going to see since 2014. So I think that gives you a good sense of at least degree of confidence that we have in pricing in that market standing."

If we go through our business, we're not seeing significant hits from inflation as we look at it again. So if we think about the buckets that will be cost for us, our single biggest bucket is going to be personnel. I mean the biggest thing that we're going to be able to flex there is what overtime hours look like in some markets because we largely have the teams in place that we need to put the material on the ground. The other thing that on some occasions, can be a bit of a challenge in some circumstances be freight, as we indicated in the first quarter, freight was actually down because we're seeing less moved by rail. I mean, if that goes up later in the year, what I would suggest to you is that's probably going to be a relatively high-class problem. So we're certainly not concerned about that. Again, we've got a good set of vendors. We have a good supply chain in place. Most of our supply chain is domestic. We think that very much cuts in our favor. So again, as we're looking at our overall cost profile, Timna, I'm very happy to report to you.

One, look, Tiller, if we were talking about Tiller 10 years ago, we would actually beginning a lot of details on Tiller because it would have been material to this company 10 years ago. It's not material today. So Tiller, a very nice acquisition, but having done Tiller number one, it's important to state that, that doesn't do anything to draw down our firepower for the rest of the year. So let's start with that notion. So we've done one. It's completely consistent with SOAR, and we like it very much. 
Number two, the pipeline of deals that we're looking at is a pretty robust pipeline right now. And I will share with you some of them are larger than Tiller. Some of them are smaller than to so it's impossible to know exactly how any of those will go. I think our team has consistently had a very disciplined approach to M&A. That's what you will continue to see us do. I do think we were very clear in outlining areas in which we wanted to grow during Analyst and Investor Day and making sure that we went to those markets where we did not have a leading position and seeing if we could find a way to a leading position in those markets what's important. And again, that's completely consistent with what we did in Tiller. With respect to timing, I'm not necessarily seeing people wanting to get things closed necessarily faster. I think most of them are more focused on either generational changes within a company or they're focused with a different strategy that they may be looking toward. Everybody is focused, as you would imagine, that's our week on value. And so the conversations around that are important. Equally are the synergies that we feel like we can pull out of transaction. So obviously, we're measuring those very carefully. And I think if we go back over time and look at the value that we've been able to deliver, whether it was on TXI or River for the Rockies or what we did with Bluegrass or otherwise. I think our track record there is good, and it's certainly our hope to be busy on the M&A front for the rest of the year. But what I would suggest to you in that respect is there's more to come."

I think infrastructure is going to become increasingly better. And I would say that because if we're looking at our top 5 states, which again, are going to be over 70% of our revenue. When we think about what that looks like. I mean Texas FY 2021 letting levels of $1.5 billion from a tech perspective is a 22% increase from where it was in 2020, and that's a very attractive number. Equally, if we look at NCDOT, their fiscal year 2021 blending schedules are projected at $1.3 billion, and that's up from $670 million. So again, those are big movements. And even Florida, which you know David, has long had a very attractive infrastructure budget is indicating higher learnings this year and they're emphasizing projects that they feel like are ready to go. So if we come back to a couple of states that are also important to us, Georgia and Colorado, those states, we're seeing is relatively flat year-over-year. But I think something that's worth keeping in mind is a lot of the COVID-19 economic relief that went to the DOTs are about to find their way into the system as well. So keep in mind, Colorado got $134 million in that process, and Georgia got $323 million in that process. So we think infrastructure is going to continue to get increasingly attractive. And depending on what happens in D.C., it could really become increasingly attractive next year. 
I think the thing that will continue to be moved by is how solid the non-res market is. And you can see it in the percentages that we talked about in today's release. The market for industrial, logistics and data center facilities continues to flourish. And clearly, that's benefiting from the critical role that these facilities play in supporting business operations, and we think we're incredibly well positioned to serve markets like Atlanta, DFW, Austin, San Antonio, Des Moines, Omaha, Indianapolis and others. What's important there, though, David, is we're seeing what we thought we would see, but we're seeing it modestly earlier. And that is, if you recall, when we gave our guidance at the beginning of the year, our view was we thought we would start to see some green shoots in light non-res and have to. I think the words we used where we thought we would start to see that inflect then we still do. But what's encouraging is we're seeing some of that in some markets even earlier than we would have thought. So for example, if we're looking in Atlanta today, clearly, Atlanta is seeing a significant uptick in corporate relocations and expansions, which plays well into the light piece of it. 
Equally, Colorado is seeing good light commercial in office and retail, and that's starting to pick up now. And that's an area that we knew would come because it's going to follow housing with a lag, we just thought the lag might be a little bit longer. And then importantly, as we're looking at residential today, we think Martin Marietta with the southeast, southwestern footprint. Is particularly well positioned to benefit from what's happening with housing. So again, if we put housing in context, the 30-year average for single-family starts is $1 million. So if we consider that as a 3 -- is a key threshold for what we think is normalized aggregates focused demand, where we think we're going to be for the next several years. And that dimension is pretty exciting because we talked about at the Analyst Investor Day that there's a correlation between single-family starts and aggregates intensity with a 1 year lag, that's at about 99%. And if you look at the March 2021 seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing in the United States for single family starts, it was at $1.2 million. And again, the last time we saw numbers like that, were back in 2007 and back in 2001. And by the way, we liked the way the market was looking at both of those times. So I think infrastructure is clearly getting better we think non-res and the heavy sign is attractive right now, but we think light is getting better. And we think housing, but in particular, single-family housing in Martin Marietta markets is really being held back only by availability today. And again, when we're trying to rank problems, David, that's probably a high-class problem."

And clearly, the cement commentary that I offered was different than that because we are already seeing tightness in a very large market in Texas. But back to your commentary, what we've long said is pricing on a percentage tends to follow volume to a degree on a percentage with a bit of a lag. So Garik, if you're looking at the marketplace, and you're saying, look, I know you've got a markup going on in-house T&I on an infrastructure bill. You've got a markup going on in Senate EPW on an infrastructure bill. It looks like something is going to happen. It looks like something is going to happen this year. It looks like whatever that something is, is likely to be the biggest something that we've seen in 15 years. I think that bodes well. If we go back to the commentary that I was just offering to David, in his question relative to non-res and res, we think that's probably pretty healthy too. 
So I think coming back to the proposition that you're offering, if the volume is going to be there, I do think it gives the opportunity for there to be pricing ahead of what we've seen over the last several years because keep in mind, that's been very much in a volume muted environment. So the pricing that we just offered you through the course of this conversation is with aggregate volume is actually down 3% in the quarter. And by the way, we anticipated that. So I think the proposition that you've offered is right.

If you're looking for things that will be a headwind. I think the biggest single headwind the industry will likely face will be diesel fuel. So remember last year, energy was quite low. But if we think about what we're seeing, we think pricing is going to continue to be very attractive for us. We think geographic mix is likely to be attractive for us this year because keep in mind, we had a record year last year with North Carolina really sitting on the bench. And North Carolina is not sitting on the bench at all anymore. We equally believe that our aggregates business in Texas and our cement business in Texas is going to perform very, very well this year. 
We think Colorado is going to have a very attractive year. The only thing that's wrong in Colorado in '21 is that Colorado had a superb '20. So keep in mind, they had a very wet '19 that deferred work from '19 into '20. And then they literally had the perfect storm in '20 with beautiful weather and a late winter setting in. So I think Jim is giving you a good sense, of course, some of the good guys and bad guys are. I think there are a lot more good guys than bad guys. So I think one more good guy, I want to make sure we call out because they really don't get the credit that they deserve is what we think is happening with respect to Magnesia Specialties as well. And again, this is a real differentiator for Martin Marietta. Q1 revenues of $65 million represents almost a 9% increase over the prior year. And that's led by what Jim was referring to earlier, so it's a nice year research and steel industry. So if we're looking at domestic steel, that's rebounded now to 78% capacity. Keep in mind, when we were about half year last year, that was at 51% utilization. So again, we're seeing even in that line of our business, a very nice recovery and we're seeing record Q1 gross profit in that business. But importantly, we're seeing record margin percentages in that business that correspond with what it was seeing a year ago in Q1. So we feel like both on the Magnesia Specialties business and the materials business, we're at a very attractive place where there's going to be more of this goodness that goes forward, then we're going to get back."

Is that going to also influence like how you think about what the opportunity is going to be for '22, '23 and beyond, because that seems to be a lot of capital flowing into the markets that could be coming pretty tight at then?"

And the short answer is, look, if we look that $10 billion of the COVID economic relief that's already out there. We talked about some of the dollars that had gone specifically to places like Georgia, $323 million and in Colorado. And I mean, to put some more context to it, if we look at Texas, that was $914 million, North Carolina, $260 million, in Florida it's $473 million, even in a state like Indiana, $238 million. So these are dollars that can move needles. Answer to number one, do we see that a decent piece of it going late '21 or into '22, I think the answer is yes, we do. Do we think we're going to see a new highway built at notably higher numbers, either through the reauthorization process or other processes, we believe that we will. We think that will likely impact '22, but we think that's probably likely to be even more impactful by the time we get to '23. 
Now with respect to the ability to meet what that need is going to be, I would say, several things: One, contractors have been hiring because they had the ability to hire during periods of time when labor was tighter in other places. So we believe contractors are going to be in a position to meet this amped up need in an appropriate and responsible ways. Importantly, from a material supply perspective, what I can tell you is we have a business that would have the ability should we need to, to put about 250 million tons of material on the ground. And if you look at what we produced and sold last year, I'd say it was 180-some materials -- tons of materials. So our ability to ramp up, if we needed to, is there, it's present. And what's important to state, and I think this goes back to the essence of your question, Mike, we would not have to put notable capital in to do it. We might have to run some longer hours to do it. But we could certainly do that without having to go deep to the well on CapEx. So I hope that helps."

But again, as I'm looking at markups that are underway in both EPW and the Senate and T&I in the house right now, there's a reason that they're marking that up, and there's the reason that I think they want to have mark upsell out by Memorial Day.

I do think there are opportunities for Martin Marietta as we go through that. Number one, I think resilient construction is going to be an important part of any dialogue relative to ESG. And I think we can demonstrate that the types of constructions in which we will participate tend to meet that criteria, number one. Number two, if we're looking at when farms and when generation of power, one of the things that we called out specifically last year, we were seeing -- I think it was in Q4 tonnage was down over 1 million tons just in our Midwest Division because we had seen that division not having as much tonnage go out to wind energy projects because some tax credits that historically had been in place had expired. 
So we're seeing more tax credits going toward wind energy, and we believe that we will. We think the opportunities are there for that. I think another area of focus is likely to be relative to water and into infrastructure that's underground. And I think people are particularly sensitive to degrees of water that communities are simply losing on a year in, year out basis, we think our products are going to be vitally important in that as well. Now with respect to green and recycle, and how that's going to work in different markets and the degree to which recycle concrete or otherwise could become more ubiquitous. I would offer several things. One, specifications are still going to be drawn up by, obviously, our friends at ASTM, the federal government in different state DOTs. Keep in mind, cross stone is an essential element in the manufacturer of ready mixed concrete. It's essential in hub mix asphalt. At least in the recycled asphalt paving that we see. The primary component of recycle that's valuable to contractors and that, it's not so much the stone but rather the bitumen or the liquid asphalt that's in that. So we think we'll continue to see that. But even most state dots that are aggressive with what can be used on wrap or recycled asphalt saving, it's 25% or 30%. So we don't think that's going to be a significant replacement for aggregates. And equally, while you can have certain degrees of crushed concrete that can serve as a commercial base. In most instances, it will still not meet a clean stone specification for use in heavy highway airport or other work. 
The other thing to remember, Paul, and this is so important. And that is despite the fact that our company has seen a nice increase and a steady increase in pricing over time. We're still selling aggregates on average for, let's call it, $14, $15 a ton. It's very difficult to have even a green product that can substitute for aggregates, that's going to be a cost-effective product in that respect because even when people are utilizing recycled concrete, oftentimes, there's rebar in that concrete, which means the crushing process tends to be quite complicated. So you asked me what time it was. I probably told you how to build a clock, but it's a great question, and it's complicated. It's something we've given a lot of thought to, but we have a lot of resilience around the view that this is an industry that is here for a long time."

Martin Marietta has once again reported impressive results, extending our strong track record of industry-leading performance and responsible growth. We delivered record profitability and the best safety performance in our company's history through the first half of the year. We're also making notable progress on our SOAR 2025 initiatives to further enhance our ability to capitalize on growing construction activity and favorable pricing dynamics in the post-pandemic landscape. We are confident about Martin Marietta's prospects for the remainder of 2021. 
In May, we announced an agreement to acquire Lehigh Hanson's West Region. Those of you who joined us early this year for our Investor Day were likely not surprised when you read the announcement. The acquisition, which is consistent with and advances to our 2025 provides a new upstream materials-led platform in 3 of the Western United States largest and fastest-growing mega regions. With this leading Pacific presence, we'll be well positioned to capitalize on long-term demand drivers from increased state infrastructure investment in California and Arizona as well as continued private sector growth across these regions. 
This strategic acquisition also provides Martin Marietta with an enhanced coast-to-coast geographic footprint and serves as a valuable platform for potential continued geographic expansion. We expect to close the transaction in the second half of 2021, following customary closing conditions. We look forward to welcoming the Lehigh West Region team to Martin Marietta. 
We're also very pleased with the performance of our recently acquired Tiller operations in the Minneapolis/St. Paul region, which exceeded management's initial expectations since closing on April 30. Tiller contributed 1 million tons each of aggregates and asphalt during May and June and provides Martin Marietta an upstream materials platform in one of the largest and fastest-growing Midwestern metropolitan areas while also expanding and complementing our product offerings in our existing operations in surrounding markets. Integration into our Central division is underway, and synergy realization is progressing as planned. This business remains on track to contribute $60 million of adjusted EBITDA this year. 
Martin Marietta has established a long track record of superior value creation by prudently balancing inorganic growth opportunities while maintaining our strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. Our latest acquisitions and successful growth initiatives demonstrate that SOAR and our disciplined capital deployment strategy continue to deliver significant value to our shareholders, customers and other stakeholders positioning our company for sustainable, long-term operational and financial success. 
Now let's turn to the company's second quarter performance. We achieved record second quarter revenues, gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per diluted share, driven by strengthening product demand, pricing gains across all product lines and meaningful contributions from the recently acquired Tiller acquisition. On a consolidated basis, products and services revenues increased 9% to $1.3 billion, adjusted gross profit increased 3% to $393 million, adjusted EBITDA increased 8% to $439 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $3.81. 
Our Building Materials business continued to benefit from single-family housing growth, infrastructure investment and heavy industrial projects of scale. Adverse weather, however, muted shipments, most notably in our top 2 revenue-generating states. Our aggregates, cement and ready-mix concrete operations in Texas experienced lower-than-expected shipment levels as a result of excessive rainfall. In fact, the second quarter was Texas' 11th wettest on record. Additionally, Colorado, home to our front range aggregates and downstream operations, surpassed average annual precipitation levels during the first half of the year. 
Second quarter aggregate shipments increased 1.5% on an organic basis and 3% in total. East Group total shipments grew 7%. Strong demand across all end-use markets in the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida and Maryland, combined with shipments from the acquired Tiller operations, more than offset lower shipments in the Midwest from weather-induced project delays. 
West Group shipments declined nearly 4% as mother nature interrupted otherwise robust construction activity in both Texas and Colorado. 
Organic aggregates average selling price increased over 3%, supported by our value over volume pricing strategy led by the East Group. Geographic mix from a lower percentage of higher-priced, long-haul shipments limited West Group's reported pricing gains. On a mix-adjusted basis, West group pricing increased 2.4%. We announced midyear price increases in a number of markets, which should further contribute to favorable pricing trends heading into next year. 
Our Texas cement business delivered solid operating performance despite significant precipitation that disrupted more than 1/3 of the quarter's available shipping days. Second quarter shipments declined less than 2% as major projects in South Texas, along with recovering energy sector activity, helped mitigate weather impacts. Notably, we established an all-time record for monthly cement shipments in June, largely due to the robust demand and construction activity throughout the Texas Triangle. 
Second quarter cement pricing increased 7% or 4% on a mix adjusted basis as annual increases went into effect on April 1. Additionally, we've announced a second price increase of $8 per ton on September 1 [indiscernible] The downstream businesses, ready mixed concrete shipments increased 8% despite significant weather headwinds, driven by incremental volume from large nonresidential projects and operations acquired last year in Texas. Concrete pricing increased modestly, reflecting geographic mix from a higher percentage of lower-priced Texas shipments. 
Overall, asphalt shipments increased 68% driven by contributions from the Tiller operations, which more than offset weather-related shipment declines in our Colorado asphalt and paving business. Colorado market fundamentals remain strong, supported by healthy bidding activity and overall customer optimism, organic asphalt pricing improved 4%. 
Looking ahead, we remain confident that Martin Marietta's attractive market fundamentals and accelerating long-term secular demand trends across our 3 primary end-use markets will drive increased levels of building activity and continued favorable pricing trends in the second half of 2021 and into the future. 
Demand for our construction products is growing, and we have both the ability and capacity to supply the needed building materials. However, transient contractor labor and supply shortages, compounded by weather deferred days that become increasingly difficult to recover as the year advances, can govern the near-term pace of overall construction activity. Fortunately, we expect work not completed this year to simply be pushed into 2022 and foresee bottlenecks like these moderating and throughput improving as federal unemployment benefits expire in September. 
We're also in the midst of the most significant seemingly bipartisan national infrastructure debate in a long time, with a number of proposals from both political parties to advance and address much needed investment. Regardless of the pathway to successor infrastructure legislation, all proposals provide for sizable increases in federal surface transportation funding over the Fixing America's Surface Transportation, or Fast Act. We're optimistic that meaningful progress in Washington, D.C. will be made, and a FAST Act replacement will be passed before its expiration in September. Such legislation would immediately stimulate economic growth, contractor optimism and job creation, while also driving meaningful product demand starting in late 2022 and beyond. 
Our company's top 5 states Department of Transportation, or DoTs, are well positioned to put increased transportation dollars to work. More specifically, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, which accounted for over 70% of our 2020 Building Materials revenues, have an abundance of projects in their backlog that would benefit from higher federal funding and generate growing demand for our products. At the same time, increased visibility and funding certainty at the federal level supports a healthy pricing environment for construction materials. 
For reference, aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 34% of second quarter shipments, well below our 10-year historical average of 43%. Nonresidential construction continues to benefit from increased investment in aggregates intensive heavy industrial warehouses and data centers. We're also beginning to see early signs of recovery in the more COVID-19-impacted like commercial and retail sectors, notably in key markets such as Denver, Atlanta and the Texas Triangle. 
Light nonresidential activity should be a more significant demand driver in 2022, given the attractive drag along effects of strong single-family residential growth. Aggregates shipments to the nonresidential market accounted for 36% of second quarter shipments. 
Martin Marietta continues to be a beneficiary of single-family housing growth across the Southeast and Southwest. Single-family starts remained strong despite higher home prices and longer material delivery times, supported by significant underbuilding over the past decade, low mortgage rates and accelerated the urbanization trends. Importantly, single-family housing is 2 to 3x more aggregates-intensive than multifamily construction given the ancillary nonresidential and infrastructure needs to build out new or expanding suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 25% of second quarter shipments. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our second quarter financial results. Jim?"

The Building Materials business posted products and services revenues of $1.2 billion, a 7% increase from last year's second quarter and product gross profit of $357 million. Aggregates established second quarter records for revenues and gross profit. Higher diesel costs and a $6 million negative impact from selling acquired inventory that was marked up to fair value as part of acquisition accounting are reflected in product gross margin of 34%. 
Excluding the acquisition impact, adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 34.8%, a 70 basis point decline versus prior year. In addition, gross profit per ton shipped improved modestly when excluding the impact of acquisition accounting. 
Cement product gross margin declined 870 basis points despite top line growth, driven by the timing and scope of planned kiln maintenance as well as higher energy and raw material costs. While our first half results were impacted by some weather-related headwinds, our cement business is well positioned to benefit from a growing demand and tight supply. 
Ready mixed concrete product gross margin declined 350 basis points to 7% as shipment and pricing gains were offset by higher costs for raw materials and diesel. Magnesia Specialties continued to benefit from improving domestic steel production and global demand for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $70 million, a 43% increase. Revenue growth more than offset higher energy costs for energy and contract services, driving a 260 basis point improvement [indiscernible] 
Relative to often cited broader economic questions regarding supply chain and inflation, we are pleased that our overall supply chain remains resilient with only a handful of indications of strain for some suppliers. 
On the cost inflation front, the only notable headwinds we have seen are from increased energy costs. For the second quarter alone, our total energy costs increased $24 million company-wide. Absent this headwind, our consolidated adjusted margins would have outpaced prior year, a testament to our team's commitment to cost control and operational excellence. We remain focused on the disciplined execution of our proven strategy and our long-standing capital allocation priorities that preserve our healthy balance sheet, financial flexibility and investment-grade credit rating profile. 
As Ward noted, we continue to balance value-enhancing inorganic growth opportunities with prudent capital spending and returning cash to shareholders. To that end, we have raised our full year capital spending guidance to $450 million to $500 million as we prioritize high-return capital projects focused on growing sales and increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion. 
Additionally, since our repurchase authorization announcement in February of 2015, we have returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. As of June 30, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9x. In late June, we accessed the capital markets to finance the Lehigh West Region transaction, issuing $2.5 billion of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.2% and weighted average tenor of 15 years. The bond sales settled in early July and, as such, is not reflected in our second quarter results. We expect pro forma leverage at year-end to be above our target range. 
Consistent with our practice of repaying debt following significant acquisitions, we are committed to returning to our target leverage range of 2 to 2.5x within 18 months following the closing of the transaction. As detailed in today's release, we have updated our full year guidance to reflect current expectations, the completion of the Tiller acquisition and the $2.5 billion bond offering. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range from $1.465 billion to $1.535 billion. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward."

But as we also indicated during -- when we were at the end of the first quarter, we thought we would see more midyear price increases than we've seen in years past. That's entirely what's happening. If we're looking on the aggregates side first and look at our East division, we're looking in a number of places for $1 a ton on clean stone, $0.50 a ton on base stone, all effective July 1. So that's something that we put into effect. 
But equally, we're looking at aggregate price increases midyear in the Southwest division. So for example, in North Texas, and for purposes of this read, Dallas-Fort Worth, we're looking at $0.50 to $0.75 a ton on September 1. In Austin, we're looking more at $1 a ton on August 1. At Hunterston, which was one of those found synergies from TXI, where we have the quarry in conjunction with the cement plant in New Braunfels, we're looking $0.50 to $1 a ton on August 1. And at Garwood, down just outside Houston Santa Gravel facility, looking at $1 a ton there. So that's what we're seeing on the stone side of it. 
Now equally, and I think this is important in our uniquely Texas business today, and we're also seeing it in ready mixed in Texas. So again, the type of backdrop that we anticipated we would see, Stanley, and I'm happy to report that to you."

Again, that's a market that we believe simply needs that. 
With respect to the maintenance in cement, you're exactly right. If you think back to '20, part of what we indicated coming into '21 is that we would spend more in cement maintenance. In fact, we had indicated to the market early on that we thought we would spend about $6 million more on kiln and finished mill outages in '21 than we did in '20. And really, Q2 was the time to do that. So if you're looking at the delta, on what we did last year in Q2 and what we did this year in Q2 on cement and maintenance, it was about $7.3 million different. So we spent that much more in Q2 than we did last year. 
So in other words, that full annual difference that we had anticipated that you should expect, we pretty much did that in Q2. So what we're expecting is a very comparable smooth run here in the second half of the year. And frankly, we're expecting better margins in that business in the second half of the year as a consequence."

Let's talk about the margin piece of first because, as Jim indicated in his commentary that was prepared, energy was up $24 million for the quarter. So I mean, that was a big number. And if we look at diesel fuel all by itself, that was up almost $15 million. So if we go and look at our diesel fuel usage, that was about a little bit over 12 million gallons, diesel fuel, up about $1.11 per gallon. So if we go and pull that energy piece of it out and look at the margins, actually, what you'll see on the margins across the enterprise is that adjusted gross margins actually improved over Q2 2020. 
What that tells me, Kathryn, is the underlying performance of the cost side of the business is actually doing extraordinarily well. So what I'm pleased with is the underlying cost is doing well, and we're seeing the price move forward in a way that we thought that we would, particularly as the economy continues to improve. 
Now with respect to your question on guidance, in particular, you're right, you had some things moving around. One, we did just drop in what we had indicated verbally before, and that was we expect $60 million of EBITDA contribution from the acquired Tiller operations. Equally, if we're looking at our cement business that has -- no pun intended, whether the decrease in Texas in February and then as we indicated, an extraordinarily wet Q2, we've taken cement down a little better. And of course, ready mixed is going to follow that. So we pulled that down a little bit. And as on paving in Colorado, had a very challenging year-over-year quarter. So we put those down. But we've equally taken Magnesia Specialties back up. So those are some of the broader puts and takes that we have. 
If we look overall at the pricing, we've really not changed pricing. We kept that very consistent with where we thought. Keep in mind, the midyears that we're putting in will not affect pricing that much this year is setting the stage even more robustly for 2022. And we did pull aggregate volume down just a hair. In large measure, we're just looking at the days in the year. It's not indication of any impact of robustness in the market. At some point today is just get shorter.

If you're looking overall at the volume, and again, the volume is going to have some degree of impact on ASP, if you think about geographic mix, the East Group in the first half was up 7%. Excluding Tiller, it was up 4%. But it's important to note that Tiller's pricing is about 30% lower than heritage Martin Marietta. So that actually gave us a modest headwind. 
And so if we're looking at what I think will be more clean stone sales most likely in the second half of the year, continued good performance in the East. And in some instances, we were selling some products that were in reserve. And typically, those tend to go for a relatively lower average selling price.

So we think that's going to moderate itself. So I think that's clearly going to come back and help on the margin piece of it. 
I think the other thing is if we simply look at what was happening in Texas and in Colorado, it's difficult to be as efficient as you want to be when you're dealing with those high degrees of rainfall as well. So we're entering a period of time that typically is dryer. We're entering a period of time that some of the midyears will play in. We're entering a period of time where I think we're going to see more clean stone going relative to base. And I think we're entering a period of time that you're likely to see less maintenance and repair, because in many respects, people are simply blowing and going in Q3. And so I think you take that combination of factors, and I think it comes back and addresses some of the margin questions.

So by and large, again, we're very happy with where the things are ending up. And just to put it in perspective, 2021's energy expense and diesel, while higher versus last year, it's pretty much in line with what we saw in 2019.

I guess the good news is I'm not sure that here, we were not surprised by it. So look, based on the way that we see it, it's an overall proposal of $1 trillion, 5 years, $550 billion in new spending. And really, if we're looking at roads and bridges straight, that's going to be, by our math, about $110 billion. That's going to be around $39 billion for public transport, another $66 billion for rail. And keep in mind, we're the largest balance producer in the country.  $25 billion for airports and about $17 billion for ports. So I mean, that's going to be a lot of work. 
What does that mean overall? I think it means several things. One, it's recognition that it's overdue. Number two, it's a recognition that, at least from our perspective, Trey, and you heard in the prepared remarks, you know having watched this business for a long time in this industry for a long time, typically, 40-some percent of our products is finding its way to highways, bridges, roads and streets, and we've been in the 30s for the last several years. And that's really evidence of the fact that there's not been the level of investment at the federal level that was needed. 
So if we're looking simply at the Senate bipartisan plan, and we're looking at what that means from a percentage up from baseline FY '21 appropriations under FAST, it's up about 46% from the baseline. So this is not a tripling number. And what I really liked about it, too, is if you look at the vote last night on basically the closure motion, what you're going to find is 67 senators voted for this and among them was Mitch. And so when we start looking at where Senate leadership is and who really came along to move that vote along, it was some pretty notable players. 
And the other thing that I think is important is, obviously, the pay fors are going to matter. And then when we look at the pay fors and at least how they've been pulled together in the Senate version, you've got a lot of repurpose COVID relief that's going into this. You've got some unused unemployment insurance that's going into it. And then obviously, they're going to be looking at degrees of economic growth that's going to be derived from their programs investment. In other words, dynamic scoring that's also going to be a piece of it. 
So the fact that you got that degree of a vote that it got that type of support from Senators Mangan,, Portman is and Macao, we think is important. And we think it helps put the industry an attractive place, not just from an infrastructure perspective going forward. But we believe residential is going to remain strong. We think heavy nonres is going to remain strong, and we think res is going to inflect that light portion of nonres. Long story short, we think this bill, if it's pushed forward into law, and we believe it will be before the FAST Act expires, puts the industry in a very attractive place for a multiyear run trade."

I think it's driven more by what is anticipated, I think, it's driven by a much higher degree of confidence. If we're looking at the condition of most DoTs in the East states, dots are actually in a very, very good place. For example, if we look at where North Carolina Department of Transportation is, I mean, their financial issues are very much in the past with 22 lettings, a $2.7 billion. That's up, I mean, if you can imagine, 260% from the prior year. 
So if we're looking at what's happening relative to homebuilding in these markets, if we're looking at what's going on with respect to infrastructure, if we're looking at a very healthy non-res environment as well in the East, it all looks very, very attractive, whether that's going to be in North Carolina or Georgia or South Carolina or Florida as well. 
The other thing that I think is really telling is when we pause and take a look at the backlogs. And backlogs are always something funny in this industry because as a practical matter, they usually represent only around 25% or 35% of annual aggregates and cement going forward. But it does give you a good dip stick into the tank to get a sense of where things are. And total aggregates backlogs is pretty attractive. It's around 13% ahead of prior year levels. So again, if we're going back to the notion of overall contractor confidence, if we're looking at people who are going to be busy and they know they're going to be busy, and then seeing broadly an overall inflationary market in a lot of different respects, it's actually a very appropriate and opportune moment for us to make sure that we're getting the value for a spec material that not everybody can put on the ground."

I mean, retail and hospitality are both already beginning to inflect, and we're starting to see strong corporate reloads here population trends are following that. We've got Apple and Google making significant investments here. 
And again, as we're looking in markets like Florida, office, hotel, retail and industrial activity in that marketplace actually continues to really be quite strong. A lot of what's driving it. And look, we get it. The U.S. has added, since 2000, over 48 million people in population.

Number one, we're thrilled to have Tiller as part of this organization. Culturally and otherwise, they fit wonderfully for us. You heard what I said in the prepared remarks, basically, in May and June, they sold 1 million ton of aggregates and 1 million tons of hot mix. By the way, I think in their history, that's the fastest they've ever gotten that 1 million tons in hot mix. 
I think what you're seeing is several things. One, the Minneapolis/St. Paul market is a good, healthy, Midwest market. It tends to be very steady. We're seeing good activity there. We talked before about the fact that Minneapolis/St. Paul actually consumes more tons of aggregates and hot mix on a per annum basis than even Charlotte does, which is a premier market here. So again, I think from a timing perspective and from a market perspective and putting their business together with ours in that important market to us, the timing was good. The operational synergies are going to be real. We have a lot that we can learn from each other. 
Tiller is extraordinarily good. On the asphalt side. They are already teaching us things that we can take from that. I think we can help them on the aggregate side. But I will tell you, they are very good on the aggregate side. So again, if we're looking at margins in that business, they tend to start with a 3. So again, I think everything that we were hoping that we would see in that transaction has come through. 
The other thing that's happening, too, is they have some very attractive real estate that they've been able to sell -- we've been able to sell that actually takes the overall purchase price paid for the business and pulls it down actually very nicely. So I'm happy to report to you, Garik, there's nothing about that transaction that, as you might be able to claim from my commentary that we're not gushing about right now. So we're very pleased with it. And think there are great things to come."

So what I would say is several things. What you're seeing in the business this quarter isn't so much an unusual pop. This is more like returning to usual for that business. So if we think about what was happening globally last year at this time, steel was in a very challenging place. Overseas chemicals was in a challenging place because in many respects, markets were closed. 
So if we go back to June of '20, steel was running at about 55% capacity. Today, it's running at around 83%. So that's a good, healthy number. Everything that we're seeing in that market tells us that we expect that business to run strong and remain strong, certainly for the rest of this year. The other thing that we're seeing is cobalt, and that ends up being an important market for us overseas, is up 52% since the end of 2020. So when we're looking at how the business is performing on steel, where it's performing relative to its chemicals business, all that's really quite good. 
And here's what's even more impressive because if you keep in mind, energy has actually been going up during much of this year. Keep in mind, that is a large kiln-driven business and portions of it, both in Woodville and in Manistee. And typically, as nat gas goes, it can have a profound effect -- or not a profound effect, a notable effect on the way that business is operating. And basically, what we're seeing is their ability to manage their costs extraordinarily well. They continue to get good pricing. And we believe that business, back to the essence of your question is, in fact, very, very durable, Mike. So we expect continued great things from that specialties. But again, thank you for the question."

That is the business that, in many respects, is running at capacity right now, and we recognize that. So much of what that business is doing is several fold. One, it is looking for ways to debottleneck and run things more efficiently. Number two, it continues to look at its product mix and will continue to drive more of what it's doing to its higher-margin products. They've had a great history of doing that. I'm sure they have a very broad future of doing that as well. 
Part of what's so difficult about that business, and it's one of the great things about the business is we produced 24% of the dolomitic lime in North America from our facility at. And opening, permitting and otherwise, the dolomitic lime plant is costly, it's very time-consuming. Both our facilities in Manistee and in Woodville have Title V operating permits, they operate very, very efficiently. So adding more capacity is something that's very difficult. We're always looking for responsible ways to grow the business. But I think in the near term, what you can anticipate is debottlenecking, focusing on higher-margin products. And at the end of the day, we're going to be focused on pricing in that business just as we are in the aggregates and cement business. So Joe, I hope that helps."

So I mean, clearly, DoT is in a much different, very healthy place right now. Keep in mind, that's an overall DoT with an annual budget of around $5 billion. 
So that's on the public side. But if we look on the non-res side, I would say several things. If you think about North Carolina really working from the middle of the state to a little bit further west, you want it from Raleigh Durham, then you go farther west the greens for a high point Salem and say on then to Charlotte, all markets in which we have leading positions. So if I think about what's going on in Charlotte, for example, from a non-res perspective, Charlotte continues to be a significant beneficiary of a lot of warehousing activity. You've got I-77, I-85 and a host of large thoroughfares that are coming together in what's effectively the capital, the Carolinas, if you think about it. 
What's important, too, is in places like Greensboro and the Triad. And again, we're seeing good warehousing. We're seeing good medical and surprisingly healthy retail activity there. But here's part of what I think is driving that. So for example, D.R. Horton recently announced their plans to build a 1,000 homes subdivision in Greensboro. What I'm going to suggest to you, Joe, if you go back in time and listened to the last time I was talking about somebody building a 1,000-home subdivision in the Triad, it's been a while. So the fact is, if you're seeing that type of single-family housing growth in the Triad, you're going to continue to see good non-res activity. 
And I spoke just a few minutes ago about what's happening here in the Raleigh-Durham area, with Apple, with Google, with generally what's happening in the Research Triangle Park. And keep in mind, when you've got North Carolina State University in Raleigh, the University of North Carolina in Chapell Hill and Duke University in Durham, you've got 3 large universities that tend to drive a lot of economic activity, and you've got state government here. And so this is an area that, in good times, does extraordinarily well in more challenging times. You're not going to say it's recession-proof, but it's pretty close. So those are the types of things that we're seeing in North Carolina, Joe."

Martin Marietta has once again reported impressive results, extending our strong track record of industry-leading performance and responsible growth. We delivered record profitability and the best safety performance in our company's history through the first half of the year. We're also making notable progress on our SOAR 2025 initiatives to further enhance our ability to capitalize on growing construction activity and favorable pricing dynamics in the post-pandemic landscape. We are confident about Martin Marietta's prospects for the remainder of 2021. 
In May, we announced an agreement to acquire Lehigh Hanson's West Region. Those of you who joined us early this year for our Investor Day were likely not surprised when you read the announcement. The acquisition, which is consistent with and advances toward 2025 provides a new upstream materials-led platform in 3 of the Western United States largest and fastest-growing mega regions. With this leading Pacific presence, we'll be well positioned to capitalize on long-term demand drivers from increased state infrastructure investment in California and Arizona as well as continued private sector growth across these regions.
This strategic acquisition also provides Martin Marietta with an enhanced coast-to-coast geographic footprint and serves as a valuable platform for potential continued geographic expansion. We expect to close the transaction in the second half of 2021, following customary closing conditions. We look forward to welcoming the Lehigh West Region team to Martin Marietta. 
We're also very pleased with the performance of our recently acquired Tiller operations in the Minneapolis/St. Paul region, which exceeded management's initial expectations since closing on April 30. Tiller contributed 1 million tons each of aggregates and asphalt during May and June and provides Martin Marietta an upstream materials platform in one of the largest and fastest-growing Midwestern metropolitan areas while also expanding and complementing our product offerings in our existing operations in surrounding markets. Integration into our Central division is underway, and synergy realization is progressing as planned. This business remains on track to contribute $60 million of adjusted EBITDA this year. 
Martin Marietta has established a long track record of superior value creation by prudently balancing inorganic growth opportunities while maintaining our strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. Our latest acquisitions and successful growth initiatives demonstrate that SOAR and our disciplined capital deployment strategy continue to deliver significant value to our shareholders, customers and other stakeholders, positioning our company for sustainable, long-term operational and financial success. 
Now let's turn to the company's second quarter performance. We achieved record second quarter revenues, gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per diluted share, driven by strengthening product demand, pricing gains across all product lines and meaningful contributions from the recently acquired Tiller acquisition. On a consolidated basis, products and services revenues increased 9% to $1.3 billion, adjusted gross profit increased 3% to $393 million, adjusted EBITDA increased 8% to $439 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $3.81. 
Our Building Materials business continued to benefit from single-family housing growth, infrastructure investment and heavy industrial projects of scale. Adverse weather, however, muted shipments, most notably in our top 2 revenue-generating states. Our aggregates, cement and ready-mix concrete operations in Texas experienced lower-than-expected shipment levels as a result of excessive rainfall. In fact, the second quarter was Texas' 11th wettest on record. Additionally, Colorado, home to our front range aggregates and downstream operations, surpassed average annual precipitation levels during the first half of the year. 
Second quarter aggregate shipments increased 1.5% on an organic basis and 3% in total. East Group total shipments grew 7%. Strong demand across all end-use markets in the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida and Maryland, combined with shipments from the acquired Tiller operations, more than offset lower shipments in the Midwest from weather-induced project delays. 
West Group shipments declined nearly 4% as mother nature interrupted otherwise robust construction activity in both Texas and Colorado. 
Organic aggregates average selling price increased over 3%, supported by our value over volume pricing strategy led by the East Group. Geographic mix from a lower percentage of higher-priced, long-haul shipments limited West Group's reported pricing gains. On a mix-adjusted basis, West Group pricing increased 2.4%. We announced midyear price increases in a number of markets, which should further contribute to favorable pricing trends heading into next year. 
Our Texas cement business delivered solid operating performance despite significant precipitation that disrupted more than 1/3 of the quarter's available shipping days. Second quarter shipments declined less than 2% as major projects in South Texas, along with recovering energy sector activity, helped mitigate weather impacts. Notably, we established an all-time record for monthly cement shipments in June, largely due to the robust demand and construction activity throughout the Texas Triangle. 
Second quarter cement pricing increased 7% or 4% on a mix adjusted basis as annual increases went into effect on April 1. Additionally, we've announced a second price increase of $8 per ton on September 1 for both North and South Texas. This represents the first midyear increase since 2014. Attractive demand drivers, continued market tightness and diversified customer backlogs will support sustainable construction activity and pricing for our Texas cement operations over the next several years. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses, ready mix concrete shipments increased 8% despite significant weather headwinds, driven by incremental volume from large nonresidential projects and operations acquired last year in Texas. Concrete pricing increased modestly, reflecting geographic mix from a higher percentage of lower-priced Texas shipments. 
Overall asphalt shipments increased 68% driven by contributions from the Tiller operations, which more than offset weather-related shipment declines in our Colorado asphalt and paving business. Colorado market fundamentals remain strong, supported by healthy bidding activity and overall customer optimism. Organic asphalt pricing improved 4%. 
Looking ahead, we remain confident that Martin Marietta's attractive market fundamentals and accelerating long-term secular demand trends across our 3 primary end-use markets will drive increased levels of building activity and continued favorable pricing trends in the second half of 2021 and into the future. 
Demand for our construction products is growing, and we have both the ability and capacity to supply the needed building materials. However, transient contractor labor and supply shortages, compounded by weather deferred days that become increasingly difficult to recover as the year advances can govern the near-term pace of overall construction activity. Fortunately, we expect work not completed this year to simply be pushed into 2022 and foresee bottlenecks like these moderating and throughput improving as federal unemployment benefits expire in September. 
We're also in the midst of the most significant seemingly bipartisan national infrastructure debate in a long time, with a number of proposals from both political parties to advance and address much needed investment. Regardless of the pathway to successor infrastructure legislation, all proposals provide for sizable increases in federal surface transportation funding over the Fixing America's Surface Transportation, or FAST Act. We're optimistic that meaningful progress in Washington, D.C. will be made, and a FAST Act replacement will be passed before its expiration in September. Such legislation would immediately stimulate economic growth, contractor optimism and job creation, while also driving meaningful product demand starting in late 2022 and beyond. 
Our company's top 5 states Department of Transportation, or DoTs, are well positioned to put increased transportation dollars to work. More specifically, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, which accounted for over 70% of our 2020 Building Materials revenues, have an abundance of projects in their backlog that would benefit from higher federal funding and generate growing demand for our products. At the same time, increased visibility and funding certainty at the federal level supports a healthy pricing environment for construction materials. 
For reference, aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 34% of second quarter shipments, well below our 10-year historical average of 43%. Nonresidential construction continues to benefit from increased investment in aggregates-intensive heavy industrial warehouses and data centers. We're also beginning to see early signs of recovery in the more COVID-19-impacted like commercial and retail sectors, notably in key markets such as Denver, Atlanta and the Texas Triangle. 
Light nonresidential activity should be a more significant demand driver in 2022, given the attractive drag along effects of strong single-family residential growth. Aggregates shipments to the nonresidential market accounted for 36% of second quarter shipments. 
Martin Marietta continues to be a beneficiary of single-family housing growth across the Southeast and Southwest. Single-family starts remained strong despite higher home prices and longer material delivery times, supported by significant underbuilding over the past decade, low mortgage rates and accelerated the urbanization trends. Importantly, single-family housing is 2 to 3x more aggregates-intensive than multifamily construction given the ancillary nonresidential and infrastructure needs to build out new or expanding suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 25% of second quarter shipments. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our second quarter financial results. Jim?"

The Building Materials business posted products and services revenues of $1.2 billion, a 7% increase from last year's second quarter and product gross profit of $357 million. Aggregates established second quarter records for revenues and gross profit. Higher diesel costs and a $6 million negative impact from selling acquired inventory that was marked up to fair value as part of acquisition accounting are reflected in product gross margin of 34%. 
Excluding the acquisition impact, adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 34.8%, a 70 basis point decline versus prior year. In addition, gross profit per ton shipped improved modestly when excluding the impact of acquisition accounting. 
Cement product gross margin declined 870 basis points despite top line growth, driven by the timing and scope of planned kiln maintenance as well as higher energy and raw material costs. While our first half results were impacted by some weather-related headwinds, our cement business is well positioned to benefit from a growing demand and tight supply. 
Ready-mix concrete product gross margin declined 350 basis points to 7% as shipment and pricing gains were offset by higher costs for raw materials and diesel. Magnesia Specialties continued to benefit from improving domestic steel production and global demand for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $70 million, a 43% increase. Revenue growth more than offset higher energy costs for energy and contract services, driving a 260 basis point improvement and product gross margin to 39.9%. On a consolidated basis, earnings from operations included more than $9 billion of acquisition related costs as well as a $12 million gain on the sale of property. This gain is nonrecurring in nature and should not be extrapolated for run rate purposes.
Relative to often-cited broader economic questions regarding supply chain and inflation, we are pleased that our overall supply chain remains resilient with only a handful of indications of strain for some suppliers. 
On the cost inflation front, the only notable headwinds we have seen are from increased energy costs. For the second quarter alone, our total energy costs increased $24 million company-wide. Absent this headwind, our consolidated adjusted margins would have outpaced prior year, a testament to our team's commitment to cost control and operational excellence. We remain focused on the disciplined execution of our proven strategy and our long-standing capital allocation priorities that preserve our healthy balance sheet, financial flexibility and investment-grade credit rating profile. 
As Ward noted, we continue to balance value-enhancing inorganic growth opportunities with prudent capital spending and returning cash to shareholders. To that end, we have raised our full year capital spending guidance to $450 million to $500 million as we prioritize high-return capital projects focused on growing sales and increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion. 
Additionally, since our repurchase authorization announcement in February of 2015, we have returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. As of June 30, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9x. In late June, we accessed the capital markets to finance the Lehigh West Region transaction, issuing $2.5 billion of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.2% and weighted average tenor of 15 years. The bond sales settled in early July and, as such, is not reflected in our second quarter results. We expect pro forma leverage at year-end to be above our target range. 
Consistent with our practice of repaying debt following significant acquisitions, we are committed to returning to our target leverage range of 2 to 2.5x within 18 months following the closing of the transaction. As detailed in today's release, we have updated our full year guidance to reflect current expectations, the completion of the Tiller acquisition and the $2.5 billion bond offering. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range from $1.465 billion to $1.535 billion. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward."

September 1 is going to be an important date in cement. We're taking that pricing up, as you indicated, $8 a ton. But as we also indicated during -- when we were at the end of the first quarter, we thought we would see more midyear price increases than we've seen in years past. That's entirely what's happening. If we're looking on the aggregates side first and look at our East division, we're looking in a number of places for $1 a ton on clean stone, $0.50 a ton on base stone, all effective July 1. So that's something that we put into effect. 
But equally, we're looking at aggregate price increases midyear in the Southwest division. So for example, in North Texas, and for purposes of this read, Dallas-Fort Worth, we're looking at $0.50 to $0.75 a ton on September 1. In Austin, we're looking more at $1 a ton on August 1. At Hunter Stone, which was one of those found centers used in TXI, where we have the quarry in conjunction with the cement plant in New Braunfels, we're looking $0.50 to $1 a ton on August 1. And at Garwood, down just outside Houston Sand & Gravel facility, looking at $1 a ton there. So that's what we're seeing on the stone side of it. 
Now equally, and I think this is important, Stanley. We're looking for that also in ready-mix, particularly in Texas. So we're looking ranges anywhere from $4 a cubic yard in Austin and in East Texas up to $6 a cubic yard in North Texas. So if we think about what we're seeing in midyears, we're seeing it in aggregates, we're seeing it in the East, we're seeing it in the Southwest, we're seeing in cement in our uniquely Texas business today, and we're also seeing it in ready-mix in Texas. So again, the type of backdrop that we anticipated we would see, Stanley, and I'm happy to report that to you."

Again, that's a market that we believe simply needs that. 
With respect to the maintenance in cement, you're exactly right. If you think back to '20, part of what we indicated coming into '21 is that we would spend more in cement maintenance. In fact, we had indicated to the market early on that we thought we would spend about $6 million more on kiln and finished mill outages in '21 than we did in '20. And really, Q2 was the time to do that. So if you're looking at the delta, on what we did last year in Q2 and what we did this year in Q2 on cement and maintenance, it was about $7.3 million different. So we spent that much more in Q2 than we did last year. 
So in other words, that full annual difference that we had anticipated that you should expect, we pretty much did that in Q2. So what we're expecting is a very comparable smooth run here in the second half of the year. And frankly, we're expecting better margins in that business in the second half of the year as a consequence."

Let's talk about the margin piece of it first because, as Jim indicated in his commentary that was prepared, energy was up $24 million for the quarter. So I mean, that was a big number. And if we look at diesel fuel all by itself, that was up almost $15 million. So if we go and look at our diesel fuel usage, that was about a little bit over 12 million gallons diesel fuel, up about $1.11 per gallon. So if we go and pull that energy piece of it out and look at the margins, actually, what you'll see on the margins across the enterprise is that adjusted gross margins actually improved over Q2 2020. 
What that tells me, Kathryn, is the underlying performance of the cost side of the business is actually doing extraordinarily well. So what I'm pleased with is the underlying cost is doing well, and we're seeing the price move forward in a way that we thought that we would, particularly as the economy continues to improve. 
Now with respect to your question on guidance, in particular, you're right, you had some things moving around. One, we did just drop in what we had indicated verbally before, and that was we expect $60 million of EBITDA contribution from the acquired Tiller operations. Equally, if we're looking at our cement business that has -- no pun intended, weathered the decrease in Texas in February and then as we indicated, an extraordinarily wet Q2, we've taken cement down a little better. And of course, ready-mix is going to follow that. So we pulled that down a little bit. Asphalt and paving in Colorado,had a very challenging year-over-year quarter. So we put those down. But we've equally taken Magnesia Specialties back up. So those are some of the broader puts and takes that we have. 
If we look overall at the pricing, we've really not changed pricing. We kept that very consistent with where we thought. Keep in mind, the midyears that we're putting in will not affect pricing that much this year. It's setting the stage even more robustly for 2022. And we did pull aggregate volume down just a hair. In large measure, we're just looking at the days left in the year. It's not indication of any lack of robustness in the market. At some point, the days just get shorter.

And you're right, what we're anticipating is we're going to see some accelerating pricing, and number of the things that we've seen during the first half of the year, that I think is important is we've seen considerably more base work than we have before. 
I think that's actually good because, as you may recall, base work ends up turning into finished work on top of that. So you're going to see several things. One, we believe North Carolina, Georgia and the East will continue to perform actually quite well. If you're looking overall at the volume, and again, the volume is going to have some degree of impact on ASP, if you think about geographic mix, the East Group in the first half was up 7%. Excluding Tiller, it was up 4%. But it's important to note that Tiller's pricing is about 30% lower than heritage Martin Marietta. So that actually gave us a modest headwind. 
And so if we're looking at what I think will be more clean stone sales most likely in the second half of the year, continued good performance in the East, and in some instances, we were selling some products that were in reserve. And typically, those tend to go for a relatively lower average selling price. I think it does back in triangulating around the number that you had indicated.

So we think that's going to moderate itself. So I think that's clearly going to come back and help on the margin piece of it. 
I think the other thing is if we simply look at what was happening in Texas and in Colorado, it's difficult to be as efficient as you want to be when you're dealing with those high degrees of rainfall as well. So we're entering a period of time that typically is dryer, we're entering a period of time that some of the midyears will play in, we're entering a period of time where I think we're going to see more clean stone going relative to base, and I think we're entering a period of time that you're likely to see less maintenance and repair, because in many respects, people are simply blowing and going in Q3.

And keep in mind, we're the largest balance producer in the country. $25 billion for airports and about $17 billion for ports. So I mean, that's going to be a lot of work. 
What does that mean overall? I think it means several things. One, it's recognition that it's overdue. Number two, it's a recognition that, at least from our perspective, Trey, and you heard in the prepared remarks, you know having watched this business for a long time and this industry for a long time, typically, 40-some percent of our products is finding its way to highways, bridges, roads and streets, and we've been in the 30s for the last several years. And that's really evidence of the fact that there's not been the level of investment at the federal level that was needed. 
So if we're looking simply at the Senate bipartisan plan, and we're looking at what that means from a percentage up from baseline FY '21 appropriations under FAST, it's up about 46% from the baseline. So this is not a trifling number. And what I really liked about it, too, is if you look at the vote last night on basically the closure motion, what you're going to find is 67 senators voted for this and among them was Mitch McConnell. And so when we start looking at where Senate leadership is and who really came along to move that vote along, it was some pretty notable players. 
And the other thing that I think is important is, obviously, the pay-fors are going to matter. And then when we look at the pay-fors and at least how they've been pulled together in the Senate version, you've got a lot of repurpose COVID relief that's going into this. You've got some unused unemployment insurance that's going into it. And then obviously, they're going to be looking at degrees of economic growth that's going to be derived from their programs investment. In other words, dynamic scoring that's also going to be a piece of it. 
So the fact that it got that degree of a vote that it got that type of support from Senators Manchin, Sinema, Portman is -- and McConnell, we think is important. And we think it helps put the industry in attractive place, not just from an infrastructure perspective going forward, but we believe residential is going to remain strong. We think heavy nonres is going to remain strong, and we think res is going to inflect that light portion of nonres. Long story short, we think this bill, if it's pushed forward into law, and we believe it will be before the FAST Act expires, puts the industry in a very attractive place for a multiyear run, Trey."

I think it's driven more by what is anticipated. I think, it's driven by a much higher degree of confidence. If we're looking at the condition of most DoTs in the East states, DoTs are actually in a very, very good place. For example, if we look at where North Carolina Department of Transportation is, I mean, their financial issues are very much in the past with 22 lettings, a $2.7 billion. That's up, I mean, if you can imagine, 260% from the prior year. 
So if we're looking at what's happening relative to homebuilding in these markets, if we're looking at what's going on with respect to infrastructure, if we're looking at a very healthy non-res environment as well in the East, it all looks very, very attractive, whether that's going to be in North Carolina or Georgia or South Carolina or Florida as well. 
The other thing that I think is really telling is when we pause and take a look at the backlogs. And backlogs are always something funny in this industry because as a practical matter, they usually represent only around 25% or 35% of annual aggregates and cement going forward. But it does give you a good dip stick into the tank to get a sense of where things are. 
And total aggregates backlogs is pretty attractive. It's around 13% ahead of prior year levels. So again, if we're going back to the notion of overall contractor confidence, if we're looking at people who are going to be busy and they know they're going to be busy, and then seeing broadly an overall inflationary market in a lot of different respects, it's actually a very appropriate and opportune moment for us to make sure that we're getting the value for a spec material that not everybody can put on the ground."

I mean, if we're looking in Colorado, I mean clearly, office, retail and hospitality is looking for a stronger inflection in half 2.

I mean, retail and hospitality are both already beginning to inflect, and we're starting to see strong corporate reloads here, population trends are following that. We've got Apple and Google making significant investments here. 
And again, as we're looking in markets like Florida, office, hotel, retail and industrial activity in that marketplace actually continues to really be quite strong. A lot of what's driving it -- and look, we get it. The U.S. has added, since 2000, over 48 million people in population. And what that's doing is it's driving what we're seeing now in single-family housing and then single-family housing is driving what we're starting to see inflect basically the way that we thought we would during Analyst and Investor Day here as we go into half 2, Phil.

Number one, we're thrilled to have Tiller as part of this organization. Culturally and otherwise, they fit wonderfully for us. You heard what I said in the prepared remarks, basically, in May and June, they sold 1 million tons of aggregates and 1 million tons of hot mix. By the way, I think in their history, that's the fastest they've ever gotten that 1 million tons in hot mix.
I think what you're seeing is several things. One, the Minneapolis/St. Paul market is a good, healthy, Midwest market. It tends to be very steady. We're seeing good activity there. We talked before about the fact that Minneapolis/St. Paul actually consumes more tons of aggregates and hot mix on a per annum basis than even Charlotte does, which is a premier market here. So again, I think from a timing perspective and from a market perspective and putting their business together with ours in that important market to us, the timing was good, the operational synergies are going to be real. We have a lot that we can learn from each other. 
Tiller is extraordinarily good. On the asphalt side, they are already teaching us things that we can take from that. I think we can help them on the aggregate side. But I will tell you, they are very good on the aggregate side. So again, if we're looking at margins in that business, they tend to start with a 3. So again, I think everything that we were hoping that we would see in that transaction has come through. 
The other thing that's happening, too, is they have some very attractive real estate that they've been able to sell -- we've been able to sell that actually takes the overall purchase price paid for the business and pulls it down actually very nicely. So I'm happy to report to you, Garik. There's nothing about that transaction that, as you might be able to claim from my commentary that we're not gushing about right now. So we're very pleased with it. And think there are great things to come."

So what I would say is several things. What you're seeing in the business this quarter isn't so much an unusual pop. This is more like returning to usual for that business. So if we think about what was happening globally last year at this time, steel was in a very challenging place. Overseas, chemicals was in a challenging place because in many respects, markets were closed. 
So if we go back to June of '20, steel was running at about 55% capacity. Today, it's running at around 83%. So that's a good, healthy number. Everything that we're seeing in that market tells us that we expect that business to run strong and remain strong, certainly for the rest of this year. The other thing that we're seeing is cobalt, and that ends up being an important market for us overseas, is up 52% since the end of 2020. So when we're looking at how the business is performing on steel, where it's performing relative to its chemicals business, all that's really quite good. 
And here's what's even more impressive because if you keep in mind, energy has actually been going up during much of this year. Keep in mind, that is a large kiln-driven business and portions of it, both in Woodville and in Manistee. And typically, as nat gas goes, it can have a profound effect -- or not a profound effect, a notable effect on the way that business is operating. 
And basically, what we're seeing is their ability to manage their costs extraordinarily well. They continue to get good pricing. And we believe that business, back to the essence of your question is, in fact, very, very durable, Mike. So we expect continued great things from that specialties. But again, thank you for the question."

That is the business that, in many respects, is running at capacity right now, and we recognize that. So much of what that business is doing is several fold. One, it is looking for ways to debottleneck and run things more efficiently. Number two, it continues to look at its product mix and will continue to drive more of what it's doing to its higher-margin products. They've had a great history of doing that. I'm sure they have a very bright future of doing that as well. 
Part of what's so difficult about that business, and it's one of the great things about the business is we produced 24% of the dolomitic lime in North America from our facility at Woodville. And opening, permitting and otherwise, the dolomitic lime plant is costly, it's very time-consuming. Both our facilities in Manistee and in Woodville have Title V operating permits and they operate very, very efficiently. 
So adding more capacity is something that's very difficult. We're always looking for responsible ways to grow the business. But I think in the near term, what you can anticipate is debottlenecking, focusing on higher-margin products. And at the end of the day, we're going to be focused on pricing in that business just as we are in the aggregates and cement business. So Joe, I hope that helps."

So I mean, clearly, DoT is in a much different, very healthy place right now. Keep in mind, that's an overall DoT with an annual budget of around $5 billion. 
So that's on the public side. But if we look on the non-res side, I would say several things. If you think about North Carolina really working from the middle of the state to a little bit further west, you went from Raleigh Durham, then you go farther west, Greensboro, High Point, Winston, Salem, then to Charlotte, all markets in which we have leading positions. So if I think about what's going on in Charlotte, for example, from a non-res perspective, Charlotte continues to be a significant beneficiary of a lot of warehousing activity. You've got I-77, I-85 and a host of large thoroughfares that are coming together in what's effectively the capital, the Carolinas, if you think about it. 
What's important, too, is in places like Greensboro and the Triad, again, we're seeing good warehousing. We're seeing good medical and surprisingly healthy retail activity there. But here's part of what I think is driving that. So for example, D.R. Horton recently announced their plans to build a 1,000 homes subdivision in Greensboro. What I'm going to suggest to you, Joe, if you go back in time and listened to the last time I was talking about somebody building a 1,000-home subdivision in the Triad, it's been a while. So the fact is, if you're seeing that type of single-family housing growth in the Triad, you're going to continue to see good non-res activity. 
And I spoke just a few minutes ago about what's happening here in the Raleigh-Durham area, with Apple, with Google, with generally what's happening in the Research Triangle Park. And keep in mind, when you've got North Carolina State University in Raleigh, the University of North Carolina in Chapell Hill and Duke University in Durham, you've got 3 large universities that tend to drive a lot of economic activity, and you've got state government here. And so this is an area that, in good times, does extraordinarily well; in more challenging times -- you're not going to say it's recession-proof, but it's pretty close. So those are the types of things that we're seeing in North Carolina, Joe."

Martin Marietta's continued growth and record results demonstrate our industry-leading performance and disciplined execution of our proven strategic operating analysis and review, or SOAR plan. And with fewer reportable and lost time incidents than this time last year, our company-wide safety incident rates are surpassing world-class levels. I'm proud to report that we're on track to deliver the most profitable and safest year in our company's history. We're also excited by the progress we're making on our SOAR 2025 initiatives to further position our company for sustainable, long-term operational and financial success. On October 1, we welcomed more than 1,200 talented employees to the Martin Marietta team as we successfully completed the acquisition of [ LeHigh Hansen's ] West region business. With this outstanding team, strong business and key assets now a part of our offering. We're well positioned to benefit from favorable market dynamics and accelerating public and private construction activity in important California and Arizona regions, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego and Phoenix. It also provides new growth platforms for our continued geographic expansion. I'm grateful to our colleagues for their dedication and perseverance in their efforts to complete the acquisition, the second largest in our company's history. We look forward to working together to seamlessly integrate the Lehigh West operations, quickly realize synergies and deliver significant stakeholder value. Integration activities are progressing as planned from both an operational and customer-facing perspective. 
As highlighted in today's release, we once again established record results for revenues and gross profit for both the quarter and year-to-date. To recap, for the first 9 months of 2021, our adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to a record $1.1 billion. Both our Building Materials and Magnesia Specialties businesses continue to capitalize on the ongoing economic recovery. During the quarter, organic shipment and pricing growth combined with value-enhancing acquisitions more than offset higher-than-expected energy-related costs and contributed to our record-setting results. Specifically, on a consolidated basis, Products and Services revenues increased 18% to $1.5 billion. Adjusted gross profit increased 11% to $450 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $490 million increased 13% on a comparable basis, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.25 grew 11% on a comparable basis. As a reminder, the prior year quarter included $70 million or $0.87 per diluted share of nonrecurring gains on surplus land sales and divested assets that affect quarter-over-quarter comparability. 
Now for a review of our third quarter operating performance. We continue to experience growing product demand across our 3 primary end-use markets. Organic aggregate shipments increased 6%, notwithstanding contractor capacity constraints and wet weather in several markets that govern the overall pace of construction activity. Notably, all divisions contributed to this solid growth, demonstrating our ability to capitalize on the strong underlying demand trends across our geographic footprint. Total aggregate shipments, including shipments from acquired operations, increased 10%. The organic aggregates average selling price increased 2%, reflecting a higher percentage of lower-priced base stone shipments during the quarter. Additionally, our East division, which has selling prices in excess of our corporate average, had the opportunity to meet customer needs with a low-priced excess fuel product that had we not shipped we otherwise would have incurred costs to relocate. We expect shipments of this excess fill material, which are profitable and not a substitute for higher-value products, to continue through the remainder of the year. That's why we updated our full year 2021 organic pricing growth guidance to now range from 2.5% to 3.5%. 
To be clear, aggregates pricing fundamentals remain very attractive. In fact, supported by strong underlying demand and rapid cost inflation in the broader economy, we successfully implemented midyear price increases in the Carolinas and Texas. These actions, combined with overall customer confidence and demand visibility bode well for meaningful pricing acceleration in 2022. Our Texas Cement business established a new quarterly record for shipments, which increased 4% to over 1 million tonnes. Large and diversified projects, recovering energy sector activity and incremental pull-through from our internal downstream customers, supported record monthly shipment levels in both August and September. Cement pricing increased 8% as the second round of price increases this year went into effect on September 1. 
Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready-mixed concrete shipments increased 23%, driven by large nonresidential projects and operations acquired late last year in Texas. Concrete pricing grew 2% following the implementation of midyear price increases in Texas. Additionally, we've announced a third price increase in the Dallas-Fort Worth market effective October 1. Asphalt shipments increased 116% overall, driven by contributions from our Minnesota-based operations acquired earlier this year. Our Colorado asphalt and paving business experienced shipment declines and supply disruptions from mid-summer liquid asphalt allocations throughout the Rocky Mountains. This circumstance has now been resolved. Despite these short-term issues, market fundamentals remain strong across the Colorado front range. Organic asphalt pricing improved modestly. 
Before discussing our preliminary 2022 outlook, I'll turn the call over to Jim to conclude our third quarter discussion with a review of our financial results and liquidity. Jim?"

Both the Building Materials and Magnesia Specialties businesses contributed to our double-digit growth in product revenues and increased profitability. That said, increased energy expense continues as a headwind, temporarily pressuring margins. For the third quarter alone, total energy costs increased $28 million or nearly 50% company-wide as compared with last year. Absent this headwind, our consolidated adjusted gross margin would have outpaced the record set in the prior year quarter. Aggregates product gross margin of 34.2% included higher diesel and other production costs as well as a $6 million negative impact from selling acquired inventory that was marked up to fair value as part of acquisition accounting. Excluding the acquisition impact, adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 34.9%, a 150 basis point decline versus prior year. Cement product gross margin declined 250 basis points driven by higher raw material cost and a $6 million increase in natural gas and electricity costs. Ready-mixed concrete product gross margin improved modestly to nearly 10% as shipment and pricing gains offset higher costs for raw materials and diesel. 
Magnesia Specialties continued to benefit from improving domestic steel production and global demand for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $72 million, a 30% year-over-year increase. Revenue growth more than offset higher costs for energy and contract services, driving a 100 basis point improvement in product gross margin to 39%. As part of our long-standing capital allocation priorities, we continue to balance value-enhancing acquisitions with prudent capital spending and returning cash to shareholders while preserving a healthy balance sheet, financial flexibility and investment-grade credit rating profile. Consistent with SOAR 2025, we acquired a crushed concrete aggregates producer in the Houston area in late July. These acquired aggregates operations expand our customer base and product offerings in one of the nation's largest addressable markets. We have raised our full year capital spending guidance to $475 million to $525 million to include anticipated Lehigh West region capital expenditures. We continue to prioritize high-return capital projects, focused on growing sales and increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion. 
Additionally, our Board of Directors approved a 7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend paid in September, underscoring its confidence in our future performance and a resilient and growing free cash flow generation. Our annualized cash dividend rate is now $2.44. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. In early July, we issued $2.5 billion of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.2% and a weighted average tenor of 15 years, primarily to finance Lehigh West region transaction. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9x as of September 30. Leverage on a pro forma basis, inclusive of reach acquisitions, is modestly above 3x debt to EBITDA. Consistent with our practice of repaying debt following significant acquisitions, we are committed to returning to our target leverage range of 2 to 2.5x within the next 18 months. As detailed in today's release, we have updated our full year 2021 guidance to reflect our year-to-date results that factor in higher energy costs and the fourth quarter contribution from the newly acquired Lehigh West business. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range from $1.500 billion to $1.550 billion. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward."

Looking beyond 2021, Martin Marietta remains well positioned to capitalize on attractive market fundamentals and secular demand trends across our geographic footprint, expanded federal and state-level infrastructure investment, single-family",805,"Thanks, Jim. Looking beyond 2021, Martin Marietta remains well positioned to capitalize on attractive market fundamentals and secular demand trends across our geographic footprint, expanded federal and state-level infrastructure investment, single-family housing strength, heavy industrial projects of scale and like nonresidential recovery should support growing construction activity and contribute to attractive pricing acceleration for heavy side building materials for years to come. Importantly, we have both the ability and the capacity to supply these needed products and supported by our locally led pricing strategy will do so in a manner that emphasizes value over volume. While navigating an imperfect legislative process, our nation is nonetheless on the cusp of achieving the most significant infrastructure action of this century. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which contains a 5-year surface transportation reauthorization and provides $110 billion in new funding for roads, bridges and other hard infrastructure projects passed the United States Senate in August with 69 bipartisan votes. Though the United States House of Representatives did not take up the bipartisan infrastructure bill last week before the then current short-term extension of the federal highway and public transportation programs expired on October 31, The House and Senate did approve a short-term program extension, keeping surface transportation funds flowing to the states through December 3. The consensus opinion with which we strongly agree is that this important legislation will be signed into law before year-end. Aside from the overall economic growth, we expect to occur with the increased federal transportation investment, the steps we've taken over the past decade to responsibly grow and expand our footprint will also benefit Martin Marietta's near and long-term outlook. 
Project lettings for our company's top 5 states Department of Transportation, or DOTs, continue to positively trend. Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, which accounted for over 70% of our 2020 Building Materials revenues, are well positioned from both the DOT funding and resource perspective to efficiently deploy increased federal and state transportation dollars in advance the growing number of projects in their backlogs. Notably, California, the nation's most popular state and the world's fifth largest economy becomes a top state for Martin Marietta, following the Lehigh West acquisition. Caltrans, California's Department of Transportation, manages a $17 billion annual budget. Additionally, the Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017, commonly referred to as Senate Bill 1 or SB1, provides $54 billion or approximately $5 billion annually through 2030 to fund state and local road, freeway and rail projects. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 36% of third quarter organic shipments, showing sequential growth since this year's second quarter, but still well below our 10-year historical average of 43%. 
Nonresidential construction continues to benefit from increased investment in aggregates intensive heavy industrial warehouses and data centers. We've also seen early signs of recovery in light commercial and retail sectors, notably in key markets such as Atlanta, Denver and the Texas triangle. Like nonresidential activity should be a more significant demand driver in 2022, given that it typically follows single-family residential development. Aggregate shipments to the nonresidential market accounted for 35% of third quarter organic shipments. Across our coast-to-coast footprint, single-family residential starts are expected to remain robust despite higher home prices and longer material delivery times. Significant underbuilding in commensurate with notable population gains over the past decade and accelerated the organization to support these trends. Importantly, single-family housing is 2 to 3x more aggregates intensive than multifamily construction given the ancillary nonresidential and infrastructure needs to build out new or expanding suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 24% of third quarter organic shipments. 
In summary, we believe our industry is about to see public and private sector construction activity [indiscernible] for the first time since its most recent 2005 peak, supporting both increased shipments and an attractive pricing environment for construction materials. For 2022, our preliminary view anticipates organic aggregate shipments will increase in the low to mid-single digits as contractor labor shortages and logistics challenges continue to impact an otherwise robust demand environment. Underpinned by our value over volume pricing strategy, we anticipate mid- to high single-digit growth in 2022 organic aggregates pricing. To conclude, we're extremely proud of our record-setting safety, operational and financial performance and look forward to continuing to build on that momentum into the fourth quarter and 2022. As a result of our thoughtfully developed and consistently executed strategic priorities, our company's future is bright. With our steadfast commitment to employee health and safety, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices and store execution, Martin Marietta intends to build the safest, best-performing and most durable aggregates-led public company poised to deliver attractive growth and superior value for all of our stakeholders.

Can you talk about some of the drivers behind that expectation, your comfort level there and maybe bridging that from this year? Is it more reliant on the more midyear increases? Or is this primarily a spring increase that's driving this? And then kind of as part of that, the pricing discussion, cement price announcements that we've been hearing about for next spring are pretty healthy. So maybe if you could speak to what you're thinking on that front as well as we go into next year?"

One, we saw a nice series of midyear price increases this year, and we saw that in 2 markets that matter a lot for us. We saw that in Texas, and we saw that in the Carolinas. So that immediately starts setting the framework for next year. Keep in mind, as I outlined in the prepared remarks, part of what we've seen this year is an optical headwind is, frankly, a higher degree of base sales that we've seen, particularly in the East as well as some bonds sales that have gone out of the East. What I think is important to keep in mind, Trey, is the pricing range that you see is really a heritage-driven range. In other words, we're not taking into account what we believe is going to happen in California and that we're not taking into account what we believe can happen in Minnesota in that. As a reminder, those markets historically have been below corporate average. So if I reflect on where we're positioning toward next year on the conversations that we have had with our customers to date and what we believe the overall economic environment is likely to be, we have a very high level of confidence in the ASPs that we're talking about for next year. 
You'd also asked specifically about cement, which is a perfectly fair question. As we look at cement, several things that are worth noting as we think about the year that's ramping up as well as the year that we're going into. So keep in mind, several things have happened this year. One, our price increase in cement in Texas in April was $9 a ton. We came back in September and did a second price increase. That was at $8 a ton. That's the first time we've seen a midyear of that sort since 2014. Again, I think, underscoring nice overall pricing momentum. If we're looking at what we're anticipating next year, we're anticipating a price increase in cement of $12 a ton. As [indiscernible],  we're looking at that effective January 1 in California, we're looking at that relative to April 1 in Texas. So a little bit of a different date between those 2 states, but still a very common number on what we're seeing. We also believe in total candor that if some of the governing aspects around volume were to go away, volume could actually be better. It's interesting as we're looking at volume today, and I mentioned this trend because I think this also has an effect on pricing from an emotional perspective as well as others. But what our team in Texas would tell us today is that there was more trucking available, say, for example, in the Dallas-Fort Worth market. We could be selling on a daily basis 3% to 5% more tonnage than we're selling today. So I think all of those factors call us to underscore what we believe 2022 is lining up to be a very attractive pricing environment for the company."

I'll start with the latter part first, and that is, what we've done in looking at volume next year is assuming that we're going to continue to see same governors around volume that we have this year. So again, I think we've taken a very responsible view at volume next year. And potentially, if you see some of these labor transportation and other backlogs or issues resolve themselves, it could be better next year. If we're thinking about overall customer backlog and the way that they're thinking about their business, here's the way that I would at least encourage you to think about that. As we're looking overall across the aggregates business, we're seeing it about 15% ahead of prior year levels based on what our customers are telling us, and there's a nice break. If we're looking in the East group, again, that's up almost 14% based on what customers are saying to us. If we're looking in the West Group, that's up around 18% based on what customers are telling them. What I think is important as well, we came into the year with very attractive cement backlog cement year-over-year is modestly down, but I think what's important is, we have some very notable projects that are in the pipeline right now that we think actually add to that pretty considerably. And importantly, as we look at our Magnesia Specialties business, we're looking at record customer backlogs. And we see very robust line business going into 2022, and we see some chemicals tailwinds going into the new year as well. So consistent with the comment that you heard that I shared in my prepared remarks, this is one of those instances where we feel like we're seeing public and private come together in a very attractive, very powerful way. And part of what I think is telling about this one is, we believe that it has the capacity, particularly if we get a new highway bill, to be in place not just for a matter of quarters, but as for a matter of years. So Brian, I hope that helps."

What I would tell you is, the conversations we've had with customers or conversations that we've already had, the correspondents that we were going to have with customers to basically affirm where our pricing for next year has already gone out. Really, Jerry, I think if there's risk to pricing next year, frankly, it's more on the upside as opposed to the downside because again, the numbers that we gave you in the release and that I referenced in my prepared remarks, our heritage numbers only. And obviously, part of what contractors we're seeing today, and I'm sure they're seeing across a whole host of inputs is an inflationary environment unlike anything that they've seen for a fly. The other thing to keep in mind is, if you go back and look at whether it's CPI, PPI or otherwise over a long period of time -- and by that, I don't mean a year or 2, I mean, decades. What you'll find is aggregate pricing has consistently outperformed that metric, and this year, actually, it was behind it just a bit. So I expect to see that gap made up next year, Jerry.

One, we're going to give you a good sense of where we believe those businesses will be when we come out in February next year. Part of what you'll see, if you go to the supplemental information with today's releases, you've got a good snapshot, particularly relative to Lehigh West. On what the tonnages look like in aggregate, cement, ready-mix and asphalt. So that will give you a nice way to back into some of that. You'll also see a nice 2021 budget EBITDA contribution. So again, I think that can put you there. With respect to the overall pricing, as you would imagine, we've got a nice blend of new colleges for Martin Marietta, but importantly, Heritage Martin Marietta players, particularly in California that are working together in that marketplace. I can tell you that our correspondence on pricing went out to our customers last week. So these are a lot of conversations. By the way, they've all been very good conversations. As I indicated in one of the earlier questions, if I had to speculate today, my guess would be, on a percentage basis, we will likely see ASPs on a percentage basis on the newly acquired operations, on percentages that will be higher than heritage Martin Marietta. So again, I don't see a downside trend there, I see potential upside opportunity in those markets. And again, to your point, we could probably -- if I really want to dig deep, be a little bit more specific with you on Lehigh Hanson, at the same time, I'm mindful that we've owned that business for about 32 days. And our sense is, let's have it for a little bit longer than 32 days before we get into too much detail on that. But hopefully, the direction I've given you and the supplemental information relative to tonnage, EBITDA contributions where we are relative to the organic business on ASPs, in my view that the acquired operations will likely overachieve that gives you a sense of how we look at that."

So again, those are just some of the more optical issues. Something that I think is worth always keeping in mind, Phil, is when base is going in a year like this, what you know is going to happen is the clean stone is going to go behind that because at some point, you're going to put either asphalt or concrete on top of the clean stone. And we actually see those clean stone prices moving in a very attractive way."

That's a business that performs quarter-after-quarter extraordinarily well and never gets depressed that team deserves. Look, you saw what I did too, and that was record revenues there, up 30% over the prior year quarter. I mean several things are happening. One, it's a strong metal mining activity around the world. We're seeing good activity in steel. To your point, in many respects, we are kept -- we're running that capacity on volumes in that marketplace right now. Pricing was up nearly 4%. We think pricing may have some nice upside to it. One thing that's worth noticing, though, is if you look at where domestic steel is now, steel is running at about almost 85%. That's up from Q2 last year when it found the bottom. It's up almost 51% since then. The other thing that I think is really impressive in that business, when you look at the margins at 39% and you take into account that natural gas pricing for Q3 was up 26%. And if we look at really what natural gas pricing has looked at for a longer period of time than that, if we go back to January 1 this year, I want to say, in January, net gas pricing was at 6 01. It's up almost $2.44 since then, almost 146%. So I guess what I would say is, would we like to grow that business in particular point to your question. The short answer is, we would. We've looked at ways to grow that business in the past. We will continue to do that. Are we largely add capacity at Woodville and [indiscernible] today, largely we are. Do we have the ability on occasion, and will we continue to look at refining our products out of those 2 different facilities to make sure we're doing more high-margin products. The short answer there is, yes, we will. So the focus will be on continuing to control costs, which they do extraordinarily well. Being a price leader, which is something they've been focused on, continuing to look for ways to add to that business. We'd like to do it, but in the meantime, making sure that we continue to refine the products that we're putting out. So I would suggest to you, Stanley, it's probably a 4- or a fivefold approach to that business."

I'm going to talk a little bit about what we're seeing going on in the market. I want Jim to come back and talk specifically about some of the issues that we had in maintenance this quarter and part of what we've seen in inventories. But here's what I would say, overall, if we look at the volume, the volume is actually very attractive. So it's a 4% overall increase. We had since July rain that slow things down in Central and South Texas. So if we're looking at what was happening coming out of Hunter, that was down about 3%. Now the flip side is, we saw very nice volumes coming out of North Texas at Midlothian, up about 6.7%. We also saw, on a percentage basis, very nice percentages up in West Texas. Now what I'll tell you is, percentages on West Texas and volumes in West Texas tell 2 different stories because you can have a very big percentage because the volumes have been overall quite low. But what I'm happy to see is at least on a year-to-date basis is West Texas volumes were up almost 66% as we continue to see mining do better. 
If we look in North Texas, again, all by itself in September, that was up 25%. So we saw a record volume quarter coming out of cement. Now we did have some maintenance issues that I want Jim to speak to and our preface that were done with maintenance for the year on the big taking the kilns down and then we had some inventory issues that he can walk you through that I think will give you some great color.

So what happened there was, we had more downtime than we had planned on to do some maintenance. So there's $3 million more of higher maintenance, but the bigger effect for the year was the drawdown of inventory. So we had record shipments, as you heard in our prepared remarks, the record shipments, but our production levels were below what we had expected, and so when you have that situation, we had inventory drawdown. And so our fixed cost absorption was worse than we had forecast, and that's the biggest piece of that headwinds for the guidance. And then separately, of course, energy headwinds are elevated higher than we had forecasted previously. These are non-diesel headwinds. So net gas, as Ward mentioned earlier, electricity, and to a much lesser extent, coal, all those costs were higher. Our view -- but now is higher cost than our view of that 3 months ago. So those are the real drivers of that. Does that answer your question, Courtney?"

And from our perspective, it's not so much an issue of supply. We're in a position to supply the materials. I think to your point, it's going to be more a matter of labor, and frankly, it's going to be a contractor timing perspective on when they're going to higher labor. One of the things that I'm at least defining on, Brent, is I think that's going to be one of the great collateral benefits from the highway bill when it's passed. Because when contractors have a sense that their backlogs and their backlogs for a period of years are going to look very good, they are likely to hire. I think that's particularly true when we're looking at public works because public works, as you know, tend to come with liquidated damages if they're not finished in a timely manner. So I think it's a practical matter, that's going to be driving some of that. But again, if we look overall at the way our top states are positioned, they're positioned really well. I mean if we're looking at TxDOT, their FY '22 lettings are set to exceed $10 billion. If we're looking at Colorado, they're looking at a DOT forecast, that's up $850 million. In CDOT has returned to historical averages, which puts them in a $5 billion a year budget. Georgia infrastructure booked strong with additional $225 million of infrastructure investment. Florida is near record levels with very attractive backlogs. But here are some of the things that I moved by. You heard me mention Caltran, their budget -- SB1 in the prepared remarks. What I didn't speak to are issues like SB9 and SB10 in California that's allowing property owners to split single-family lots into 2 lots and streamlining of zoning or rezoning process because what we think that does in that market is, it brings housing back in ways that, that state hasn't seen for a while. And as you recall, Brent, from our Analyst and Investor Day, so much goodness in heavy side space tends to follow what's happening with single-family with a lag. If we see the highway bill, if we see the hiring that I think comes behind the highway bill, if we see the public work that I think we're going to see and we continue to see that type of product work that's driven by reds, I think a lot of these supply chain and employee -- labor issues work their way out. I don't think it's going to be immediate, and again, I think that's part of the governor we put on next year. But that's a long answer, but you asked a really good question, and I think it has a lot of moving parts."

And Paul, I think that is something that we are cognizant of, that we're sensitive to. I think in the fullness of time, recycle will play a bigger role and it's going to play in the next 5 or 10 years. And what do I mean by that? I think we are going to have to be looking to utilize recycled concrete more as a base product. I think we're going to be looking at higher degrees of recycled asphalt or wrap that's used in asphalt mixes. Today, in many respects, you might see wrap in the, let's call it, 20% portions of asphalt. I think you could see that going up to 30% in the fullness of time. The primary driver of that being liquid. One reason I mentioned those 2 things in particular, Paul, is if you look at the transactions, at least 2 of the 3 that we've done this year, it's somewhat mindful of that. So if we're looking at the SCC materials transaction that we did in July, that's basically buying a recycled business on concrete and selling that recycled concrete as an aggregate and selling that in Houston, Texas, where we have a significant presence -- and keep in mind, part of what Tiller does for us in that marketplace -- I'm sorry, SCC, is it adds a series of new yards for us. More specifically, it adds around 10. And we had a very attractive position in that marketplace with the existing rail yards that we had. So to your point, it expands our footprint, but importantly, it adds new product offerings. Now similarly, if we look at the business that we bought in Minnesota at Tiller at the end of April, that's a stone business, and it's a hot mix business, but it's not a laydown business. 
So again, part of what that's going to allow us to do is make sure that we're looking at percentages of rep, how we're going to utilize that going forward. And the other piece of Tiller that I think has been important for us is as part of that business, we also picked up about 100,000 tons worth of tank farm capacity in that marketplace. So we also have the ability to look at energy going forward in some modestly different ways with a physical hedge because it allows us to hedge physically about 60% of our need for liquid in that relevant geographic market during the course of any one year. So do we think we'll see more recycle? Yes. Are we ourselves positioning ourselves more of that? Yes. Do I think spec aggregates in the near term are any concern of being specked out of jobs? Absolutely not. So I hope that helps, Paul."

It goes back to a lot of what we spoke about at the Analyst Investor Day. So I would say several things worth knowing at least again as we think about Texas and Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and now increasingly, in California. We came into this period of time, in our view, with remarkably underbuilt conditions, particularly with respect to single-family. We think the population dynamics will continue to be strong in those states. I mean here's some specific color. If we're looking at Texas population growth, the residential section at least for us in Texas is red hot. Texas comprises almost 9% of the U.S. population, but accounts for almost 34% of the country's population growth. And if we're looking at DFW, it's led nation in metro growth for at least 4 years running, and by the way, the Houston area is second. So this just underscores again why we thought that move -- that enhanced move in Texas is so important and housing is such a driver there. If we look in Colorado, the biggest issue that we have in Colorado is, they frankly need more supply. The demand is there. Colorado's population has grown 14% since 2010. So that's almost 1 million people that gained a house seat in this last population. So again, we anticipate continued strong housing growth in Colorado. North Carolina just continues to grow dramatically. We see it here in our backyard every day between what's happening in Charlotte and in Raleigh-Durham. 
When I moved by North Carolina, I think this is important is, places like Greensboro. I think I might have mentioned earlier in the year, D.R. Horton has announced a plan to build 1,000 home single-family subdivision there and annual starts and the Triad are up 28% year-over-year. So again, these are powerful numbers. If we're looking at Atlanta, Atlanta single-family housing starts now approaching 35,000. That's up on a trailing 12 basis, almost 38%, but it's not just Atlanta, we're seeing that in Atlanta, we're seeing that in Savannah. And even in smaller markets like Augusta that have continued to be very attractive, and even single-family housing in Florida. And keep in mind, that's really not the market that we're in there. We're a niche player in Florida and basically public transportation or infrastructure, but single-family housing in Florida is up 37% on trailing 12 months. And again, Florida has added 2.7 resin since 2010. So if we look at those numbers, then come back and also lay on top of that, those 2 different propositions that I spoke of just a few minutes ago relative to California on SB9 and SB10. If we are of the view that single-family housing is going to stay strong for a while and that aggregate tends to follow that with a very high correlative factor. And if we're assuming, this is what we think is going to happen. We think single-family starts in '21 go to about 1.2 million. We think in '22, they probably go to around 1.4 million and in '23, to about 1.5 million. Those are heady numbers, but here's what's important to remember. If we're right and they go to 1.2 million in 2021, that's 2,000 levels. In the U.S., it has added 48 million people since then. If we're right and they go to 1.4 million in '22, that's in 2003 levels. And if we're right, and it goes to 1.5 million in '23, that's 2003 and 2004 levels. Again, on a much higher population base. So I've tried to give you some color around specific markets that matter to us, but I've also tried to give some numbers just broadly nationally that we think are relevant and we think are worth keeping in the back or front of your mind."

Our view is, we invest in the business once we know we've got it where it needs to be. So we're going through the capital process and looking at it very carefully as we speak. As Jim indicated earlier in his conversation with Paul, the increase in CapEx that you see is almost uniquely tied to what's going on in the Lehigh Hanson West region that we now have, and certainly, a significant portion of that is going to the cement business.

The thing that I would always say is, where we've been, and you've heard us say that and you were an aggregate select company, and that's the way we think about our businesses first. And so I would always encourage you to remember that with us. At the same time, for example, when we went in and bought the business in Minnesota, that is the total business, that does have a hot mix component to it. But part of what's so different about that is, it doesn't have a laydown component to it. So if you think about really what I think makes Martin Marietta different from many is, we're not so much in the contracting business. We will take that stone in Minnesota in some respects, add liquid to it, turn it into Black pavement and sell it FOB the facility. So number one, aggregate slug is the right way to think of us; two, being more focused on materials is the right way to think of us. Lastly, with respect to growing the business, look, at the end of the transaction, clearly, our debt-to-EBITDA range is a little bit above 3x. As you know, we like to stay in the range of 2 to 2.5x. We think that's actually going deleverage very nicely over the next year to 18 months. I think it's possible that if we get toward the end of next year, we could be back towards the high end of our range. I mean that's really, I think, doing great work in deleveraging the business. I think we have added immense value to this business by doing not acquisitions, but by doing the right acquisitions. By doing these transactions that we've done, we have opened up a series of new corridors. And if you go back in time and you look at the way that we've grown our business, we have been focused uniquely on cars of growth. whether it's I-95, I-85, Interstate 40, whether it's I-25 in Colorado and now increasingly on I-5 in California. So aggregate slug is the right way to think of us, a company that wants to continue to do the right deals in the right markets is the right way to think of us and heavy side oriented is where we will continue to resign, Anthony. So I hope that helps."

At the same time, for example, the Port Arthur LNG facility that's been on some degree of hold for a while, our understanding, spectral is really anticipating some bid refreshing on that in this quarter. And we may see some activity there as early as Q1 2022, not job that we've won at this point, but still nonetheless, seeing that type of activity on heavy, we actually think it's quite attractive judge."

Obviously, we sold it for front because we did have in the books for anything, but it is a bill product. And if you're looking at what was a fairly significant movement on base, particularly in that Raleigh market, again, of all the things that I've worried at night about aggregate pricing is not on my list. And those are purely and simply those are the drivers. The other thing -- and I know your question was on organic, but I do think it's important to keep in mind when you look at it all rolled up, stone pricing in the acquired Tiller operations are about $5 a ton lower than our heritage number. So again, when you do an all-in number with that, it clearly has optically a dilutive effect. And then when you feather in nearly 1 million tons of funds, again, it will have an optical effect. But I think, to your point, the midyear, I think really did underscore the strength of the market. To give you a sense of what we saw in the East division and this really means in the Carolinas, was $1 a ton up on clean stone effective July 1 and even $0.50 on base effective July 1. And then Southwest, we saw -- in North Texas, up $0.50 to $0.75 a ton on September 1. In Austin, up $1 a ton and around Hunter stone, which is in new Broncos, $0.50 to up $1 a ton and then at Garwood, up $1 a ton on August 1. So I think all those at least in the way that I'm watching it and measuring the cadence, David, give me a high degree of confidence in what we're anticipating next year that and probably more importantly, together with conversations we've had with our customers. So I hope that helps."

Martin Marietta's continued growth and record results demonstrate our industry-leading performance and disciplined execution of our proven strategic operating analysis and review, or SOAR plan. And with fewer reportable and lost time incidents than this time last year, our company-wide safety incident rates are surpassing world-class levels. I'm proud to report that we're on track to deliver the most profitable and safest year in our company's history. We're also excited by the progress we're making on our SOAR 2025 initiatives to further position our company for sustainable, long-term operational and financial success.
On October 1, we welcomed more than 1,200 talented employees to the Martin Marietta team as we successfully completed the acquisition of Lehigh Hanson's West Region business. With this outstanding team, strong business and key assets now are part of our offering. We're well positioned to benefit from favorable market dynamics and accelerating public and private construction activity in important California and Arizona regions, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego and Phoenix. It also provides new growth platforms for our continued geographic expansion. I'm grateful to our colleagues for their dedication and perseverance in their efforts to complete the acquisition, the second largest in our company's history. We look forward to working together to seamlessly integrate the Lehigh West operations, quickly realize synergies and deliver significant stakeholder value. Integration activities are progressing as planned from both an operational and customer-facing perspective.
As highlighted in today's release, we once again established record results for revenues and gross profit for both the quarter and year-to-date. To recap, for the first 9 months of 2021, our adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to a record $1.1 billion. Both our Building Materials and Magnesia Specialties businesses continue to capitalize on the ongoing economic recovery.
During the quarter, organic shipment and pricing growth combined with value-enhancing acquisitions more than offset higher-than-expected energy-related costs and contributed to our record-setting results. Specifically, on a consolidated basis, Products and Services revenues increased 18% to $1.5 billion. Adjusted gross profit increased 11% to $450 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $490 million increased 13% on a comparable basis, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.25 grew 11% on a comparable basis. As a reminder, the prior year quarter included $70 million or $0.87 per diluted share of nonrecurring gains on surplus land sales and divested assets that affect quarter-over-quarter comparability.  
Now for a review of our third quarter operating performance. We continue to experience growing product demand across our 3 primary end-use markets. Organic aggregate shipments increased 6%, notwithstanding contractor capacity constraints and wet weather in several markets that govern the overall pace of construction activity. Notably, all divisions contributed to this solid growth, demonstrating our ability to capitalize on the strong underlying demand trends across our geographic footprint. Total aggregate shipments, including shipments from acquired operations, increased 10%. Organic aggregates average selling price increased 2%, reflecting a higher percentage of lower-priced base stone shipments during the quarter.
Additionally, our East division, which has selling prices in excess of our corporate average, had the opportunity to meet customer needs with a low-priced excess fuel product that had we not shipped we otherwise would have incurred costs to relocate. We expect shipments of this excess fill material, which are profitable and not a substitute for higher-value products, to continue through the remainder of the year. That's why we updated our full year 2021 organic pricing growth guidance to now range from 2.5% to 3.5%.
To be clear, aggregates pricing fundamentals remain very attractive. In fact, supported by strong underlying demand and rapid cost inflation in the broader economy, we successfully implemented midyear price increases in the Carolinas and Texas. These actions, combined with overall customer confidence and demand visibility, bode well for meaningful pricing acceleration in 2022.
Our Texas Cement business established a new quarterly record for shipments, which increased 4% to over 1 million tonnes. Large and diversified projects, recovering energy sector activity and incremental pull-through from our internal downstream customers, supported record monthly shipment levels in both August and September. Cement pricing increased 8% as the second round of price increases this year went into effect on September 1.
Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready-mixed concrete shipments increased 23%, driven by large nonresidential projects and operations acquired late last year in Texas. Concrete pricing grew 2% following the implementation of midyear price increases in Texas. Additionally, we've announced a third price increase in the Dallas/Fort Worth market effective October 1.
Asphalt shipments increased 116% overall, driven by contributions from our Minnesota-based operations acquired earlier this year. Our Colorado asphalt and paving business experienced shipment declines and supply disruptions from mid-summer liquid asphalt allocations throughout the Rocky Mountains. This circumstance has now been resolved. Despite these short-term issues, market fundamentals remain strong across the Colorado front range. Organic asphalt pricing improved modestly.
Before discussing our preliminary 2022 outlook, I'll turn the call over to Jim to conclude our third quarter discussion with a review of our financial results and liquidity. Jim?"

Both the Building Materials and Magnesia Specialties businesses contributed to our double-digit growth in product revenues and increased profitability. That said, increased energy expense continues as a headwind, temporarily pressuring margins.
For the third quarter alone, total energy costs increased $28 million or nearly 50% company-wide as compared with last year. Absent this headwind, our consolidated adjusted gross margin would have outpaced the record set in the prior year quarter. Aggregates product gross margin of 34.2% included higher diesel and other production costs as well as a $6 million negative impact from selling acquired inventory that was marked up to fair value as part of acquisition accounting.
Excluding the acquisition impact, adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 34.9%, a 150 basis point decline versus prior year. Cement product gross margin declined 250 basis points driven by higher raw material cost and a $6 million increase in natural gas and electricity costs. Ready-mixed concrete product gross margin improved modestly to nearly 10% as shipment and pricing gains offset higher costs for raw materials and diesel.
Magnesia Specialties continued to benefit from improving domestic steel production and global demand for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $72 million, a 30% year-over-year increase. Revenue growth more than offset higher costs for energy and contract services, driving a 100 basis point improvement in product gross margin to 39%.
As part of our long-standing capital allocation priorities, we continue to balance value-enhancing acquisitions with prudent capital spending and returning cash to shareholders while preserving a healthy balance sheet, financial flexibility and investment-grade credit rating profile. Consistent with SOAR 2025, we acquired a crushed concrete aggregates producer in the Houston area in late July. These acquired aggregates operations expand our customer base and product offerings in one of the nation's largest addressable markets. We have raised our full year capital spending guidance to $475 million to $525 million to include anticipated Lehigh West region capital expenditures. We continue to prioritize high-return capital projects, focused on growing sales and increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion.
Additionally, our Board of Directors approved a 7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend paid in September, underscoring its confidence in our future performance and a resilient and growing free cash flow generation. Our annualized cash dividend rate is now $2.44. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases.
In early July, we issued $2.5 billion of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.2% and a weighted average tenor of 15 years, primarily to finance Lehigh West region transaction. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9x as of September 30. Leverage on a pro forma basis, inclusive of reach acquisitions, is modestly above 3x debt to EBITDA. Consistent with our practice of repaying debt following significant acquisitions, we are committed to return into our target leverage range of 2 to 2.5x within the next 18 months. As detailed in today's release, we have updated our full year 2021 guidance to reflect our year-to-date results that factor in higher energy costs and the fourth quarter contribution from the newly acquired Lehigh West business. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range from $1.500 billion to $1.550 billion.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward."

Looking beyond 2021, Martin Marietta remains well positioned to capitalize on attractive market fundamentals and secular demand trends across our geographic footprint, expanded federal and state-level infrastructure investment, single-family",805,"Thanks, Jim. Looking beyond 2021, Martin Marietta remains well positioned to capitalize on attractive market fundamentals and secular demand trends across our geographic footprint, expanded federal and state-level infrastructure investment, single-family housing strength, heavy industrial projects of scale and like nonresidential recovery should support growing construction activity and contribute to attractive pricing acceleration for heavy side building materials for years to come. Importantly, we have both the ability and the capacity to supply these needed products and supported by our locally led pricing strategy will do so in a manner that emphasizes value over volume.
While navigating an imperfect legislative process, our nation is nonetheless on the cusp of achieving the most significant infrastructure action of this century. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which contains a 5-year surface transportation reauthorization and provides $110 billion in new funding for roads, bridges and other hard infrastructure projects passed the United States Senate in August with 69 bipartisan votes. Though the United States House of Representatives did not take up the bipartisan infrastructure bill last week before the then current short-term extension of the federal highway and public transportation programs expired on October 31, The House and Senate did approve a short-term program extension, keeping surface transportation funds flowing to the states through December 3. The consensus opinion with which we strongly agree is that this important legislation will be signed into law before year-end.
Aside from the overall economic growth, we expect to occur with the increased federal transportation investment, the steps we've taken over the past decade to responsibly grow and expand our footprint will also benefit Martin Marietta's near and long-term outlook.
Project lettings for our company's top 5 states Department of Transportation, or DOTs, continue to positively trend. Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, which accounted for over 70% of our 2020 Building Materials revenues, are well positioned from both the DOT funding and resource perspective to efficiently deploy increased federal and state transportation dollars in advance the growing number of projects in their backlogs.
Notably, California, the nation's most popular state and the world's fifth largest economy becomes a top state for Martin Marietta, following the Lehigh West acquisition. Caltrans, California's Department of Transportation, manages a $17 billion annual budget. Additionally, the Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017, commonly referred to as Senate Bill 1 or SB1, provides $54 billion or approximately $5 billion annually through 2030 to fund state and local road, freeway and rail projects. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 36% of third quarter organic shipments, showing sequential growth since this year's second quarter, but still well below our 10-year historical average of 43%.
Nonresidential construction continues to benefit from increased investment in aggregates intensive heavy industrial warehouses and data centers. We've also seen early signs of recovery in light commercial and retail sectors, notably in key markets such as Atlanta, Denver and the Texas triangle. Like nonresidential activity should be a more significant demand driver in 2022, given that it typically follows single-family residential development. Aggregate shipments to the nonresidential market accounted for 35% of third quarter organic shipments.
Across our coast-to-coast footprint, single-family residential starts are expected to remain robust despite higher home prices and longer material delivery times. Significant underbuilding in commensurate with notable population gains over the past decade and accelerated the organization to support these trends. Importantly, single-family housing is 2 to 3x more aggregates intensive than multifamily construction given the ancillary nonresidential and infrastructure needs to build out new or expanding suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 24% of third quarter organic shipments.
In summary, we believe our industry is about to see public and private sector construction activity coalesce for the first time since its most recent 2005 peak, supporting both increased shipments and an attractive pricing environment for construction materials. For 2022, our preliminary view anticipates organic aggregate shipments will increase in the low to mid-single digits as contractor labor shortages and logistics challenges continue to impact an otherwise robust demand environment. Underpinned by our value over volume pricing strategy, we anticipate mid- to high single-digit growth in 2022 organic aggregates pricing.
To conclude, we're extremely proud of our record-setting safety, operational and financial performance and look forward to continuing to build on that momentum into the fourth quarter and 2022. As a result of our thoughtfully developed and consistently executed strategic priorities, our company's future is bright. With our steadfast commitment to employee health and safety, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices and store execution, Martin Marietta intends to build the safest, best-performing and most durable aggregates-led public company poised to deliver attractive growth and superior value for all of our stakeholders.

So Ward, your initial outlook for '22 around aggregates pricing, looking for mid- to high single digits, clearly, an acceleration from what we've seen this year and recent years. Can you talk about some of the drivers behind that expectation, your comfort level there and maybe bridging that from this year? Is it more reliant on the more midyear increases? Or is this primarily a spring increase that's driving this?
And then kind of as part of that, the pricing discussion, cement price announcements that we've been hearing about for next spring are pretty healthy. So maybe if you could speak to what you're thinking on that front as well as we go into next year?"

One, we saw a nice series of midyear price increases this year, and we saw that in 2 markets that matter a lot for us. We saw that in Texas, and we saw that in the Carolinas. So that immediately starts setting the framework for next year. Keep in mind, as I outlined in the prepared remarks, part of what we've seen this year is an optical headwind is, frankly, a higher degree of base sales that we've seen, particularly in the East as well as some bonds sales that have gone out of the East. What I think is important to keep in mind, Trey, is the pricing range that you see is really a heritage-driven range. In other words, we're not taking into account what we believe is going to happen in California and that we're not taking into account what we believe can happen in Minnesota in that. As a reminder, those markets historically have been below corporate average. So if I reflect on where we're positioning toward next year on the conversations that we have had with our customers to date and what we believe the overall economic environment is likely to be, we have a very high level of confidence in the ASPs that we're talking about for next year.
You'd also asked specifically about cement, which is a perfectly fair question. As we look at cement, several things that are worth noting as we think about the year that's ramping up as well as the year that we're going into. So keep in mind, several things have happened this year. One, our price increase in cement in Texas in April was $9 a tonne. We came back in September and did a second price increase. That was at $8 a tonne. That's the first time we've seen a midyear of that sort since 2014. Again, I think, underscoring nice overall pricing momentum. If we're looking at what we're anticipating next year, we're anticipating a price increase in cement of $12 a ton. As fact of matter,  we're looking at that effective January 1 in California, we're looking at that relative to April 1 in Texas. So a little bit of a different date between those 2 states, but still a very common number on what we're seeing.
We also believe in total candor that if some of the governing aspects around volume were to go away, volume could actually be better. It's interesting as we're looking at volume today, and I mentioned this trait because I think this also has an effect on pricing from an emotional perspective as well as others. But what our team in Texas would tell us today is that there was more trucking available, say, for example, in the Dallas/Fort Worth market. We could be selling on a daily basis 3% to 5% more tonnage than we're selling today. So I think all of those factors coalesce to underscore why we believe 2022 is lining up to be a very attractive pricing environment for the company."

I'll start with the latter part first, and that is, what we've done in looking at volume next year is assuming that we're going to continue to see same governors around volume that we have this year. So again, I think we've taken a very responsible view at volume next year. And potentially, if you see some of these labor, transportation and other backlogs or issues resolve themselves, it could be better next year.
If we're thinking about overall customer backlog and the way that they're thinking about their business, here's the way that I would at least encourage you to think about that. As we're looking overall across the aggregates business, we're seeing it about 15% ahead of prior year levels based on what our customers are telling us, and there's a nice break. If we're looking in the East group, again, that's up almost 14% based on what customers are saying to us. If we're looking in the West Group, that's up around 18% based on what customers are telling them.
What I think is important as well, we came into the year with very attractive cement backlog cement year-over-year is modestly down, but I think what's important is, we have some very notable projects that are in the pipeline right now that we think actually add to that pretty considerably. And importantly, as we look at our Magnesia Specialties business, we're looking at record customer backlogs, and we see very robust line business going into 2022, and we see some chemicals tailwinds going into the new year as well.
So consistent with the comment that you heard that I shared in my prepared remarks, this is one of those instances where we feel like we're seeing public and private come together in a very attractive, very powerful way. And part of what I think is telling about this one is, we believe that it has the capacity, particularly if we get a new highway build, to be in place not just for a matter of quarters, but as for a matter of years. So Brian, I hope that helps."

What I would tell you is, the conversations we've had with customers or conversations that we've already had, the correspondents that we were going to have with customers to basically affirm where our pricing for next year has already gone out. Really, Jerry, I think if there's risk to pricing next year, frankly, it's more on the upside as opposed to the downside because again, the numbers that we gave you in the release and that I referenced in my prepared remarks are heritage numbers only.
And obviously, part of what contractors are seeing today, and I'm sure they're seeing across a whole host of inputs is an inflationary environment unlike anything that they've seen for a while. The other thing to keep in mind is, if you go back and look at whether it's CPI, PPI or otherwise over a long period of time -- and by that, I don't mean a year or two, I mean, decades. What you'll find is aggregate pricing has consistently outperformed that metric, and this year, actually, it was behind it just a bit. So I expect to see that gap made up next year, Jerry.

On what the tonnages look like in aggregate, cement, ready-mix and asphalt. So that will give you a nice way to back into some of that. You'll also see a nice 2021 budget EBITDA contribution. So again, I think that can put you there.
With respect to the overall pricing, as you would imagine, we've got a nice blend of new colleges for Martin Marietta, but importantly, Heritage Martin Marietta players, particularly in California that are working together in that marketplace. I can tell you that our correspondence on pricing went out to our customers last week. So these are our live conversations. By the way, they've all been very good conversations. As I indicated in one of the earlier questions, if I had to speculate today, my guess would be, on a percentage basis, we will likely see ASPs on a percentage basis on the newly acquired operations, on percentages that will be higher than heritage Martin Marietta. So again, I don't see a downside trend there, I see potential upside opportunity in those markets.
And again, to your point, we could probably -- if I really want to dig deep, be a little bit more specific with you on Lehigh Hanson, at the same time, I'm mindful that we've owned that business for about 32 days. And our sense is, let's have it for a little bit longer than 32 days before we get into too much detail on that. But hopefully, the direction I've given you and the supplemental information relative to tonnage, EBITDA contributions where we are relative to the organic business on ASPs, in my view that the acquired operations will likely overachieve that, gives you a sense of how we look at that."

So again, those are just some of the more optical issues. Something that I think is worth always keeping in mind, Phil, is when base is going in a year like this, what you know is going to happen is the clean stone is going to go behind that because at some point, you're going to put either asphalt or concrete on top of the clean stone. And we actually see those clean stone prices moving in a very attractive way."

That's a business that performs quarter-after-quarter extraordinarily well and never gets depressed that team deserves. Look, you saw what I did too, and that was record revenues there, up 30% over the prior year quarter. I mean several things are happening. One, it's a strong metal mining activity around the world. We're seeing good activity in steel. To your point, in many respects, we are kept -- we're running that capacity on volumes in that marketplace right now. Pricing was up nearly 4%. We think pricing may have some nice upside to it. One thing that's worth noticing, though, is if you look at where domestic steel is now, steel is running at about almost 85%. That's up from Q2 last year when it found the bottom. It's up almost 51% since then. The other thing that I think is really impressive in that business, when you look at the margins at 39% and you take into account that natural gas pricing for Q3 was up 26%. And if we look at really what natural gas pricing has looked at for a longer period of time than that, if we go back to January 1 this year, I want to say, in January, net gas pricing was at 6.01. It's up almost $2.44 since then, almost 146%.
So I guess what I would say is, would we like to grow that business in particular point to your question. The short answer is, we would. We've looked at ways to grow that business in the past. We will continue to do that. Are we largely add capacity at Woodville and Manistee today? Largely we are. Do we have the ability on occasion, and will we continue to look at refining our products out of those 2 different facilities to make sure we're doing more high-margin products? The short answer there is, yes, we will.
So the focus will be on continuing to control costs, which they do extraordinarily well. Being a price leader, which is something they've been focused on, continuing to look for ways to add to that business. We'd like to do it, but in the meantime, making sure that we continue to refine the products that we're putting out. So I would suggest to you, Stanley, it's probably a 4- or a fivefold approach to that business."

I'm going to talk a little bit about what we're seeing going on in the market. I want Jim to come back and talk specifically about some of the issues that we had in maintenance this quarter and part of what we've seen in inventories.
But here's what I would say, overall, if we look at the volume, the volume is actually very attractive. So it's a 4% overall increase. We had since July rain that slow things down in Central and South Texas. So if we're looking at what was happening coming out of Hunter, that was down about 3%. Now the flip side is, we saw very nice volumes coming out of North Texas at Midlothian, up about 6.7%. We also saw, on a percentage basis, very nice percentages up in West Texas. Now what I'll tell you is, percentages on West Texas and volumes in West Texas tell 2 different stories because you can have a very big percentage because the volumes have been overall quite low. But what I'm happy to see is at least on a year-to-date basis is West Texas volumes were up almost 66% as we continue to see mining do better.
If we look in North Texas, again, all by itself in September, that was up 25%. So we saw a record volume quarter coming out of cement. Now we did have some maintenance issues that I want Jim to speak to and our preface that were done with maintenance for the year on the big, taking the kilns down and then we had some inventory issues that he can walk you through that I think will give you some great color.

So what happened there was, we had more downtime than we had planned on to do some maintenance. So there's $3 million more of higher maintenance, but the bigger effect for the year was the drawdown of inventory. So we had record shipments, as you heard in our prepared remarks, the record shipments, but our production levels were below what we had expected, and so when you have that situation, we had inventory drawdown. And so our fixed cost absorption was worse than we had forecast, and that's the biggest piece of that headwinds for the guidance. And then separately, of course, energy headwinds are elevated higher than we had forecasted previously. These are non-diesel headwinds.
So net gas, as Ward mentioned earlier, electricity, and to a much lesser extent, coal, all those costs were higher. Our view -- but now is higher cost than our view of that 3 months ago. So those are the real drivers of that. Does that answer your question, Courtney?"

And from our perspective, it's not so much an issue of supply. We're in a position to supply the materials. I think to your point, it's going to be more a matter of labor, and frankly, it's going to be a contractor timing perspective on when they're going to higher labor. One of the things that I'm at least defining on, Brent, is I think that's going to be one of the great collateral benefits from the highway bill when it's passed. Because when contractors have a sense that their backlogs and their backlogs for a period of years are going to look very good, they are likely to hire. I think that's particularly true when we're looking at public works because public works, as you know, tend to come with liquidated damages if they're not finished in a timely manner. So I think it's a practical matter, that's going to be driving some of that. But again, if we look overall at the way our top states are positioned, they're positioned really well. I mean if we're looking at TxDOT, their FY '22 lettings are set to exceed $10 billion. If we're looking at Colorado, they're looking at a DOT forecast, that's up $850 million. NCDOT has returned to historical averages, which puts them in a $5 billion a year budget. Georgia infrastructure booked strong with additional $225 million of infrastructure investment. Florida is near record levels with very attractive backlogs. But here are some of the things that I moved by. You heard me mention Caltran, their budget -- SB1 in the prepared remarks. What I didn't speak to are issues like SB9 and SB10 in California that's allowing property owners to split single-family lots into 2 lots and streamlining of zoning or rezoning process because what we think that does in that market is, it brings housing back in ways that, that state hasn't seen for a while. And as you recall, Brent, from our Analyst and Investor Day, so much goodness in heavy side space tends to follow what's happening with single-family with a lag. If we see the highway bill, if we see the hiring that I think comes behind the highway bill, if we see the public work that I think we're going to see and we continue to see that type of product work that's driven by reds, I think a lot of these supply chain and employee -- labor issues work their way out. I don't think it's going to be immediate, and again, I think that's part of the governor we put on next year. But that's a long answer, but you asked a really good question, and I think it has a lot of moving parts."

And Paul, I think that is something that we are cognizant of, that we're sensitive to. I think in the fullness of time, recycle will play a bigger role and it's going to play in the next 5 or 10 years. And what do I mean by that? I think we are going to have to be looking to utilize recycled concrete more as a base product. I think we're going to be looking at higher degrees of recycled asphalt or wrap that's used in asphalt mixes.
Today, in many respects, you might see wrap in the, let's call it, 20% portions of asphalt. I think you could see that going up to 30% in the fullness of time. The primary driver of that being liquid. One reason I mentioned those 2 things in particular, Paul, is if you look at the transactions, at least 2 of the 3 that we've done this year, it's somewhat mindful of that.
So if we're looking at the SCC materials transaction that we did in July, that's basically buying a recycled business on concrete and selling that recycled concrete as an aggregate and selling that in Houston, Texas, where we have a significant presence -- and keep in mind, part of what Tiller does for us in that marketplace -- I'm sorry, SCC, is it adds a series of new yards for us. More specifically, it adds around 10. And we had a very attractive position in that marketplace with the existing rail yards that we have. So to your point, it expands our footprint, but importantly, it adds new product offerings. Now similarly, if we look at the business that we bought in Minnesota at Tiller at the end of April, that's a stone business, and it's a hot mix business, but it's not a laydown business.
So again, part of what that's going to allow us to do is make sure that we're looking at percentages of rep, how we're going to utilize that going forward. And the other piece of Tiller that I think has been important for us is as part of that business, we also picked up about 100,000 tons worth of tank farm capacity in that marketplace. So we also have the ability to look at energy going forward in some modestly different ways with a physical hedge because it allows us to hedge physically about 60% of our need for liquid in that relevant geographic market during the course of any one year. So do we think we'll see more recycle? Yes. Are we ourselves positioning ourselves more of that? Yes. Do I think spec aggregates in the near term or had any concern of being specked out of jobs? Absolutely not. So I hope that helps, Paul."

It goes back to a lot of what we spoke about at the Analyst Investor Day. So I would say several things worth knowing at least again as we think about Texas and Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and now increasingly, in California. We came into this period of time, in our view, with remarkably underbuilt conditions, particularly with respect to single-family. We think the population dynamics will continue to be strong in those states. I mean here's some specific color. If we're looking at Texas population growth, the residential section at least for us in Texas is red hot. Texas comprises almost 9% of the U.S. population, but accounts for almost 34% of the country's population growth. And if we're looking at DFW, it's led nation in metro growth for at least 4 years running, and by the way, the Houston area is second. So this just underscores again why we thought that move -- that enhanced move in Texas is so important and housing is such a driver there. If we look in Colorado, the biggest issue that we have in Colorado is, they frankly need more supply. The demand is there. Colorado's population has grown 14% since 2010. So that's almost 1 million people that gained a house seat in this last population. So again, we anticipate continued strong housing growth in Colorado. North Carolina just continues to grow dramatically. We see it here in our backyard every day between what's happening in Charlotte and in Raleigh-Durham.
When I moved by North Carolina, I think this is important is, places like Greensboro. I think I might have mentioned earlier in the year, D.R. Horton has announced a plan to build 1,000 home single-family subdivision there and annual starts and the Triad are up 28% year-over-year. So again, these are powerful numbers. If we're looking at Atlanta, Atlanta single-family housing starts now approaching 35,000. That's up on a trailing 12 basis, almost 38%, but it's not just Atlanta, we're seeing that in Atlanta, we're seeing that in Savannah. And even in smaller markets like Augusta that have continued to be very attractive, and even single-family housing in Florida. And keep in mind, that's really not the market that we're in there. We're a niche player in Florida and basically public transportation or infrastructure, but single-family housing in Florida is up 37% on trailing 12 months. And again, Florida has added 2.7 resin since 2010.
So if we look at those numbers, then come back and also lay on top of that, those 2 different propositions that I spoke of just a few minutes ago relative to California on SB9 and SB10. If we are of the view that single-family housing is going to stay strong for a while and that aggregate tends to follow that with a very high correlative factor. And if we're assuming, this is what we think is going to happen. We think single-family starts in '21 go to about 1.2 million. We think in '22, they probably go to around 1.4 million and in '23, to about 1.5 million. Those are heady numbers, but here's what's important to remember. If we're right and they go to 1.2 million in 2021, that's 2,000 levels. In the U.S., it has added 48 million people since then. If we're right and they go to 1.4 million in '22, that's in 2003 levels. And if we're right, and it goes to 1.5 million in '23, that's 2003 and 2004 levels. Again, on a much higher population base. So I've tried to give you some color around specific markets that matter to us, but I've also tried to give you some numbers just broadly nationally that we think are relevant and we think are worth keeping in the back or front of your mind."

Clearly, they don't have the capacity in California that we have in Texas right now. We've got 1 million ton more capacity in Texas, and obviously adding more at Midlothian. Part of what we're wanting to make sure right now is that we've got those facilities in California running optimally where they are.
Our view is, we invest in the business once we know we've got it where it needs to be. So we're going through the capital process and looking at it very carefully as we speak. As Jim indicated earlier in his conversation with Paul, the increase in CapEx that you see is almost uniquely tied to what's going on in the Lehigh Hanson's West region that we now have, and certainly, a significant portion of that is going to the cement business. Jim, anything you want to add to that?"

The thing that I would always say is, where we've been, and you've heard us say that and you were an aggregate select company, and that's the way we think about our businesses first. And so I would always encourage you to remember that with us. At the same time, for example, when we went in and bought the business in Minnesota, that is the Tiller business, that does have a hot mix component to it. But part of what's so different about that is, it doesn't have a laydown component to it. So if you think about really what I think makes Martin Marietta different from many is, we're not so much in the contracting business. We will take that stone in Minnesota in some respects, add liquid to it, turn it into Black pavement and sell it FOB the facility. So number one, aggregate slug is the right way to think of us; two, being more focused on materials is the right way to think of us.
Lastly, with respect to growing the business, look, at the end of the transaction, clearly, our debt-to-EBITDA range is a little bit above 3x. As you know, we like to stay in the range of 2 to 2.5x. We think that's actually going deleverage very nicely over the next year to 18 months. I think it's possible that if we get toward the end of next year, we could be back towards the high end of our range. I mean that's really, I think, doing great work in deleveraging the business. I think we have added immense value to this business by doing not acquisitions, but by doing the right acquisitions. By doing these transactions that we've done, we have opened up a series of new corridors. And if you go back in time and you look at the way that we've grown our business, we have been focused uniquely on corridors of growth. whether it's I-95, I-85, Interstate 40, whether it's I-25 in Colorado and now increasingly on I-5 in California. So aggregate slug is the right way to think of us, a company that wants to continue to do the right deals in the right markets is the right way to think of us and heavy side oriented is where we will continue to resign, Anthony. So I hope that helps."

At the same time, for example, the Port Arthur LNG facility that's been on some degree of hold for a while, our understanding, spectral is really anticipating some bid refreshing on that in this quarter. And we may see some activity there as early as Q1 2022, not job that we've won at this point, but still nonetheless, seeing that type of activity on heavy, we actually think it's quite attractive, Josh."

No, look, I think a quick answer is, we've been very comfortably in those zones that we had talked about earlier. And I think when -- again, David, if it's 900 -- if it's almost 1 million tons of bill and Phil largely looked at broadly as almost a waste product. Obviously, we sold it for front because we did have in the books for anything, but it is a bill product. And if you're looking at what was a fairly significant movement on base, particularly in that Raleigh market, again, of all the things that I've worried at night about aggregate pricing is not on my list. And those are purely and simply those are the drivers. The other thing -- and I know your question was on organic, but I do think it's important to keep in mind when you look at it all rolled up, stone pricing in the acquired Tiller operations are about $5 a ton lower than our heritage number. So again, when you do an all-in number with that, it clearly has optically a dilutive effect. And then when you feather in nearly 1 million tons of funds, again, it will have an optical effect. But I think, to your point, the midyear, I think really did underscore the strength of the market. To give you a sense of what we saw in the East division and this really means in the Carolinas, was $1 a ton up on clean stone effective July 1, and even $0.50 on base effective July 1. And then Southwest, we saw -- in North Texas, up $0.50 to $0.75 a ton on September 1. In Austin, up $1 a ton and around Hunter stone, which is in new Broncos, $0.50 to up $1 a ton and then at Garwood, up $1 a ton on August 1. So I think all those at least in the way that I'm watching it and measuring the cadence, David, give me a high degree of confidence in what we're anticipating next year that and probably more importantly, together with conversations we've had with our customers. So I hope that helps."
