I'll begin today's call with some key highlights from last quarter of last year, and walk you through an update on the progress of eBay's tech-led reimagination. I will then turn the cal",2299,"Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today's call with some key highlights from last quarter of last year, and walk you through an update on the progress of eBay's tech-led reimagination. I will then turn the call over to Andy to discuss the details of our recent performance and near-term outlook.
Overall, 2020 was a great year for sellers and buyers on eBay. We are pleased that we closed out the year with strong results. For Q4, gross merchandise volume in marketplaces grew 18%, well ahead of our expectations. The holiday season contributed to the strong performance as we saw record volume with high velocity in hard-to-find and sold-out items. Refurbished gift also emerged as a top trend, and we saw many products from top brands in our certified refurbished experience sell-out completely.
Our buyers were very active during the holiday season. In the U.S., 1 in 10 online shoppers bought something on eBay. In Germany, that number was 1 in 7. And in the U.K., it was 1 in 4. In addition to this holiday surge, we experienced unprecedented traffic levels for most of 2020, and yet our platform had the highest availability in the last 6 years.
To put this in context, more than 100 days in 2020 exceeded peak 2019 traffic levels. eBay has been able to seamlessly handle these peaks, while keeping our marketplace open for all during a global pandemic.
For the full quarter, revenue grew 10 points faster than volume, up 28% driven primarily by payments and advertising. And we delivered $0.86 in non-GAAP earnings per share which was above our expectations and included reinvestments for the long term.
Our customer metrics grew on both sides of our marketplace in the quarter. Active buyers grew 7% to $185 million globally, and our active seller base increased by 5% as more small business and consumer sellers listed and sold on the platform. These results capped off a tremendous year for eBay. In 2020, we added an incremental $14 billion of GMV, that's more growth in the past 7 years combined. Organic revenue grew 21% and non-GAAP earnings per share grew 49%, and we returned nearly $5.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.
In July, I laid out a long-term vision for the company, and we have rearchitected our road map to achieve our tech-led reimagination over the next few years. We also made progress on our multiyear initiatives, payments and advertising, which drove tremendous financial results while providing customers with a significantly improved experience. 
We continue to make significant advancements with our managed payments transition, ending the year with over 1 million sellers migrated. During the quarter, eBay managed payments for over 38% of on-platform volume. In the U.S., we exited the year with over 50% of the migration complete. In addition to the 5 markets where we already launched, transitions have been announced or underway in France, Italy, Spain and Greater China. We have also started to transition consumer sellers in the U.S., U.K., Canada and Germany.
Seller satisfaction has improved compared to Q3, and NPS scores from sellers in managed payments remain more than 10 points higher than the NPS of sellers who have yet to migrate. Over the course of 2021, we plan to roll out payments to remaining markets, launch cross-border trade and release product capabilities for all use cases. This road map opens up managed payments to all sellers globally and places us firmly on our path toward 100% migration. As the vast majority of the transition will be complete by the end of this year, we are well positioned to deliver at least an incremental $2 billion in revenue and $500 million in operating income annually in 2022.
In Q4, advertising growth outpaced volume once again as sellers lean further into Promoted Listings to grow their business. For the quarter, Promoted Listings delivered over $215 million of revenue up 57% despite having lapped a major product launch that drove strong acceleration a year ago. For the full year, Promoted Listings grew 86%. This product continues to grow in part because sellers who have adopted Promoted Listings are seeing, on average, a double-digit sales increase.
Our total advertising revenue reached a new milestone in 2020 passing $1 billion for the year. We see tremendous growth potential remaining as this represents approximately 1% of GMV, well below industry benchmarks. We expect advertising revenue to outpace volume for the foreseeable future.
Now I'd like to share an update on the transfer of Classifieds to Adevinta. We remain excited to bring together 2 highly complementary businesses that can create tremendous value over time. We believe the deal is on track to close as we have received the vast majority of regulatory approvals. We expect closure by the end of the first quarter, subject to the remaining regulatory approvals which we are working to obtain.
We also recently announced that we are exploring options for our Korean business. Our 2 local platforms, Gmarket and IAC, have built leading e-commerce positions by tailoring to customer needs with innovative experiences. With a paid loyalty program of over 2.5 million members, and a growing first-party inventory program, these businesses primarily focus on new and seasoned products from B2C sellers with limited cross-border trade. As we mentioned in our press release, we will not be communicating any further information about the strategic review process until there is material information to disclose.
I will now provide an update on the progress we have made towards our long-term vision for eBay. The 3 strategic priorities to support this vision remain the same: First, to defend our core by building compelling next-gen experiences for enthusiasts; second, to become the partner of choice for sellers; and third, to cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with our buyers.
In the past few months, we launched several new product experiences aligned with this vision. While we still have a long way to go, we are encouraged by the initial reaction from buyers and sellers and the acceleration in GMV in several categories. During the fall in the U.S., we launched authentication for luxury watches, and quickly rolled out a similar experience to sneakers a few weeks later. We have put a greater focus on protecting buyers and sellers by preventing counterfeits and eliminating fraudulent returns. These experiences are driving significantly higher-than-average customer satisfaction, and we see opportunities to expand this capability to other verticals and markets.
This new product experience is driving material growth in these categories for U.S. business. For luxury watches over $2,000, we saw a double-digit increase in GMV growth in Q4 versus Q3 driven by higher sell-through rates and higher average prices. For sneakers over $100, we saw triple-digit growth year-over-year in Q4. While some volume growth is due to the effects of the pandemic, significant growth drivers included the authentication rollout, pricing reductions and marketing changes.
Sneaker buyer behavior is a great example of the power of the eBay platform. In 2020, the average customer who purchased a pair of sneakers over $100 spent a total of $2,500 on eBay. Approximately 80% of that spend was in categories outside of sneakers. We will continue to drive more cross-category shopping to grow GMV per buyer over time.
To expand the buyer base, we are investing in new channels, including social marketing to reach more gen z and millennial customers. We launched a TikTok campaign called Lace 'Em Up, generating 4.7 billion views. And we also have been partnering with celebrities, famous athletes and influencers on exclusive promotions.
Another area of non-new and season inventory we're focused on is outlet fashion. In the U.K., we launched an optimized brand outlet experience with 150 fashion brands offering products at deep discounts. This contributed to strong double-digit GMV growth in fashion ahead of U.K. market rates. We also saw active listings double and active buyers in the category grew 30% in Q4.
Moving on to the second key priority of our vision, becoming the platform of choice for sellers. In addition to enhancements in payments and advertising, we continue to provide small businesses with more tools and capabilities to help them grow. In Q4, we added more automation and scale to sell our initiated offers. This uniquely eBay feature allows sellers to escape the limits of a buyback by enabling them to offer custom deals to individual buyers. For the year, seller-initiated offers drove over $1.2 billion of GMV.
Another win for sellers on eBay in Q4 was in SEO. The work we have done in the past to optimize our platform for search engine ranking and visibility is paying off. SEO traffic is growing faster than paid channels and delivering more new buyers to small business sellers on eBay.
Last, we continued to increase seller visibility in our native app by driving traffic to their eBay stores. 95% of our store subscribers have migrated to the newest experience, and they are seeing a 20% average increase in visits to their storefront.
The third key priority of our strategy is to cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with buyers. To achieve this, we are leveraging technology to remove friction throughout the buying journey. A major focus for us has been the native app experience.
In 2020, almost half of our global GMV was transacted in the app, and it continues to grow faster than the overall business as buyer and seller preferences evolved. We have maintained high ratings in both iOS and Android, and our app was downloaded more than 50 million times in 2020.
To drive engagement from buyers on mobile, we have simplified item pages, made it easier to like or share an item and provided more exposure by creating direct access to seller stores. Additionally, we improved conversion by enhancing search relevance and streamlining sort and filter options, allowing app users to find what they are looking for faster. 
While we are focused on delivering our vision, we remain committed to keeping our purpose at the forefront by leveraging the power of our platform to support our communities. One way we did this last year was by helping to quickly and efficiently distribute PPE to frontline workers in the U.K. eBay partnered with the U.K.'s National Health Service, the Department for Health and Social Care and logistic partners on this effort. I am proud to report that in December, the NHS PPE portal powered by eBay reached a significant milestone. Together, we delivered more than 1 billion PPE items to more than 45,000 social care providers in the U.K.
Another way the eBay platform provides opportunity is by enabling a thriving customer community that loves to give back. During the year that has been challenging for so many, the eBay for Charity community continues to be an inspiration. 2020 was a record-breaking year with nearly $123 million raised globally in charitable donations. The generosity showed by our buyers and sellers is amazing. The spirit of a global community centered around connection and economic opportunity for all is clearly alive and well.
Over the course of 2020, eBay invested more than $100 million to support the growing needs of small businesses around the world through programs like Up & Running. These programs provided the access, training and resources needed to start selling online and connect new sellers to eBay's global community of buyers. And just last quarter, we announced further assistance through Up & Running Grants program. In the coming weeks, we will reward a number of eBay U.S. small business sellers a grant package worth $10,000 each.
As I've mentioned in the past, at eBay, we focus our sustainability initiatives on the most impactful goals that will help strengthen our business and provide the most value to all our stakeholders. And our commitment to climate action and transparency is being recognized externally. We were once again included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North America indices and recognized in the Carbon Disclosure Project A List for the first time. In the past year alone, we have avoided an additional 720,000 metric tons of carbon emissions through people selling their preowned electronics and apparel on eBay.
In summary, we are making progress on our vision to realize the enormous untapped potential of eBay, and we have a clear road map for 2021 and beyond. Our payments transition is on track and will largely be completed this year. Our advertising business will continue to outpace volume through Promoted Listings and other products.
As we [ defend ] the quarter, we plan to expand our new vertical experiences to more markets and innovate in more categories. To date, we have only touched a single-digit percentage of our global GMV, but in the coming years, that will expand to a majority of volume.
To build a platform of choice for sellers, we will continue to expand the stores experience and give sellers more tools to increase velocity. We will also leverage technology to dramatically simplify the end-to-end selling process for consumer and business sellers.
To create more lifelong buyer relationships, we will connect with them through new channels, deepen their engagement with the eBay app and deliver trusted experiences when they shop with us. Last but not least, we will continue to invest in product and technology, and evolve how we spend marketing in order to become the best marketplace in the world for buyers and sellers.
I know we can accomplish all of this due to the fantastic team I have the privilege of leading. Our employees live our purpose in 2020, and I look forward to what we can do together for our customers in 2021 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy to provide more details on our financial performance. Andy?"

I will begin my prepared remarks with our Q4 financial highlights, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q4, we generated $2.9 billion of revenue, $0.86 of non-GAAP EPS and $715 million of free cash flow, while returning $529",2016,"Thanks, Jamie. I will begin my prepared remarks with our Q4 financial highlights, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q4, we generated $2.9 billion of revenue, $0.86 of non-GAAP EPS and $715 million of free cash flow, while returning $529 million to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends.
Moving to active buyers on Slide 5. We exited the year with 185 million buyers, representing 7% year-on-year growth, a 2-point acceleration versus the third quarter. Since the end of Q1, we've added 11 million buyers to the ecosystem and are seeing retention rates in line with historical cohorts. We continue to see growth in GMV per active buyer across the buyer base.
Moving to Slide 6. In Q4, we enabled $26.6 billion of marketplace GMV, up 18% year-on-year. While volume decelerated 3 points versus the third quarter, we did see modest acceleration compared to September growth rates driven by a decrease in consumer mobility and benefits from ongoing improvements in the product experience across horizontal work streams and the progress we're making in key verticals.
In the U.S., we generated $9.6 billion of GMV in Q4, up 25% year-on-year, decelerating 8 points from Q3. International GMV was up 15% year-on-year, a 1-point acceleration versus the third quarter, inclusive of growth in our off-platform Korean business at 5%, accelerating 1 point from Q3. For the full year, the marketplace platform generated $100 billion of GMV, up 17% year-on-year, an acceleration of 19 points versus the prior year.
Turning to revenue on Slide 7. Our Q4 net revenue was $2.9 billion, up 28% organically, accelerating 2 points. We delivered $2.6 billion of transaction revenue, up 31%, accelerating 3 points from Q3 driven by our payments migration and strength in advertising.
In managed payments, strong execution continued as we rapidly expanded seller migration to the new payments platform reaching over 38% of global on-platform volume in the quarter. In addition to the higher customer satisfaction metrics that Jamie mentioned, managed payments contributed 10 points of incremental revenue growth versus 2019. 
Transaction take rate was 9.8% for the quarter, accelerating [ 40 ] basis points driven by managed payments and Promoted Listings, partially offset by FX. This is the second straight quarter with a 40 basis point increase, and we expect take rate to continue to grow as managed payments and Promoted Listings continue to scale.
We delivered $270 million of marketing services and other revenue, up 3%, accelerating 4 points from Q3, mostly from a lower headwind from lapping the sale of brands4friends, partially offset by first-party growth in Korea, which decelerated approximately 40 points to 60% year-on-year growth.
For the full year, the marketplace platform generated $10.3 billion in revenue, up 20%. Year-over-year growth was driven by higher volumes as well as strong execution in our initiatives. In advertising, we cleared $1 billion, ahead of expectations and powered by the 86% growth in Promoted Listings. And managed payments delivered 8 points of incremental revenue growth in the second half of the year.
Turning to Slide 8 and major cost drivers. In Q4, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 28.1%. This is up approximately 20 basis points year-on-year, driven by volume leverage and growth in advertising, partially offset by reinvestments and FX. Cost of revenue was up over 1 point year-on-year driven by managed payments and our first-party inventory program in Korea, partially offset by volume leverage.
Sales and marketing expense was down approximately 50 basis points versus the prior year as volume leverage and spend efficiency were partially offset by investments in our vertical strategy and brand advertising. Product development costs were flat as volume leverage was offset by investments in the product experience, including managed payments.
G&A was down approximately 70 basis points, primarily from volume leverage and cost control, partially offset by charitable donations to support the eBay Foundation. Transaction losses were down 10 basis points as bad debt rates have performed better than expected.
For the year, operating margin was 31.3%, up 3 points; 2 points from volume upside, net of reinvestment; and 1 point from continued cost efficiency related to our operational review.
Turning to EPS on Slide 9. In Q4, we delivered $0.86 of non-GAAP EPS, up 31% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS growth was driven primarily by higher volume, a reduction in share count driven by our repurchases and growth in advertising and payments, partially offset by a higher tax rate and investments in our vertical strategy and brand advertising.
For the year, we delivered 49% growth in non-GAAP EPS primarily driven by volume, reduction in share count from our repurchase program, growth in advertising and payments in addition to continued cost efficiency, partially offset by FX, a higher tax rate and lower interest income.
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.12, up 94% versus last year. The increase in GAAP EPS is mostly driven by the same factors of non-GAAP performance, plus the change in the value of investments, including the fair value of the Adyen warrant, partially offset by a higher tax rate. For the year, we delivered 100% growth in GAAP EPS, primarily driven by the fair value of the Adyen warrant, non-GAAP performance, our share repurchase program, partially offset by a higher tax rate. As always, you can find the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
Moving to Slide 10. In Q4, we generated $715 million of free cash flow, up 27%, driven by higher earnings. We had a very strong year of cash generation finishing 2020 with $2.7 billion of free cash flow, a 29% increase year-on-year, driven by top line growth, improved working capital and lower CapEx, partially offset by higher cash taxes.
Moving to Slide 11. For the quarter, we ended with cash and investments of $4.1 billion and debt of $7.8 billion. In Q4, we repurchased nearly 8.5 million shares at an average price of $49.46 per share, amounting to $419 million. For the year, we repurchased nearly 124 million shares at an average price of $41.31, amounting to $5.1 billion in total. We ended the year with $2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.
Moving to Slide 12, I'd like to provide an update on our investments, starting with the pending Classifieds transaction. As Jamie said, we remain excited to bring together 2 highly complementary businesses that can create tremendous value over time. When we announced the transfer on July 20, the valuation was $9.2 billion based on a mix of cash and Adevinta shares. The share price has appreciated by over 10%, which increased the value of the Classifieds business to nearly $10.7 billion based on recent trading levels. We expect that the cash portion of the transfer will provide approximately $2 billion net of tax. And we currently expect any future sale of our stake would be a taxable event at the prevailing statutory rate.
Turning to Adyen. The warrant we acquired in Q2 of 2018 is valued at $1.1 billion at the end of Q4, an increase of $770 million year-on-year. This is an additional value driver stemming from our payments initiative, incremental to the plan of at least $2 billion of transaction revenue and $500 million of operating profit that is expected in 2022. You can find more information on the Adyen warrant in our 10-K. For both of these investments, we remain excited about the optionality they provide, including the significant value each can generate for shareholders.
Moving to guidance on Slide 13. Given the limited visibility to potential outcomes in the longer term, we are providing guidance for the first quarter, and we'll reassess providing longer-term guidance at a later date. For Q1, we are projecting revenue between $2.94 billion and $2.99 billion, growing between 35% to 37% on an organic FX-neutral basis. This assumes marketplace's volume growth in the low 20s driven by strength in e-commerce and continued improvements in our user experience. In addition, we expect further take rate expansion driven by ongoing strong execution in managed payments and advertising.
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.03 to $1.08 per share, representing 49% to 57% growth. We expect non-GAAP EPS growth will be driven primarily by volume, lower share count, managed payments and advertising, partially offset by continued investments in product and marketing. We are expecting GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.81 to $0.86 per share in Q1.
In February, our Board approved a 13% increase to our quarterly dividend raising it to $0.18 per share. The dividend will be payable to shareholders of record as of March 1 with the payment date of March 19. Our Board has also approved an additional share repurchase authorization of $4 billion, with no expiration, raising the total authorization to approximately $6 billion.
While we aren't guiding for the full year, we do want to provide some additional context for our path forward. On volume, while we are in early days, we feel great about the progress we are making on the strategy we've laid out, and believe these efforts will continue to deliver growth as we scale. In the near term, it is important to note that we will begin to lap significantly tougher comps toward the end of Q1.
And looking at Q2 specifically, we will be facing into our peak level of growth in 2020, that was driven by the first wave of mobility restrictions, stimulus payments around the world and supply chain disruptions that our globally distributed sellers were well positioned to overcome. We expect revenue will continue to outpace GMV as seller migration into managed payments nears completion. And we expect ads to continue to grow faster than volume on our way to the next $1 billion.
On margin, we expect to continue to drive operational efficiency, while investing into higher rates of long-term revenue growth. We maintain our commitment of delivering 2 points of margin expansion versus 2019, achieving at least 30% by 2022.
We expect to deliver strong free cash flow, and we'll continue to return capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends while being opportunistic with strategic M&A to accelerate our core strategy.
Throughout 2020, we strengthened our balance sheet by leveraging favorable market conditions to improve rates on our outstanding debt within our existing targets and tenants. We will continue to optimize our capital structure and recently announced our intention to call our retail bond that we plan to replace with debt at favorable rates in 2021.
In summary, 2020 was an extraordinary year. We added $14 billion of GMV and 11 million active buyers to our ecosystem. We executed in payments and advertising, which delivered a combined 7 points of incremental revenue growth compared to GMV for the year, 13 points in the fourth quarter. We processed over 38% of on-platform GMV through managed payments in the fourth quarter while improving experiences for buyers and sellers. We cleared $1 billion in advertising in the year, highlighted by 86% growth within Promoted Listings. We grew non-GAAP EPS by 49%, and delivered strong free cash flow of $2.7 billion. We executed a comprehensive portfolio review, including the divestiture of StubHub for $4 billion, the pending transfer of ECG assets at a favorable valuation and announced the decision to explore options for Korea in January. We returned nearly $5.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. Repurchasing $5.1 billion of our own shares, taking advantage of a market price that we do not believe reflects the value of our company. And in these imaginably tough times, we were there to help our employees, sellers, buyers and communities while delivering strong results for our shareholders.
We exit 2020 having improved the underlying health of the business by delivering on the strategy we implemented this year. And we entered 2021 focused and excited to deliver on the next phase of the strategy as we build more compelling next-gen experiences, become the partner of choice for sellers and cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with our buyers. And now we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

Let me take the first one on verticals and then Andy can take a second. So we invested in those verticals really based on the strategy that we laid out in July of focusing on non-new and season and opportunities where we had strength to win.

I mentioned the triple-digit growth rate that we saw in sneakers, you got to remember, this was a business that had been in decline. And so to see it as strong as this shows us the power of really focusing on those verticals and the end-to-end experience for our customers.
And so while those categories represent a single-digit percentage of our GMV, the plan is to continue to roll out new category experiences from an end-to-end perspective over the course of the coming years, eventually meeting the majority of our GMV.
I will add that we included another area for us in the U.K., where we piloted a fashion brand outlet with 150 fashion brand sellers performed really well, double-digit growth ahead of the market and ahead of what we expected.

But the beauty of this model is, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're committed to the 30% margin, and we believe that we've got a very strong plan to get there. And we feel like we've done -- or made great progress on the initiatives this year, exiting the year stronger -- certainly stronger than we entered and stronger than we had anticipated when we entered the year. As we look at the controllable aspects of growth, if you peel apart what we can see from COVID-related items."

So starting on the buyer ones. We acquired 11 million buyers over the course of the year. And what we're seeing is that the behavior, when we look at things like frequency and retention, is not different and is as strong as we've seen in past cohorts, which means they didn't just come to us for eBay to buy a specific PPE and then we won't see them again. We're doing a good job of turning a percentage of them into enthusiasts.
And what we're really focused on is how do we turn them into cross-category shoppers. So as I mentioned in the remarks, a sneaker buyer who comes into eBay is going to be worth $2,500, [ or they end up ] buying $2,500 worth of GMV. But only 20% of that is in sneakers, and 80% of that will be in other categories across the site. And that's a huge advantage for us because of the cross-category nature that we have of the platform. And it's also a specific focus and something that we lean into a lot is driving it. And a lot of that growth is coming from C2C, and is bringing gen z and millennials to the platform, which is also critical and part of our strategy.
In terms of the authentication, we've ramped up the amount of authenticating what we're doing to now every sneaker over $100 going through the authentication platforms. And we're seeing great response and great operations there. So consumers are getting their sneakers really quickly, and the authentication process is working. And look, while it's a very, very small percentage of things that we find where there are issues that guarantee for customers is a huge differentiator and is a big part of what's leading to the triple-digit growth. So we're leaning in a lot in terms of marketing and acquiring those customers in that category, and we're excited for what we're seeing."

On Q4 dynamics and then the international versus U.S. split, it looks like there's a bit of a difference between U.S. and international growth rates with the U.S. down 8 and international accelerating on a quarter-over-quarter basis. That's really less an impact of what we saw in the fourth quarter and more an impact of kind of the unwind of the second quarter spike and how third quarter rates played through. So keep in mind, in the U.S. in the third quarter, the growth rate -- the deceleration from Q2 was a little less.
So when we look at third quarter -- or fourth quarter and how it plays through into the first, it's really for us more what we saw -- what we've seen since September with some acceleration really in all -- basically all countries around the world. And that's played through to the first quarter, and it's implied in the acceleration you see in our Q1 guidance. So clearly, mobility plays a large role in sustaining a level of growth and driving a bit of acceleration. But again, the initiatives we're working on and the progress we've made with regards to product and marketing and managed payments and search contribute as well to the acceleration on a quarter-over-quarter basis. But clearly, the majority of that's going to be mobility driven but underlying performance is better."

Since I was here the first time, it continues to be a really important thing when you look at driving the CLTV of our buyers. If I go back to the sneaker example, I talked about the 80% outside the category, and that represents them purchasing in 10 categories out of that core category.
I would even broaden that question to say, we're really studying a lot that first kind of 90-day experience for a customer and looking at all the things that drive the retention of them. And so getting them to download the mobile app, getting them to shop across category, getting them to watch or save items and really driving more of our marketing technology to align to driving the retention of the buyers. And that's why we're excited to see that.
A big reason why we also focused on C2C selling is because if we acquire that buyer to come in as a buyer and then we get them to just do any kind of casual selling, they become 2 to 2.5x more valuable to us as a buyer. So really that whole kind of introductory life cycle and being really algorithmic, and using our best data science and AI, really working on our marketing technology to be able to leverage that more is a key focus for us.
And look, on the competitive landscape, we feel great about our positioning. We significantly improved the NPS of our experiences, especially in those focused verticals that we talked about. And we're seeing really good feedback from buyers and sellers. And that's always the leading indicator is that CSAT and NPS performance and what's happening there.
And so that, combined with the payment CSAT stuff we're seeing where sellers that are moving to our payments 2.0, our managed payments platform, have a 10-point higher NPS, is making us feel really good about where our competitive positioning is.
And last thing I'd say is just thinking about the scale, right? So we talked about $14 billion GMV that we grew year-on-year last year. That's more than the last 7 years combined. That's more than most vertical competitors would do in a year, we grew more than that amount. So being able to leverage those 185 million buyers, and have their purchasing across category is a huge and unique asset for eBay."

On your question on managed payments, absolutely. It's a huge part of the win is really streamlining the payment process and providing more payment options. Cross-border trade for us has always been a great business. A really unique business to eBay and specifically in the Greater China corridor and helps us bring on new buyers to the platform and a different type of inventory. So between what we're doing in terms of speed pack and some of the forward deployed inventory, plus now as we expand payments to Greater China, we think that will help a number of the quarters in terms of our cross-border trade business."

And some percentage of those are actually because they lost their job, and so they're looking for opportunities on just making money on the platform.
The other thing that's important to remember is that we believe that people have about $4,000 of items in their house that they can sell, less than 20% of that is online. And so there's a huge kind of social element which we're leading into as part of that, but definitely a focus on the gen z millennials.

But not only does Buy It Now remains strong, but we've innovated over the years in things like best offer and in seller-initiated offers. And seller-initiated offers, as an example, is almost the inverse the best offer. Best offer is the buyer making an offer. Sellers can actually make specific individual offers to sellers who have interacted with one of their products, and we're doing $1.2 billion already in that. It's one of the unique elements of the eBay platform as auctions, best offers, seller-initiated offers are all ways for buyers and sellers to get to a negotiated price on the platform. But overall, Buy It Now still remains the vast majority of the business."

But a",415,"Yes. So look, the buying behavior that we saw over the course of the year it started in PPE equipment, then went to kind of stuff that people needed to work from home or stay at home, things like fitness equipment and laptops and that type of thing. But after that, it was really broad based and continues to be broad based in terms of where we're acquiring buyers.
So from everything from people spending time in their hobbies and parts and accessories or fixing up their cars to Certified Refurbished on what we're doing there. We're definitely seeing strength in buyer acquisition and the focused verticals that we have been talking about. So like apparel that we worked on in the quarter with the brand fashion outlet. And in the areas that we announced in the U.S., and we'll be expanding globally.
So more important for us is not where we acquire them, but getting really smart and using a lot of AI about what's the best second category, how we're using all of our tools and capabilities across marketing and the apps and the websites to get them to interact in different parts of the business. And that's where I think about it just getting a little bit better every single day in how we're able to do that is going to be what continues to help drive those numbers.
From an ads perspective, we're focused on the tools and capabilities to make it easier for sellers to use the product to give them templating and reporting of how it's doing and be able to have that closed-loop ROI on the spend that they have on the platform. To make it more applicable to C2C sellers and make it really easy there because, obviously, if you think about a sophisticated B2C seller, it's easier to interact with and much easier understands in advertising product. So that's a big component of what we're doing.
And then also just building new algorithms and relevance and machine learning into are we displaying the best thing to the buyers. So we continue to expand the program while not degrading the buying experience and ideally, enhancing the buyer experience through what we're doing on our advertising products.
So what you'll see is just continued quarter-after-quarter innovation in that product to help us keep the -- grow the -- and reach the potential of the product and have it continue to outpace GMV for the near and medium term."

I'll begin today's call with some key highlights from last quarter of last year, and walk you through an update on the progress of eBay's tech-led reimagination. I will then turn the call over to Andy to discuss the details of our recent performance and near-term outlook. 
Overall, 2020 was a great year for sellers and buyers on eBay. We are pleased that we closed out the year with strong results. For Q4, gross merchandise volume in marketplaces grew 18%, well ahead of our expectations. The holiday season contributed to the strong performance as we saw record volume with high velocity in hard-to-find and sold-out items. Refurbished gifts also emerged as a top trend, and we saw many products from top brands in our certified refurbished experience sell out completely. 
Our buyers were very active during the holiday season. In the U.S., 1 in 10 online shoppers bought something on eBay. In Germany, that number was 1 in 7. And in the U.K., it was 1 in 4. In addition to this holiday surge, we experienced unprecedented traffic levels for most of 2020, and yet our platform had the highest availability in the last 6 years. 
To put this in context, more than 100 days in 2020 exceeded peak 2019 traffic levels. eBay has been able to seamlessly handle these peaks, while keeping our marketplace open for all during a global pandemic. 
For the full quarter, revenue grew 10 points faster than volume, up 28% driven primarily by payments and advertising. And we delivered $0.86 in non-GAAP earnings per share, which was above our expectations and included reinvestments for the long term. 
Our customer metrics grew on both sides of our marketplace in the quarter. Active buyers grew 7% to $185 million globally, and our active seller base increased by 5% as more small business and consumer sellers listed and sold on the platform. These results capped off a tremendous year for eBay. In 2020, we added an incremental $14 billion of GMV, that's more growth in the past 7 years combined. Organic revenue grew 21% and non-GAAP earnings per share grew 49%, and we returned nearly $5.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. 
In July, I laid out a long-term vision for the company, and we have rearchitected our road map to achieve our tech-led reimagination over the next few years. We also made progress on our multiyear initiatives, payments and advertising, which drove tremendous financial results while providing customers with a significantly improved experience.  
We continue to make significant advancements with our managed payments transition, ending the year with over 1 million sellers migrated. During the quarter, eBay managed payments for over 38% of on-platform volume. In the U.S., we exited the year with over 50% of the migration complete. In addition to the 5 markets where we already launched, transitions have been announced or underway in France, Italy, Spain and Greater China. We have also started to transition consumer sellers in the U.S., U.K., Canada and Germany.  
Seller satisfaction has improved compared to Q3, and NPS scores from sellers in managed payments remain more than 10 points higher than the NPS of sellers who have yet to migrate. Over the course of 2021, we plan to roll out payments to remaining markets, launch cross-border trade and release product capabilities for all use cases. This road map opens up managed payments to all sellers globally and places us firmly on our path toward 100% migration. 
As the vast majority of the transition will be complete by the end of this year, we are well positioned to deliver at least an incremental $2 billion in revenue and $500 million in operating income annually in 2022. 
In Q4, advertising growth outpaced volume once again as sellers lean further into Promoted Listings to grow their business. For the quarter, Promoted Listings delivered over $215 million of revenue, up 57% despite having lapped a major product launch that drove strong acceleration a year ago. For the full year, Promoted Listings grew 86%. This product continues to grow, in part because sellers who have adopted Promoted Listings are seeing, on average, a double-digit sales increase. 
Our total advertising revenue reached a new milestone in 2020, passing $1 billion for the year. We see tremendous growth potential remaining as this represents approximately 1% of GMV, well below industry benchmarks. We expect advertising revenue to outpace volume for the foreseeable future. 
Now I'd like to share an update on the transfer of Classifieds to Adevinta. We remain excited to bring together 2 highly complementary businesses that can create tremendous value over time. We believe the deal is on track to close as we have received the vast majority of regulatory approvals. We expect closure by the end of the first quarter, subject to the remaining regulatory approvals which we are working to obtain. 
We also recently announced that we are exploring options for our Korean business. Our 2 local platforms, Gmarket and IAC, have built leading e-commerce positions by tailoring to customer needs with innovative experiences. With a paid loyalty program of over 2.5 million members, and a growing first-party inventory program, these businesses primarily focus on new and seasoned products from B2C sellers with limited cross-border trade. As we mentioned in our press release, we will not be communicating any further information about the strategic review process until there is material information to disclose. 
I will now provide an update on the progress we have made towards our long-term vision for eBay. The 3 strategic priorities to support this vision remain the same: first, to defend our core by building compelling next-gen experiences for enthusiasts; second, to become the partner of choice for sellers; and third, to cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with our buyers. 
In the past few months, we launched several new product experiences aligned with this vision. While we still have a long way to go, we are encouraged by the initial reaction from buyers and sellers and the acceleration in GMV in several categories. During the fall in the U.S., we launched authentication for luxury watches, and quickly rolled out a similar experience to sneakers a few weeks later. We have put a greater focus on protecting buyers and sellers by preventing counterfeits and eliminating fraudulent returns. These experiences are driving significantly higher-than-average customer satisfaction, and we see opportunities to expand this capability to other verticals and markets. 
This new product experience is driving material growth in these categories for U.S. business. For luxury watches over $2,000, we saw a double-digit increase in GMV growth in Q4 versus Q3, driven by higher sell-through rates and higher average prices. For sneakers over $100, we saw triple-digit growth year-over-year in Q4. While some volume growth is due to the effects of the pandemic, significant growth drivers included the authentication rollout, pricing reductions and marketing changes. 
Sneaker buyer behavior is a great example of the power of the eBay platform. In 2020, the average customer who purchased a pair of sneakers over $100 spent a total of $2,500 on eBay. Approximately 80% of that spend was in categories outside of sneakers. We will continue to drive more cross-category shopping to grow GMV per buyer over time. 
To expand the buyer base, we are investing in new channels, including social marketing to reach more Gen Z and millennial customers. We launched a TikTok campaign called Lace 'Em Up, generating 4.7 billion views. And we also have been partnering with celebrities, famous athletes and influencers on exclusive promotions. 
Another area of non-new and season inventory we're focused on is outlet fashion. In the U.K., we launched an optimized brand outlet experience with 150 fashion brands offering products at deep discounts. This contributed to strong double-digit GMV growth in fashion ahead of U.K. market rates. We also saw active listings double and active buyers in the category grew 30% in Q4. 
Moving on to the second key priority of our vision, becoming the platform of choice for sellers. In addition to enhancements in payments and advertising, we continue to provide small businesses with more tools and capabilities to help them grow. In Q4, we added more automation and scale to sell our initiated offers. This uniquely eBay feature allows sellers to escape the limits of a buyback by enabling them to offer custom deals to individual buyers. For the year, seller-initiated offers drove over $1.2 billion of GMV. 
Another win for sellers on eBay in Q4 was in SEO. The work we have done in the past to optimize our platform for search engine ranking and visibility is paying off. SEO traffic is growing faster than paid channels and delivering more new buyers to small business sellers on eBay. 
Last, we continued to increase seller visibility in our native app by driving traffic to their eBay stores. 95% of our store subscribers have migrated to the newest experience, and they are seeing a 20% average increase in visits to their storefront. 
The third key priority of our strategy is to cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with buyers. To achieve this, we are leveraging technology to remove friction throughout the buying journey. A major focus for us has been the native app experience. 
In 2020, almost half of our global GMV was transacted in the app, and it continues to grow faster than the overall business as buyer and seller preferences evolved. We have maintained high ratings in both iOS and Android, and our app was downloaded more than 50 million times in 2020. 
To drive engagement from buyers on mobile, we have simplified item pages, made it easier to like or share an item and provided more exposure by creating direct access to seller stores. Additionally, we improved conversion by enhancing search relevance and streamlining sort and filter options, allowing app users to find what they are looking for faster.  
While we are focused on delivering our vision, we remain committed to keeping our purpose at the forefront by leveraging the power of our platform to support our communities. One way we did this last year was by helping to quickly and efficiently distribute PPE to frontline workers in the U.K. eBay partnered with the U.K.'s National Health Service, the Department for Health and Social Care and logistic partners on this effort. I am proud to report that in December, the NHS PPE portal powered by eBay reached a significant milestone. Together, we delivered more than 1 billion PPE items to more than 45,000 social care providers in the U.K. 
Another way the eBay platform provides opportunity is by enabling a thriving customer community that loves to give back. During the year that has been challenging for so many, the eBay for Charity community continues to be an inspiration. 2020 was a record-breaking year with nearly $123 million raised globally in charitable donations. The generosity showed by our buyers and sellers is amazing. The spirit of a global community centered around connection and economic opportunity for all is clearly alive and well. 
Over the course of 2020, eBay invested more than $100 million to support the growing needs of small businesses around the world through programs like Up & Running. These programs provided the access, training and resources needed to start selling online and connect new sellers to eBay's global community of buyers. And just last quarter, we announced further assistance through Up & Running grant program. In the coming weeks, we will reward a number of eBay U.S. small business sellers a grant package worth $10,000 each. 
As I've mentioned in the past, at eBay, we focus our sustainability initiatives on the most impactful goals that will help strengthen our business and provide the most value to all our stakeholders. And our commitment to climate action and transparency is being recognized externally. We were once again included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North America indices and recognized in the Carbon Disclosure Project A List for the first time. In the past year alone, we have avoided an additional 720,000 metric tons of carbon emissions through people selling their preowned electronics and apparel on eBay. 
In summary, we are making progress on our vision to realize the enormous untapped potential of eBay, and we have a clear road map for 2021 and beyond. Our payments transition is on track and will largely be completed this year. Our advertising business will continue to outpace volume through Promoted Listings and other products. 
As we defend the quarter, we plan to expand our new vertical experiences to more markets and innovate in more categories. To date, we have only touched a single-digit percentage of our global GMV, but in the coming years, that will expand to a majority of volume. 
To build a platform of choice for sellers, we will continue to expand the stores experience and give sellers more tools to increase velocity. We will also leverage technology to dramatically simplify the end-to-end selling process for consumer and business sellers. 
To create more lifelong buyer relationships, we will connect with them through new channels, deepen their engagement with the eBay app and deliver trusted experiences when they shop with us. Last but not least, we will continue to invest in product and technology, and evolve how we spend marketing in order to become the best marketplace in the world for buyers and sellers. 
I know we can accomplish all of this due to the fantastic team I have the privilege of leading. Our employees live our purpose in 2020, and I look forward to what we can do together for our customers in 2021 and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy to provide more details on our financial performance. Andy?"

I will begin my prepared remarks with our Q4 financial highlights, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q4, we generated $2.9 billion of revenue, $0.86 of non-GAAP EPS and $715 million of free cash flow, while returning $529",2014,"Thanks, Jamie. I will begin my prepared remarks with our Q4 financial highlights, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q4, we generated $2.9 billion of revenue, $0.86 of non-GAAP EPS and $715 million of free cash flow, while returning $529 million to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. 
Moving to active buyers on Slide 5. We exited the year with 185 million buyers, representing 7% year-on-year growth, a 2-point acceleration versus the third quarter. Since the end of Q1, we've added 11 million buyers to the ecosystem and are seeing retention rates in line with historical cohorts. We continue to see growth in GMV per active buyer across the buyer base. 
Moving to Slide 6. In Q4, we enabled $26.6 billion of marketplace GMV, up 18% year-on-year. While volume decelerated 3 points versus the third quarter, we did see modest acceleration compared to September growth rates, driven by a decrease in consumer mobility and benefits from ongoing improvements in the product experience across horizontal work streams and the progress we're making in key verticals. 
In the U.S., we generated $9.6 billion of GMV in Q4, up 25% year-on-year, decelerating 8 points from Q3. International GMV was up 15% year-on-year, a 1-point acceleration versus the third quarter, inclusive of growth in our off-platform Korean business at 5%, accelerating 1 point from Q3. For the full year, the marketplace platform generated $100 billion of GMV, up 17% year-on-year, an acceleration of 19 points versus the prior year.
Turning to revenue on Slide 7. Our Q4 net revenue was $2.9 billion, up 28% organically, accelerating 2 points. We delivered $2.6 billion of transaction revenue, up 31%, accelerating 3 points from Q3, driven by our payments migration and strength in advertising.
In managed payments, strong execution continued as we rapidly expanded seller migration to the new payments platform, reaching over 38% of global on-platform volume in the quarter. In addition to the higher customer satisfaction metrics that Jamie mentioned, managed payments contributed 10 points of incremental revenue growth versus 2019. 
Transaction take rate was 9.8% for the quarter, accelerating 40 basis points, driven by managed payments and Promoted Listings, partially offset by FX. This is the second straight quarter with a 40 basis point increase, and we expect take rate to continue to grow as managed payments and Promoted Listings continue to scale.
We delivered $270 million of marketing services and other revenue, up 3%, accelerating 4 points from Q3, mostly from a lower headwind from lapping the sale of brands4friends, partially offset by first-party growth in Korea, which decelerated approximately 40 points to 60% year-on-year growth.
For the full year, the marketplace platform generated $10.3 billion in revenue, up 20%. Year-over-year growth was driven by higher volumes as well as strong execution in our initiatives. In advertising, we cleared $1 billion, ahead of expectations and powered by the 86% growth in Promoted Listings. And managed payments delivered 8 points of incremental revenue growth in the second half of the year.
Turning to Slide 8 and major cost drivers. In Q4, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 28.1%. This is up approximately 20 basis points year-on-year, driven by volume leverage and growth in advertising, partially offset by reinvestments and FX. Cost of revenue was up over 1 point year-on-year, driven by managed payments and our first-party inventory program in Korea, partially offset by volume leverage.
Sales and marketing expense was down approximately 50 basis points versus the prior year as volume leverage and spend efficiency were partially offset by investments in our vertical strategy and brand advertising. Product development costs were flat as volume leverage was offset by investments in the product experience, including managed payments.
G&A was down approximately 70 basis points, primarily from volume leverage and cost control, partially offset by charitable donations to support the eBay Foundation. Transaction losses were down 10 basis points as bad debt rates have performed better than expected.
For the year, operating margin was 31.3%, up 3 points; 2 points from volume upside, net of reinvestment; and 1 point from continued cost efficiency related to our operational review.
Turning to EPS on Slide 9. In Q4, we delivered $0.86 of non-GAAP EPS, up 31% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS growth was driven primarily by higher volume, a reduction in share count driven by our repurchases and growth in advertising and payments, partially offset by a higher tax rate and investments in our vertical strategy and brand advertising.
For the year, we delivered 49% growth in non-GAAP EPS, primarily driven by volume, reduction in share count from our repurchase program, growth in advertising and payments in addition to continued cost efficiency, partially offset by FX, a higher tax rate and lower interest income.
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.12, up 94% versus last year. The increase in GAAP EPS is mostly driven by the same factors of non-GAAP performance, plus the change in the value of investments, including the fair value of the Adyen warrant, partially offset by a higher tax rate. For the year, we delivered 100% growth in GAAP EPS, primarily driven by the fair value of the Adyen warrant, non-GAAP performance, our share repurchase program, partially offset by a higher tax rate. As always, you can find the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
Moving to Slide 10. In Q4, we generated $715 million of free cash flow, up 27%, driven by higher earnings. We had a very strong year of cash generation finishing 2020 with $2.7 billion of free cash flow, a 29% increase year-on-year, driven by top line growth, improved working capital and lower CapEx, partially offset by higher cash taxes.
Moving to Slide 11. For the quarter, we ended with cash and investments of $4.1 billion and debt of $7.8 billion. In Q4, we repurchased nearly 8.5 million shares at an average price of $49.46 per share, amounting to $419 million. For the year, we repurchased nearly 124 million shares at an average price of $41.31, amounting to $5.1 billion in total. We ended the year with $2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.
Moving to Slide 12, I'd like to provide an update on our investments, starting with the pending Classifieds transaction. As Jamie said, we remain excited to bring together 2 highly complementary businesses that can create tremendous value over time. When we announced the transfer on July 20, the valuation was $9.2 billion based on a mix of cash and Adevinta shares. The share price has appreciated by over 10%, which increased the value of the Classifieds business to nearly $10.7 billion based on recent trading levels. We expect that the cash portion of the transfer will provide approximately $2 billion net of tax. And we currently expect any future sale of our stake would be a taxable event at the prevailing statutory rate.
Turning to Adyen. The warrant we acquired in Q2 of 2018 is valued at $1.1 billion at the end of Q4, an increase of $770 million year-on-year. This is an additional value driver stemming from our payments initiative, incremental to the plan of at least $2 billion of transaction revenue and $500 million of operating profit that is expected in 2022. You can find more information on the Adyen warrant in our 10-K. For both of these investments, we remain excited about the optionality they provide, including the significant value each can generate for shareholders.
Moving to guidance on Slide 13. Given the limited visibility to potential outcomes in the longer term, we are providing guidance for the first quarter, and we'll reassess providing longer-term guidance at a later date. For Q1, we are projecting revenue between $2.94 billion and $2.99 billion, growing between 35% to 37% on an organic FX-neutral basis. This assumes marketplace's volume growth in the low 20s, driven by strength in e-commerce and continued improvements in our user experience. In addition, we expect further take rate expansion driven by ongoing strong execution in managed payments and advertising.
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.03 to $1.08 per share, representing 49% to 57% growth. We expect non-GAAP EPS growth will be driven primarily by volume, lower share count, managed payments and advertising, partially offset by continued investments in product and marketing. We are expecting GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.81 to $0.86 per share in Q1.
In February, our Board approved a 13% increase to our quarterly dividend, raising it to $0.18 per share. The dividend will be payable to shareholders of record as of March 1 with the payment date of March 19. Our Board has also approved an additional share repurchase authorization of $4 billion, with no expiration, raising the total authorization to approximately $6 billion.
While we aren't guiding for the full year, we do want to provide some additional context for our path forward. On volume, while we are in early days, we feel great about the progress we are making on the strategy we've laid out, and believe these efforts will continue to deliver growth as we scale. In the near term, it is important to note that we will begin to lap significantly tougher comps toward the end of Q1.
And looking at Q2 specifically, we will be facing into our peak level of growth in 2020, that was driven by the first wave of mobility restrictions, stimulus payments around the world and supply chain disruptions that our globally distributed sellers were well positioned to overcome. We expect revenue will continue to outpace GMV as seller migration into managed payments nears completion. And we expect ads to continue to grow faster than volume on our way to the next $1 billion.
On margin, we expect to continue to drive operational efficiency, while investing into higher rates of long-term revenue growth. We maintain our commitment of delivering 2 points of margin expansion versus 2019, achieving at least 30% by 2022.
We expect to deliver strong free cash flow, and we'll continue to return capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends while being opportunistic with strategic M&A to accelerate our core strategy.
Throughout 2020, we strengthened our balance sheet by leveraging favorable market conditions to improve rates on our outstanding debt within our existing targets and tenants. We will continue to optimize our capital structure and recently announced our intention to call our retail bond that we plan to replace with debt at favorable rates in 2021.
In summary, 2020 was an extraordinary year. We added $14 billion of GMV and 11 million active buyers to our ecosystem. We executed in payments and advertising, which delivered a combined 7 points of incremental revenue growth compared to GMV for the year, 13 points in the fourth quarter. We processed over 38% of on-platform GMV through managed payments in the fourth quarter while improving experiences for buyers and sellers. We cleared $1 billion in advertising in the year, highlighted by 86% growth within Promoted Listings. We grew non-GAAP EPS by 49%, and delivered strong free cash flow of $2.7 billion. We executed a comprehensive portfolio review, including the divestiture of StubHub for $4 billion, the pending transfer of eCG assets at a favorable valuation and announced the decision to explore options for Korea in January. We returned nearly $5.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, repurchasing $5.1 billion of our own shares, taking advantage of a market price that we do not believe reflects the value of our company. And in these imaginably tough times, we were there to help our employees, sellers, buyers and communities while delivering strong results for our shareholders.
We exit 2020 having improved the underlying health of the business by delivering on the strategy we implemented this year. And we entered 2021 focused and excited to deliver on the next phase of the strategy as we build more compelling next-gen experiences, become the partner of choice for sellers and cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with our buyers.

Can you just talk philosophically about how much you think your exit velocity is going to matter against running against that comp versus how much you might want to make investments to sustain momentum in either buyer growth or buyer behavior to sort of outrun the comp through some of the investments you might be able to make against the business or just letting sort of the market play out from a comp perspective."

Let me take the first one on verticals and then Andy can take the second. So we invested in those verticals really based on the strategy that we laid out in July of focusing on non-new and season and opportunities where we had strength to win. And if you look at those categories being watches, sneakers, which we rolled out surely after watches and then Certified Refurbished, we saw really great growth rates. I mentioned the triple-digit growth rate that we saw in sneakers. You got to remember, this was a business that had been in decline. And so to see it as strong as this shows us the power of really focusing on those verticals and the end-to-end experience for our customers.
And so while those categories represent a single-digit percentage of our GMV, the plan is to continue to roll out new category experiences from an end-to-end perspective over the course of the coming years, eventually meeting the majority of our GMV.
I will add that we included another area for us in the U.K., where we piloted a fashion brand outlet with 150 fashion brand sellers performed really well, double-digit growth ahead of the market and ahead of what we expected. And so that kind of gives us the confidence that the strategy is working and the confidence to continue to roll out more categories over the coming quarters and years."

But the beauty of this model is, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're committed to the 30% margin, and we believe that we've got a very strong plan to get there. And we feel like we've done -- or made great progress on the initiatives this year, exiting the year stronger -- certainly stronger than we entered and stronger than we had anticipated when we entered the year, as we look at the controllable aspects of growth, if you peel apart what we can see from COVID-related items."

So starting on the buyer ones. We acquired 11 million buyers over the course of the year. And what we're seeing is that the behavior, when we look at things like frequency and retention, is not different and is as strong as we've seen in past cohorts, which means they didn't just come to us for eBay to buy a specific PPE and then we won't see them again. We're doing a good job of turning a percentage of them into enthusiasts.
And what we're really focused on is how do we turn them into cross-category shoppers. So as I mentioned in the remarks, a sneaker buyer who comes into eBay is going to be worth $2,500, or they end up buying $2,500 worth of GMV. But only 20% of that is in sneakers, and 80% of that will be in other categories across the site. And that's a huge advantage for us because of the cross-category nature that we have of the platform. And it's also a specific focus and something that we lean into a lot is driving it. And a lot of that growth is coming from C2C, and is bringing Gen Z and millennials to the platform, which is also critical and part of our strategy.
In terms of the authentication, we've ramped up the amount of authenticating we're doing to now every sneaker over $100 going through the authentication platforms. And we're seeing great response and great operations there. So consumers are getting their sneakers really quickly, and the authentication process is working. And look, while it's a very, very small percentage of things that we find where there are issues, that guarantee for customers is a huge differentiator and is a big part of what's leading to the triple-digit growth. So we're leaning in a lot in terms of marketing and acquiring those customers in that category, and we're excited for what we're seeing."

Ross, I'll take the first one. On Q4 dynamics and then the international versus U.S. split, it looks like there's a bit of a difference between U.S. and international growth rates, with the U.S. down 8 and international accelerating on a quarter-over-quarter basis. That's really less an impact of what we saw in the fourth quarter and more an impact of kind of the unwind of the second quarter spike and how third quarter rates played through. So keep in mind, in the U.S. in the third quarter, the growth rate -- the deceleration from Q2 was a little less.
So when we look at third quarter -- or fourth quarter and how it plays through into the first, it's really for us more what we saw -- what we've seen since September with some acceleration really in all -- basically all countries around the world. And that's played through to the first quarter, and it's implied in the acceleration you see in our Q1 guidance. So clearly, mobility plays a large role in sustaining a level of growth and driving a bit of acceleration. But again, the initiatives we're working on and the progress we've made with regards to product and marketing and managed payments and search contribute as well to the acceleration on a quarter-over-quarter basis. But clearly, the majority of that's going to be mobility driven, but underlying performance is better."

Since I was here the first time, it continues to be a really important thing when you look at driving the CLTV of our buyers. If I go back to the sneaker example, I talked about the 80% outside the category, and that represents them purchasing in 10 categories out of that core category.
I would even broaden that question to say, we're really studying a lot that first kind of 90-day experience for a customer and looking at all the things that drive the retention of them. And so getting them to download the mobile app, getting them to shop across category, getting them to watch or save items and really driving more of our marketing technology to align to driving the retention of the buyers. And that's why we're excited to see that.
A big reason why we also focused on C2C selling is because if we acquire that buyer to come in as a buyer and then we get them to just do any kind of casual selling, they become 2 to 2.5x more valuable to us as a buyer. So really that whole kind of introductory life cycle and being really algorithmic, and using our best data science and AI, really working on our marketing technology to be able to leverage that more is a key focus for us.
And look, on the competitive landscape, we feel great about our positioning. We significantly improved the NPS of our experiences, especially in those focused verticals that we talked about. And we're seeing really good feedback from buyers and sellers. And that's always the leading indicator is that CSAT and NPS performance and what's happening there.
And so that, combined with the payment CSAT stuff we're seeing where sellers that are moving to our payments 2.0, our managed payments platform, have a 10-point higher NPS, is making us feel really good about where our competitive positioning is.
And last thing I'd say is just thinking about the scale, right? So we talked about $14 billion GMV that we grew year-on-year last year. That's more than the last 7 years combined. That's more than most vertical competitors would do in a year, we grew more than that amount. So being able to leverage those 185 million buyers, and have their purchasing cross-category is a huge and unique asset for eBay."

So I think part of the benefit of working with Adyen has been that you can accept different forms of online payment, which you probably couldn't do before.

On your question on managed payments, absolutely. It's a huge part of the win is really streamlining the payment process and providing more payment options. Cross-border trade for us has always been a great business, a really unique business to eBay and specifically in the Greater China corridor and helps us bring on new buyers to the platform and a different type of inventory. So between what we're doing in terms of speed pack and some of the forward deployed inventory, plus now as we expand payments to Greater China, we think that will help a number of the quarters in terms of our cross-border trade business."

We recently did a survey, it probably sounds like much of the survey that you've done. And what we saw is that 72% of our sellers that come and start selling on the platform are doing so because they need to earn a little bit of extra money. And some percentage of those are actually because they lost their job, and so they're looking for opportunities on just making money on the platform.
The other thing that's important to remember is that we believe that people have about $4,000 of items in their house that they can sell, less than 20% of that is online. And so there's a huge kind of social element which we're leaning into as part of that, but definitely a focus on the Gen Z millennials.

Sure, Bob. So look, the increase in buyer is, in part, doing a lot of the strategic work that we're doing and the focus verticals, you saw us do more marketing in the quarter, really talking about some of the new capabilities that we have out there. And we leaned in from a reinvestment standpoint to not only acquire those buyers, but to really to work on driving the retention of those buyers into our key platforms.
So obviously, in a number of countries, it's also pandemic-related relative to mobility, but we've also been leaning in to kind of take advantage of that and drive their cohort curves. And we've been impressed that we've been seeing from that perspective.
In terms of the makeup of different format, Buy It Now remains the vast majority of what's on the platform. We do see strength in auctions in areas like collectibles, which is a category that's growing strong for us. But not only does Buy It Now remains strong, but we've innovated over the years in things like best offer and in seller-initiated offers. And seller-initiated offers, as an example, is almost the inverse the best offer. Best offer is the buyer making an offer. Sellers can actually make specific individual offers to sellers who have interacted with one of their products, and we're doing $1.2 billion already in that. It's one of the unique elements of the eBay platform as auctions, best offers, seller-initiated offers are all ways for buyers and sellers to get to a negotiated price on the platform. But overall, Buy It Now still remains the vast majority of the business."

So look, the buying behavior that we saw over the course of the year, it started in PPE equipment, then went to kind of stuff that people needed to work from home or stay at home, things like fitness equipment and laptops and that type of thing. But after that, it was really broad-based and continues to be broad-based in terms of where we're acquiring buyers.
So from everything from people spending time with their hobbies and parts and accessories or fixing up their cars to Certified Refurbished on what we're doing there. We're definitely seeing strength in buyer acquisition and the focused verticals that we have been talking about. So like apparel that we worked on in the quarter with the brand fashion outlet and in the areas that we announced in the U.S., and we'll be expanding globally.
So more important for us is not where we acquire them, but getting really smart and using a lot of AI about what's the best second category, how we're using all of our tools and capabilities across marketing and the apps and the websites to get them to interact in different parts of the business. And that's where I think about it just getting a little bit better every single day in how we're able to do that is going to be what continues to help drive those numbers.
From an ads perspective, we're focused on the tools and capabilities to make it easier for sellers to use the product to give them templating and reporting of how it's doing and be able to have that closed-loop ROI on the spend that they have on the platform. To make it more applicable to C2C sellers and make it really easy there because, obviously, if you think about a sophisticated B2C seller, it's easier to interact with and much easier understands in advertising product. So that's a big component of what we're doing.
And then also just building new algorithms and relevance and machine learning into are we displaying the best thing to the buyers. So we continue to expand the program while not degrading the buying experience and, ideally, enhancing the buyer experience through what we're doing on our advertising products.
So what you'll see is just continued quarter-after-quarter innovation in that product to help us keep the -- grow the -- and reach the potential of the product and have it continue to outpace GMV for the near and medium term."

Today, we'll begin the call with key highlights from the first quarter. Then I will share some reflections from my first 12 months as CEO and provide an update on the status of our tech-led reimagination. At the end of my remarks, I will turn the call over to Andy, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. The first quarter of 2021 was an excellent start to the year for sellers and buyers on eBay. Gross merchandise volume grew 24% ahead of expectations. Revenue grew 38%, outpacing volume primarily due to payments and advertising. This is the fastest our revenues have grown since 2005, and we lean further into technology and vertical marketing investments, but still delivered $1.09 in non-GAAP earnings per share above our expectation. Importantly, our customer metrics grew on both sides of our marketplace. Active sellers grew 8% to $20 million globally, more small businesses are joining the platform and more consumers are engaging in selling. C2C GMV growth outpaced B2C for the fourth quarter in a row. This is positive for the long term as consumer sellers bring unique inventory at compelling prices and spend more than twice as much as buyers who don't sell. Active buyers grew 7% to $187 million globally. We are retaining buyers acquired over the last year at similar rates as prepandemic level, and we're seeing higher customer satisfaction in several categories as well as increased spend per buyer. We have continued to make progress on our multiyear initiatives, payments and advertising, which contribute to a seamless customer experience, increase our platform monetization and deliver compelling financial results. managed payments ended Q1 with over 4 million sellers migrated. This includes millions of consumer sellers and hundreds of thousands of businesses globally. During the quarter, eBay managed payments representing over 52% of on-platform volume, up from 38% last quarter. In the U.S., we exited the quarter over 80% complete. By applying what we learned in previous markets, rollouts in France, Italy and Spain progressed at an even faster pace, and we're on track to launch Greater China this quarter in all remaining markets by the middle of the year. We continue to see higher seller satisfaction due to a simpler end-to-end experience that reduces cost and complexity. For many years before managed payments, sellers had to manage delays between purchase and payment across 2 platforms that tied up their inventory. As sellers migrate to managed payments, that pain point is resolved, saving time and money. And in Q1, we reduced unpaid items by approximately 80% on fixed-price transaction. We remain on track to complete the vast majority of the payments transition by the end of this year, which will deliver our stated financial goals of a leased and incremental $2 billion in revenue and $500 million in annualized operating income in 2022. In Q1, advertising growth outpaced volume, driven by Promoted Listings, which delivered close to $224 million of revenue, up 58%. More than 1.3 million sellers promoted close to 400 million listings during the quarter. Growth was driven by increased seller adoption and AI improvements that increase conversion. Inspired by the success of Promoted Listings over the past few years, we are investing aggressively in innovation. We reached $1 billion of advertising revenue in 2020, primarily through Promoted Listings, which leverages a reentry Due to a combination of mobility driven tailwinds and the execution of our multiyear monetization initiatives. And we are driving value through portfolio optimization and returning capital to shareholders. Despite these notable achievements, there's still a tremendous amount of potential to be realized. Now I'd like to take a step back to a year ago when I rejoined this remarkable company as CEO. I knew eBay as a pioneer in e-commerce, with a globally recognized brand, robust organic traffic and long-standing customer relationships. And I've always been inspired the purpose and special culture it creates.
Last July we set out a vision for a techland reimagination of eBay. First, we believe that we can drive growth in our core by significantly increasing customer satisfaction. Second, we saw the need to better serve our small businesses and consumer sellers to become their platform of choice. And third, we identify the opportunity to evolve our relationship with buyers to drive better long term retention. I am confident we can deliver on these 3 pillars, positioning us to more effectively compete and win in a huge and growing addressable market. 
Our results to date are very encouraging. Our underlying growth is accelerating, sellers and buyers are growing, and we are making progress in our pursuit to be the best global marketplace to buy and sell. Simply put, our strategy is working. Let me share some examples with you. In the U.S., we are growing our core. In Q1, sneakers valued above $100, who had a triple digit rate once again. Since launching authentication, we verified hundreds of thousands of sneakers, and we're seeing buyer satisfaction above 80 as a result. In addition we are expanding our engagement with GenZ and millennials through a wide range of social channels. Based on the tremendous success we've seen in the U.S., we are rapidly expanding identical capabilities to other major markets. We have set up local authentication centers, and are launching in the U.K., Australia and Canada this quarter. These centers will also unlock cross-border trade opportunities in sneakers and in other categories. In luxury watches we saw growth accelerate from 16% in Q4 to 38% in Q1 in the U.S. For authenticated items, we are seeing customer satisfaction that was close to 90%, and is changing customer behavior. Sellers are listing more items, and seeing a higher price realization. Buyers are visiting eBay more often and spending more. One of the key advantages of our platform is cross-category shopping. Our luxury watch buyers, like our sneakers enthusiasts, spend thousands of dollars on other categories across the platform. In addition, based on the value we are delivering in luxury watches, we recently raised fees in this category to create more investment capacity. For our certified refurbished experience, eBay sellers continue to see strong velocity, and we've expanded in the U.S. to over 150 brands. We've also rolled certified refurbished out to the U.K., Canada and Germany, with more than 100 top brands signed up already. Buyers love the low prices on like new products, as well as free shipping, extended warranties, and extended returns. Now I want to highlight the next core category where we see significant potential, trading cards, a key part of our collectibles business. EBay is a market leader in this category, with the widest selection across all price levels. We've seen explosive growth to start the year. In the U.S. GMV was over $1 billion in Q1, which represents more than half of 2020's record setting volume. Active buyers of trading cards doubled, and existing buyers purchased more items at higher prices than last year. To dramatically simplify selling, we've recently launched image based scanning for our top selling trading cards. In addition, we introduced a new, low cost track and shipping service, and aggressively market it to buyers on social and enthusiast forums. We plan to launch more innovation for trading cards throughout this year. Another area of focus for us is customization. Beginning next month, in the U.K. and Germany, we will offer a new capability, to all sellers to offer personalized goods in categories such as home, fashion and jewelry. This will allow buyers to find and enter specific customization requests to the seller. In the past, this process was manual, which limited GMV. But we believe this new experience can significantly improve customer satisfaction, bring more supply onto the platform and capture more growth. We plan to expand this capability to all major markets in the coming months. As I mentioned upfront, our playbook to grow the core is working. We have a series of innovations rolling out to more markets throughout the year. While we've only touched a small percentage of global volume so far, all of our largest eBay categories, collectibles, home and garden, fashion, electronics and parts and accessories have addressable opportunities that can benefit from this playbook. In addition to category-specific changes, we are rolling out site-wide improvements for all sellers. For consumer sellers and small businesses, we are focused on significantly reducing complexity, helping maximize value and driving sustainable growth. We believe these changes will increase seller satisfaction and grow the number of active sellers on the platform. Here are some examples of what we are doing. Image-based listing can remove up to 75% of the time it takes to list an item. We have activated this feature in trading cards, and we plan to expand to multiple categories and geographies throughout the year. Last quarter, we talked about how we have migrated almost all of our store subscribers to our new platform that increases traffic to their items by approximately 20%. This quarter, we empowered sellers with new CRM features, allowing them to directly issue coupons to acquire buyers. In addition, they can set coupon budgets, include QR codes on packing slips and drive repeat business to their eBay stores. Recently, we opened up Thera Peak product research free for all Seller Hub users in several markets, including price insights and listing quality reports. In addition, we launched sourcing insights that help sellers analyze trending categories, top products and signals what inventory is most likely to sell. To acquire more buyers, we are also adding new ad formats to our display and social marketing, including video, and we improved the inventory feeds that power them. Once we acquire these buyers, we are making changes to increase engagement and trust in their first 90 days and beyond. As an example, we are leveraging a mobile-first approach and revamping key communications buyers received. We are seeing increased engagement from Gen Z and millennial customers through social shopping such as eBay Sneaker Showdown, For our experienced buyers, we continue to optimize the end-to-end shopping experience. In Q1, we increased conversion by improving our search engine's understanding of longer complex queries, and we added functionality to help buyers identify free local pickup items in their community. We are excited that all 3 of our strategic pillars are producing volume, seller and buyer growth, but we have a long runway ahead of us. We will continue to drive our investment decisions, both organic and inorganic in pursuit of achieving this vision. While I'm pleased with our business results, I am more proud of the way our employees and our platform are fulfilling our purpose of providing economic opportunity for all. As part of our commitment to empowering small businesses everywhere, we announced an investment of $25 million into the Clear Vision Impact Fund, to help support small- and medium-sized, minority-owned businesses that support historically underserved communities. We continue to support the U.K.'s National Health Care Service efforts, and I'm happy to report that we're now up to 2 billion PPE items distributed utilizing eBay's technology. Additionally, we remain active in philanthropy during Q1. We raised over $35 million through eBay for charity. The company also contributed to Asian Americans Advanced Justice and supported employee giving during Black History Month and the Lunar New Year, and we quadrupled employee matching gift limits through the eBay Foundation. Finally, another area that inspires me is eBay's impact on the planet. Many companies make admirable investments into adjacent programs, but at eBay, sustainability is the core of our business. Since eBay was founded over 25 years ago, re-commerce, or the resale of preowned goods, has been an integral part of our platform and purpose. Our community connects and trades pre-owned items that hold meaning and usefulness and keeps these items out of landfills. A recent survey confirmed that re-commerce resonates with our customers. In the U.S., 87% of respondents say they have sold preowned goods in the last 12 months. And they aren't just selling, 81% of Gen V customers surveyed said that buying pre-owned items has become more common in the last year. In summary, we are making great progress on the tech library [ imagination ] of eBay. We delivered historically strong Q1 results, putting us in a stronger position today than we thought we'd be coming into the year. Looking forward, we are excited because our long-term strategy is working. By increasing customer satisfaction, we are accelerating our core business while attracting and retaining sellers and buyers. There is more work to do, but I couldn't be prouder of the eBay team. They are focused and driven and they work hard every day to innovate, keeping our customers at the forefront. With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy to provide more details on our financial performance. Andy?"

I will begin my prepared remarks with our first quarter financial highlights, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. The first quarter was another great quarter for eBay. We generated over $27 billion of GMV, our highest GMV quarter ever. We delivered $3 billion of revenue, $1.09 of non-GAAP EPS and $855 million of free cash flow, while returning $414 million to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. Moving to active buyers on Slide 5. We exited the quarter with 187 million buyers, representing 7% year-on-year growth, consistent with the fourth quarter. We've added 13 million buyers to the ecosystem since the beginning of 2020 and are experiencing retention rates that remain in line with historical trends. And as we said throughout 2020, we continue to see growth in GMV per active buyer across all cohorts. 
Moving to Slide 6. In Q1, we enabled $27.5 billion of Marketplace GMV, up 24%, accelerating 6 points versus the fourth quarter. On a spot basis, this represents growth of 29%, an acceleration of 8 points versus the fourth quarter. As over 60% of our GMV is generated outside of the U.S., we saw a 5-point translation benefit due to the weaker dollar. On platform volume, which represents nearly 85% of total GMV, grew at 28%, a 7-point acceleration versus Q4, driven by site-wide product experience improvements, progress we're making in key categories, increased mobility restrictions and additional stimulus in the U.S. Our platform business in Korea was relatively stable versus the fourth quarter at 4% year-on-year growth. In the U.S., we generated $10.4 billion of GMV in Q1, up 36% year-on-year, accelerating 11 points from the fourth quarter, driven by mobility dynamics, stimulus payments and strength in our core categories, including collectibles. International GMV was up 17% year-on-year, a 2-point acceleration versus the fourth quarter, driven by strength in our core categories and mobility dynamics. 
Turning to revenue on Slide 7. Our Q1 net revenue was $3 billion, up 38% and accelerating 10 points on an FX-neutral basis. As Jamie said, this was our strongest quarter since 2005. On a spot basis, this represents growth of 42%. We delivered $2.7 billion of transaction revenue, up 40%, accelerating 9 points from the fourth quarter, mostly driven by our payments migration and volume strength. In managed payments, we continue to execute and have made great progress on seller migration to the new payments platform. As Jamie mentioned, we process over half of our global on-platform volume in the quarter, which contributed approximately 15 points of incremental revenue growth versus 2020. Transaction take rate was 10% for the quarter, accelerating 20 basis points driven by managed payments, partially offset by category and seller mix, in addition to currency hedging impacts. When we started the managed payments journey, we expect it to progressively increase monetization of our site, while delivering better seller economics and improved experience for both buyers and sellers and overall revenue growth for the business. We continue to deliver across all of these dimensions. We delivered $291 million of marketing services and other revenue, up 22%, accelerating 19 points from the fourth quarter, driven by first-party growth in Korea, which grew approximately 120%, in addition to strength in advertising and shipping. Turning to Slide 8 and major cost drivers. In Q1, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 33%. This is up approximately 140 basis points year-on-year driven by volume and advertising, partially offset by product and marketing reinvestments, the impact of managed payments growth and FX. For each of the non-GAAP expense buckets, volume and a higher take rate provided leverage as a percent of revenue. I will provide additional context for other significant drivers. Cost of revenue was up nearly 4 points year-over-year as leverage was more than offset by scaling managed payments and our first-party inventory program in Korea. As a reminder, the managed payments cost structure includes payment processing costs that scale in line with payments revenue. This dynamic has been fully contemplated in our 2022 margin targets. Sales and marketing expense was down nearly 2 points versus the prior year as leverage was partially offset by investments in our vertical strategy, strategic reinvestments in online marketing and FX. Product development costs were down 10 basis points as leverage was mostly offset by investments in end-to-end product experience in addition to managed payments and advertising. G&A was down nearly 2 points, primarily from leverage and a disciplined cost control. Transaction losses were down approximately 1.5 points from the benefit of fee netting in our managed payments initiative and lapping COVID-driven deferred fees and seller protection increases. Turning to EPS on Slide 9. In Q1, we delivered $1.09 of non-GAAP EPS, up 59% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS growth was driven primarily by higher volume, growth in payments and advertising and the reduction in share count driven by our repurchases, partially offset by investments in product and marketing. 
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.82, up 44% versus last year. The increase in GAAP EPS is mostly driven by the same factors as non-GAAP performance, partially offset by the fair value of the [ audience warrant. ] Moving to Slide 10. In Q1, we had a very strong quarter of cash generation, finishing Q1 with $855 million of free cash flow, a 65% increase year-on-year driven by top line growth, increased working capital and lower capital expenditures. Turning to Slide 11. For the quarter, we ended with cash and investments of $3.9 billion and debt of $7 billion. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares at an average price of $55.70 per share, amounting to $292 million. We exited the quarter with $5.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Moving to Slide 12 and investments. When we announced the classifieds transaction with Adevinta on July 20 of last year, the valuation was $9.2 billion based on a mix of cash and the value of Adevinta shares at that time. As of April 27, the Adevinta share price had appreciated by nearly 37%, which increased the value of the deal to over $12.7 billion. We continue to expect the deal to close in the second quarter, with the cash portion of the transaction providing approximately $2 billion net of tax. Turning to Adyen. The warrants we acquired in the second quarter of 2018 are valued at $1 billion at the end of the first quarter, an increase of over $700 million year-on-year. You can find more information on the Adyen warrant in our 10-Q. We remain excited about both of these investments, the optionality they provide and the significant value each can generate for our shareholders. 
Turning to guidance on Slide 13. For Q2, we are projecting revenue between $2.98 billion and $3.03 billion, growing between 8% to 10% on an organic FX-neutral basis, representing 12% to 14% growth on a spot basis. This assumes marketplace volume declines high single to low double digits on an FX-neutral basis, representing a decline of mid- to high single digits on a spot basis. This volume guidance is driven by 3 main components: first, the negative impact from lapping our second largest quarter ever, which was fueled by the first wave of mobility restrictions, stimulus payments and supply chain disruptions; second, the ongoing benefit from macro factors, including mobility and stimulus payments across our on-platform businesses, which we estimate are contributing high single-digit growth this quarter. Third and most importantly, continued delivery on initiatives driving us towards our vision, many of which Jamie highlighted earlier. On a year over 2 year basis, this guidance represents growth in the high teens on a spot basis, which is more than $4 billion of incremental GMV versus the same quarter in 2019, as our sellers and buyers have discovered or rediscovered the power and reach of our global platform. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.91 to $0.96 per share, representing a 6% to 11% decrease, primarily driven by volume deleverage and continued investments in product and marketing in support of our strategy, partially offset by managed payments and a lower share count. We expect non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16% to 18%. We are expecting GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.67 to $0.72 per share in Q2. Finally, on Q2, our EPS guidance assumes approximately $400 million of share buyback. While we aren't providing guidance for the full year, we do want to provide some additional context on our path forward. On volume, our conviction in the vision is increasing, and we are confident these efforts will continue to drive additional growth as we scale. While difficult to forecast, mobility will likely continue to improve throughout the second half, pressuring growth. And when combined with easier lapping, that could result in second half FX-neutral volume growth rates similar to those of our second quarter guidance. For buyers, similar to GMV, we expect growth will be pressured as we lap periods of high buyer acquisition. We expect revenue growth will continue to materially outpace GMV growth as our monetization initiatives drive a higher effective take rate. Specifically in payments, we're more than halfway done with the migration of on-platform GMV and expect to deliver at least $1.7 billion of revenue in 2021, well on our way to realizing at least $2 billion of revenue in 2022. On margin, we are on target and remain committed to delivering 2 points of margin expansion versus 2019, achieving at least 30% by 2022. We said along the way that margin accretion won't be linear. And in 2021, we expect margin will be approximately 29% for the full year. With regards to cash and capital allocation, we will continue to deliver strong free cash flow. We remain committed to our targets and tenants, and we will continue to optimize our capital structure within them. 
Specifically on buybacks. For the full year, we anticipate repurchasing approximately $2 billion of stock, excluding deal proceeds. We will update plans for use of proceeds from the classifieds transaction at the time of closure. For our Korea business, we have a strategic review process underway, which includes the possibility of a sale with interest from multiple parties. We are exploring that interest, and we'll provide an update when we have material information to share. And finally, on FX. At current rates, we'd expect the benefit of currency to be smaller in the second half as we lap a relatively weaker U.S. dollar. In conclusion, Q1 was a record quarter for eBay, and we entered Q2 excited about the path forward to deliver on all aspects of our long-term plan. We will continue to execute on our multiyear monetization initiatives, which are driving material benefits to our customers and shareholders as we move towards at least $2 billion of revenue and $0.5 billion of operating income in managed payments and the next $1 billion of advertising revenue. We are delivering on our core strategy, increasing customer satisfaction and attracting and retaining customers as we capitalize on a $0.5 trillion addressable market that is growing double digits. We're delivering consistent, strong free cash flow and continue to deploy that cash in a disciplined manner by investing in our platform for the long term and returning capital to shareholders. On margins, we remain on target for at least 2 points of improvement in 2022 compared to 2019, while we continue to drive efficiencies and strategically reinvest to accelerate growth. And finally, we're executing on our portfolio reviews and will deploy capital in a disciplined manner, balancing reinvestment in the core, capacity for mergers and acquisitions, paying a dividend and buying back our undervalued stock. And now we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

Second one is on the margins. So the 29% margin guidance. Is that just from all this payment revenue coming in at a lower margin? Or is there other discrete areas that you're layering in on the investment? And then lastly, on the trading cards. Are there other categories like this that just kind of have emerged over the last year that you guys maybe had that were nascent and just now are being like activated because consumer behavior has changed? Anything else besides trading cars you would point to that would be an example of like coming out of this whole thing, why eBay would be in much better shape from a category perspective. quarter"

So yes, we've always had a great history in the Collectibles business and a great history in trading cards. Obviously, Q1 was really strong doing over $1 billion in the quarter, which was more than half of last year's record setting. And I'd say, in general, what we see is that when we take category by category and we change the NPS and we change the customer experience, that changes the buyers and sellers and the GMV follows. And in that case, it's similar to what we saw in sneakers and in watches, where that change led to a dramatically different performance. We see customization, which we just launched this quarter as another one of those opportunities. We do millions of items on the site today, but we do it in a way that's really full of a lot of friction between the buyer and the seller. And this makes it really seamless and things, gives us the opportunity to open up more GMV. But as I said upfront, we haven't even touched the -- some of the major categories that we have like home & garden, fashion, electronics, and parts and accessories. These are big core categories that all have addressable opportunities that we think can benefit from this playbook."

I mean, clearly, the first quarter was a huge quarter for us, as I said, our largest quarter ever. As we indicated in January, we had seen increasing restrictions late last year thro",520,"Yes, Ross. And on the other 2 questions on Q2 and Q1 versus Q2 dynamics. I mean, clearly, the first quarter was a huge quarter for us, as I said, our largest quarter ever. As we indicated in January, we had seen increasing restrictions late last year through most of our markets, and those kind of persisted into the first quarter. And the growth in the first quarter, driven by 2 main factors. As we've said, the continued underlying performance and then the correlation between mobility and GMV. And then as the quarter progressed, a lot of further developments and things we learned along the way, back to January, pace of vaccines were very different from where they are today. Mobility has improved throughout the quarter in most markets. And then you've got, as you mentioned, the impact of stimulus payments in the U.S., which, it's hard to say exactly the impact, but -- or when it started or when it will stop, but we believe the peak of that impact was probably in the March time frame. So when you look then on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the biggest difference between Q1 and the outlook for Q2 would be the fact that the stimulus -- or not stimulus, sorry, but the mobility is in a better place today than it was at the beginning of the first quarter. Underlying performance continues to be great. And then as we've said, progress on payments is continuing to be very positive as well. That leads a little bit in to your second question on margin rate for the year. I think a couple of things to consider. We're still on target for the 30% that we said for next year. And we have said all along, it's not going to be linear. We're going to have quarters where we're up or down, and we're going to continue to balance growth and margin along the way. A couple of things when you look at Q1 relative to the rest of the year and then the second half -- and again, you hit on a couple. I think it's important to remember, our historical trend is that Q1 is a bit higher than the rest of the year and typically higher than Q2. Last year, that was a bit muted with the amount of growth that we saw. But I think this year, we're -- with the relative size of the 2 quarters, more on that trend. And then without getting into a specific walk on the second half, I think 3 things. One would be moderating growth, which will have some impact on volume and deleverage. We continue to invest for long-term health. So we're not going to be managing to a quarterly margin target. We're working towards longer-term business health. And then you did call it, and it's a great problem, which is, payments is scaling rapidly. It's delivering a tremendous amount of incremental op income, and it does come with a minor bit of pressure on operating margin, but we feel great about that progress and what it does for the P&L."

You talked a bit about some of the additional product planning with advertising. And so more broadly, I wonder how you think about the ramp of overall seller monetization, how much additional upside do you see there? Or if you see perhaps an opportunity longer term to shift the model towards more ad orientation like we see with marketplaces in other markets? And then secondly, on the margin side, on the spending side, obviously, dynamics this year are a little bit different, given the comps. But we've seen periods of reinvestments with eBay over the last decade. And so Jimmy, you outlined a bit of a division last year, and it sounds like you're happy with the progress this year, so far this year with the verticals. But how do you weigh the need to invest long term and measure your performance on a short-term basis? And how quickly are you going to be able to pivot, if necessary?"

So look, obviously, both payments and advertising are leading to the significant growth in revenue ahead of payments. Since you asked more about advertising, I'll talk about -- we feel great about the business, in p",463,"Yes. So first on the monetization side. So look, obviously, both payments and advertising are leading to the significant growth in revenue ahead of payments. Since you asked more about advertising, I'll talk about -- we feel great about the business, in part because our sellers are seeing a great return on the ad spend. And we think there's a lot of opportunity left from that perspective, to help them be able to move their products with velocity. So what we're announcing this quarter is that we're basically rolling out 3 new experiments or pilots in our advertising business. The first being placement for our auctions. So the growth that we've seen to date has really just been on the fixed price business. So that will be a new capability. We're also testing a CPC-based capability for our sellers, which is a new potential growth vector. And we're looking at off eBay opportunities for our sellers to even further increase their exposure. So we continue to look at the monetization and are we adding value to sellers? A great example for that is in watches this quarter, we saw an opportunity to increase our fees there because of the value that we're creating for our sellers in that category. Overall, when I look at advertising, it's still only 1% of GMV. And if you look at benchmarks, there's significant opportunity above that. And we -- as long as we continue to add value to sellers, we think that will be a continued opportunity. On the second side on the investments, we laid out in July, the strategic plan and started with the category idea on verticals, specifically of reinventing the experience, changing the NPS and driving GMV. And if you look at the results of the past few quarters, this is the fourth quarter in a row where we have triple-digit growth in sneakers. This is a business that had been declining double digits. Our watches went from 16% last quarter to 38%. More importantly, though, we're seeing customer satisfaction metrics in the 80s and 90s. And so we think this concept of really applying it to other parts of the business. So what you're going to see over the next coming quarters and years is us continuing to expand that focus and invest in and roll out additional categories. Like I said, upfront, the majority of our big categories, like parts and accessories, electronics, fashion, all have similar opportunities to follow that playbook. So we're going to continue to do it in a balanced way, as I talked about in July, managing what we spend with what we see as the growth opportunity. And we've already done that in a lot of areas, especially in marketing over the past couple of quarters."

So on take rate, obviously, with payments, we actually think we are -- for the vast majority of sellers, they're going to experience lower fees, even though it will mean at least $0.5 billion of operating income to our business. And we continue to look for ways that we can drive kind of the new experience. The off eBay advertising is a great example of that. And to your comment on watches, it's really kind of a category-by-category basis of us looking at what value are we creating and what opportunities are there for our sellers. On how large this can be, we -- why we're focused on the non-new in season is because we believe it's a $500 million total addressable market. And if you look at our categories on the site, we have high single-digit, low double-digit penetration. And so we think there's lots of opportunity. And coming back to the core of what we said about re-commerce, I think more and more, especially in younger generations are interested in the re-commerce of pre-loved items. And so it's why we're leaning in so much towards that. Also, we're seeing this strategy is working with C2C. So our C2C again outgrew our B2C growth, 34% versus 21%. But that only -- not only brings the unique inventory, but it turns those buyers into twice as valuable buyers, when they try casual selling. And then lastly, the tests we've been doing on the brand outlet side in the U.K. has been performing well. We're growing double digits ahead of market rates. And as I mentioned before, what's great is that while we went out and sourced all of the initial programs to kind of build that up, and now the brands are actually calling us and asking us to be part of that program. So you've seen this playbook from us over the past few quarters where we're trying things in different markets, finding success and then rolling them out more broadly. So we've had a lot of success with sneakers in the U.S., and we're now rolling that out to U.K., Canada and Australia this quarter. And you could see us continue to follow that playbook."

There's a lot of opportunity for us on the seller side. So on the store side, we're migrating all of our stores to the NextGen platform. That's mostly complete, which is a much better platform for them. This quarter, we're rolling out CRM capabilities, which has been a long-standing ask of theirs so that they can remarket to buyers through packing slips, through e-mail, et cetera. So that's been pretty significant. And then even things like the customization that we're launching is a long-standing seller request to drive their business.

We're really focused on the first 90 days for buyers and making sure that they have a great experience on the site. And what you're seeing is that the NPS is up, especially in focused categories like watches and sneakers, certified refurbished, where you now have a 2-year warranty and have the free returns. So we're really pleased with that. The cross-category nature and the size of these categories is one of the best assets of eBay. We talked last quarter about our sneaker buyer, where we acquire a new Gen Z buyer, they end up buying $500 in sneakers, but another $2,000 outside sneakers. We're seeing the same type of thing in watches, where we're acquiring a buyer of new high-end watches and they're spending thousands of dollars outside of other categories. So we continue to lean in, because it's a huge accelerator for us, to get buyers purchasing cross-category and a lot of the marketing technology that we've built and we worked on, the AI with recommendations, et cetera, is really centered on this idea of capturing buyers and having them transact in multiple categories."

So we're going to see things in the short-term variances versus prior year. But I think for me, the core thing is the playbook that we put in place is working. This thesis of really changing the growth trajectory of the category by investing in the playbook is what the team is focused on. And we're going to stay on that for the near to medium future. If I look at coming into this in 2019, we were, I think, declining 2% from a GMV perspective. And if you look at our revenue growth projected, next quarter, we're looking at double-digit revenue growth. So we feel good about where we're positioned coming out of the pandemic."

And I guess, as a follow-up to some of the earlier questions on advertising, as an increasing portion of the transactions end up being C2C or what might be more unique, collectible or enthusiast items, should we still be thinking that, that type of gross merchandise value is still appropriate for PLA because it seems like advertising should work best for probably those categories where there are multiple sellers trying to sell a fairly homogeneous item?"

So to us, it dramatically simplifies the whole experience for a buyer and makes it easier. They keep that payment on file, and it's just a dramatically easier experience. And then it's helping the seller, too, because I mentioned the unpaid item example earlier on the call, but also the ability for them to manage all their business in one place makes it much more streamlined to just run a business on eBay. On the Promoted Listings, we see opportunities really across every category and every price point of GMV. The beauty of the CPA model that we've had of the cost per acquisition model has been just the simplicity of it, of just adding the percentage, and it makes it really easy. But the PC model that we're launching also gives the opportunity to really kind of push volume in a different way, with a different set of capabilities. But even on single and unique items, people want to promote those items and get more exposure for them. They have for the longest period of time. It's why we're launching the ad feature for auction and testing that, is to really go after it. And it's still not -- we still have a lot of opportunity across our listings to increase the penetration. Like I said before, we're only at 1% of GMV."

So the first thing I'd say is that on the category piece, in some cases, the categories have overlapped in terms of features or capabilities we need to build in order to make that a winning NPS for us. So we build authentication once. It took us a couple of months to build it out, but then we're able to roll it out to the next category in a couple of weeks and expand that geographically. And so I think that's actually true for a lot of areas where there's components or features that we're building, specifically to drive the NPS of a category that will be applicable to a broad set of categories across the experience. And in terms of pace, we're going to continue to do what we've done before, which is, roll them out in a specific geography, make sure that we're seeing the intended impact and then roll it out across the board. We don't really want to talk about which category is next and what we're focused on for competitive reasons. But I would just say that we're really pleased with the playbook. We're really pleased that we're able to drive significant growth and a significant change in trajectory and most importantly, a significant change in the customer experience. And so you're just going to see us continue feature after feature, category after category. The second thing I'd say is that the verticals is not the only investment that we're making. A lot of our investment is going to site-wide investments that impact all categories. Clearly, that's true for payments and advertising, but the same is true across our seller tools, across our API business, across the CRM and couponing capabilities that we just rolled out, investments that we have in search and in SEO, which apply to the whole business. So the way I think about them is kind of a good amount of investment in vertical to really change the NPS of those categories, but a significant amount of site-wide investments as well, which lifts all categories. So that's the strategy. That's how we think about it, and we're really pleased with the performance."

Today, we'll begin the call with key highlights from the first quarter, then I will share some reflections from my first 12 months as CEO and provide an update on the status of our tech-led reimagination. At the end of my remarks, I will turn the call over to Andy, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail.
The first quarter of 2021 was an excellent start to the year for sellers and buyers on eBay. Gross merchandise volume grew 24%, ahead of expectations. Revenue grew 38%, outpacing volume primarily due to payments and advertising. This is the fastest our revenues have grown since 2005, and we lean further into technology and vertical marketing investments, but still delivered $1.09 in non-GAAP earnings per share above our expectation.
Importantly, our customer metrics grew on both sides of our marketplace. Active sellers grew 8% to 20 million globally. More small businesses are joining the platform, and more consumers are engaging in selling. C2C GMV growth outpaced B2C for the fourth quarter in a row. This is positive for the long term as consumer sellers bring unique inventory at compelling prices and spend more than twice as much as buyers who don't sell. Active buyers grew 7% to 187 million globally. We are retaining buyers acquired over the last year at similar rates as pre-pandemic level, and we're seeing higher customer satisfaction in several categories as well as increased spend per buyer.
We have continued to make progress on our multiyear initiatives, payments and advertising, which contribute to a seamless customer experience, increased our platform monetization and delivered compelling financial results. Managed payments ended Q1 with over 4 million sellers migrated. This includes millions of consumer sellers and hundreds of thousands of businesses globally.
During the quarter, eBay managed payments representing over 52% of on-platform volume, up from 38% last quarter. In the U.S., we exited the quarter over 80% complete. By applying what we learned in previous markets, rollouts in France, Italy and Spain progressed at an even faster pace, and we're on track to launch Greater China this quarter and all remaining markets by the middle of the year.
We continue to see higher seller satisfaction due to simpler end-to-end experience that reduces cost and complexity. For many years before managed payments, sellers had to manage delays between purchase and payment across 2 platforms that tied up their inventory. As sellers migrate to managed payments, that pain point is resolved, saving time and money. And in Q1, we reduced unpaid items by approximately 80% on fixed price transaction.
We remain on track to complete the vast majority of the payments transition by the end of this year, which will deliver our stated financial goals of at least an incremental $2 billion in revenue and $500 million in annualized operating income in 2022. In Q1, advertising growth outpaced volume driven by Promoted Listings, which delivered close to $224 million of revenue, up 58%. More than 1.3 million sellers promoted close to 400 million listings during the quarter. Growth was driven by increased seller adoption and AI improvements that increased conversion.
Inspired by the success of Promoted Listings over the past few years, we are investing aggressively in innovation. We reached $1 billion of advertising revenue in 2020 primarily through Promoted Listings, which leverages a risk-free CPA model for fixed price inventory. To capture our next billion, we are running multiple experiments, including an ad product for auctions and cost-per-click capabilities. We are also exploring a new capability that expands seller exposure by increasing off-eBay traffic to Promoted Listings.
Q1 clearly demonstrates that the ongoing execution of our long-term vision is driving better results. Small business and consumer sellers are thriving, and buyers are finding unique items at great prices. We have seen strong growth in volume, revenue and earnings over the past year due to a combination of mobility driven tailwinds and the execution of our multiyear monetization initiatives. And we are driving value through portfolio optimization and returning capital to shareholders. Despite these notable achievements, there's still a tremendous amount of potential to be realized.
Now I'd like to take a step back to a year ago when I rejoined this remarkable company as CEO. I knew eBay as a pioneer in e-commerce with a globally recognized brand, robust organic traffic and long-standing customer relationships, and I've always been inspired by the purpose and special culture it creates.
Last July, we set out a vision for a tech-led reimagination of eBay. First, we believe that we can drive growth in our core by significantly increasing customer satisfaction. Second, we saw the need to better serve our small businesses and consumer sellers to become their platform of choice. And third, we identified the opportunity to evolve our relationship with buyers to drive better long-term retention. I am confident we can deliver on these 3 pillars, positioning us to more effectively compete and win in a huge and growing addressable market.
Our results to date are very encouraging. Our underlying growth is accelerating. Sellers and buyers are growing, and we are making progress in our pursuit to be the best global marketplace to buy and sell. Simply put, our strategy is working. Let me share some examples with you.
In the U.S., we are growing our core. In Q1, sneakers valued above $100 grew a triple-digit rate once again. Since launching authentication, we verified hundreds of thousands of sneakers, and we're seeing buyer satisfaction above 80 as a result. In addition, we are expanding our engagement with Gen Z and millennials through a wide range of social channels. Based on the tremendous success we've seen in the U.S., we are rapidly expanding identical capabilities to other major markets. We have set up local authentication centers and are launching in the U.K., Australia and Canada this quarter. These centers will also unlock cross-border trade opportunities in sneakers and in other categories.
In luxury watches, we saw growth accelerate from 16% in Q4 to 38% in Q1 in the U.S. For authenticated items, we are seeing customer satisfaction levels close to 90%, and it is changing customer behavior. Sellers are listing more items and seeing a higher price realization. Buyers are visiting eBay more often and spending more. One of the key advantages of our platform is cross-category shopping. Our luxury watch buyers, like our sneakers enthusiasts, spend thousands of dollars on other categories across the platform.
In addition, based on the value we are delivering in luxury watches, we recently raised fees in this category to create more investment capacity. For our certified refurbished experience, eBay sellers continue to see strong velocity, and we've expanded in the U.S. to over 150 brands. We've also rolled certified refurbish out to the U.K., Canada and Germany with more than 100 top brands signed up already. Buyers love the low prices [ unlike ] new products as well as free shipping, extended warranties and extended returns.
Now I want to highlight the next core category where we see significant potential, trading cards, a key part of our collectibles business. eBay is a market leader in this category with the widest selection across all price levels. We've seen explosive growth to start the year. In the U.S., GMV was over $1 billion in Q1, which represents more than half of 2020's record-setting volume. Active buyers of trading cards doubled, and existing buyers purchased more items at higher prices than last year. To dramatically simplify selling, we recently launched image-based scanning for our top selling trading cards. In addition, we introduced a new low-cost track and shipping service and aggressively market it to buyers on social and enthusiast forums. We plan to launch more innovation for trading cards throughout this year.
Another area of focus for us is customization. Beginning next month, in the U.K. and Germany, we will offer a new capability to all sellers to offer personalized goods in categories such as home, fashion and jewelry. This will allow buyers to find and enter specific customization requests to the seller. In the past, this process was manual, which limited GMV. But we believe this new experience can significantly improve customer satisfaction, bring more supply onto the platform and capture more growth. We plan to expand this capability to all major markets in the coming months.
As I mentioned upfront, our playbook to grow the core is working. We have a series of innovations rolling out to more markets throughout the year. While we've only touched a small percentage of global volume so far, all of our largest eBay categories, collectibles, home and garden, fashion, electronics and parts and accessories, have addressable opportunities that can benefit from this playbook.
In addition to category-specific changes, we are rolling out site-wide improvements for all sellers. For consumer sellers and small businesses, we are focused on significantly reducing complexity, helping maximize value and driving sustainable growth. We believe these changes will increase seller satisfaction and grow the number of active sellers on the platform. Here are some examples of what we are doing.
Image-based listing can remove up to 75% of the time it takes to list an item. We have activated this feature in trading cards, and we plan to expand to multiple categories and geographies throughout the year. Last quarter, we talked about how we have migrated almost all of our store subscribers to our new platform that increases traffic to their items by approximately 20%. This quarter, we empowered sellers with new CRM features, allowing them to directly issue coupons to acquire buyers. In addition, they can set coupon budgets, include QR codes on packing slips and drive repeat business to their eBay stores.
Recently, we opened up Terapeak product research free for all Seller Hub users in several markets, including price insights and listing quality reports. In addition, we launched sourcing insights that help sellers analyze trending categories, top products and signals what inventory is most likely to sell. To acquire more buyers, we are also adding new ad formats to our display and social marketing, including video, and we improved the inventory feeds that power them. Once we acquire these buyers, we are making changes to increase engagement and trust in their first 90 days and beyond.
As an example, we are leveraging a mobile-first approach and revamping key communications buyers [ received ]. We are seeing increased engagement from Gen Z and millennial customers through social shopping, such as eBay Sneaker Showdown. For our experienced buyers, we continue to optimize the end-to-end shopping experience. In Q1, we increased conversion by improving our search engine's understanding of longer complex queries, and we added functionality to help buyers identify free local pickup items in their community.
We are excited that all 3 of our strategic pillars are producing volume, seller and buyer growth, but we have a long runway ahead of us. We will continue to drive our investment decisions, both organic and inorganic, in pursuit of achieving this vision. While I'm pleased with our business results, I am more proud of the way our employees and our platform are fulfilling our purpose of providing economic opportunity for all.
As part of our commitment to empowering small businesses everywhere, we announced an investment of $25 million into the Clear Vision Impact Fund to help support small- and medium-sized minority-owned businesses that support historically underserved communities. We continue to support the U.K.'s National Health Care Service (sic) [ National Health Service ] efforts, and I'm happy to report that we're now up to 2 billion PPE items distributed utilizing eBay's technology. Additionally, we remain active in philanthropy during Q1. We raised over $35 million through eBay for Charity. The company also contributed to Asian Americans Advance Justice (sic) [ Asian Americans Advancing Justice ] and supported employee giving during Black History Month and the Lunar New Year. And we quadrupled employee matching gift limits through the eBay Foundation.
Finally, another area that inspires me is eBay's impact on the planet. Many companies make admirable investments into adjacent programs. But at eBay, sustainability is the core of our business. Since eBay was founded over 25 years ago, re-commerce, or the resale of pre-owned goods, has been an integral part of our platform and purpose. Our community connects and trades pre-owned items that hold meaning and usefulness and keeps these items out of landfills. A recent survey confirmed that re-commerce resonates with our customers. In the U.S., 87% of respondents say they have sold pre-owned goods in the last 12 months. And they aren't just selling. 81% of Gen Z customers surveyed said that buying pre-owned items has become more common in the last year.
In summary, we are making great progress on the tech-led reimagination of eBay. We delivered historically strong Q1 results, putting us in a stronger position today than we thought we'd be coming into the year. Looking forward, we are excited because our long-term strategy is working. By increasing customer satisfaction, we are accelerating our core business while attracting and retaining sellers and buyers. There is more work to do, but I couldn't be prouder of the eBay team. They are focused and driven and they work hard every day to innovate, keeping our customers at the forefront.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy to provide more details on our financial performance. Andy?"

Moving to active buyers on Slide 5. We exited the quarter with 187 million buyers, representing 7% year-on-year growth, consistent with the fourth quarter. We've added 13 million buyers to the ecosystem since the beginning of 2020 and are experiencing retention rates that remain in line with historical trends. And as we said throughout 2020, we continue to see growth in GMV per active buyer across all cohorts.
Moving to Slide 6. In Q1, we enabled $27.5 billion of Marketplace GMV, up 24%, accelerating 6 points versus the fourth quarter. On a spot basis, this represents growth of 29%, an acceleration of 8 points versus the fourth quarter. As over 60% of our GMV is generated outside of the U.S., we saw a 5-point translation benefit due to the weaker dollar. On-platform volume, which represents nearly 85% of total GMV, grew at 28%, a 7-point acceleration versus Q4 driven by site-wide product experience improvements, progress we're making in key categories, increased mobility restrictions and additional stimulus in the U.S.
Our on-platform business in Korea was relatively stable versus the fourth quarter at 4% year-on-year growth. In the U.S., we generated $10.4 billion of GMV in Q1, up 36% year-on-year, accelerating 11 points from the fourth quarter driven by mobility dynamics, stimulus payments and strength in our core categories, including collectibles. International GMV was up 17% year-on-year, a 2-point acceleration versus the fourth quarter driven by strength in our core categories and mobility dynamics.
Turning to revenue on Slide 7. Our Q1 net revenue was $3 billion, up 38% and accelerating 10 points on an FX-neutral basis. As Jamie said, this was our strongest quarter since 2005. On a spot basis, this represents growth of 42%. We delivered $2.7 billion of transaction revenue, up 40%, accelerating 9 points from the fourth quarter mostly driven by our payments migration and volume strength. In managed payments, we continue to execute and have made great progress on seller migration to the new payments platform. As Jamie mentioned, we processed over half of our global on-platform volume in the quarter, which contributed approximately 15 points of incremental revenue growth versus 2020.
Transaction take rate was 10% for the quarter, accelerating 20 basis points driven by managed payments, partially offset by category and seller mix in addition to currency hedging impacts. When we started the managed payments journey, we expected to progressively increase monetization of our site while delivering better seller economics and improved experience for both buyers and sellers and overall revenue growth for the business. We continue to deliver across all of these dimensions. We delivered $291 million of marketing services and other revenue, up 22%, accelerating 19 points from the fourth quarter driven by first-party growth in Korea, which grew approximately 120%, in addition to strength in advertising and shipping.
Turning to Slide 8 and major cost drivers. In Q1, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 33%. This is up approximately 140 basis points year-on-year driven by volume and advertising, partially offset by product and marketing reinvestments, the impact of managed payments growth and FX. For each of the non-GAAP expense buckets, volume and a higher take rate provided leverage as a percent of revenue. I will provide additional context for other significant drivers.
Cost of revenue was up nearly 4 points year-over-year as leverage was more than offset by scaling managed payments and our first-party inventory program in Korea. As a reminder, the managed payments cost structure includes payment processing costs that scale in line with payments revenue. This dynamic has been fully contemplated in our 2022 margin targets.
Sales and marketing expense was down nearly 2 points versus the prior year as leverage was partially offset by investments in our vertical strategy, strategic reinvestments in online marketing and FX. Product development costs were down 10 basis points as leverage was mostly offset by investments in end-to-end product experience in addition to managed payments and advertising. G&A was down nearly 2 points primarily from leverage and a disciplined cost control. Transaction losses were down approximately 1.5 points from the benefit of fee netting in our managed payments initiative and lapping COVID-driven deferred fees and seller protection increases.
Turning to EPS on Slide 9. In Q1, we delivered $1.09 of non-GAAP EPS, up 59% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS growth was driven primarily by higher volume, growth in payments and advertising and the reduction in share count driven by our repurchases, partially offset by investments in product and marketing. 
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.82, up 44% versus last year. The increase in GAAP EPS is mostly driven by the same factors as non-GAAP performance, partially offset by the fair value of the Adyen warrant.
Moving to Slide 10. In Q1, we had a very strong quarter of cash generation, finishing Q1 with $855 million of free cash flow, a 65% increase year-on-year driven by top line growth, increased working capital and lower capital expenditures.
Turning to Slide 11. For the quarter, we ended with cash and investments of $3.9 billion and debt of $7 billion. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares at an average price of $55.70 per share, amounting to $292 million. We exited the quarter with $5.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.
Moving to Slide 12 and investments. When we announced the Classifieds transaction with Adevinta on July 20 of last year, the valuation was $9.2 billion based on a mix of cash and the value of Adevinta shares at that time. As of April 27, the Adevinta share price had appreciated by nearly 37%, which increased the value of the deal to over $12.7 billion. We continue to expect the deal to close in the second quarter with the cash portion of the transaction providing approximately $2 billion net of tax.
Turning to Adyen. The warrants we acquired in the second quarter of 2018 are valued at $1 billion at the end of the first quarter, an increase of over $700 million year-on-year. You can find more information on the Adyen warrant in our 10-Q. We remain excited about both of these investments, the optionality they provide and the significant value each can generate for our shareholders.
Turning to guidance on Slide 13. For Q2, we are projecting revenue between $2.98 billion and $3.03 billion, growing between 8% to 10% on an organic FX-neutral basis, representing 12% to 14% growth on a spot basis. This assumes marketplace volume declines high single to low double digits on an FX-neutral basis, representing a decline of mid- to high single digits on a spot basis.
This volume guidance is driven by 3 main components: first, the negative impact from lapping our second largest quarter ever, which was fueled by the first wave of mobility restrictions, stimulus payments and supply chain disruptions; second, the ongoing benefit from macro factors, including mobility and stimulus payments across our on-platform businesses, which we estimate are contributing high single-digit growth this quarter; third and most importantly, continued delivery on initiatives driving us towards our vision, many of which Jamie highlighted earlier.
On a year over 2-year basis, this guidance represents growth in the high teens on a spot basis, which is more than $4 billion of incremental GMV versus the same quarter in 2019 as our sellers and buyers have discovered or rediscovered the power and reach of our global platform. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.91 to $0.96 per share, representing a 6% to 11% decrease primarily driven by volume deleverage and continued investments in product and marketing in support of our strategy, partially offset by managed payments and a lower share count. We expect non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16% to 18%. We are expecting GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.67 to $0.72 per share in Q2. Finally, on Q2, our EPS guidance assumes approximately $400 million of share buyback.
While we aren't providing guidance for the full year, we do want to provide some additional context on our path forward. On volume, our conviction in the vision is increasing, and we are confident these efforts will continue to drive additional growth as we scale. While difficult to forecast, mobility will likely continue to improve throughout the second half, pressuring growth. And when combined with easier lapping, that could result in second half FX-neutral volume growth rates similar to those of our second quarter guidance.
For buyers, similar to GMV, we expect growth will be pressured as we lap periods of high buyer acquisition. We expect revenue growth will continue to materially outpace GMV growth as our monetization initiatives drive a higher effective take rate. Specifically in payments, we're more than halfway done with the migration of on-platform GMV and expect to deliver at least $1.7 billion of revenue in 2021, well on our way to realizing at least $2 billion of revenue in 2022.
On margin, we are on target and remain committed to delivering 2 points of margin expansion versus 2019, achieving at least 30% by 2022. We said along the way that margin accretion won't be linear. And in 2021, we expect margin will be approximately 29% for the full year. With regards to cash and capital allocation, we will continue to deliver strong free cash flow. We remain committed to our targets and tenets, and we will continue to optimize our capital structure within them.
Specifically on buybacks. For the full year, we anticipate repurchasing approximately $2 billion of stock, excluding deal proceeds. We will update plans for use of proceeds from the Classifieds transaction at the time of closure.
For our Korea business, we have a strategic review process underway, which includes the possibility of a sale with interest from multiple parties. We are exploring that interest, and we'll provide an update when we have material information to share. And finally, on FX. At current rates, we'd expect the benefit of currency to be smaller in the second half as we lap a relatively weaker U.S. dollar.
In conclusion, Q1 was a record quarter for eBay, and we entered Q2 excited about the path forward to deliver on all aspects of our long-term plan. We will continue to execute on our multiyear monetization initiatives, which are driving material benefits to our customers and shareholders as we move towards at least $2 billion of revenue and $0.5 billion of operating income in managed payments and the next $1 billion of advertising revenue.
We are delivering on our core strategy, increasing customer satisfaction and attracting and retaining customers as we capitalize on a $0.5 trillion addressable market that is growing double digits. We're delivering consistent strong free cash flow and continue to deploy that cash in a disciplined manner by investing in our platform for the long term and returning capital to shareholders.
On margins, we remain on target for at least 2 points of improvement in 2022 compared to 2019, while we continue to drive efficiencies and strategically reinvest to accelerate growth. And finally, we're executing on our portfolio reviews. And we'll deploy capital in a disciplined manner, balancing reinvestment in the core, capacity for mergers and acquisitions, paying a dividend and buying back our undervalued stock.
And now we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

But if we look at 1Q to 2Q sequentially, I think it assumes about a 7% decline Q-on-Q for GMV. Normally, you're kind of flat Q-on-Q. So I guess, can you parse that into how much is like stimulus burning off versus all these economies reopening in the context of what Jamie said about buyers retaining at a high level and spend per buyer going up? Just trying to reconcile that.
Second one is on the margins. So the 29% margin guidance. Is that just from all this payment revenue coming in at a lower margin? Or is there other discrete areas that you're layering in on the investment? And then lastly on the trading cards. Are there other categories like this that just kind of have emerged over the last year that you guys maybe had that were nascent and just now are being like activated because consumer behavior has changed? Anything else besides trading cars you would point to that would be an example of like coming out of this whole thing why eBay would be in much better shape from a category perspective?"

So yes, we've always had a great history in the collectibles business and a great history in trading cards. Obviously, Q1 was really strong, doing over $1 billion in the quarter, which was more than half of last year's record setting. And I'd say, in general, what we see is that when we take category by category and we change the NPS and we change the customer experience, that changes the buyers and sellers and the GMV follows. And in that case, it's similar to what we saw in sneakers and in watches where that change led to a dramatically different performance.
We see customization, which we just launched this quarter, as another one of those opportunities. We do millions of items on the site today, but we do it in a way that's really full of a lot of friction between the buyer and the seller. And this makes it really seamless and I think gives us the opportunity to open up more GMV. But as I said upfront, we haven't even touched the -- some of the major categories that we have like home and garden, fashion, electronics and parts and accessories. These are big core categories that all have addressable opportunities that we think can benefit from this playbook."

And on the other 2 questions on Q2 and Q1 versus Q2 dynamics, I mean, clearly, the first quarter was a huge quarter for us. As I said, our largest quarter ever. As we indicated in January, we had seen increasing restrictions late last year through most of our markets, and those kind of persisted into the first quarter. And the growth in the first quarter, driven by 2 main factors. As we've said, the continued underlying performance and then the correlation between mobility and GMV.
And then as the quarter progressed, a lot of further developments and things we learned along the way. Back to January, pace of vaccines were very different from where they are today. Mobility has improved throughout the quarter in most markets. And then you've got, as you mentioned, the impact of stimulus payments in the U.S., which it's hard to say exactly the impact but -- or when it started or when it will stop, but we believe the peak of that impact was probably in the March time frame. So when you look then on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the biggest difference between Q1 and the outlook for Q2 would be the fact that the -- or not stimulus, sorry, that the mobility is in a better place today than it was at the beginning of the first quarter. Underlying performance continues to be great. And then as we've said, progress on payments is continuing to be very positive as well.
That leads a little bit into your second question on margin rate for the year. I think a couple of things to consider. We're still on target for the 30% that we said for next year. And we have said all along, it's not going to be linear. We're going to have quarters where we're up or down, and we're going to continue to balance growth and margin along the way. A couple of things when you look at Q1 relative to the rest of the year and then the second half and again, you hit on a couple. I think it's important to remember, our historical trend is that Q1 is a bit higher than the rest of the year and typically higher than Q2. Last year, that was a bit muted with the amount of growth that we saw. But I think this year, we're -- with the relative size of the 2 quarters, more on that trend.
And then without getting into a specific walk on the second half, I think 3 things. One would be moderating growth, which will have some impact on volume and deleverage. We continue to invest for long-term health, so we're not going to be managing to a quarterly margin target. We're working towards longer-term business health. And then you did call it, and it's a great problem, which is payments is scaling rapidly. It's delivering a tremendous amount of incremental op income, and it does come with a minor bit of pressure on operating margin. But we feel great about that progress and what it does for the P&L."

You talked a bit about some of the additional product planning with advertising. And so more broadly, I wonder how you think about the ramp of overall seller monetization, how much additional upside you see there or if you see perhaps an opportunity longer term to shift the model towards more ad orientation like we see with marketplaces in other markets.
And then secondly on the margin side. And the spending side, obviously, dynamics this year are a little bit different given the comps, but we've seen periods of reinvestments with eBay over the last decade. And so Jamie, you outlined a bit [ of a division ] last year and it sounds like you're happy with the progress this year -- so far this year with the verticals. But how do you weigh the need to invest long term and measure your performance on a short-term basis? And how quickly are you going to be able to pivot if necessary?"
27862,710756072,2262008,"eBay Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Yes. So first on the monetization side. So look, obviously, both payments and advertising are leading to the significant growth in revenue ahead of payments. Since you asked more about advertising, I'll talk about we feel great about the business, in part",460,"Yes. So first on the monetization side. So look, obviously, both payments and advertising are leading to the significant growth in revenue ahead of payments. Since you asked more about advertising, I'll talk about we feel great about the business, in part, because our sellers are seeing a great return on the ad spend. And we think there's a lot of opportunity left from that perspective to help them be able to move their products with velocity.
So what we're announcing this quarter is that we're basically rolling out 3 new experiments or pilots in our advertising business, the first being placement for our auctions. So the growth that we've seen to date has really just been on the fixed price business. So that will be a new capability. We're also testing a CPC-based capability for our sellers, which is a new potential growth vector. And we're looking at off-eBay opportunities for our sellers to even further increase their exposure.
So we continue to look at the monetization and are we adding value to sellers. A great example for that is in watches this quarter, we saw an opportunity to increase our fees there because of the value that we're creating for our sellers in that category. Overall, when I look at advertising, it's still only 1% of GMV. And if you look at benchmarks, there's significant opportunity above that. And we -- as long as we continue to add value to sellers, we think that will be a continued opportunity.
On the second side on investments, we laid out in July the strategic plan and started with the category idea on verticals specifically of reinventing the experience, changing the NPS and driving GMV. And if you look at the results of the past few quarters, this is the fourth quarter in a row where we have triple-digit growth in sneakers. This is a business that had been declining double digits. Our watches went from 16% last quarter to 38%. More importantly, though, we're seeing customer satisfaction metrics in the 80s and 90s, and so we think this concept of really applying it to other parts of the business.
So what you're going to see over the next coming quarters and years is us continuing to expand that focus and invest in and roll out additional categories. Like I said upfront, the majority of our big categories, like parts and accessories, electronics, fashion, all have similar opportunities to follow that playbook. So we're going to continue to do it in a balanced way, as I talked about in July, managing what we spend with what we see as the growth opportunity. And we've already done that in a lot of areas, especially in marketing over the past couple of quarters."

So on take rate, obviously, with payments, we actually think we are -- for the vast majority of sellers, they're going to experience lower fees, even though it will mean at least $0.5 billion of operating income to our business. And we continue to look for ways that we can drive kind of a new experience. The off-eBay advertising is a great example of that. And to your comment on watches, it's really kind of a category-by-category basis of us looking at what value are we creating and what opportunities are there for our sellers.
On how large this can be, we -- why we're focused on the non-new in-season is because we believe it's a [ $500 billion ] total addressable market. And if you look at our categories on the site, we have high single-digit, low double-digit penetration. And so we think there's lots of opportunity. And coming back to the core of what we said about re-commerce, I think more and more, especially in younger generations, are interested in the re-commerce of pre-loved items. And so it's why we're leaning in so much towards that. Also, we're seeing this strategy is working with C2C. So our C2C, again, outgrew our B2C, [ grew ] 34% versus 21%. But that only -- not only brings a unique inventory, but it turns those buyers into twice as valuable buyers when they try casual selling.
And then lastly, the tests we've been doing on the brand outlet side in the U.K. has been performing well. We're growing double digits ahead of market rates. And as I mentioned before, what's great is that while we went out and sourced all of the initial programs to kind of build that up, now the brands are actually calling us and asking us to be part of that program. So you've seen this playbook from us over the past few quarters where we're trying things in different markets, finding success and then rolling them out more broadly. So we've had a lot of success with sneakers in the U.S., and we're now rolling that out to U.K., Canada and Australia this quarter. And you could see us continue to follow that playbook."

So look, what I'd say is that on the categories that we've tackled thus far, we're still in kind of single-digit percentage territory.

So look, what I'd say is that on the categories that we've tackled thus far, we're still in kind of single-digit percentage territory. And what we've said is that we believe that over half -- over the coming years, over half of the GMV is addressable in this type of opportunity and especially in some of these major categories. And frankly, there's probably opportunities across all categories over time to be able to [ really ] change it. We really wanted to see if the thesis that we laid out work, and it's been working pretty consistently. And that's the feedback we're getting from buyers and sellers, and we're obviously seeing it in the business.
There's a lot of opportunity for us on the seller side. So on the store side, we're migrating all of our stores to the next-gen platform. That's mostly complete, which is a much better platform for them. This quarter, we're rolling out CRM capabilities, which has been a long-standing ask of theirs so that they can remarket to buyers through packing slips, through e-mail, et cetera. So that's been pretty significant. And then even things like the customization that we're launching is a long-standing seller request to drive their business.
We didn't talk much about this, but one of the pain points that's existed in the eBay community for our sellers has been unpaid items. For -- since the company really started, payments was divorced from -- or separated from purchase. And so sellers sometimes would have a transaction closed without getting paid. The ability -- now that we've launched managed payments and we're migrating a bunch of new technologies, we actually reduced that by 80% for our sellers. So that's a pain point that we're really happy to be able to eliminate for them.
And then on the C2C side, it's really about making it easier. Why you see us launching things like image-based listing is because we want to take all of the friction out of the experience and make it a really short couple of minute process to get your items up onto the platform. So we're doing a lot more education, things around the seller business really focused on continuing to drive that C2C business. So I think each quarter, we'll be rolling out features that really address this key thesis of taking all the friction out of the experience and making this the best marketplace in the world."

Over the past year, we've added 13 million buyers to the marketplace. And what we're seeing is that those buyers are behaving with strong performance like pre-pandemic. So they're not just coming to eBay for during the pandemic time period and leaving. We're converting a good amount to our strategy of long-standing enthusiasts. We're really focused on the first 90 days for buyers and making sure that they have a great experience on the site. And what you're seeing is that the NPS is up, especially in focused categories like watches and sneakers, certified refurbished where you now have a 2-year warranty and hassle-free returns. So we're really pleased with that.
The cross-category nature and the size of these categories is one of the best assets of eBay. We talked last quarter about our sneaker buyer where we acquire a new Gen Z buyer, they end up buying $500 in sneakers but another $2,000 outside sneakers. We're seeing the same type of thing in watches where we're acquiring a buyer of new high-end watches and they're spending thousands of dollars outside of other categories. So we continue to lean in, because it's a huge accelerator for us, to get buyers purchasing cross-category. And a lot of the marketing technology that we've built and we worked on, the AI with recommendations, et cetera, is really centered on this idea of capturing buyers and having them transact in multiple categories."

But we're looking at the performance of those active buyers on a go-forward basis, and we're pretty pleased with them -- with that performance. And then the last thing I'd say is that, look, a lot of the stuff that we're doing on the core strategy is really about the long-term growth. So we're going to see things in the short-term variances versus prior year.
But I think for me, the core thing is the playbook that we put in place is working. This thesis of really changing the growth trajectory of the category by investing in the playbook is what the team is focused on, and we're going to stay on that for the near to medium future. If I look at -- coming into this in 2019, we were, I think, declining 2% from a GMV perspective. And if you look at our revenue growth projected next quarter, we're looking at double-digit revenue growth. So we feel good about where we're positioned coming out of the pandemic."

And I guess, as a follow-up to some of the earlier questions on advertising, as an increasing portion of the transactions end up being C2C or what might be more unique, collectible or enthusiast items, should we still be thinking that, that type of gross merchandise value is still appropriate for PLA because it seems like advertising should work best for probably those categories where there are multiple sellers trying to sell a fairly homogeneous item?"

Not only buyers now have more choices of how to pay, including Google Pay, Apple Pay, credit card, debit, PayPal, et cetera, but you no longer have to set up 2 different accounts. You no longer have to manage a claims process or returns process in 2 different areas. It's one eBay money back guarantee. So to us, it dramatically simplifies the whole experience for a buyer and makes it easier. They keep that payment on file, and it's just a dramatically easier experience. And then it's helping the seller, too, because I mentioned the unpaid item example earlier on the call, but also the ability for them to manage all of their business in one place, makes it much more streamlined to just run a business on eBay.
On the Promoted Listings, we see opportunities really across every category and every price point of GMV. The beauty of the CPA model that we've had, the cost per acquisition model, has been just the simplicity of it, of just adding the percentage and it makes it really easy. But the CPC model that we're launching also gives the opportunity to really kind of push volume in a different way with a different set of capabilities. But even on single and unique items, people want to promote those items and get more exposure for them. They have for the longest period of time. It's why we're launching the ad feature for auction and testing that is to really go after it. And it's still not -- we still have a lot of opportunity across our listings to increase the penetration. Like I said before, we're only at 1% of GMV."

So the first thing I'd say is that on the category piece, in some cases, the categories have overlapped in terms of features or capabilities we need to build in order to make that a winning NPS for us. So we built authentication, one. It took us a couple of months to build it out, but then we even roll it out to the next category in a couple of weeks and expand that geographically. And so I think that's actually true for a lot of areas where there's components or features that we're building specifically to drive the NPS of a category that will be applicable to a broad set of categories across the experience.
And in terms of pace, we're going to continue to do what we've done before, which is roll them out in a specific geography, make sure that we're seeing the intended impact and then roll it out across the board. We don't really want to talk about which category is next and what we're focused on for competitive reasons. But I would just say that we're really pleased with the playbook. We're really pleased that we're able to drive significant growth and a significant change in trajectory and most importantly, a significant change in the customer experience. And so you're just going to see us continue feature after feature, category after category.
The second thing I'd say is that the verticals is not the only investment that we're making. A lot of our investment is going to site-wide investments that impact all categories. Clearly, that's true for payments and advertising. But the same is true across our seller tools, across our API business, across the CRM and couponing capabilities that we just rolled out, investments that we have in search and in SEO which apply to the whole business. So the way I think about it is kind of a good amount of investment in vertical to really change the NPS of those categories, but a significant amount of site-wide investments as well which lifts all categories. So that's the strategy. That's how we think about it, and we're really pleased with the performance."

At the end of my remarks, I will turn the call over to Steve, our new CFO, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail.
The second quarter of 2021 marks several important milestones in the ongoing transformation of eBay, and I want to thank our team for making it happen. We have accelerated our pace of innovation while executing several complex transactions. Their dedication and focus has created tremendous value for our customers and shareholders. Let me start with a few of our portfolio enhancements.
We completed the transition of eBay's Classifieds business to Adevinta. This deal was originally valued at approximately $9.2 billion, but a closing in June had appreciated to $13.3 billion. Shortly after closing, we announced the deal with Permira to sell approximately $135 million of our Adevinta shares for over $2.4 billion. This agreement fulfills regulatory commitments while returning value to eBay's shareholders. We also increased our share buyback plan for the year from $2 billion to $5 billion.
In June, we announced the sale of over 80% of our Korean business to Emart for approximately $3 billion bringing together 2 -- e-commerce and retail companies that can unlock significant potential in Korea. We anticipate the deal will close either later this year or in early 2022. These portfolio changes allow us to intensify our focus on the core eBay business moving forward.
When I spoke to you last July, I outlined a renewed vision and strategic plan for the company. We set out on a multiyear journey to become the best global marketplace for sellers and buyers through a tech-led reimagination. Our priorities were to grow the core, become the platform of choice for sellers and to cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with buyers by turning them into enthusiasts. To date, our progress is very encouraging. Our underlying growth is positive and the strategy is working.
Q2 results were strong and all key business metrics met or exceeded expectations. Revenue grew 11% driven by acceleration in the payments migration and advertising growth. We funded incremental investments in product development while delivering $0.99 of non-GAAP EPS, above the high end of our range. As expected, GMV declined 11% when compared to last year when results were heavily impacted by the initial pandemic lockdown. Importantly, compared to pre-pandemic levels 2 years ago, we are seeing positive underlying GMV growth.
Our customer metrics remain healthy on both sides of our marketplace. Active sellers grew 5% to 19 million globally as more small businesses and consumers continue to turn to eBay's global platform to reach millions of potential customers from around the world. This quarter, global active buyers totaled 159 million down 2% versus last year and up 3% versus 2019. We have been focused on building lifelong trusted relationships with enthusiast buyers. Changes in our marketing mix and product investments have been focused on attracting and retaining these enthusiasts, particularly Gen Z and millennials.
In parallel, we have discontinued legacy tactics that led to low-value, infrequent or one-and-done buyers. Our buyer base is starting to evolve based on this strategy. These high-value buyers are growing compared to a year ago, and their spend on eBay is growing even faster. This higher quality mix of buyers increases value for sellers, and will lead to improved health of our ecosystem over the long term.
Moving on from buyer trends, the payments and advertising initiatives continue to deliver a simpler product experience and meaningful benefits for sellers, buyers and shareholders. Managed payments is now live in every market globally and the transition is progressing faster than expected. During the second quarter, we processed 71% of on-platform volume through managed payments. We exited Q2 at a run rate over 80% and are on track to process over 90% this quarter.
Managing the payments experience ourselves enables us to eliminate a pain point that sellers occasionally face on eBay, unpaid items. Changes to checkout have been made to address this issue, and today, 99% of fixed-price transactions are paid upfront. We have also started to address this issue for best offers and auctions by asking buyers to provide a payment method in order to bid. This is a significant win for sellers as it frees up inventory and reduces their post-transaction costs.
Our advertising business continues to perform well. In Q2, ad revenue outpaced volume driven by Promoted Listings, which delivered almost $224 million, up 8%. More than 1.4 million sellers promoted over 430 million listings during the quarter. Growth was driven by higher adoption and technology improvements that increased conversion.
We see tremendous growth opportunities in advertising, both from our existing Promoted Listings offerings and from new product innovations. Following a number of successful trials in Q2, we are scaling several new products globally over the next few months. Previously, sellers can only promote fixed-price listings, but now they can increase visibility for a flat fee on auctions to increase conversion.
In June, we also introduced a cost-per-click ad product to sellers in our major markets. Initial results from the first 100,000 listings showed that sellers' return on ad spend was higher than industry benchmarks. We are placing more AI-powered recommendations for pricing and keyword bidding into the Seller Hub to help sellers drive particular buying.
Finally, we are beginning to syndicate ads off eBay platform to drive more buyers to listings. Importantly, sellers maintain control of pricing and visibility while benefiting from the scaled marketing capabilities of eBay. In addition to advertising and payments, we are driving a number of other site-wide initiatives. For consumer sellers, we are simplifying the selling process with a heavy focus on mobile. This includes easier label printing solutions in the app and faster listing through image or barcode scans. In trading cards where we first launched image-based listing, sellers are able to match scans over 80% of the time. The time it takes to create a listing has been dramatically reduced, and we plan to expand the capability to more product categories later this year.
For small business sellers, we continue to expand and optimize their eBay toolkit. To help drive repeat businesses from enthusiasts to eBay stores, we built a CRM tool that enables sellers to fund and distribute their own coupons. Since launching a few months ago, over 1 million buyers have purchased items through these targeted campaigns.
As you've heard me say in the past, we are focused on a number of categories where we are well positioned to serve both sellers and buyers. These categories are growing significantly faster than the overall business, and I'm delighted with the progress our team is making. Our innovation playbook has included increasing customer satisfaction, improving trust, growing supply and marketing to enthusiasts.
As we exited Q2, we have applied this playbook to approximately 10% of our volume across our top 3 markets. With our current plan and ongoing momentum, we expect to expand coverage to approximately 20% by the end of the year.
One of these categories is trading cards. In North America, we continue to see substantial growth with approximately $2 billion of GMV in the first half of the year, equal to all of 2020. Despite these strong results, we see additional untapped potential in the market that we plan to capture with further innovation. We recently launched price guide and collection tools aimed at trading card enthusiasts. These new features leverage unparalleled inventory and pricing data, allowing customers to view, manage and track the value of their collections in real time. As a leader in trading cards with 25 years of transactional data, no one is better positioned to estimate the value of every card ever sold.
In addition, the collection tool seamlessly tracks all eBay activity and off-line inventory in one place. This makes it easy for enthusiasts to assess opportunities, quickly trade and increase the value of their collections.
Sneakers and watches continue to outgrow our overall marketplace. Since launching 1 year ago, we have authenticated nearly 1 million items, enabling a game-changing level of trust. Both categories are seeing close to 90% customer satisfaction rates on authenticated transactions.
Our sneakers business saw strong double-digit growth despite tougher comps from a year ago. And based on the success, we have expanded sneaker authentication to the U.K., Canada and Australia.
Luxury watches are also sustaining double-digit growth. Improved buyer trust is leading to strong cross-category shopping behavior, similar to what we have seen in sneakers. In fact, luxury watch buyers spent $8,000 on more than 50 items in other categories, well above the average eBay buyer.
The next luxury category we are focused on is handbags. We plan to leverage a similar playbook from watches and sneakers to deliver higher NPS for buyers and sellers. We have started in the U.S. by authenticating handbags over $500 from major brands.
Refurbished electronics continues to be another area of growth across our largest markets. Our Certified Refurbished experience is strengthening relationships with best-in-class brands by opening new sales channels. We recently welcomed Samsung Galaxy to the program providing eBay buyers access to exclusive like-new products at exceptional prices.
Vehicles parts and accessories has historically been one of the strongest-performing categories on eBay and remain so today. Our platform offers a wide inventory selection supported by a robust catalog. The Fitment shopping experience matches car parts to vehicles to help buyers shop efficiently and confidently. In Q2, we expanded this capability by enabling a motorcycle parts finder in Germany and the U.K. We also expanded the my garage feature, which allows buyers to store their vehicle data leading to a more tailored shopping experience to Canada, Italy, France and Spain. We plan to launch more technology-driven innovations in this category later this year to further build on our success.
Taking a step back, eBay exists to create economic opportunity for all. That purpose guides our approach to our customers, our communities and our team at eBay. This year, our leadership team's individual goals focus on accelerating meaningful change in diversity, equity and inclusion throughout every level of our company.
We formed an ESG Council composed of senior leaders across the company whose role is to guide and ensure the success of sustainability initiatives. During the quarter, we published our fifth annual impact report and third annual diversity, equity and inclusion report detailing the progress we made in the past year as well as outlining our 2025 goals. The full list of activities is extensive but I would like to share a few highlights.
We made progress on our journey to be more diverse, equitable and inclusive. Our communities of inclusion have conducted 150 events with more than 10,000 attendees in the past year. We have also continued multiyear efforts to ensure gender pay equity, resulting in 100% pay parity in the U.S. and 99.7% globally.
Another priority is managing our environmental impact. Investing in clean energy is a focus for the company, and our goal is to source 100% renewable energy by 2025. We have already reached 74% of our goal through a combination of power purchase agreements and local programs.
Just last week, we announced that we are teaming up with McDonald's in an agreement with Lightsource BP to purchase power from Louisiana's largest solar project. The electricity produced will be greater than the power used at our largest data center.
Finally, I would like to call out the incredible generosity of our buyers and sellers. During Q2, customers contributed over $35 million to their favorite causes through eBay for Charity. This represented a 16% growth versus last year, and the platform is on track to hit the 2025 goal of raising $600 million. These are just a sample of the ongoing ESG-related activities, and I encourage you to check out more at ebayinc.com.
Q2 is another step forward in the multiyear transformation of eBay. The business delivered strong results, and it's clear that our strategy is working. Customers are delighted with the innovation in our focus categories, leading to volume growth despite tougher comps from a year ago. We are harnessing the power of next-gen technology to make eBay the seller platform of choice and to attract lifelong enthusiasts.
Our payments transition is nearly complete, delivering benefits to sellers, buyers and shareholders. Our advertising product portfolio is expanding, giving sellers more tools to grow their business. And we simplified our portfolio, enabling us to focus on the core while creating significant shareholder value.
Our team continues to be relentlessly focused on executing for our customers. I'm delighted to welcome 4 new exceptional leaders to our executive team this year. In addition, we have hired critical talent in areas such as technology, AI, analytics and category management. The teams in place are well positioned to propel this business forward.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Before I do, I want to say how excited I am to have another world-class, customer-centric leader on our team to help us realize our vision. Steve, over to you."

I'd also like to thank Andy for his leadership and guidance during my transition into the role. He has done an excellent job creating value for the company and leading our finance team over the last couple of years.
I'll start on Page 4 of our presentation. We have outlined the impact of moving our Korean business to discontinued operations in our guidance for Q2 earnings. At an aggregated level, this would have reduced guidance by approximately 2 points of GMV growth, $400 million of revenue and $0.02 of EPS. The Q2 results purely reflect the performance of our continuing marketplace business. On July 13, we published a Form 8-K that included recasted historical financial statements back to the start of 2019. These figures provide an apples-to-apples comparison versus our actual results. Excluding Korea, the implied Q2 guidance was between $2.58 billion and $2.63 billion of revenue, growing 8% to 10% on an organic FX-neutral basis. Non-GAAP EPS was between $0.89 and $0.94 per share, representing a decrease of 5% to 10% year-over-year.
Turning to our highlights from the quarter on Slide 5. Despite lapping an exceptional quarter last year, we delivered strong operational results. Revenue grew double digits driven by payments and ads. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.99 per share, and our operating margin was 33%. We generated $910 million of free cash flow, while returning $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. We generated significant value from our portfolio as we work to transform eBay. We announced the agreement to sell over 80% of our Korean business to Emart for approximately $3 billion. We completed a Classifieds transaction for total value of $13.3 billion, including $2.5 billion in cash and a 44% stake in Adevinta. We then reached an agreement to sell 1/4 of that stake to Permira for over $2.4 billion in cash. Finally, we increased our estimated 2021 share buyback to $5 billion for an initial $2 billion.
Moving to active buyers on Slide 6. We exited the quarter with 159 million buyers, representing a 2% decrease year-over-year on a trailing 12-month basis. At the beginning of the pandemic in Q2 last year, we added more than 7 million buyers, our largest quarterly increase ever. That cohort of buyers has matured in line with historical trends. We are also seeing a reduction in buyers of low-priced items due to changes in our marketing mix.
As Jamie mentioned, our strategy to attract and retain buyers has changed over the past several quarters. We have intentionally focused our marketing and product innovation on high-value buyers. These include buyers who sell or buyers who purchase at least 6 days a year and spend over $800. This high-value segment represents approximately 20% of our buyer base and they process around 75% of our GMV.
High-value buyers grew in Q2, as did the spend per buyer. Low-value buyers on eBay make approximately half of our buyer base but only purchased about 5% of our GMV. As we drive this strategy, we expect to see a further drop in active buyers on a rolling 12-month basis, but an increase in GMV per buyer over the coming quarters.
Moving to Slide 7. In Q2, we delivered $22.1 billion of GMV, down 11% year-over-year. On a spot basis, this represents a decrease of 7% year-over-year. Compared with Q2 of 2019, GMV grew 19% on an FX-neutral basis and 23% on a spot basis. There were several factors that contributed to the Q2 GMV dynamic.
First, we lapped the peak of the early impacts of the pandemic, including the first wave of mobility restrictions, stimulus payments and supply chain disruptions; second, there was a meaningful ongoing macro benefit from global mobility, although it was significantly less at the end of the quarter than at the beginning of Q2; and third, our underlying business continued to show positive growth from site-wide product experience improvements and category performance.
In the U.S., we generated approximately $10 billion of GMV in Q2, down 5% year-over-year. International GMV decreased 16% year-over-year to $12.1 billion. Our U.S. volume outpaced international primarily due to strength in trading cards as well as benefits from government stimulus earlier in the quarter.
Turning to revenue on Slide 8. Our net revenue for the quarter was $2.7 billion, up 11% on an FX-neutral basis and up 14% on a spot basis. We delivered $2.5 billion of transaction revenue up 11% year-over-year, mainly driven by payments. We continue to make great progress on seller migration. As Jamie mentioned, 71% of our global on-platform volume was processed through managed payments during the quarter, which contributed approximately 18 points of incremental revenue growth year-over-year. The success of the payments ramp also drove quarterly acceleration of 80 basis points to our transaction take rate which is 11.3% for the quarter. We expect this rate to continue to grow throughout 2021 as we complete the payments rollout.
We delivered $172 million of marketing services and other revenue, up 11% year-over-year, driven by strength in shipping programs. While we continue to purposely reduce third-party advertising, the drag on total MS&O growth rate was less due to easier comps from a year ago.
Turning to Slide 9, our major cost drivers. In Q2, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 33%. This represents a 6-point year-over-year decrease driven primarily by lower volume. Cost of revenue has increased in line with payments growth due to processing costs. While these variable costs will increase as payments revenue grows,  the incremental revenue provides leverage for our fixed expenses, most notably sales and marketing and G&A.
Product development costs increased year-over-year as we continue to invest in product innovation, supporting our strategic initiatives. Transaction losses were flat versus the prior year as the benefit of netting seller fees against our net proceeds were offset by higher customer protection losses.
Turning to EPS on Slide 10. We delivered $0.99 of non-GAAP EPS in the second quarter, flat versus the prior year. Negative impacts from lapping COVID-driven volumes were offset by strategic initiatives particularly payments as well as a lower share count related to share repurchases. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.43, a decrease of 56% year-over-year.
We elected the fair value accounting method for our investment in Adevinta. The change in stock price between the close of the sale on June 24 and the quarter end on June 30, drove a majority of the GAAP EPS decrease. In addition, while we recognized further gains on the Adyen launch in Q2, we are lapping significant gains in the prior year.
Moving to Slide 11. We saw another strong quarter of cash generation with $910 million of free cash flow. This 7% year-over-year growth was driven by strong operational results led by payments and improvements in working capital. This was partly offset by higher cash taxes.
Turning to Slide 12. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.6 billion and debt of $9.1 billion. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we completed the sale of the Classifieds business to Adevinta during the quarter, generating cash proceeds of $2.5 billion. We expect to pay cash taxes associated with the sale of approximately $400 million in the third quarter.
As a result of our strong underlying free cash flow performance and the proceeds from this transaction we updated our capital allocation plans for 2021 by increasing the estimated share buyback to $5 billion. In Q2, we returned $1.6 billion to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately 24 million shares at an average price of $62.60 per share, amounting to $1.5 billion and paid a dividend of $121 million. We exited the quarter with $4.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.
Our Board has approved an additional share repurchase authorization of $3 billion with no expiry, raising a total to approximately $7.2 billion. Finally, we issued $2.5 billion of senior unsecured notes during the quarter, part of which will be used to repay our 2022 debt maturities.
Moving to investments on Slide 13. On June 24, we closed the Classifieds sale and recorded an investment on our balance sheet of $10.8 billion to reflect the 540 million shares we received as consideration. The value of this stake stood at $10.4 billion at quarter end based on Adevinta's stock price. Between the announcement of the deal last July and the close of the transaction this June, the value of our equity stake appreciated 61%.
As a regulatory condition of the Classifieds sale, we agreed to reduce our ownership stake in Adevinta to 33% or less over the 18 months following the close of the deal. We recently announced an agreement with Permira to sell approximately 135 million shares for more than $2.4 billion. This will reduce our ownership stake to 33%. We expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Adyen. The warrants we acquired in the second quarter of 2018 are valued at $1.1 billion at the end of the second quarter, an increase of over $500 million year-over-year. You'll find more information on the Adyen warrant in our 10-Q.
We also want to highlight our stake in Kakao Bank. At the end of the second quarter, our investment was worth approximately $300 million. On August 6, they completed their IPO, which increased the value of our stake to over $900 million.
Finally, on June 24, we announced plans to sell over 80% of our Korea business to Emart. We will retain an interest of less than 20%. The implied value of our interest was approximately $800 million at the time of the announcement. We remain excited about all these investments, the optionality they provide and a significant value they need to generate for our shareholders.
Turning to guidance on Slide 14. For Q3, we are projecting revenue between $2.42 billion and $2.47 billion, growing 6% to 8% on an organic FX-neutral basis and approximately 7% to 9% on a spot basis. We anticipate payments and advertising will continue to drive revenue to grow faster than volume, leading to take rate expansion. This revenue guidance implies GMV is down low to mid-teens on an FX-neutral basis versus last year and up high single digits compared to 2019. On a spot basis, today's rates would indicate a 2-point benefit versus FX-neutral growth rates in Q3. This is 2 points lower than the 4-point benefit we saw in Q2 GMV. We are assuming that macro benefits including stimulus and mobility will be significantly less in Q3 than Q2. We also expect that our efforts to improve the business will continue to enable modestly positive underlying growth.
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 to $0.90 per share, representing 4% to 9% growth. Year-over-year, we plan to continue investing in product and technology to deliver better category experiences while improving marketing efficiencies. We are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.64 to $0.68 per share [ for ] Q3.
Looking at the full year, the macro environment remains dynamic and difficult to predict, and we're not providing full year guidance at this time. However, they're available within our control that we are sharing this context. Given the accelerated pace of the payments transition, we are raising our full year forecast for payments revenue from $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Payments margin contribution continues to ramp towards our long-term target of 25%. Total operating margin for the business is expected to land at approximately 33%, which will be close to 150 basis points better than 2019. As I mentioned before, we expect to repurchase shares totaling $5 billion in 2021 at this time, which implies an additional $3.2 billion in the second half.
In conclusion, during the quarter, we delivered strong short-term results ahead of expectations while transforming the company for the longer term. We are excited about the path forward and the growth potential of eBay. Innovation is leading to volume growth in our focused categories despite tougher comps from a year ago. Our payments and advertising initiatives are driving better customer experience, resulting in incremental revenue and earnings growth. Our balanced approach to cost management allows us to reinvest in our customers while delivering high margins with low capital intensity.
We continue to deliver strong free cash flow and return value to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. Our portfolio simplification has created over $20 billion of shareholder value, allowing us to intensely focus on growing the core. As a purpose-driven company, we're enabling economic opportunity for all while supporting our people, our communities and our planet.
I would like to once more take this opportunity to thank our teams across eBay for their tremendous work over the last quarter and for their support for our buyers and sellers in the eBay community. We will now take your questions. Operator?"

This is something that I laid out last July when we talked about the tech-led reimagination is being focused on turning buyers into lifelong enthusiasts on the platform. And moving away from the tactics that we had in",411,"Yes. So first, on the buyer strategy. This is something that I laid out last July when we talked about the tech-led reimagination is being focused on turning buyers into lifelong enthusiasts on the platform. And moving away from the tactics that we had in 2019, where it was really just about the number of active buyers, even low-value buyers or one-and-done buyers.
I've got the whole organization pivoted to focusing on those high-value buyers, buyers that are buying over $800, buying 6 times a year or buyers who sell. And so as you think about these buyers, they're so strong at eBay. They're 20% of them, they make up 75% of GMV. And the goal is how do we turn more buyers into these lifelong enthusiasts.
I've met a lot of these buyers, they wake up and they get a cup of coffee. And they turn to eBay and open the eBay app. And our focus is really not on just the total number, but really focused on how are we driving these buyers to become enthusiasts. The metrics that we show in the board deck our trailing 12-month metric. So we're obviously lapping the buyers that we acquired in Q2. But going forward, our focus will really be on these long-term enthusiasts. I'm excited to say that their GMV is growing, they're growing as a population and more. You're going to see us doing things to drive that longevity because we know the things that move buyers up the cohort curves into long-term buyers.
On your second question on the portfolio, absolutely. A huge part of the portfolio simplification is about being able to focus on the marketplace. And as Steve talked about, we generated $20 billion in value for shareholders, starting with the StubHub transaction. But I think more importantly now, it enables us to focus all of our attention on the marketplace business. As I've talked about, we see a lot of growth opportunity in that business. The strategy that we have is working. We're in year 1 of a multiyear reimagination of eBay. But if you look at what we talked about a second ago with the 10%, about to reach 20% of categories, it's really working. Customer satisfaction is at 90. It's leading to very strong GMV, and we see the same potential for this innovation playbook in every category in the [ study ]. And Steve, maybe you want to take the last one?"

And coming over to eBay, a company that's got a real sense of purpose, an amazing team and a heart of our customer centricity and innovation were with some of the core facets that I looked at when I came over to eBay.
Since I've been here, it's really clear about the sheer size and scale of the enterprise and what opportunities are ahead of us. in terms of its growth. We really do have incredible durability of a financial model with a fortress balance sheet, best-in-class margins, incredible free cash flow even after a few weeks, I sort of feel that the value of the enterprise is really misunderstood because of the potential that's ahead of us and the strategy that Jamie has laid out.
So I'm really excited to be here I think there's huge opportunities for the enterprise, and I'm looking forward to my journey over here in eBay."

But now we're pretty much at the goal line here. So there has to be pockets of the global demand base you otherwise could not cater to before because you just simply could not take their money. So what are the prospects of opening up the buyer acquisition funnel to that audience a bit more in those regions.
And I guess on a second point, recently, you launched a fulfillment service in the U.K. with a partner. So can you talk about what kind of improvement you think you may see to either conversion rates on the buyer experience as you step up the level of service for the buyers in the country."

On the first one, we're excited that as we get through managed payments, we announced that next quarter we'll be at 90%.

On the first one, we're excited that as we get through managed payments, we announced that next quarter we'll be at 90%. That opens up even more opportunities for us from a how do we service our buyers and sellers. So some examples of things that we've already launched, for example, is we launched a partnership with Afterpay as an additional form of payment in Australia, allowing people to -- in that market to pay with installments. It's very strong in Australia, and that certainly helped us in our Australia business.
In our U.K. business, we've launched a partnership that allows us to do seller financing and to help sellers out there. And we'll continue to expand in different ways throughout the globe on more opportunities around managed payments.
The other big one that I talked about earlier is that now that commerce and payments are on, and we can manage all of that on eBay, there's a lot of friction we can take out of the platform. So unpaid items is a great example where for 25 years since I was here the first time, sellers have had to face items where buyers wouldn't pay. We've now eliminated that into 99% of auctions on our way to do that in best -- I'm sorry, best offer in auctions. We've limited fixed price on our way to do it in best offer in auctions. 2 weeks ago, we had eBay Open with thousands of sellers online and we announced this, and it was massive rejoicing from them because this has been a key pain point. So the other thing I'm excited about is just eliminating those pain points.
On your question on the fulfillment service, what we saw in the U.S. and especially in our cross-border trade coming out of Greater China, for example, is the ability to forward deploy inventory is a benefit because of the predictability that it gives to buyers from that standpoint. So we're using it to help scale small businesses to drive the ability to have forward deployment and basically pass those savings on to the customer. So we're just getting started with that program, but we've learned a lot about cross-border trade, and we're excited that fulfillment service is going to help scale some of our small businesses in their cross-border inventory."

And then secondly, looking at the decline in sold items. It looks like the sold items was down by more than GMV was down. And looking back to last year, GMV grew more than sold items last year. So it doesn't look to be driven by comps. So is there anything to call out for the decline in sold items for Q2 as well."

What we're calling Promoted Listings Express, which is a CPC business and then an off-eBay advertising business. So we continue to lots of potential in that business. And these 3 areas are just getting started.
On the sold items, that's really a reflection of the purposeful decisions that we've made to, one, is move away from low-value items that weren't driving the type of return in low-value buyers specifically as well as a shift to higher ASP in general because of the strategy to focus category strategy working. So we talked about the strength that we're seeing in trading cards and collectibles, already having done $2 billion this year, the same as all of last year really driving our C2C business. And C2C tends to have a higher ASP or a higher average selling price than our B2C business. And so that's also driving kind of that dynamic.
So it's actually in line with where we want it to be. We think it's healthy for the ecosystem. And we think it's going to continue to be driven that way because C2C, as we look at it, we hope to continue to outpace B2C and lean in on these categories of value like our luxury goods, collectibles, et cetera."

So on your first question on the buyer strategy, yes, we're purposely moving away from low-value buyers or kind of low CLTV, low GMV per buyers. If you remember back to 2019, we talked about that strategy and because some of these are trailing 12-mon",348,"Yes. So on your first question on the buyer strategy, yes, we're purposely moving away from low-value buyers or kind of low CLTV, low GMV per buyers. If you remember back to 2019, we talked about that strategy and because some of these are trailing 12-month metrics, some of those numbers are actually still in our numbers even from 2019. But the reason I'm focused on it is if you look at those 50% of buyers, they only contribute 5% of GMV and the top 20% contributes 75%. And so by focusing the organization, not on just how many buyers do we have on the platform, but how many of our buyers are we turning into these high-value buyers. We think that's much healthier for the growth of the platform in the long term, much healthier for sellers, et cetera. Drives better with the marketing strategy that we're going after. We're really focused on the first 90 days of a customer and getting them up their life cycle. So this is going to be a purposeful strategy. You're going to see us on for years walking away from the work that we did back in 2019.
When you ask about the managed payments, what I'm really happy about is the execution from the team. If you look at when we started, for example, enabling Greater China, we got to 90% penetration within 10 weeks. And so we took the learnings from what started 2 years ago with the U.S. and Germany. And we've learned a lot as we've rolled out all of the other countries. And that pace speaks to the pace of execution of the team and what they're doing. I know there are a lot of questions of, would we be able to even reach the targets we had for next year originally. And I'm just excited that we're ahead of schedule, and we're starting to do things like the Afterpay and the seller financing because there's just a lot of potential for this business as we fully manage the payments by -- all through eBay."

27862,1673836192,2374081,"eBay Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2021",2021-08-11,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Yes. So first, on your question on authentication. Look, we're really excited about how we've been able to scale this program. We've now authenticated 1 million items on the platform. We've expanded that authentication to -- for sneakers to U.K., Australi",360,"Yes. So first, on your question on authentication. Look, we're really excited about how we've been able to scale this program. We've now authenticated 1 million items on the platform. We've expanded that authentication to -- for sneakers to U.K., Australia and Canada. This quarter, we announced that we're authenticating handbags over $500 in the U.S. And we're using a mixture of third-party and in-house resources to do so. But what we're seeing is that this authentication has a great ROI. What it's able to do in terms of driving GMV, driving new buyers into the site.
I'll just give you -- I'll reiterate the stat we talked about last quarter in sneakers, which is acquiring a Gen Z, they buy $500 in sneakers, but they buy $2,000 in other categories on the site. We're seeing the same thing in watches where a luxury watch buyer is buying $8,000 in categories outside of watches, and that's over 50 items. And that's one of the benefits of eBay is that cross-category shopping nature, and that's really hard for other competitors to replicate.
On eBay stores, we talked about being the seller platform of choice. And a big part of that is our strategy of really growing eBay stores. So this quarter, we announced a new program where it's much simpler to set up your eBay store. And I'm really excited by one of the features the team announced, which was the ability for a seller to send coupons to repeat buyers. So this is something that sellers have been asking for. We built it in as part of the stores platform. And in just a few short months since it launched, that product already has 1 million buyers taking advantage of those coupons from sellers.
So another thing that, as we had our big eBay Open event 2 weeks ago, our sellers were really excited by, and frankly, we're just getting started on that program. So we're even continuing to make sellers aware of these new capabilities. So you'll continue to see quarter after quarter and year after year innovation on eBay stores because it's an important part of our strategy."

So you've got about a 10-point easier comp for GMV on an ex-FX basis in the third quarter, and you're calling for a little bit more decel from here. So do we chalk that up to kind of purging some of the low-quality buyers and a chunk of that 25% of GMV that they represent? Or is that just the macro is kind of dropping off? Any color on that would be great. And then your 33% operating margin for 2021 that's got the brunt of all the payment ramp in there. So as we kind of look ahead to '22, and we expect GMV to start growing again, how should we think about that operating margin? Like what are the puts and takes on that going up or going down next year?"

We laid out our third quarter guidance.",311,"Ross, Steve here. I'll pick those up. So I'll start off with the second quarter. And as we laid everything out on an apples-to-apples basis, we've obviously exceeded our expectations across all of the major metrics. We laid out our third quarter guidance. And obviously, that reflects the best view based on what we're seeing in our most recent trends in the first part of the quarter and our latest outlook on mobility.
This is actually an unchanged view versus what we communicated when we guided in the second quarter. And what we indicated was that we expected the second half GMV growth will be similar to Q2, as the easier comps will be offset by lower macro benefits in 2021 so mobility got back to normal. And we are seeing some of that in particular, a couple of our key markets in the likes of Germany and the U.K. So that underpins that. And again, we sort of -- when we look through that lens, we expect that to lead to a low to mid-teen volume declines year-over-year, which actually at the heart of it indicates modestly positive growth from the underlying business on the basis of us continuing to improve the customer experience and execute on the vision that Jamie has laid out.
Specifically, with regards to your second question about the 33% operating margin for 2021 Obviously, we're ramping payments up. We talked extensively about the fact that, that's actually a lower margin part of the business sort of 25%. We've guided our expectations that 2021, we'll end with that 33%. With our recast financials, those are 150 basis stronger than 2019. So we're right on track. We're seeing margin accretion from all of the initiatives that we're driving forward. We're not guiding 2022 at this point but I'm very pleased with the trajectory that we're sitting on."

What's your message to sellers with the notion that what they're seeing in terms of their costs on eBay continue to go up as there's been a lot of issues and glitches with working on final value fees and tax and so forth.
And then a couple of quick questions for Steve. Can you give us a bit more detail on the decline in gross margins. You mentioned payments and authentication. And also, adjusting for the fair value of both warrants and equity and the investments, it looks like free cash flow would have been about 1/3 lower. So can you talk about what you're seeing in the underlying free cash flow of the business when we remove all these very noisy investment income and changes in fair value awards."
27862,1673836192,2374081,"eBay Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2021",2021-08-11,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Yes. On your first question, I think what is important there is to think about the fact that there used to be a separate take rate associated with payments, and now what our sellers are seeing is a blended take rate. And in general, the vast majority of s",298,"Yes. On your first question, I think what is important there is to think about the fact that there used to be a separate take rate associated with payments, and now what our sellers are seeing is a blended take rate. And in general, the vast majority of sellers will actually be paying lower fees when you look at the combined take rate that they pay because they're no longer paying that separate piece, and it's one single rate.
The reason you're still seeing a rise in take rate and may continue to do so is just because of the ramp of payments. So as payments ramps up, that starts to get reflected in eBay's take rate but the seller's no longer paying that PayPal or other form of payment take rate.
The second key thing for us is making sure that we return the value to the sellers for the fees that we're charging. And so when you think about the scale demand that we can bring in terms of 159 million buyers, in terms of new capabilities that we're bringing to them on the platform like the ability to go back to repeat sellers. There are areas where we've discounted our fees like in sneakers, which has worked out really well in terms of growing those categories. We look in general at the value that we provide. And I would say in our core business, we actually feel really good about that. And what we're seeing in our advertising business is that the ROAS or the return on ad spend that our sellers are seeing is actually higher than what they're getting on other platforms. which also, I think, speaks to the value of the demand that we're providing. I'll let Steve take the other questions."

There's the underlying business, there's payments and then there's the likes of authentication. And so as a reminder, we laid out the strategy around payments a couple of years ago with regards to $2 billion of incremental revenue, $500 million of incremental op margin. And as Jamie alluded to, that is going very well. The momentum's going well. We've increased the forecast for 2021 to $1.8 million billion on the revenue side. And as I said earlier, we are continuing to be on the path for the incremental 150 basis points over 2 years on our margin story. So it's not necessarily driving any dilution in the margin story. It's great from a net income standpoint as we go forward.
The second point on authentication, Jamie mentioned the return on investment that, that was providing. It's rather de minimis when you look at the overall cost structure in terms of, in fact, less than 0.5 point of margin is where you go from authentication. But the amount of stickiness that it's providing for our customers when they're going to cross-category buying more than pays itself. And it's an investment that we're really glad we're making as we think about the whole ecosystem, and then the ability for that to move across categories.
With regard to our free cash flow at an underlying level, we generated free cash flow of $910 million in the quarter. The warrants are not achieved yet and the free cash flow is investment. What I would say is that we continue to invest in product as part of our core platform. A, in terms of the payments rollout, which is going extremely well. And other product investments with regards to moving the site forward in the categories that Jamie alluded to earlier. So we're doing very well in terms of the organization and how we're moving forward, and very happy to follow up offline if there's any further questions."

In fact, if you look at particularly Germany, one of our biggest markets in the U.K., things are pretty much back to normal from a mobility standpoint. Travel's going through the roof if you look at search in terms of leisure activities and travel, I think that's -- going forward. Obviously, it feels a little different maybe over here at the moment with regard to the Delta variant. But in essence, when we're seeing things, we're expecting that going forward.
I'm not going to get beyond quarter 3, Deepak, because we chose not to guide further than that because of the uncertainty. But we are assuming in the third quarter that things are sort of starting to get back to some sort of normality and we're not in the sort of a lockdown scenario.
With regards to the Adevinta transaction, obviously, that was completed. When we think about Adyen and Korea, whilst we have agreed those transactions, they're not closed yet.

So first, on the Promoted Listings, yes, the rollout of CPC is really to have additional ad formats and additional capabilities for sellers to drive visibility of their listings. So we talked last quarter about how we're only at 1% of GMV. And if you look at other platforms, we think there's significant potential in the kind of low- to mid-single-digit percentage of GMV. The backs of the existing program where we've already done over $1 billion grew 8% this quarter were really on a single type of advertising in a single format. So it was all CPA on fixed price. So as we expand now to auctions, as we expand to a CPC where we introduce more bidding capabilities for our top spot and search, that just enables sellers to have more tools. So we're in beta on that product right now. And I would just say, in general, we're really excited by what we're seeing because our ROAS is really strong, meaning our buyer experience is performing well and the return that the sellers are getting on that spend is productive and much more productive than they would get on other platforms.
In terms of eBay Open, I think we had a lot of really positive feedback about the unpaid item noise. I've known sellers forever, get frustrated when that happens to them, especially for a new seller. And so they're really excited that we're tackling that as part of managed payments. I'd say they're really excited by what we're doing in stores and coupons because they want to build their brand on eBay. They want to drive repeat business. And so I think they're really excited by that.
I'd say the other forum that was really well attended and had a lot of excitement was the trading cards forum. the launch of Computer Vision, where we're driving 80% of the scans are really identifying what the product is and it's simplifying the listing flow. We launched this new my collections which is a really popular feature for people because they can show up their collections. And we launched a price sky feature, which eBay has this treasure trove of data in the 25 years of history. Nobody has the data that we have. It's a really great asset for us. So I'd say that area and those sellers that joined in particular, we're really excited by the innovation that we're making.
I love those forums because this platform gets better by listening to our sellers and hearing their feedback, and they give us lots of ideas of things to continue to work on in the tech-led reimagination. So a great interaction. Despite being virtual, they all can't wait to be in person again like we can, but it was a really good session."

At the end of my remarks, I will turn the call over to Steve, our new CFO, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail.
The second quarter of 2021 marks several important milestones in the ongoing transformation of eBay, and I want to thank our team for making it happen. We have accelerated our pace of innovation while executing several complex transactions. Their dedication and focus has created tremendous value for our customers and shareholders. Let me start with a few of our portfolio enhancements.
We completed the transition of eBay's Classifieds business to Adevinta. This deal was originally valued at approximately $9.2 billion, but a closing in June had appreciated to $13.3 billion. Shortly after closing, we announced the deal with Permira to sell approximately $135 million of our Adevinta shares for over $2.4 billion. This agreement fulfills regulatory commitments while returning value to eBay's shareholders. We also increased our share buyback plan for the year from $2 billion to $5 billion.
In June, we announced the sale of over 80% of our Korean business to Emart for approximately $3 billion bringing together 2 leading e-commerce and retail companies that can unlock significant potential in Korea. We anticipate the deal will close either later this year or in early 2022. These portfolio changes allow us to intensify our focus on the core eBay business moving forward.
When I spoke to you last July, I outlined a renewed vision and strategic plan for the company. We set out on a multiyear journey to become the best global marketplace for sellers and buyers through a tech-led reimagination. Our priorities were to grow the core, become the platform of choice for sellers and to cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with buyers by turning them into enthusiasts. To date, our progress is very encouraging. Our underlying growth is positive and the strategy is working.
Q2 results were strong and all key business metrics met or exceeded expectations. Revenue grew 11% driven by acceleration in the payments migration and advertising growth. We funded incremental investments in product development while delivering $0.99 of non-GAAP EPS, above the high end of our range. As expected, GMV declined 11% when compared to last year when results were heavily impacted by the initial pandemic lockdown. Importantly, compared to pre-pandemic levels 2 years ago, we are seeing positive underlying GMV growth.
Our customer metrics remain healthy on both sides of our marketplace. Active sellers grew 5% to 19 million globally as more small businesses and consumers continue to turn to eBay's global platform to reach millions of potential customers from around the world. This quarter, global active buyers totaled 159 million down 2% versus last year and up 3% versus 2019. We have been focused on building lifelong trusted relationships with enthusiast buyers. Changes in our marketing mix and product investments have been focused on attracting and retaining these enthusiasts, particularly Gen Z and millennials.
In parallel, we have discontinued legacy tactics that led to low-value, infrequent or one-and-done buyers. Our buyer base is starting to evolve based on this strategy. These high-value buyers are growing compared to a year ago, and their spend on eBay is growing even faster. This higher quality mix of buyers increases value for sellers, and will lead to improved health of our ecosystem over the long term.
Moving on from buyer trends, the payments and advertising initiatives continue to deliver a simpler product experience and meaningful benefits for sellers, buyers and shareholders. Managed payments is now live in every market globally and the transition is progressing faster than expected. 
During the second quarter, we processed 71% of on-platform volume through managed payments. We exited Q2 at a run rate over 80% and are on track to process over 90% this quarter.
Managing the payments experience ourselves enables us to eliminate a pain point that sellers occasionally face on eBay, unpaid items. Changes to checkout have been made to address this issue, and today, 99% of fixed-price transactions are paid upfront. We have also started to address this issue for best offers and auctions by asking buyers to provide a payment method in order to bid. This is a significant win for sellers as it frees up inventory and reduces their post-transaction costs.
Our advertising business continues to perform well. In Q2, ad revenue outpaced volume driven by Promoted Listings, which delivered almost $224 million, up 8%. More than 1.4 million sellers promoted over 430 million listings during the quarter. Growth was driven by higher adoption and technology improvements that increased conversion.
We see tremendous growth opportunities in advertising, both from our existing Promoted Listings offerings and from new product innovations. Following a number of successful trials in Q2, we are scaling several new products globally over the next few months. Previously, sellers could only promote fixed-price listings, but now they can increase visibility for a flat fee on auctions to increase conversion.
In June, we also introduced a cost-per-click ad product to sellers in our major markets. Initial results from the first 100,000 listings showed that sellers' return ad spend was higher than industry benchmarks. We are placing more AI-powered recommendations for pricing and keyword bidding into the Seller Hub to help sellers drive particular buying.
Finally, we are beginning to syndicate ads up eBay platform to drive more buyers to listings. Importantly, sellers maintain control of pricing and visibility while benefiting from the scaled marketing capabilities of eBay. In addition to advertising and payments, we are driving a number of other site-wide initiatives. 
For consumer sellers, we are simplifying the selling process with a heavy focus on mobile. This includes easier label printing solutions in the app and faster listing through image or barcode scans. In trading cards where we first launched image-based listing, sellers are able to match scans over 80% of the time. The time it takes to create a listing has been dramatically reduced, and we plan to expand the capability to more product categories later this year.
For small business sellers, we continue to expand and optimize their eBay toolkit. To help drive repeat businesses from enthusiasts to eBay stores, we built a CRM tool that enables sellers to fund and distribute their own coupons. Since launching a few months ago, over 1 million buyers have purchased items through these targeted campaigns.
As you've heard me say in the past, we are focused on a number of categories where we are well positioned to serve both sellers and buyers. These categories are growing significantly faster than the overall business, and I'm delighted with the progress our team is making. Our innovation playbook has included increasing customer satisfaction, improving trust, growing supply and marketing to enthusiasts.
As we exited Q2, we have applied this playbook to approximately 10% of our volume across our top 3 markets. With our current plan and ongoing momentum, we expect to expand coverage to approximately 20% by the end of the year.
One of these categories is trading cards. In North America, we continue to see substantial growth with approximately $2 billion of GMV in the first half of the year, equal to all of 2020. Despite these strong results, we see additional untapped potential in the market that we plan to capture with further innovation. We recently launched price guide and collection tools aimed at trading card enthusiasts. 
These new features leverage unparalleled inventory and pricing data, allowing customers to view, manage and track the value of their collections in real time. As a leader in trading cards with 25 years of transactional data, no one is better positioned to estimate the value of every card ever sold.
In addition, the collection tool seamlessly tracks all eBay activity and off-line inventory in one place. This makes it easy for enthusiasts to assess opportunities, quickly trade and increase the value of their collections.
Sneakers and watches continue to outgrow our overall marketplace. Since launching 1 year ago, we have authenticated nearly 1 million items, enabling a game-changing level of trust. Both categories are seeing close to 90% customer satisfaction rates on authenticated transactions.
Our sneakers business saw strong double-digit growth despite tougher comps from a year ago. And based on the success, we have expanded sneaker authentication to the U.K., Canada and Australia.
Luxury watches are also sustaining double-digit growth. Improved buyer trust is leading to strong cross-category shopping behavior, similar to what we have seen in sneakers. In fact, luxury watch buyers spent $8,000 on more than 50 items in other categories, well above the average eBay buyer.
The next luxury category we are focused on is handbags. We plan to leverage a similar playbook from watches and sneakers to deliver higher NPS for buyers and sellers. We have started in the U.S. by authenticating handbags over $500 from major brands.
Refurbished electronics continues to be another area of growth across our largest markets. Our Certified Refurbished experience is strengthening relationships with best-in-class brands by opening new sales channels. We recently welcomed Samsung Galaxy to the program providing eBay buyers access to exclusive like-new products at exceptional prices.
Vehicles parts and accessories has historically been one of the strongest-performing categories on eBay and remain so today. Our platform offers a wide inventory selection supported by a robust catalog. The Fitment shopping experience matches car parts to vehicles to help buyers shop efficiently and confidently. 
In Q2, we expanded this capability by enabling a motorcycle parts finder in Germany and the U.K. We also expanded the My Garage feature, which allows buyers to store their vehicle data leading to a more tailored shopping experience to Canada, Italy, France and Spain. We plan to launch more technology-driven innovations in this category later this year to further build on our success.
Taking a step back, eBay exists to create economic opportunity for all. That purpose guides our approach to our customers, our communities and our team at eBay. This year, our leadership team's individual goals focus on accelerating meaningful change in diversity, equity and inclusion throughout every level of our company.
We formed an ESG Council composed of senior leaders across the company whose role is to guide and ensure the success of sustainability initiatives. During the quarter, we published our fifth annual impact report and third annual diversity, equity and inclusion report detailing the progress we made in the past year as well as outlining our 2025 goals. The full list of activities is extensive but I would like to share a few highlights.
We made progress on our journey to be more diverse, equitable and inclusive. Our communities of inclusion have conducted 150 events with more than 10,000 attendees in the past year. We have also continued multiyear efforts to ensure gender pay equity, resulting in 100% pay parity in the U.S. and 99.7% globally.
Another priority is managing our environmental impact. Investing in clean energy is a focus for the company, and our goal is to source 100% renewable energy by 2025. We have already reached 74% of our goal through a combination of power purchase agreements and local programs.
Just last week, we announced that we are teaming up with McDonald's in an agreement with Lightsource BP to purchase power from Louisiana's largest solar project. The electricity produced will be greater than the power used at our largest data center.
Finally, I would like to call out the incredible generosity of our buyers and sellers. During Q2, customers contributed over $35 million to their favorite causes through eBay for Charity. This represented a 16% growth versus last year, and the platform is on track to hit the 2025 goal of raising $600 million. These are just a sample of the ongoing ESG-related activities, and I encourage you to check out more at ebayinc.com.
Q2 is another step forward in the multiyear transformation of eBay. The business delivered strong results, and it's clear that our strategy is working. Customers are delighted with the innovation in our focus categories, leading to volume growth despite tougher comps from a year ago. We are harnessing the power of next-gen technology to make eBay the seller platform of choice and to attract lifelong enthusiasts.
Our payments transition is nearly complete, delivering benefits to sellers, buyers and shareholders. Our advertising product portfolio is expanding, giving sellers more tools to grow their business. And we simplified our portfolio, enabling us to focus on the core while creating significant shareholder value.
Our team continues to be relentlessly focused on executing for our customers. I'm delighted to welcome 4 new exceptional leaders to our executive team this year. In addition, we have hired critical talent in areas such as technology, AI, analytics and category management. The teams in place are well positioned to propel this business forward.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Before I do, I want to say how excited I am to have another world-class, customer-centric leader on our team to help us realize our vision. 
Steve, over to you."

I would like to start by saying how excited I am to be at eBay. I'd also like to thank Andy for his leadership and guidance during my transition into the role.

I'd also like to thank Andy for his leadership and guidance during my transition into the role. He has done an excellent job creating value for the company and leading our finance team over the last couple of years.
I'll start on Page 4 of our presentation. We have outlined the impact of moving our Korean business to discontinued operations in our guidance for Q2 earnings. At an aggregated level, this would have reduced guidance by approximately 2 points of GMV growth, $400 million of revenue and $0.02 of EPS. The Q2 results purely reflect the performance of our continuing marketplace business. 
On July 13, we've published a Form 8-K that included recasted historical financial statements back to the start of 2019. These figures provide an apples-to-apples comparison versus our actual results. Excluding Korea, the implied Q2 guidance was between $2.58 billion and $2.63 billion of revenue, growing 8% to 10% on an organic FX-neutral basis. Non-GAAP EPS was between $0.89 and $0.94 per share, representing a decrease of 5% to 10% year-over-year.
Turning to our highlights from the quarter on Slide 5. Despite lapping an exceptional quarter last year, we delivered strong operational results. Revenue grew double digits driven by payments and ads. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.99 per share, and our operating margin was 33%. We generated $910 million of free cash flow, while returning $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. 
We generated significant value from our portfolio as we work to transform eBay. We announced the agreement to sell over 80% of our Korean business to Emart for approximately $3 billion. We completed the Classifieds transaction for total value of $13.3 billion, including $2.5 billion in cash and a 44% stake in Adevinta. We then reached an agreement to sell 1/4 of that stake to Permira for over $2.4 billion in cash. Finally, we increased our estimated 2021 share buyback to $5 billion for an initial $2 billion.
Moving to active buyers on Slide 6. We exited the quarter with 159 million buyers, representing a 2% decrease year-over-year on a trailing 12-month basis. At the beginning of the pandemic in Q2 last year, we added more than 7 million buyers, our largest quarterly increase ever. That cohort of buyers has matured in line with historical trends. We are also seeing a reduction in buyers of low-priced items due to changes in our marketing mix.
As Jamie mentioned, our strategy to attract and retain buyers has changed over the past several quarters. We have intentionally focused our marketing and product innovation on high-value buyers. These include buyers who sell or buyers who purchase at least 6 days a year and spend over $800. This high-value segment represents approximately 20% of our buyer base and they process around 75% of our GMV.
High-value buyers grew in Q2, as did the spend per buyer. Low-value buyers on eBay make approximately half of our buyer base but only purchase about 5% of our GMV. As we drive this strategy, we expect to see a further drop in active buyers on a rolling 12-month basis, but an increase in GMV per buyer over the coming quarters.
Moving to Slide 7. In Q2, we delivered $22.1 billion of GMV, down 11% year-over-year. On a spot basis, this represents a decrease of 7% year-over-year. Compared with Q2 of 2019, GMV grew 19% on an FX-neutral basis and 23% on a spot basis. There were several factors that contributed to the Q2 GMV dynamic.
First, we lapped the peak of the early impacts of the pandemic, including the first wave of mobility restrictions, stimulus payments and supply chain disruptions. Second, there was a meaningful ongoing macro benefit from global mobility, although it was significantly less at the end of the quarter than at the beginning of Q2; and third, our underlying business continued to show positive growth from site-wide product experience improvements and category performance.
In the U.S., we generated approximately $10 billion of GMV in Q2, down 5% year-over-year. International GMV decreased 16% year-over-year to $12.1 billion. Our U.S. volume outpaced international primarily due to strength in trading cards as well as benefits from government stimulus earlier in the quarter.
Turning to revenue on Slide 8. Our net revenue for the quarter was $2.7 billion, up 11% on an FX-neutral basis and up 14% on a spot basis. We delivered $2.5 billion of transaction revenue up 11% year-over-year, mainly driven by payments. We continue to make great progress on seller migration. 
As Jamie mentioned, 71% of our global on-platform volume was processed through managed payments during the quarter, which contributed approximately 18 points of incremental revenue growth year-over-year. The success of the payments ramp also drove quarterly acceleration of 80 basis points to our transaction take rate which is 11.3% for the quarter. We expect this rate to continue to grow throughout 2021 as we complete the payments rollout.
We delivered $172 million of marketing services and other revenue, up 11% year-over-year, driven by strength in shipping programs. While we continue to purposely reduce third-party advertising, the drag on total MS&O growth rate was less due to easier comps from a year ago.
Turning to Slide 9, our major cost drivers. In Q2, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 33%. This represents a 6-point year-over-year decrease driven primarily by lower volume. Cost of revenue has increased in line with payments growth due to processing costs. While these variable costs will increase as payments revenue grows,  the incremental revenue provides leverage for our fixed expenses, most notably sales and marketing and G&A.
Product development costs increased year-over-year as we continue to invest in product innovation, supporting our strategic initiatives. Transaction losses were flat versus the prior year as the benefit of netting seller fees against our net proceeds were offset by higher customer protection losses.
Turning to EPS on Slide 10. We delivered $0.99 of non-GAAP EPS in the second quarter, flat versus the prior year. Negative impacts from lapping COVID-driven volumes were offset by strategic initiatives particularly payments as well as a lower share count related to share repurchases. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.43, a decrease of 56% year-over-year.
We elected the fair value accounting method for our investment in Adevinta. The change in stock price between the close of the sale on June 24 and the quarter end on June 30, drove a majority of the GAAP EPS decrease. In addition, while we recognized further gains on the Adyen launch in Q2, we are lapping significant gains in the prior year.
Moving to Slide 11. We saw another strong quarter of cash generation with $910 million of free cash flow. This 7% year-over-year growth was driven by strong operational results led by payments and improvements in working capital. This was partly offset by higher cash taxes.
Turning to Slide 12. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.6 billion and debt of $9.1 billion. As I mentioned in my early remarks, we completed the sale of the Classifieds business to Adevinta during the quarter, generating cash proceeds of $2.5 billion. We expect to pay cash taxes associated with the sale of approximately $400 million in the third quarter.
As a result of our strong underlying free cash flow performance and the proceeds from this transaction we updated our capital allocation plans for 2021 by increasing the estimated share buyback to $5 billion. In Q2, we returned $1.6 billion to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately 24 million shares at an average price of $62.60 per share, amounting to $1.5 billion and paid a dividend of $121 million. We exited the quarter with $4.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.
Our Board has approved an additional share repurchase authorization of $3 billion with no expiry, raising a total to approximately $7.2 billion. Finally, we issued $2.5 billion of senior unsecured notes during the quarter, part of which will be used to repay our 2022 debt maturities.
Moving to investments on Slide 13. On June 24, we closed the Classifieds sale and recorded an investment on our balance sheet of $10.8 billion to reflect the 540 million shares we received as consideration. The value of this stake stood at $10.4 billion at quarter end based on Adevinta's stock price. Between the announcement of the deal last July and the close of the transaction this June, the value of our equity stake appreciated 61%.
As a regulatory condition of the Classifieds sale, we agreed to reduce our ownership stake in Adevinta to 33% or less over the 18 months following the close of the deal. We recently announced an agreement with Permira to sell approximately 135 million shares for more than $2.4 billion. This will reduce our ownership stake to 33%. We expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Adyen. The warrants we acquired in the second quarter of 2018 are valued at $1.1 billion at the end of the second quarter, an increase of over $500 million year-over-year. You'll find more information on the Adyen warrant in our 10-Q.
We also want to highlight our stake in Kakao Bank. At the end of the second quarter, our investment was worth approximately $300 million. On August 6, they completed their IPO, which increased the value of our stake to over $900 million.
Finally, on June 24, we announced plans to sell over 80% of our Korea business to Emart, we will retain an interest of less than 20%. The implied value of our interest was approximately $800 million at the time of the announcement. We remain excited about all these investments, the optionality they provide and a significant value they generate for our shareholders.
Turning to guidance on Slide 14. For Q3, we are projecting revenue between $2.42 billion and $2.47 billion, growing 6% to 8% on an organic FX-neutral basis and approximately 7% to 9% on a spot basis. We anticipate payments and advertising will continue to drive revenue to grow faster than volume, leading to take rate expansion. This revenue guidance implies GMV is down low to mid-teens on an FX-neutral basis versus last year and up high single digits compared to 2019. 
On a spot basis, today's rates would indicate a 2-point benefit versus FX-neutral growth rates in Q3. This is 2 points lower than the 4-point benefit we saw in Q2 GMV. We are assuming that macro benefits including stimulus and mobility will be significantly less in Q3 than Q2. We also expect that our efforts to improve the business will continue to enable modestly positive underlying growth.
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 to $0.90 per share, representing 4% to 9% growth. Year-over-year, we plan to continue investing in product and technology to deliver better category experiences while improving marketing efficiencies. We are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.64 to $0.68 per share in Q3.
Looking at the full year, the macro environment remains dynamic and difficult to predict, and we are not providing full year guidance at this time. However, there are variables within our control that we are sharing this context. Given the accelerated pace of the payments transition, we are raising our full year forecast for payments revenue from $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. 
Payments margin contribution continues to ramp towards our long-term target of 25%. Total operating margin for the business is expected to land at approximately 33%, which will be close to 150 basis points better than 2019. As I mentioned before, we expect to repurchase shares totaling $5 billion in 2021 at this time, which implies an additional $3.2 billion in the second half.
In conclusion, during the quarter, we delivered strong short-term results ahead of expectations while transforming the company for the longer term. We are excited about the path forward and the growth potential of eBay. Innovation is leading to volume growth in our focused categories despite tougher comps from a year ago. Our payments and advertising initiatives are driving better customer experience, resulting in incremental revenue and earnings growth. Our balanced approach to cost management allows us to reinvest in our customers while delivering high margins with low capital intensity.
We continue to deliver strong free cash flow and return value to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. Our portfolio simplification has created over $20 billion of shareholder value, allowing us to intensely focus on growing the core. As a purpose-driven company, we're enabling economic opportunity for all while supporting our people, our communities and our planet.
I would like to once more take this opportunity to thank our teams across eBay for their tremendous work over the last quarter and for their support for our buyers and sellers in the eBay community.

This is something that I laid out last July when we talked about the tech-led reimagination is being focused on turning buyers into lifelong enthusiasts on the platform. And moving away from the tactics that we had in",411,"Yes. So first, on the buyer strategy. This is something that I laid out last July when we talked about the tech-led reimagination is being focused on turning buyers into lifelong enthusiasts on the platform. And moving away from the tactics that we had in 2019, where it was really just about the number of active buyers, even low-value buyers or one-and-done buyers.
I've got the whole organization pivoted to focusing on those high-value buyers, buyers that are buying over $800, buying 6 times a year or buyers who sell. And so as you think about these buyers, they're so strong at eBay. They're 20% of them, they make up 75% of GMV. And the goal is how do we turn more buyers into these lifelong enthusiasts.
I've met a lot of these buyers, they wake up and they get a cup of coffee. And they turn to eBay and open the eBay app. And our focus is really not on just the total number, but really focused on how are we driving these buyers to become enthusiasts. The metrics that we show in the board deck our trailing 12-month metric. So we're obviously lapping the buyers that we acquired in Q2. 
But going forward, our focus will really be on these long-term enthusiasts. I'm excited to say that their GMV is growing, they're growing as a population. And more and more you're going to see us doing things to drive that longevity because we know the things that move buyers up the cohort curves into long-term buyers.
On your second question on the portfolio, absolutely. A huge part of the portfolio simplification is about being able to focus on the marketplace. And as Steve talked about, we generated $20 billion in value for shareholders, starting with the StubHub transaction, but I think more importantly now, it enables us to focus all of our attention on the marketplace business. As I've talked about, we see a lot of growth opportunity in that business. The strategy that we have is working. We're in year 1 of a multiyear reimagination of eBay. 
But if you look at what we talked about a second ago with the 10%, about to reach 20% of categories, it's really working. Customer satisfaction is at 90. It's leading to very strong GMV, and we see the same potential for this innovation playbook in every category on the site. And Steve, maybe you want to take the last one?"

And coming over to eBay, a company that's got a real sense of purpose, an amazing team and a heart of our customer centricity and innovation were with some of the core facets that I looked at when I came over to eBay.
Since I've been here, it's really clear about the sheer size and scale of the enterprise and what opportunities are ahead of us. in terms of its growth. We really do have incredible durability of a financial model with a fortress balance sheet, best-in-class margins, incredible free cash flow even after a few weeks, I sort of feel that the value of the enterprise is really misunderstood because of the potential that's ahead of us and the strategy that Jamie has laid out.
So I'm really excited to be here I think there's huge opportunities for the enterprise, and I'm looking forward to my journey over here in eBay."

But now we're pretty much at the [ goal ] line here. So there has to be pockets of the global demand base you otherwise could not cater to before because you just simply could not take their money. So what are the prospects of opening up the buyer acquisition funnel to that audience a bit more in those regions.
And I guess on a second point, recently, you launched a fulfillment service in the U.K. with a partner. So can you talk about what kind of improvement you think you may see to either conversion rates on the buyer experience as you step up the level of service for the buyers in the country."

On the first one, we're excited that as we get through managed payments, we announced that next quarter we'll be at 90%.

On the first one, we're excited that as we get through managed payments, we announced that next quarter we'll be at 90%. That opens up even more opportunities for us from a how do we service our buyers and sellers. So some examples of things that we've already launched, for example, is we launched a partnership with Afterpay as an additional form of payment in Australia, allowing people to -- in that market to pay with installments. It's very strong in Australia, and that's certainly helped us in our Australia business.
In our U.K. business, we've launched a partnership that allows us to do seller financing and to help sellers out there. And we'll continue to expand in different ways throughout the globe on more opportunities around managed payments.
The other big one that I talked about earlier is that now that commerce and payments are on, and we can manage all of that on eBay, there's a lot of friction we can take out of the platform. So unpaid items is a great example where for 25 years since I was here the first time, sellers have had to face items where buyers wouldn't pay. We've now eliminated that into 99% of auctions on our way to do that in best -- I'm sorry, best offer in auctions. We've limited fixed price on our way to do it in best offer in auctions. 2 weeks ago, we had eBay Open with thousands of sellers online and we announced this, and it was massive rejoicing from them because this has been a key pain point. So the other thing I'm excited about is just eliminating those pain points.
On your question on the fulfillment service, what we saw in the U.S. and especially in our cross-border trade coming out of Greater China, for example, is the ability to forward deploy inventory is a benefit because of the predictability that it gives to buyers from that standpoint. So we're using it to help scale small businesses to drive the ability to have forward deployment and basically pass those savings on to the customer. So we're just getting started with that program, but we've learned a lot about cross-border trade, and we're excited that fulfillment service is going to help scale some of our small businesses in their cross-border inventory."

And then secondly, looking at the decline in sold items. It looks like the sold items was down by more than GMV was down. And looking back to last year, GMV grew more than sold items last year. So it doesn't look to be driven by comps. So is there anything to call out for the decline in sold items for Q2 as well."

So we grew at 8% in the quarter despite volume being down 11%. And we actually are starting to scale up a couple of pilots that we launched in Q2, specifically ads for auctions. What we're calling Promoted Listings Express, which is a CPC business and then an off-eBay advertising business. So we continue to see lots of potential in that business. And these 3 areas are just getting started.
On the sold items, that's really a reflection of the purposeful decisions that we've made to, one, is move away from low-value items that weren't driving the type of return in low-value buyers specifically as well as a shift to higher ASP in general because of the strategy to focus category strategy working. So we talked about the strength that we're seeing in trading cards and collectibles, already having done $2 billion this year, the same as all of last year really driving our C2C business. And C2C tends to have a higher ASP or a higher average selling price than our B2C business. And so that's also driving kind of that dynamic.
So it's actually in line with where we want it to be. We think it's healthy for the ecosystem. And we think it's going to continue to be driven that way because C2C, as we look at it, we hope to continue to outpace B2C and lean in on these categories of value like our luxury goods, collectibles, et cetera."

And is there going to be, for example, an extended period of decay in those less active users before the marketplace essentially normalizes and then you can show growth?
And then secondly, I guess, more housekeeping in terms of what was behind the acceleration in the move to managed payment stream Q2? It seems like you may be about a quarter or 2 ahead of plan there, if I have the metrics right."
27862,1673836192,2374281,"eBay Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2021",2021-08-11,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Yes. So on your first question on the buyer strategy, yes, we're purposely moving away from low-value buyers or kind of low CLTV, low GMV per buyers. If you remember back to 2019, we talked about that strategy and because some of these are trailing 12-mon",347,"Yes. So on your first question on the buyer strategy, yes, we're purposely moving away from low-value buyers or kind of low CLTV, low GMV per buyers. If you remember back to 2019, we talked about that strategy and because some of these are trailing 12-month metrics, some of those numbers are actually still in our numbers even from 2019. But the reason I'm focused on is, if you look at those 50% of buyers, they only contribute 5% of GMV and the top 20% contribute 75%. And so by focusing the organization, not on just how many buyers do we have on the platform, but how many of our buyers are we turning into these high-value buyers. 
We think that's much healthier for the growth of the platform in the long term, much healthier for sellers, et cetera. Drives better with the marketing strategy that we're going after, we're really focused on the first 90 days of a customer and getting them up their life cycle. So this is going to be a purposeful strategy. You're going to see us on for years walking away from the work that we did back in 2019.
When you ask about the managed payments, what I'm really happy about is the execution from the team. If you look at when we started, for example, enabling Greater China, we got to 90% penetration within 10 weeks. And so we took the learnings from what started 2 years ago with the U.S. and Germany. And we've learned a lot as we've rolled out all of the other countries. And that pace speaks to the pace of execution of the team and what they're doing. 
I know there are a lot of questions of, would we be able to even reach the targets we had for next year originally. And I'm just excited that we're ahead of schedule, and we're starting to do things like the Afterpay and the seller financing because there's just a lot of potential for this business as we fully manage the payments by -- all through eBay."

Look, we're really excited about how we've been able to scale this program. We've now authenticated 1 million items on the platform. We've expanded that authentication to -- for sneakers to U.K., Australi",360,"Yes. So first, on your question on authentication. Look, we're really excited about how we've been able to scale this program. We've now authenticated 1 million items on the platform. We've expanded that authentication to -- for sneakers to U.K., Australia and Canada. This quarter, we announced that we're authenticating handbags over $500 in the U.S. And we're using a mixture of third-party and in-house resources to do so. But what we're seeing is that this authentication has a great ROI. What it's able to do in terms of driving GMV, driving new buyers into the site.
I'll just give you -- I'll reiterate the stat we talked about last quarter in sneakers, which is acquiring a Gen Z, they buy $500 in sneakers, but they buy $2,000 in other categories on the site. We're seeing the same thing in watches where a luxury watch buyer is buying $8,000 in categories outside of watches, and that's over 50 items. And that's one of the benefits of eBay is that cross-category shopping nature, and that's really hard for other competitors to replicate.
On eBay stores, we talked about being the seller platform of choice. And a big part of that is our strategy of really growing eBay stores. So this quarter, we announced a new program where it's much simpler to set up your eBay store. And I'm really excited by one of the features the team announced, which was the ability for a seller to send coupons to repeat buyers. So this is something that sellers have been asking for. We've built it in as part of the stores platform. And in just a few short months since it launched, that product already has 1 million buyers taking advantage of those coupons from sellers.
So another thing that, as we had our big eBay Open event 2 weeks ago, our sellers were really excited by, and frankly, we're just getting started on that program. So we're even continuing to make sellers aware of these new capabilities. So you'll continue to see quarter after quarter and year after year innovation on eBay stores because it's an important part of our strategy."

So you've got about a 10-point easier comp for GMV on an ex-FX basis in the third quarter, and you're calling for a little bit more decel from here. So do we chalk that up to kind of purging some of the low-quality buyers and a chunk of that 25% of GMV that they represent? Or is that just the macro is kind of dropping off? Any color on that would be great. 
And then your 33% operating margin for 2021 that's got the brunt of all the payment ramp in there. So as we kind of look ahead to '22, and we expect GMV to start growing again, how should we think about that operating margin? Like what are the puts and takes on that going up or going down next year?"

So I'll start off with the second quarter. And as we laid everything out on an apples-to-apples basis, we've obviously exceeded our expectations across all of the major metrics. We laid out our third quarter guidance.",311,"Ross, Steve here. I'll pick those up. So I'll start off with the second quarter. And as we laid everything out on an apples-to-apples basis, we've obviously exceeded our expectations across all of the major metrics. We laid out our third quarter guidance. And obviously, that reflects the best view based on what we're seeing in our most recent trends in the first part of the quarter and our latest outlook on mobility.
This is actually an unchanged view versus what we communicated when we guided in the second quarter. And what we indicated was that we expected the second half GMV growth will be similar to Q2, as the easier comps will be offset by lower macro benefits in 2021, so mobility got back to normal. And we are seeing some of that in particular, a couple of our key markets in the likes of Germany and the U.K. So that underpins that. And again, we sort of -- when we look through that lens, we expect that to lead to a low to mid-teen volume declines year-over-year, which actually at the heart of it indicates modestly positive growth from the underlying business on the basis of us continuing to improve the customer experience and execute on the vision that Jamie has laid out.
Specifically, with regards to your second question about the 33% operating margin for 2021, obviously, we're ramping payments up. We talked extensively about the fact that, that's actually a lower margin part of the business sort of 25%. We've guided our expectations that 2021, we'll end with that 33%. With our recast financials, those are 150 basis stronger than 2019. So we're right on track. We're seeing margin accretion from all of the initiatives that we're driving forward. We're not guiding 2022 at this point but I'm very pleased with the trajectory that we're sitting on."

What's your message to sellers with the notion that what they're seeing in terms of their costs on eBay continue to go up as there's been a lot of issues and glitches with working out final value fees and tax and so forth.
And then a couple of quick questions for Steve. Can you give us a bit more detail on the decline in gross margins, you mentioned payments and authentication. And also, adjusting for the fair value of both warrants and equity and the investments, it looks like free cash flow would have been about 1/3 lower. So can you talk about what you're seeing in the underlying free cash flow of the business when we remove all these very noisy investment income and changes in fair value of warrants."
27862,1673836192,2374281,"eBay Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 11, 2021",2021-08-11,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Yes. On your first question, I think what is important there is to think about the fact that there used to be a separate take rate associated with payments, and now what our sellers are seeing is a blended take rate. And in general, the vast majority of s",299,"Yes. On your first question, I think what is important there is to think about the fact that there used to be a separate take rate associated with payments, and now what our sellers are seeing is a blended take rate. And in general, the vast majority of sellers will actually be paying lower fees when you look at the combined take rate that they pay because they're no longer paying that separate fees, and it's one single rate.
The reason you're still seeing a rise in take rate and may continue to do so is just because of the ramp of payments. So as payments ramps up, that starts to get reflected in eBay's take rate but the seller is no longer paying that PayPal or other form of payment take rate.
The second key thing for us is making sure that we return the value to the sellers for the fees that we're charging. And so when you think about the scale demand that we can bring in terms of 159 million buyers, in terms of new capabilities that we're bringing to them on the platform like the ability to go back to repeat sellers. There are areas where we've discounted our fees like in sneakers, which has worked out really well in terms of growing those categories. We look in general at the value that we provide. 
And I would say in our core business, we actually feel really good about that. And what we're seeing in our advertising business is that the ROAS or the return on ad spend that our sellers are seeing is actually higher than what they're getting on other platforms, which also, I think, speaks to the value of the demand that we're providing. I'll let Steve take the other questions."

There's the underlying business, there's payments and then there's the likes of authentication. And so as a reminder, we laid out the strategy around payments a couple of years ago with regards to $2 billion of incremental revenue, $500 million of incremental op margin. And as Jamie alluded to, that is going very well. The momentum's going well. We've increased the forecast for 2021 to $1.8 million billion on the revenue side. And as I said earlier, we are continuing to be on the path for the incremental 150 basis points over 2 years on our margin story. So it's not necessarily driving any dilution in the margin story. It's great from a net income standpoint as we go forward.
The second point on authentication, Jamie mentioned the return on investment that, that was providing. It's rather de minimis when you look at the overall cost structure in terms of, in fact, less than 0.5 point of margin is where you go from authentication. But the amount of stickiness that it's providing for our customers when they're going to cross-category buying more than pays itself. And it's an investment that we're really glad we're making as we think about the whole ecosystem, and then the ability for that to move across categories.
With regard to our free cash flow at an underlying level, we generated free cash flow of $910 million in the quarter. The warrants are not achieved yet and the free cash flow is investment. What I would say is that we continue to invest in product as part of our core platform. A, in terms of the payments rollout, which is going extremely well. And other product investments with regards to moving the site forward in the categories that Jamie alluded to earlier. So we're doing very well in terms of the organization and how we're moving forward, and very happy to follow up offline if there's any further questions."

We have, as I said in my prepared comments, assumed that we start to ramp off the significant lockdowns coming from 2020 through '21. We talked about the fact that mobility in terms of people getting out and about would increase as we went through the second quarter. 
And so as we get into the third, then that's rolling off. In fact, if you look at particularly Germany, one of our biggest markets in the U.K., things are pretty much back to normal from a mobility standpoint. Travel's going through the roof if you look at search in terms of leisure activities and travel, I think that's also going forward. Obviously, it feels a little different maybe over here at the moment with regard to the Delta variant. But in essence, when we're seeing things, we're expecting that going forward.
I'm not going to get beyond quarter 3, Deepak, [indiscernible] because we chose not to guide further than that because of the uncertainty. But we are assuming in the third quarter that things are sort of starting to get back to some sort of normality and we're not in the sort of a lockdown scenario.
With regards to the Adevinta transaction, obviously, that was completed. When we think about Adyen and Korea, whilst we have agreed those transactions, they're not closed yet. And obviously, therefore, we're not getting to any discussions about the proceeds associated with those transactions until those are closed. So obviously, leading into the Adevinta, very pleased that we were able to increase the share buyback from $2 billion to $5 billion this year in terms of driving those returns for shareholders. but it's too early to say with regard to the other transactions that are not closed yet."

So first, on the Promoted Listings, yes, the rollout of CPC is really to have additional ad formats and additional capabilities for sellers to drive visibility of their listings. So we talked last quarter about how we're only at 1% of GMV. And if you look at other platforms, we think there's significant potential in the kind of low- to mid-single-digit percentage of GMV. 
The backs of the existing program where we've already done over $1 billion grew 8% this quarter were really on a single type of advertising in a single format. So it was all CPA on fixed price. So as we expand now to auctions, as we expand to a CPC where we introduce more bidding capabilities for our top spot and search, that just enables sellers to have more tools. So we're in beta on that product right now.
 And I would just say, in general, we're really excited by what we're seeing because our ROAS is really strong, meaning our buyer experience is performing well and the return that the sellers are getting on that spend is productive and much more productive than they would get on other platforms.
In terms of eBay Open, I think we had a lot of really positive feedback about the unpaid item noise. I've known sellers forever, get frustrated when that happens to them, especially for a new seller. And so they're really excited that we're tackling that as part of managed payments. I'd say they're really excited by what we're doing in stores and coupons because they want to build their brand on eBay. They want to drive repeat business. And so I think they're really excited by that.
I'd say the other forum that was really well attended and had a lot of excitement was the trading cards forum. the launch of Computer Vision, where we're driving 80% of the scans are really identifying what the product is and it's simplifying the listing flow. We launched this new my collections which is a really popular feature for people because they can show up their collections. 
And we launched a price sky feature, which eBay has this treasure trove of data in the 25 years of history. Nobody has the data that we have. It's a really great asset for us. So I'd say that area and those sellers that joined in particular, we're really excited by the innovation that we're making.
I love those forums because this platform gets better by listening to our sellers and hearing their feedback, and they give us lots of ideas of things to continue to work on in the tech-led reimagination. So a great interaction. Despite being virtual, they all can't wait to be in person again like we can, but it was a really good session."

Today, I'll begin the call with key highlights from the third quarter. Then I will share some updates on the progress we are making towards our strategic vision. At the end of my remarks, I will turn the call over to Steve, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. 
Q3 was another strong quarter, driven by our team's relentless focus on sellers and buyers. I'm excited by the positive impact this is having on the underlying health of the business. The changes we are making to the marketplace are improving results today and are also putting us in a better position to deliver sustainable growth. We remain confident in our long-term vision to grow the core, become the seller platform of choice and cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with buyers. 
Let me highlight a few achievements from the quarter that brought us one step closer to this vision. 
Our business delivered better-than-expected revenue and earnings growth on the high end of our guidance. Our strategic playbook continues to improve customer satisfaction and build trust and is leading to faster GMV growth in our focus categories. The managed payments migration, which is nearly complete, is helping sellers and buyers by reducing friction, lowering cost and enabling new capabilities. Our advertising business continues to grow faster than marketplace volume, and our product innovation provides sellers new tools to help them scale their eBay businesses. 
We are also making great strides in our ESG efforts. Recently, we received approval from the science-based targets initiative for our multiyear carbon emission reduction goals. And importantly, we announced that eBay will be 100% carbon neutral this year and will remain so going forward. 
I'm pleased to report that all key business metrics either met or surpassed our expectations in Q3. 
Revenue overperformed growing 10%, driven by acceleration in the payments migration and Promoted Listings growth. We also delivered $0.90 of non-GAAP EPS at the high end of expectations while increasing technology investments. GMV performed in line with expectations globally, declining 12% versus last year and increasing 9% compared to 2019. Excluding transitory macro impacts, we continue to see modestly positive underlying growth in the business. 
Global active sellers remained unchanged at 19 million, and total active buyers were 154 million. Over the past year, we have focused on attracting and retaining high-value buyers by innovating in focused categories and targeting enthusiasts with upper funnel marketing. We have also discontinued legacy couponing that's skewed towards low-value buyers. These actions are resulting in a gradual evolution of our buyer base over time. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, high-value buyers are up 6%. 
Another ongoing transformation of our marketplace is managed payments, which progressed quickly during the quarter. In Q3, we processed over 90% of on-platform GMV and remain on track to finish by the end of this year. I'm thrilled that we are close to migrating all of our global sellers to a next-gen product experience. While we are close to completing the transition, we are only at the beginning of realizing our full payments potential. Owning the entire seller and buyer journey unlocks opportunities to remove friction, improve trust and provide new capabilities to sellers and buyers. We are already starting down this path, and here are a few examples. 
Last quarter, we effectively eliminated unpaid items on fixed-price transactions and have continued to reduce this issue for best offers. In the U.K., we are paying many sellers as quickly as next business day after buyer payment is confirmed. Based on community feedback, we reduced another pain point for trusted sellers by increasing protection against fraudulent returns by requiring photos and providing return shipping credits. 
In addition, we continue to improve our stores experience to make eBay the seller platform of choice. We've been increasing our traffic to stores and providing more CRM capabilities to make managing their businesses on eBay easier than ever. Sellers are leveraging these new features to drive repeat purchases. For example, in only 6 months since launch, more than 2.5 million buyers have completed a repeat purchase from a store using our new seller funded coupons. To further build sellers' brands, we are testing video integration on high-traffic pages to help them tell their unique and compelling stories to enthusiast buyers. 
Our advertising revenue continues to outpace volume due to Promoted Listings, which drove over $207 million in revenue in Q3, up 9%. We also tested 3 new Promoted Listings products and are starting to offer these features to more sellers. 
In September, we opened up Promoted Listings Express to more sellers in the U.S., U.K., Germany and Australia. This feature allows sellers to boost visibility of auction listings for a onetime fee regardless of whether the item is sold. Early adopters have seen substantial growth in impressions and clicks. 
Last month, we invited eligible sellers to try Promoted Listings Advanced, enabling them to create campaigns on a cost-per-click basis with more budget control. In parallel, we launched a suite of tools to create campaigns, monitor performance and optimize returns. We are also providing training and webinars to drive trial and adoption. During Q3, we explored ways to syndicate ads off eBay through external Promoted Listings. 
Through the eBay Partner Network, we are testing tools and incentives for affiliates to drive enthusiast buyers to existing promoted listing sellers. We are also experimenting with other forms of seller-funded marketing across various channels. Our new advertising products are in the early days, and we are excited about their long-term potential. 
Moving to our focus categories. I'm pleased with the pace of innovation and the positive reaction from our sellers and buyers. Volume from these categories continues to outperform the rest of the marketplace, and we are increasing customer satisfaction by improving trust. 
As you may recall, when we exited last quarter, we had applied our playbook to approximately 10% of global GMV. We remain on track to expand that to roughly 20% by the end of the year. 
Let me walk you through several examples. Our sneakers business in the U.S. continues to grow at healthy double-digit rates. During Q3, we launched authentication in Germany, added 30 more brands to our catalog and improved SEO performance for top sneaker brands. We also leaned further into upper funnel marketing and sponsored key industry events to strengthen our reputation with enthusiasts. 
Starting tomorrow, we will be trialing a new 3D image capability on select sneaker listings. Leveraging AI and machine learning, the experience will allow buyers to interact with a detailed 360-degree view of the actual item they are buying. We're excited about the potential of this new technology, particularly the ability to reinforce buyer confidence at the point of purchase. 
Moving to luxury watches. This category is also growing at strong double-digit rates in the U.S. Buyers are finding more inventory on eBay than other marketplaces as many brands have decreased production, and preowned supply is limited on other platforms. 
Since launching authentication in luxury handbags, growth has accelerated in this category and was positive in Q3, outperforming the total U.S. site by double digits. We are seeing the same high customer satisfaction as other authenticated categories. 
As I've mentioned in the past, part of our strategy is to drive enthusiasts to new trusted experiences and then leverage those buyers across our vast supply in other categories. The average buyer who purchase sneakers and luxury watches spends approximately $2,000 and $8,000, respectively, in other categories. We are seeing the exact same behavior in our latest focus category. 
Buyers of authenticated handbags are spending over $5,000 outside of handbags. This cross-category benefit for sellers and buyers is a unique advantage for eBay. One of the reasons our growth has improved in luxury categories is the improvement in buyer and seller trust. We recently celebrated the 1-year anniversary of authenticity guarantee, having now processed over 1.4 million items across multiple categories. Customer satisfaction has consistently exceeded 90%, and we are operating in 5 countries with a mix of in-house and third-party resources. 
Another focus category that is driving growth in the U.S. is trading cards, which is growing significantly faster than the total marketplace. In late July, we launched new features, including price guides and collections, which allow trading card enthusiasts to view, manage and track the value of their portfolios. To date, close to 4 million cards have been added to customer collections. 
In addition, close to 250,000 buyers have used eBay's newly launched price guide to visualize the changing value of their favorite trading cards. These features cater to the needs of high-value enthusiasts and are increasing engagement and trust in eBay. 
The next focus category we're applying the innovation playbook to is motors, parts and accessories. Among the changes we are making is to take our entire parts inventory and add it to the eBay Motors app, creating a one-stop shop for vehicles and parts enthusiasts. We are excited by the potential of bringing together one of the world's largest vehicle selections with hundreds of millions of parts in one customized experience. We're exploring further changes to parts and accessories that leverage our strong market position to capture more untapped growth. 
ESG remains critical to our business health and to our customers, and I'm pleased to announce that we have reached some significant milestones in our journey toward establishing eBay as the leading sustainability company in e-commerce. 
Just 2 weeks ago, we announced that our emission reduction goals were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. We will reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 90% by 2030. This is the most ambitious designation available and aligned with the Paris agreement. 
Additionally, we will reduce value chain emissions from downstream transportation by 20% in the same time frame. To reduce emissions from good shift using our platform, we will partner with our logistics providers to encourage low-carbon alternatives. 
I'm also proud that eBay will be carbon neutral for our offices and data centers in 2021. We expect to maintain this going forward as we continue efforts to reduce our overall carbon footprint. At eBay, one of our core values is to be for everyone. As part of this focus, supporting our seller community is critically important. 
Earlier this month, we issued a new report on equitable entrepreneurship, which detailed how selling on eBay helped women during the pandemic. We found that 82% of women who are new to eBay or increased their selling did so because of job loss, reduction of income, illness, loss of child care or some other hardship. This vast majority of women surveyed says the ability to sell on eBay was a benefit during the pandemic, citing the need to earn additional income for themselves or drive revenue for their businesses. I'm proud that our platform can provide flexibility and opportunity to so many during tough times so that they can earn extra income through selling in our marketplace. 
I'm also inspired by the continuous generosity of sellers and buyers on eBay. During Q3, approximately $35 million was raised through eBay for Charity, up 11%. Additionally, thousands of global employees helped select small businesses to receive grants totaling $3 million from the eBay Foundation. These grants are focused on serving underrepresented entrepreneurs and are used to provide training, coaching and mentorship needed to help their businesses thrive. 
In closing, as I mentioned at the start of the call, Q3 was yet another strong quarter. We continue to make progress on our multiyear journey, and it's clear that our strategy is working. Enthusiasts are responding to innovation in our focus categories and are increasingly putting their trust in eBay. 
Managed payments is on track to complete the migration this year and is driving friction out of the experience while opening up new capabilities for sellers and buyers. 
Our advertising business is innovating by providing a portfolio of tools our sellers can leverage to build and grow their businesses on eBay. And we're accomplishing all of this while setting and achieving ambitious climate goals and providing a platform where economic opportunity is available to all. 
I want to thank our passionate employees who have tirelessly worked to bring our vision and purpose to life. Their dedication to serving sellers and buyers is inspiring. Their relentless execution is driving innovation and making eBay a better marketplace, and I couldn't be prouder to lead this team. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you."
27862,1684584211,2414758,"eBay Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with our Q3 financial highlights on Slide 4 of our presentation. We delivered another strong quarter. Our results met or exceeded expectations across all key metrics, while our year-ov",2281,"Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. 
I'll begin with our Q3 financial highlights on Slide 4 of our presentation. We delivered another strong quarter. Our results met or exceeded expectations across all key metrics, while our year-over-year comparisons reflect the extraordinary growth we experienced last year as a result of the pandemic. These results were underpinned by continued execution against our strategic pillars, including contributions from payments, Promoted Listings and focus categories. 
Revenue grew 10% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. The transaction revenue grew by double digits for the sixth consecutive quarter, primarily due to contributions from managed payments. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.90 per share, and our operating margin was 31.7%. We generated $502 million of free cash flow and returned approximately $2.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends during Q3. Given the underlying growth in our business and strong free cash flow generation, I'm pleased to announce we've raised our share buyback target for 2021 from $5 billion to $7 billion. 
Our pending portfolio transactions remain on track to close within previously communicated time lines. We anticipate the sale of Adevinta shares to Permira will close during Q4, while the Korea deal, which will close early next year or potentially by the end of 2021. 
Turning to active buyers on Slide 5. We exited Q3 with 154 million active buyers on a trailing 12-month basis, representing a 5% decrease year-over-year. This decline was primarily driven by low-value buyers, a group that makes up more than half of our buyer base but only 5% of GMV. As Jamie mentioned, this ongoing trend is a result of our strategy to prioritize attracting and retaining high-value buyers. We are confident in this approach, but we recognize the reduction in low-value buyers could pressure our rolling 12-month active buy account in the coming quarters. Compared with Q3 of 2019, a low-value buyers are down 7%, while high-value buyers were up 6%. 
Moving to GMV on Slide 6. In Q3, we delivered $19.5 billion of GMV, down 10% year-over-year on a spot basis and down 12% on an FX-neutral basis, in line with our expectations. The macro benefits to our business from mobility was significantly diminished in Q3 as restrictions faded across the globe, where we continue to see modestly positive underlying growth in our business. Compared with Q3 of 2019, GMV grew 9% on an FX-neutral basis. Consistent with prior quarters, our performance by market varied based on a number of factors, including relative mobility and country-specific macroeconomic trends. p
Internationally, GMV was roughly flat versus Q3 of 2019 on an FX-neutral basis. A number of factors influenced the growth differential between the U.S. and our international markets during the quarter. Mobility is back to pre-COVID levels in many of our largest international markets, diminishing the volume tailwinds we benefited from in prior quarters. Changing consumer behavior, including an uptick in leisure activities and travel, also may have impacted e-commerce growth internationally. Additionally, category mix varies in our international markets, which have lower exposure to certain fast-growing verticals like collectibles, but higher concentration of items from cross-border trade that are more difficult to source amid the ongoing supply chain disruptions. 
Finally, our focus category rollouts are more nascent in our international markets. However, as our innovation playbook expands to more categories and countries, we are confident our international growth trajectory will improve. 
In the U.S., GMV grew 22% versus Q3 of 2019. Growth in our domestic marketplace was driven by strong execution against our strategic pillars, more product rollouts within focus categories and steady growth within e-commerce. 
Residential mobility improved in the U.S. but continues to trial the European markets, while leisure activities and travel increased in line with normal seasonal trends. Other external factors may be benefiting our U.S. business relative to international markets, including the lingering impact of government stimulus and scarcity benefits and supply chain disruptions. The precise impact of these effects is unclear, but they are likely a net positive contributor to U.S. growth in the near term. In aggregate, there are numerous puts and takes between regions, but we remain encouraged by the modestly positive underlying growth in our business. 
Turning to revenue on Slide 7. Net revenue for Q3 was $2.5 billion, up 10% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis and 11% on a spot basis. We delivered $2.4 billion of transaction revenue, also up 11% on an FX-neutral basis. Growth was primarily driven by managed payments, which contributed roughly 20 points of incremental revenue growth during the third quarter. The payments ramp drove an 80 basis point sequential increase in our take rate, which surpassed 12% in quarter 3. Moving forward, we expect our sequential take rate increases to moderate as the managed payments rollout is nearly complete. 
Within our advertising business, Promoted Listings grew 9% year-over-year, outpacing volume by 21 points. Early adopters of the new Promoted Listings products are seeing significant increases in performance, giving us confidence in the long-term potential for advertising revenue. 
Marketing services and other revenue declined 7% year-over-year to $151 million driven by the impact of sold item declines and shipping programs and headwinds within third-party advertising. We continue to purposely reduce third-party advertising in favor of Promoted Listings, which delivers superior performance and offer a better experience for both sellers and buyers. 
Moving to expenses on Slide 8. In Q3, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31.7%. This represents the 2.7 point year-over-year decrease primarily driven by lower volume. Our cost of revenue has scaled in line with payments growth due to variable processing costs. This dynamic has pressured gross margins during our transition to managed payments. However, once the transition is complete, we expect gross margins to be more stable. Moreover, the incremental revenue from payments drive significant leverage in our fixed expenses, most notably sales and marketing and G&A. 
Sales and marketing fell by nearly 4 points as a percentage of revenue year-over-year in Q3. In addition to leverage from payments revenue, sales and marketing was lower due to reduction in coupons and rewards programs that were previously targeted towards low-value buyers. 
Product development increased 21% year-over-year as we continue to accelerate product innovation and support our longer-term strategic initiatives within payments, advertising and focus categories. Transaction losses rose as a percentage of revenue by nearly 2 points versus last year due to higher consumer protection losses from the payments transition and the lapping of onetime benefits in the prior year, which were partially offset by the benefits of fee netting. 
Turning to EPS on Slide 9. We delivered $0.90 of non-GAAP EPS in Q3, up 9% year-over-year as ramping contributions from payments and the net benefit of share repurchases more than offset the lapping of COVID-driven volumes a year ago. 
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.43, roughly 50% lower than last year. The delta was primarily driven by a fair value adjustment on our Adevinta shares, partly offset by gains from other investments. 
Switching to free cash flow on Slide 10. We delivered another strong quarter of cash generation in Q3 with $502 million of free cash flow, a 4% decline year-over-year. The decline was driven by the timing of working capital and CapEx spend, partly offset by operational efficiencies and the timing of 2020 cash taxes. 
As a reminder, the managed payments transition has yielded meaningful working capital benefits. Through 3 quarters of 2021, this benefit amounted to approximately $300 million. 
Moving to capital allocation on Slide 11. We ended the quarter with cash and nonequity investments of $5.1 billion and gross debt of $9.1 billion. During the third quarter, we returned approximately $2.4 billion to our shareholders through stock repurchase and dividends. We repurchased approximately 31 million shares to $2.3 billion at an average share price of $72.52. We also paid a quarterly dividend of $116 million in September. Given our fortress balance sheet and strong underlying free cash flow, we are updating our share buyback plan for 2021 from $5 billion to $7 billion, which implies approximately $3 billion of repurchases during the fourth quarter. 
Overall, our capital allocation objectives remain unchanged. We'll preserve financial flexibility to execute on strategy and drive long-term value creation. We aim to drive organic growth in our business, and we'll look for opportunities to supplement that growth with disciplined acquisitions and investments. We will optimize our financial flexibility, access to debt and cost of capital, and we'll continue to deliver meaningful returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Moving to investments on Slide 12. As a reminder, we received 540 million shares in Adevinta from our Classifieds sale, which closed during June of this year, representing an equity ownership stake of approximately 44%. As a regulatory condition of the Classifieds sale, we committed to reduce our ownership stake in Adevinta to 33% or less over the 18 months following the close of the deal. In July, we agreed to sell approximately 135 million shares to Permira for roughly $2.4 billion. We believe the Permira share sale remains on track to close during Q4 and the 405 million shares that we would retain were worth close to $7 billion at the end of September. 
Turning to Adyen. The wins we acquired in connection with our strategic partnership during the second quarter of 2018 were valued at $1.4 billion at the end of Q3, an increase of over $300 million quarter-over-quarter. You will find more information on the Adyen warrant in our 10-Q. 
Our stake in KakaoBank has appreciated in value following the company's IPO in August. At the end of Q3, our investment was worth approximately $800 million. 
Finally, in June, we announced plans to sell over 80% of our Korea business to Emart for approximately $3 billion. Upon deal close, we will retain an interest of just under 20% of eBay Korea, which carried an implied value of roughly $800 million at the time of the announcement. We believe the deal remains on track to close by early 2022 with a possibility of closing before the year end. We remain excited about our portfolio of global investments, the potential optionality they provide and the significant value they collectively represent for eBay shareholders. 
Turning to guidance on Slide 13. For the fourth quarter, we are projecting revenue between $2.57 billion and $2.62 billion, representing growth of 3% to 5% on an FX-neutral basis and approximately 4% to 6% on a spot basis. 
Our pay rate has risen notably in recent quarters due to contributions from payments and advertising. Although we expect advertising to continue growing faster than volume, we expect the impact from payments on our take rate to moderate as we are nearing completion of our managed payments transition. 
We are raising our 2021 full year outlook for payments revenue from $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Our revenue guidance implies GMV is down low teens on an FX-neutral basis versus last year and up mid- to high single digits compared to Q4 of 2019. Our GMV guidance assumes steady execution against our strategic pillars and continued innovation within focused categories. Our outlook also assumes minimal benefits from macro factors like mobility, stimulus and supply chain impacts. However, we note the macro environment remains dynamic and difficult to predict, with varied impacts from country to country. 
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.97 to $1.01 per share in Q4, representing a 14% to 19% year-over-year growth. We plan to continue investing in product and technology to deliver better category experiences and improved customer satisfaction. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to between 18% and 19% due to recent outperformance of our U.S. business. We expect our GAAP EPS in the range of $0.72 to $0.76 per share in Q4. 
In closing, we delivered strong results in Q3 that met or exceeded their expectations across all key metrics. We continue to execute our strategic vision and grow our core marketplace while maintaining the balance and discipline that will enable us to generate tremendous value for our shareholders for years to come. Managed payments is on track to deliver $2 billion in revenue this year. and our transition is on track for completion by year-end. However, we believe our payments journey is just beginning as this milestone unlocks new opportunities to reduce friction in the marketplace and provide additional financial services. 
Advertising revenue continues to outpace volume, the sellers increasingly leverage our expanded product portfolio to amplify the exposure of their listings. We observed impressive momentum with our focus categories, which are meaningfully outpacing overall volume growth. We are confident we can continue expanding this innovation playbook to more categories and countries in the quarters ahead. 
Our balanced approach to capital allocation has enabled us to reinvest in our business, generating consistently strong free cash flow and deliver attractive returns for shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
As proud as I am of our numerous business accomplishments,  what makes them even more impactful to me is knowing we are achieving these milestones while building sustainable, exclusive and circular economy platform for all. 
Once again, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our teams across eBay for their incredible work over the last quarter and their support for our amazing sellers and buyers in the eBay community. 
One final note, we are in the midst of a multiyear journey to deliver a tech-led reimagination of eBay. As the impact from macro factors stabilizes, we are reviewing our internal goals for 2022 and beyond. We anticipate showing our longer-term goals and aspirations at an investor event early next year. 
With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Operator, over to you."

So first, on the categories, it really is about both leading into the high-value buyers that are on the platform as well as attracting new buyers in. So if you look at what we're doing in watches and sneakers or this quarter, we",340,"Yes. So I'll take that. So first, on the categories, it really is about both leading into the high-value buyers that are on the platform as well as attracting new buyers in. 
So if you look at what we're doing in watches and sneakers or this quarter, we announced we're authenticating handbags over $500, it is catering to both. One of the great benefits of eBay is the cross-category nature of shopping. So if we acquire a buyer into a handbag, who buys a handbag over $500, they actually end up spending $5,000 in other categories outside of handbags on the site. 
So when we think about acquisition, it's not just acquiring it for that category, it's acquiring it more broadly for eBay. That's one of our significant benefits. Excited because we've expanded categories this quarter. We brought our sneakers authentication program to Germany. We brought watches to the U.K. business, and we launched handbags in the U.S. in terms of that product. 
From Certified Refurbished, we added new brands, Samsung, KitchenAid Dyson and expanded number of products there, and that's exciting coming into holiday. 
On your question on marketing, we've really shifted our marketing. I think traditionally, we've been a mostly lower funnel with some broad-based campaigns on upper funnel really driving into how do we acquire high-value buyers and high-value enthusiasts in specific verticals. So what that means is a whole lot more of upper-funnel marketing, partnerships, leaning in with social media influencers in certain categories and basically going much more broad with our marketing plans to find those buyers where they are. 
And I guess the last thing I'd say is we're really focused on the first 90-day experience on eBay. Many times in my career, I've done this, where you really get focused on how do you introduce them to the brand, bring them up the life cycle, make sure that they turn into the high-value buyers that we want to do, and that's going to be a continued focus for us over the coming quarters."

And then, Steve, maybe with respect to the Q4 outlook, just looking at the sequential ramp versus typical seasonality, it's certainly a little light of historical patterns even when eBay could be a net beneficiary from supply chain issues. I know you like factoring that into the outlook, but maybe some additional color there would be helpful."

So thanks for the question, Colin. So we do talk a lot about the vertical expansion and focus category work that we're doing, and we're excited for what's happening there. if you actually step back and look at it, the vast majority of our resources are actually going to site-wide initiatives across the board. And I'd point to a couple. 
One is, obviously, our ad business and a lot of investment there across the board, especially with the 3 new products that were at the beginning of launching. Obviously, payments huge initiative. But other areas that we haven't talked a lot about are like eBay stores. So working on a next-gen experience in eBay stores, incorporating video so allowing sellers to kind of tell their story from that perspective. So the more CRM tool capabilities so that sellers can be more involved in how we bring buyers back to the platform and drive that repeat business. 
So the stat I just mentioned earlier about we launched it 6 months ago, but now sellers are funding the coupons to drive buyers back to the site from past buyers or interested buyers, and that's a huge benefit for sellers and a huge benefit for eBay because we're involving them and driving them and already 2.5 million buyers have used that in that time period. 
And so we're also testing a new selling experience. If you're on the site, you'll see that there's a beta out there of a new way to sell. So most of the vast majority of investments are going to horizontal. But what I like is it's a complement because some of those horizontal lean into some of the vertical work that we're doing in the vertical work, and we're able to use in a number of categories across the site. So the 2 also play together well. 
Steve, I'll let you take the second part of the question."

Colin, I will say we're expecting a steady contribution from the strategic initiatives that Jamie has continued to lay out with the innovation that we're driving across the platform, not only in the focus categories, but also the momentum around sort of payments and ads as we've gone forward. 
On a year-over-2 basis, I mean, if you think about and stand back year-over-year, we're obviously lapping a pandemic. On a year-over-2 basis, we're seeing mid- to high single-digit growth compared to Q4 2019. 
I think there's a few puts and say, Colin, First of all, our holiday perspective around Q4 is embedded in the guide. From a headwind perspective, in the prepared comments we had, we talked about supply chain pressure for cross-border trade that we see on one side. But in terms of a tailwind, obviously, eBay is well known for unique and scarce items, which we do expect to support through the holiday period. 
So a few puts and takes, but overall, I'm pleased we believe will be continued modestly positive underlying growth on the platform as a result of the initiatives that we're driving forward."

I mean, should we expect these offerings to drive adoption among a broader range of sellers? And maybe related to that, can you provide an update on where you currently are in terms of penetration among the seller base for promoted offerings? 
And then a second question, I realize this might be a little bit early, but how should we think about the buybacks for next year? It feels like you have plenty of capacity, but wondering if there is a formula you're thinking about to do it in a more programmatic way after the $7 billion this year."

So on the new Promoted Listings offerings, let me just kind of explain this in detail. So the first one, which is Express is really to give us a Promoted Listings product against auctions so since we launched this product 5 years ago, it's really onl",300,"Yes. So on the new Promoted Listings offerings, let me just kind of explain this in detail. So the first one, which is Express is really to give us a Promoted Listings product against auctions so since we launched this product 5 years ago, it's really only applied to fixed price. And so this opens up, while a smaller format of the site, a format that has not been open to advertising before. Promoted Listings Express is a CPC-based product, gives sellers the opportunity to drive more velocity, goes after a different type of marketing budget for that perspective and gives us the opportunity to work with a secondary and supplementary advertising format. 
And the third is off-eBay advertising. And that's using the vast marketing reach that eBay does today, partnering with our sellers to drive advertising as part of that off-eBay outreach to bring existing buyers and new buyers back to the platform. What I would say for you is that it's early days on these 3 products. 
If you look back, we started our ad business 5 years ago, and we've grown to $1 billion now over 5 years. And so we're at the point now where we're testing, we're learning. We've got invited sellers into the program. And just like it took us time to build up the CPA-based program, I think it will take us time here to build up the advertising program. 
In terms of penetration, we still have a lot of opportunity left, both in terms of the sellers and listings. I believe the last that we shared was that only $400 million of the listings have advertising associated with them. So there's a lot of opportunity for additional penetration. 
I'll let Steve take the second question about how we're thinking about the future."

We haven't put the guidance out there, but I'll give a little bit of color in terms of where we are. 
So as we've previously said, reinvestments in the business is our first priority, whether that's built by the partner. But having said that, beyond that, any excess cash that we do have continue to drive returns. We'll continue with a disciplined return of capital to shareholders. And this is no different to the past. We've had a strong and consistent history of actually those capital returns. And in 2021, that's been no exception. So think about it as going from $2 billion at the start of the year, lifting that to $5 billion, and most recently on this call talking about $7 billion. 
So I think when I stand back and think about eBay as a whole, the balance that we have and the benefits of the franchise is we often have the ability to do both in terms of reinvesting in the business and doing capital returns to our shareholders. So you should expect that philosophy as we go forward."

So what's holding back the same type of uptick for international? Is it structural? Or is it just a timing thing that we should see a ramp up after you kind of roll those out after starting in the U.S.? 
And then the second question is on how big is eBay Motors these days? I know it's a big category historically. And just can you talk about a little bit about the opportunity there in terms of making that one focus category and merging the parts and the motors."

First off, let me say, I'm really pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the overall business. We're growing at 9% year-over-2-year basis based on the strategic vision we have. Clearly, different",559,"Yes. So let me start with the U.S. versus international. First off, let me say, I'm really pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the overall business. We're growing at 9% year-over-2-year basis based on the strategic vision we have. Clearly, different dynamics across the market. 
So in Q3, our international business was impacted by mobility returning to really pre-COVID levels, coupled with an unprecedented snapback in travel and leisure activities in Europe. In addition, as Steve mentioned a little bit earlier, our international cross-border trade sellers were also pressured by supply chain disruptions. That tends to be more in our international segment from a cross-border perspective than in our U.S. segment. 
On the other hand, in the U.S., we've seen strong growth driven by momentum in our core business. To your question on the focus categories, it's not a structural change. We actually think the work we're doing applies across the whole globe. It's really a timing thing. So in most of these areas, we actually roll them out in the U.S., get them perfected here and then expand them internationally. 
So for example, sneakers is just now launching this quarter in Germany. We launched watches in the U.S. We just started that expansion in the U.K. this quarter. Handbags, we just launched in the U.S. and that hasn't expanded yet. So it's really a timing thing, but we think the playbook that we have is relevant in every single market that we have. Probably with the exception of trading cards and collectibles, that's just so much stronger in the U.S. than it is internationally. But that's a huge U.S. benefit and a lot of the pieces that we're doing there are a key focus for that. But overall, I feel great about the health of the business and our ability to expand those focus categories internationally. 
On your second question on P&A, we haven't disclosed the size of the business, but I will say that if you just step back and look at the market, we're in a leading position in P&A, especially in U.K. and in Germany. It's a very strong category and a very strong franchise there. And it's a key part of our path that we talked about last quarter of going from 10% of the site to 20% of the site. It's a strong category for eBay because of the vastness of parts and accessories that we have. We actually do a fairly good job with Fitment. I talked last quarter about the My Garage feature and how we've expanded that internationally, which helps with Fitment. 
We also recently announced a motorcycle parts finder in that business, and it tends to help and be benefited also from a cross-border trade. 
To give you a sense of the scale, we've got hundreds of millions of listings in our parts business. And what I'm excited by is one of the first evolutions that we did was take all of that inventory and make it available on our Motors app, which is a dedicated separate app for vehicle enthusiasts, and now you've got vehicles and parts and accessories in a one-stop shop from that perspective. So you'll continue to hear further updates from us about that category. It's our next big category of focus and one where we're coming into it from a position of strength."

So first, on the friction, the whole idea of bringing commerce and payments together gives us great opportunities to remove friction. 
So on the selling side, people now only have to set up for a single account and get selling, all of their claims are managed in one place, tons of benefits from there. One of the ones that I'm really excited by is that since I worked at eBay the last time starting in 2001, unpaid items have been on this platform forever. And so now we've eliminated it in fixed price virtually. We're doing so in best offer. And so sellers won't have to face that issue and it takes friction out of the platform. 
On the buyers side, it allows us to open up new opportunities for different forms of payments. So clearly, we've already integrated Apple Pay and Google Pay, but we launched a partnership with Afterpay in our Australia business for buy now, pay later. Afterpay is a very strong brand in that market, and that's bringing us new customers. It's already at 10% of our business there. And we're continuing to look at new opportunities for forms of payment for our buyers. 
Secondarily is on the seller financing side. We launched a partnership in the U.K. with ULend and opening up more opportunities for sellers now that we're processing such a large volume of payments through the business. 
So like I said in the call, the way I look at it is the migration is complete, but we're just getting started in terms of the opportunity of what we can do with commerce and payments together in a single flow and single experience."

And I'm excited that we're starting to launch express because that will give our auction sellers the ability to drive some more visibility for them and then to have a tool that they haven't been able to use before. 
In terms of the shipping services, this has been a constant march for us. Last year, we expanded in the U.S. to have USPS, UPS and FedEx in there and did the same thing with Royal Mail and Australia Post to greatly exceed the amount of tracking. On the specific shipping test that's going on now, it's kind of too early to tell. 
What I would say in general is how to think about this, Brian, is I'm trying to get the whole company focused on how do we make things as simple and as easy to do on the platform. So what we're doing with our new seller flows, with computer vision and trading cards is how do we take all the work out of the listing process. We're trying to do the same type of thing with our sellers and the stores product and making it really easy to get that set up on the platform. And shipping is one of those areas where there's an opportunity to take a lot of the friction out. 
So the new partnerships that we've created, the integrated tracking, the smoother returns process is all part of this evolution of just make the whole platform so much easier to use. And so we'll keep you posted on how these tests roll out, but I'm happy with the progress so far."

So on the first one, look, I've been talking since last July about a game-changing level of trust on the platform, and we've been doing that kind of category by category. So the authentication that we've been doing in the luxury categories really takes trust off the table these 2-year warranties that we put in place for Certified Refurbished does the same thing. And eBay actually has a good sized business and industrial business in capital equipment, and allows us to put a whole different level of trust in there. They're a long-time seller and partner on eBay and the capabilities that they will bring to that category will help bring a new level of trust and just help buyers and sellers in that category move forward. So that's what I would say on bid a deal. 
On the C2C, that's really just the lapping of the COVID dynamics that we saw from last year in terms of the number of sellers that came on during that time period and just some of the macro dynamics. What I'd tell you is I'm really happy with the progress and continue to be a huge focus for us is on our C2C selling experience, bringing them on to the platform, making it extremely easy, making that payment sign-up process really simple. And so that's going to continue to be something that we're going to focus on quarter after quarter because as I mentioned in the past, we -- when we talk about high-value buyers, that includes buyers who sell. So by nature, it helps drive them up their buyer cohort curves as well as bringing that unique inventory. So we're going to continue to push forward there.

If you take that and you pair it with the strategy that Jamie has laid out and the momentum that we're going forward with, I think the eBay franchise is pretty misunderstood. And one of the things that we need to do a better job is just really ensuring that the investor community understand a little better. 
And again, your point is well made. The momentum we've shown on the buyback and capital allocation. as you progress through 2021 from the 2 billion to the 5 billion and now the 7 billion is really a sort of a reflection of that in terms of our thought process around balanced and disciplined capital allocation. and getting that balance right between reinvestments in the business to stimulate growth and providing the robust returns to our shareholders."

But it's all about building trust on the platform. I bought a $4,000 OBO on the platform last year, and it was great. I could see a lot of images, but the opportunity to really get in there in 3D and see what a pre-loved product looks like is an interesting opportunity. 
So like I said, it's early, you'll start to see some products that we have using that technology. But I'm what I'm excited by is like the innovation and computer vision, we're using our AI resources and computer vision resources here to do some interesting things that, over time, I think will really change the buying experience on eBay. 
To your question on C2C, it looks pretty similar to historical behaviors and consistent in terms of them coming on to the platform, continuing to list and then turning into buyers. What I'd say is the other thing is that a lot of our business sellers actually started out as C2C sellers. So it's another reason we lean in there. 
I was visiting with a seller up in Seattle, and he started many years ago. He had an extra set of tires sold them on eBay and then just start to sum a couple more things than tires, now several times now runs a huge lug nuts business as a business seller with a warehouse and lots of employees. So that's the other kind of key focus for us on C2C is that's how a lot of our B2C sellers actually got their start in the platform."

Q3 was another strong quarter, driven by our team's relentless focus on sellers and buyers. I'm excited by the positive impact this is having on the underlying health of the business. The changes we are making to the marketplace are improving results today and are also putting us in a better position to deliver sustainable growth. We remain confident in our long-term vision to grow the core, become the seller platform of choice and cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with buyers.
Let me highlight a few achievements from the quarter that brought us one step closer to this vision. Our business delivered better-than-expected revenue and earnings growth on the high end of our guidance. Our strategic playbook continues to improve customer satisfaction and build trust and is leading to faster GMV growth in our focused categories. 
The managed payments migration, which is nearly complete, is helping sellers and buyers by reducing friction, lowering cost and enabling new capabilities. Our advertising business continues to grow faster than marketplace volume, and our product innovation provides sellers new tools to help them scale their eBay businesses.
We are also making great strides in our ESG efforts. Recently, we received approval from the Science Based Targets initiative for our multiyear carbon emission reduction goal. And importantly, we announced that eBay will be 100% carbon neutral this year and will remain so going forward. I'm pleased to report that all key business metrics either met or surpassed our expectations in Q3.
Revenue overperformed growing 10%, driven by acceleration in the payments migration and Promoted Listings growth. We also delivered $0.90 of non-GAAP EPS at the high end of expectations while increasing technology investments. GMV performed in line with expectations globally, declining 12% versus last year and increasing 9% compared to 2019. Excluding transitory macro impacts, we continue to see modestly positive underlying growth in the business.
Global active sellers remained unchanged at 19 million, and total active buyers were 154 million. Over the past year, we have focused on attracting and retaining high-value buyers by innovating in focused categories and targeting enthusiasts with upper funnel marketing. We have also discontinued legacy couponing that's skewed towards low-value buyers. These actions are resulting in a gradual evolution of our buyer base over time. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, high-value buyers are up 6%.
Another ongoing transformation of our marketplace is managed payments, which progressed quickly during the quarter. In Q3, we processed over 90% of on-platform GMV and remain on track to finish by the end of this year. I'm thrilled that we are close to migrating all of our global sellers to a next-gen product experience. While we are close to completing the transition, we are only at the beginning of realizing our full payments potential. Owning the entire seller and buyer journey unlocks opportunities to remove friction, improve trust and provide new capabilities to sellers and buyers. We are already starting down this path, and here are a few examples.
Last quarter, we effectively eliminated unpaid items on fixed-price transactions and have continued to reduce this issue for best offers. In the U.K., we are paying many sellers as quickly as next business day after buyer payment is confirmed. Based on community feedback, we reduced another pain point for trusted sellers by increasing protection against fraudulent returns by requiring photos and providing return shipping credits.
In addition, we continue to improve our stores experience to make eBay the seller platform of choice. We've been increasing our traffic to stores and providing more CRM capabilities to make managing their businesses on eBay easier than ever. Sellers are leveraging these new features to drive repeat purchases. For example, in only 6 months since launch, more than 2.5 million buyers have completed a repeat purchase from a store using our new seller-funded coupon. To further build sellers brands, we are testing video integration on high-traffic pages to help them tell their unique and compelling stories to enthusiast buyers.
Our advertising revenue continues to outpace volume due to Promoted Listings, which drove over $207 million in revenue in Q3, up 9%. We also tested 3 new Promoted Listings products and are starting to offer these features to more sellers.
In September, we opened up Promoted Listings Express to more sellers in the U.S., U.K., Germany and Australia. This feature allows sellers to boost visibility of auction listing for a onetime fee regardless of whether the item is sold. Early adopters have seen substantial growth in impressions and clicks.
Last month, we invited eligible sellers to try Promoted Listings Advanced, enabling them to create campaigns on a cost-per-click basis with more budget control. In parallel, we launched a suite of tools to create campaigns, monitor performance and optimize returns. We are also providing training and webinars to drive trial and adoption. During Q3, we explored ways to syndicate ads off eBay through external Promoted Listings.
Through the eBay partner network, we are testing tools and incentives for affiliates to drive enthusiast buyers to existing promoted listing sellers. We are also experimenting with other forms of seller-funded marketing across various channels. Our new advertising products are in the early days, and we are excited about their long-term potential.
Moving to our focus categories. I'm pleased with the pace of innovation and the positive reaction from our sellers and buyers. Volume from these categories continues to outperform the rest of the marketplace, and we are increasing customer satisfaction by improving trust. As you may recall, when we exited last quarter, we had applied our playbook to approximately 10% of global GMV. We remain on track to expand that to roughly 20% by the end of the year.
Let me walk you through several examples. Our sneakers business in the U.S. continues to grow at healthy double-digit rates. During Q3, we launched authentication in Germany, added 30 more brands to our catalog and improved SEO performance for top sneaker brands. We also leaned further into upper funnel marketing and sponsored key industry events to strengthen our reputation with enthusiasts.
Starting tomorrow, we will be trialing a new 3D image capability on select sneaker listings. Leveraging AI and machine learning, the experience will allow buyers to interact with a detailed 360-degree view of the actual item they are buying. We're excited about the potential of this new technology, particularly the ability to reinforce buyer confidence at the point of purchase.
Moving to luxury watches. This category is also growing at strong double-digit rates in the U.S. Buyers are finding more inventory on eBay than other marketplaces as many brands have decreased production, and preowned supply is limited on other platforms.
Since launching authentication in luxury handbags, growth has accelerated in this category and was positive in Q3, outperforming the total U.S. site by double digits. We are seeing the same high customer satisfaction as other authenticated categories.
As I've mentioned in the past, part of our strategy is to drive enthusiasts to new trusted experiences and then leverage those buyers across our vast supply in other categories. The average buyer who purchases sneakers and luxury watches, spends approximately $2,000 and $8,000, respectively, in other categories. We are seeing the exact same behavior in our latest focus category.
Buyers of authenticated handbags are spending over $5,000 outside of handbags. This cross-category benefit for sellers and buyers is a unique advantage for eBay. One of the reasons our growth has improved in luxury categories is the improvement in buyer and seller trust. We recently celebrated the 1-year anniversary of Authenticity Guarantee, having now processed over 1.4 million items across multiple categories. Customer satisfaction has consistently exceeded 90%, and we are operating in 5 countries with a mix of in-house and third-party resources.
Another focus category that is driving growth in the U.S. is trading cards, which is growing significantly faster than the total marketplace. In late July, we launched new features, including price guides and collections, which allow trading card enthusiasts to view, manage and track the value of their portfolios. To date, close to 4 million cards have been added to customer collections. 
In addition, close to 250,000 buyers have used eBay's newly launched Price Guide to visualize the changing value of their favorite trading cards. These features cater to the needs of high-value enthusiasts and are increasing engagement and trust in eBay.
The next focus category we're applying the innovation playbook to is motors, parts and accessories. Among the changes we are making is to take our entire parts inventory and add it to the eBay Motors app, creating a one-stop shop for vehicles and parts enthusiasts. We are excited by the potential of bringing together one of the world's largest vehicle selections with hundreds of millions of parts in one customized experience. We're exploring further changes to parts and accessories that leverage our strong market position to capture more untapped growth.
ESG remains critical to our business health and to our customers, and I'm pleased to announce that we have reached some significant milestones in our journey toward establishing eBay as the leading sustainability company in e-commerce.
Just 2 weeks ago, we announced that our emission reduction goals were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. We will reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 90% by 2030. This is the most ambitious designation available and aligned with the Paris agreement.
Additionally, we will reduce value chain emissions from downstream transportation by 20% in the same time frame. To reduce emissions from good shift using our platform, we will partner with our logistics providers to encourage low-carbon alternatives.
I'm also proud that eBay will be carbon neutral for our offices and data centers in 2021. We expect to maintain this going forward as we continue efforts to reduce our overall carbon footprint. At eBay, one of our core values is to be for everyone. As part of this focus, supporting our seller community is critically important.
Earlier this month, we issued a new report on equitable entrepreneurship, which revealed how selling on eBay helped women during the pandemic. We found that 82% of women who are new to eBay or increased their selling did so because of job loss, reduction of income, illness, loss of child care or some other hardship. This vast majority of women surveyed says the ability to sell on eBay was a benefit during the pandemic, citing the need to earn additional income for themselves or drive revenue for their businesses. I'm proud that our platform can provide flexibility and opportunity to so many during tough times so that they can earn extra income through selling in our marketplace.
I'm also inspired by the continuous generosity of sellers and buyers on eBay. During Q3, approximately $35 million was raised through eBay for Charity, up 11%. Additionally, thousands of global employees helped select small businesses to receive grants totaling $3 million from the eBay Foundation. These grants are focused on serving underrepresented entrepreneurs and are used to provide training, coaching and mentorship needed to help their businesses thrive.
In closing, as I mentioned at the start of the call, Q3 was yet another strong quarter. We continue to make progress on our multiyear journey, and it's clear that our strategy is working. Enthusiasts are responding to innovation in our focus categories and are increasingly putting their trust in eBay. Managed payments is on track to complete the migration this year and is driving friction out of the experience while opening up new capabilities for sellers and buyers.
Our advertising business is innovating by providing a portfolio of tools our sellers can leverage to build and grow their businesses on eBay. And we're accomplishing all of this while setting and achieving ambitious climate goals and providing a platform where economic opportunity is available to all.
I want to thank our passionate employees who have tirelessly worked to bring our vision and purpose to life. Their dedication to serving sellers and buyers is inspiring. Their relentless execution is driving innovation and making eBay a better marketplace, and I couldn't be prouder to lead this team.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you."

I'll begin with our Q3 financial highlights on Slide 4 of our presentation. We delivered another strong quarter. Our results met or exceeded expectations across all key metrics, while our year-over",2280,"Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with our Q3 financial highlights on Slide 4 of our presentation. We delivered another strong quarter. Our results met or exceeded expectations across all key metrics, while our year-over-year comparisons reflect the extraordinary growth we experienced last year as a result of the pandemic. These results were underpinned by continued execution against our strategic pillars, including contributions from payments, Promoted Listings and focus categories.
Revenue grew 10% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. The transaction revenue grew by double digits for the sixth consecutive quarter, primarily due to contributions from managed payments.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.90 per share, and our operating margin was 31.7%. We generated $502 million of free cash flow and returned approximately $2.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends during Q3. Given the underlying growth in our business and strong free cash flow generation, I'm pleased to announce we've raised our share buyback target for 2021 from $5 billion to $7 billion.
Our pending portfolio transactions remain on track to close within previously communicated time lines. We anticipate the sale of Adevinta shares to Permira will close during Q4, while the Korea deal, which will close early next year or potentially by the end of 2021.
Turning to active buyers on Slide 5. We exited Q3 with 154 million active buyers on a trailing 12-month basis, representing a 5% decrease year-over-year. This decline was primarily driven by low-value buyers, a group that makes up more than half of our buyer base but only 5% of GMV. As Jamie mentioned, this ongoing trend is a result of our strategy to prioritize attracting and retaining high-value buyers. We are confident in this approach, but we recognize the reduction in low-value buyers could pressure our rolling 12-month active buyer count in the coming quarters. Compared with Q3 of 2019, low-value buyers are down 7%, while high-value buyers were up 6%.
Moving to GMV on Slide 6. In Q3, we delivered $19.5 billion of GMV, down 10% year-over-year on a spot basis and down 12% on an FX-neutral basis, in line with our expectations. The macro benefits to our business from mobility were significantly diminished in Q3 as restrictions faded across the globe, where we continue to see modestly positive underlying growth in our business. Compared with Q3 of 2019, GMV grew 9% on an FX-neutral basis. Consistent with prior quarters, our performance by market varied based on a number of factors, including relative mobility and country-specific macroeconomic trends.
Internationally, GMV was roughly flat versus Q3 of 2019 on an FX-neutral basis. A number of factors influenced the growth differential between the U.S. and our international markets during the quarter. Mobility is back to pre-COVID levels in many of our largest international markets, diminishing the volume tailwinds we benefited from in prior quarters. 
Changing consumer behavior, including an uptick in leisure activities and travel, also may have impacted e-commerce growth internationally. Additionally, category mix varies in our international markets, which have lower exposure to certain fast-growing verticals like collectibles, but higher concentration of items from cross-border trade that are more difficult to source amid the ongoing supply chain disruptions.
Finally, our focus category rollouts are more nascent in our international markets. However, as our innovation playbook expands to more categories and countries, we are confident our international growth trajectory will improve.
In the U.S., GMV grew 22% versus Q3 of 2019. Growth in our domestic marketplace was driven by strong execution against our strategic pillars, more product rollouts within focus categories and steady growth within e-commerce.
Residential mobility improved in the U.S. but continues to try the European markets, while leisure activities and travel increased in line with normal seasonal trends. Other external factors may be benefiting our U.S. business relative to international markets, including the lingering impact of government stimulus and scarcity benefits and supply chain disruptions. The precise impact of these effects is unclear, but they are likely a net positive contributor to U.S. growth in the near term. In aggregate, there are numerous puts and takes between regions, but we remain encouraged by the modestly positive underlying growth in our business.
Turning to revenue on Slide 7. Net revenue for Q3 was $2.5 billion, up 10% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis and 11% on a spot basis. We delivered $2.4 billion of transaction revenue, also up 11% on an FX-neutral basis. Growth was primarily driven by managed payments, which contributed roughly 20 points of incremental revenue growth during the third quarter. The payments ramp drove an 80 basis point sequential increase in our take rate, which surpassed 12% in quarter 3.
Moving forward, we expect our sequential take rate increases to moderate as the managed payments rollout is nearly complete.
Within our advertising business, Promoted Listings grew 9% year-over-year, outpacing volume by 21 points. Early adopters of the new Promoted Listing products are seeing significant increases in performance, giving us confidence in the long-term potential for advertising revenue.
Marketing services and other revenue declined 7% year-over-year to $151 million driven by the impact of sold item declines and shipping programs and headwinds within third-party advertising. We continue to purposely reduce third-party advertising in favor of Promoted Listings, which delivers superior performance and offer a better experience for both sellers and buyers.
Moving to expenses on Slide 8. In Q3, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31.7%. This represents the 2.7 point year-over-year decrease primarily driven by lower volume. Our cost of revenue has scaled in line with payments growth due to variable processing costs. This dynamic has pressured gross margins during our transition to managed payments. However, once the transition is complete, we expect gross margins to be more stable. Moreover, the incremental revenue from payments drive significant leverage in our fixed expenses, most notably sales and marketing and G&A.
Sales and marketing fell by nearly 4 points as a percentage of revenue year-over-year in Q3. In addition to leverage from payments revenue, sales and marketing was lower due to reduction in coupons and rewards programs that were previously targeted towards low-value buyers.
Product development increased 21% year-over-year as we continue to accelerate product innovation and support our longer-term strategic initiatives within payments, advertising and focus categories. Transaction losses rose as a percentage of revenue by nearly 2 points versus last year due to higher consumer protection losses from the payments transition and the lapping of onetime benefits in the prior year, which were partially offset by the benefits of fee netting.
Turning to EPS on Slide 9. We delivered $0.90 of non-GAAP EPS in Q3, up 9% year-over-year as ramping contributions from payments and the net benefit of share repurchases more than offset the lapping of COVID-driven volumes a year ago.
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.43, roughly 50% lower than last year. The delta was primarily driven by a fair value adjustment on our Adevinta shares, partly offset by gains from other investments.
Switching to free cash flow on Slide 10. We delivered another strong quarter of cash generation in Q3 with $502 million of free cash flow, a 4% decline year-over-year. The decline was driven by the timing of working capital and CapEx spend, partly offset by operational efficiencies and the timing of 2020 cash taxes.
As a reminder, the managed payments transition has yielded meaningful working capital benefits. Through 3 quarters of 2021, this benefit amounted to approximately $300 million.
Moving to capital allocation on Slide 11. We ended the quarter with cash and nonequity investments of $5.1 billion and gross debt of $9.1 billion. During the third quarter, we returned approximately $2.4 billion to our shareholders through stock repurchase and dividends. We repurchased approximately 31 million shares to $2.3 billion at an average share price of $72.52. 
We also paid a quarterly dividend of $116 million in September. Given our fortress balance sheet and strong underlying free cash flow, we are updating our share buyback plan for 2021 from $5 billion to $7 billion, which implies approximately $3 billion of repurchases during the fourth quarter.
Overall, our capital allocation objectives remain unchanged. We'll preserve financial flexibility to execute on strategy and drive long-term value creation. We aim to drive organic growth in our business, and we'll look for opportunities to supplement that growth with disciplined acquisitions and investments. We will optimize our financial flexibility, access to debt and cost of capital, and we'll continue to deliver meaningful returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Moving to investments on Slide 12. As a reminder, we received 540 million shares in Adevinta from our Classifieds sale, which closed during June of this year, representing an equity ownership stake of approximately 44%. As a regulatory condition of the Classifieds sale, we committed to reduce our ownership stake in Adevinta to 33% or less over the 18 months following the close of the deal. In July, we agreed to sell approximately 135 million shares to Permira for roughly $2.4 billion. We believe the Permira share sale remains on track to close during Q4, and the 405 million shares that we would retain were worth close to $7 billion at the end of September.
Turning to Adyen. The warrants we acquired in connection with our strategic partnership during the second quarter of 2018 were valued at $1.4 billion at the end of Q3, an increase of over $300 million quarter-over-quarter. You will find more information on the Adyen warrant in our 10-Q. Our stake in Kakao Bank has appreciated in value following the company's IPO in August. At the end of Q3, our investment was worth approximately $800 million.
Finally, in June, we announced plans to sell over 80% of our Korea business to E-mart for approximately $3 billion. Upon deal close, we will retain an interest of just under 20% of eBay Korea, which carried an implied value of roughly $800 million at the time of the announcement. We believe the deal remains on track to close by early 2022 with a possibility of closing before the year end. We remain excited about our portfolio of global investments, the potential optionality they provide and the significant value they collectively represent for eBay shareholders.
Turning to guidance on Slide 13. For the fourth quarter, we are projecting revenue between $2.57 billion and $2.62 billion, representing growth of 3% to 5% on an FX-neutral basis and approximately 4% to 6% on a spot basis.
Our take rate has risen notably in recent quarters due to contributions from payments and advertising. Although we expect advertising to continue growing faster than volume, we expect the impact from payments on our take rate to moderate as we are nearing completion of our managed payments transition.
We are raising our 2021 full year outlook for payments revenue from $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Our revenue guidance implies GMV is down low teens on an FX-neutral basis versus last year and up mid- to high single digits compared to Q4 of 2019. Our GMV guidance assumes steady execution against our strategic pillars and continued innovation within focused categories. Our outlook also assumes minimal benefits from macro factors like mobility, stimulus and supply chain impacts. However, we note the macro environment remains dynamic and difficult to predict, with varied impacts from country to country.
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.97 to $1.01 per share in Q4, representing a 14% to 19% year-over-year growth. We plan to continue investing in product and technology to deliver better category experiences and improved customer satisfaction. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to between 18% and 19% due to recent outperformance of our U.S. business. We expect our GAAP EPS in the range of $0.72 to $0.76 per share in Q4.
In closing, we delivered strong results in Q3 that met or exceeded the expectations across all key metrics. We continue to execute our strategic vision and grow our core marketplace while maintaining the balance and discipline that will enable us to generate tremendous value for our shareholders for years to come. Managed payments is on track to deliver $2 billion in revenue this year. and our transition is on track for completion by year-end. However, we believe our payments journey is just beginning as this milestone unlocks new opportunities to reduce friction in the marketplace and provide additional financial services.
Advertising revenue continues to outpace volume, the sellers increasingly leverage our expanded product portfolio to amplify the exposure of their listings. We observed impressive momentum with our focus categories, which are meaningfully outpacing overall volume growth. We are confident we can continue expanding this innovation playbook to more categories and countries in the quarters ahead.
Our balanced approach to capital allocation has enabled us to reinvest in our business, generating consistently strong free cash flow and deliver attractive returns for shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
As proud as I am of our numerous business accomplishments, what makes them even more impactful to me is knowing we are achieving these milestones while building sustainable, inclusive and circular economy platform for all. Once again, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our teams across eBay for their incredible work over the last quarter and their support for our amazing sellers and buyers in the eBay community.
One final note, we are in the midst of a multiyear journey to deliver a tech-led reimagination of eBay. As the impact from macro factors stabilizes, we are reviewing our internal goals for 2022 and beyond. We anticipate showing our longer-term goals and aspirations at an investor event early next year.
With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Operator, over to you."

So if you look at what we're doing in watches and sneakers or this quarter, we announced we're authenticating handbags over $500, it is catering to both. One of the great benefits of eBay is the cross-category nature of shopping. So if we acquire a buyer into a handbag, who buys a handbag over $500, they actually end up spending $5,000 in other categories outside of handbags on the site.
So when we think about acquisition, it's not just acquiring it for that category, it's acquiring it more broadly for eBay. That's one of our significant benefits. Excited because we've expanded categories this quarter. We brought our sneakers authentication program to Germany. We brought watches to the U.K. business, and we launched handbags in the U.S. in terms of that product.
From Certified Refurbished, we added new brands, Samsung, KitchenAid, Dyson and expanded number of products there, and that's exciting coming into holiday.
On your question on marketing, we've really shifted our marketing. I think traditionally, we've been a mostly lower funnel with some broad-based campaigns on upper funnel really driving into how do we acquire high-value buyers and high-value enthusiasts in specific verticals. So what that means is a whole lot more of upper-funnel marketing, partnerships, leaning in with social media influencers in certain categories and basically going much more broad with our marketing plans to find those buyers where they are.
And I guess the last thing I'd say is we're really focused on the first 90-day experience on eBay. Many times in my career, I've done this, where you really get focused on how do you introduce them to the brand, bring them up the life cycle, make sure that they turn into the high-value buyers that we want to do, and that's going to be a continued focus for us over the coming quarters."

And then, Steve, maybe with respect to the Q4 outlook, just looking at the sequential ramp versus typical seasonality, it's certainly a little light of historical patterns even when eBay could be a net beneficiary from supply chain issues. I know you don't like factoring that into the outlook, but maybe some additional color there would be helpful."
27862,1684584211,2414918,"eBay Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Yes. So thanks for the question, Colin.

So thanks for the question, Colin. So we do talk a lot about the vertical expansion and focus category work that we're doing, and we're excited for what's happening there. if you actually step back and look at it, the vast majority of our resources are actually going to site-wide initiatives across the board. And I'd point to a couple.
One is, obviously, our ad business and a lot of investment there across the board, especially with the 3 new products that were at the beginning of launching. Obviously, payments, huge initiative. But other areas that we haven't talked a lot about are like eBay stores. So working on a next-gen experience in eBay stores, incorporating video, so allowing sellers to kind of tell their story from that perspective. So there are more CRM tool capabilities so that sellers can be more involved in how we bring buyers back to the platform and drive that repeat business.
So the stat I just mentioned earlier about we launched it 6 months ago, but now sellers are funding the coupons to drive buyers back to the site from past buyers or interested buyers, and that's a huge benefit for sellers and a huge benefit for eBay because we're involving them and driving them and already 2.5 million buyers have used that in that time period.
And so we're also testing a new selling experience. If you're on the site, you'll see that there's a beta out there of a new way to sell. So most of the -- vast majority of investments are going to horizontal. But what I like is it's a complement because some of those horizontal lean into some of the vertical work that we're doing. In the vertical work and focused categories, some of the things that we're building for a given category we're able to use in a number of categories across the site. So the 2 also play together well. 
Steve, I'll let you take the second part of the question."

Thank you, Jamie. Colin, I will say we're expecting a steady contribution from the strategic initiatives that Jamie has continued to lay out with the innovation that we're driving across the platform, not only in the focus categories, but also the momentum around sort of payments and ads as we've gone forward.
On a year-over-2 basis, I mean, if you think about and stand back year-over-year, we're obviously lapping the pandemic. On a year-over-2 basis, we're seeing mid- to high single-digit growth compared to Q4 2019.
I think there's a few puts and takes there, Colin. So first of all, our holiday perspective around Q4 is embedded in the guide. From a headwind perspective, in the prepared comments we had, we talked about supply chain pressure for cross-border trade that we see on one side. But in terms of a tailwind, obviously, eBay is well known for unique and scarce items, which we do expect to support through the holiday period.
So a few puts and takes, but overall, I'm pleased there'll, we believe, will be continued modestly positive underlying growth on the platform as a result of the initiatives that we're driving forward."

And then a second question, I realize this might be a little bit early, but how should we think about the buybacks for next year? It feels like you have plenty of capacity, but wondering if there is a formula you're thinking about to do it in a more programmatic way after the $7 billion this year."

So since we launched this product 5 years ago, it's really on",299,"Yes. So on the new Promoted Listings offerings, let me just kind of explain this in detail. So the first one, which is Express is really to give us a Promoted Listings product against auctions. So since we launched this product 5 years ago, it's really only applied to fixed price. And so this opens up, a smaller format of the site, a format that has not been open to advertising before. Promoted Listings Express is a CPC-based product, gives sellers the opportunity to drive more velocity, goes after a different type of marketing budget for that perspective and gives us the opportunity to work with a secondary and supplementary advertising format.
And the third is off-eBay advertising. And that's using the vast marketing reach that eBay does today, partnering with our sellers to drive advertising as part of that off-eBay outreach to bring existing buyers and new buyers back to the platform. 
What I would say for you is that it's early days on these 3 products. If you look back, we started our ad business 5 years ago, and we've grown to $1 billion now over 5 years. And so we're at the point now where we're testing, we're learning. We've got invited sellers into the program. And just like it took us time to build up the CPA-based program, I think it will take us time here to build up the advertising program.
In terms of penetration, we still have a lot of opportunity left, both in terms of the sellers and listings. I believe the last that we shared was that only $400 million of the listings have advertising associated with them. So there's a lot of opportunity for additional penetration.
I'll let Steve take the second question about how we're thinking about the future."

We haven't put the guidance out there, but I'll give a little bit of color in terms of where we are.
So as we've previously said, reinvestments in the business is our first priority, whether that's built by our partner. But having said that, beyond that, any excess cash that we do have, it continues to drive returns. We'll continue with a disciplined return of capital to shareholders. And this is no different to the past. We've had a strong and consistent history of actually those capital returns. And in 2021, that's been no exception. So think about it as going from $2 billion at the start of the year, lifting that to $5 billion, and most recently on this call, talking about $7 billion.
So I think when I stand back and think about eBay as a whole, the balance that we have and the benefits of the franchise is we often have the ability to do both in terms of reinvesting in the business and doing capital returns to our shareholders. So you should expect that philosophy as we go forward."

So it seems like a big reason why your U.S. GMV is way above 3Q '19.

So what's holding back the same type of uptick for international? Is it structural? Or is it just a timing thing that we should see a ramp up after you kind of roll those out after starting in the U.S.?
And then the second question is on how big is eBay Motors these days? I know it's a big category historically. And just can you talk about a little bit about the opportunity there in terms of making that one focus category and merging the parts and the motors?"

Clearly, different",559,"Yes. So let me start with the U.S. versus international. First off, let me say, I'm really pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the overall business. We're growing at 9% year-over-2-year basis based on the strategic vision we have. Clearly, different dynamics across the market.
So in Q3, our international business was impacted by mobility returning to really pre-COVID level, coupled with an unprecedented snapback in travel and leisure activities in Europe. In addition, as Steve mentioned a little bit earlier, our international cross-border trade sellers were also pressured by supply chain disruptions. That tends to be more in our international segment from a cross-border perspective than in our U.S. segment.
On the other hand, in the U.S., we've seen strong growth driven by momentum in our core business. To your question on the focus categories, it's not a structural change. We actually think the work we're doing applies across the whole globe. It's really a timing thing. So in most of these areas, we actually roll them out in the U.S., get them perfected here and then expand them internationally.
So for example, sneakers is just now launching this quarter in Germany. We launched watches in the U.S. We just started that expansion in the U.K. this quarter. Handbags, we just launched in the U.S. and that hasn't expanded yet. So it's really a timing thing, but we think the playbook that we have is relevant in every single market that we have. Probably with the exception of trading cards and collectibles, that's just so much stronger in the U.S. than it is internationally. But that's a huge U.S. benefit and a lot of the pieces that we're doing there are a key focus for that. But overall, I feel great about the health of the business and our ability to expand those focus categories internationally.
On your second question on P&A, we haven't disclosed the size of the business, but I will say that if you just step back and look at the market, we're in a leading position in P&A, especially in U.K. and in Germany. It's a very strong category and a very strong franchise there. And it's a key part of our path that we talked about last quarter of going from 10% of the site to 20% of the site. 
It's a strong category for eBay because of the vastness of parts and accessories that we have. We actually do a fairly good job with Fitment. I talked last quarter about the My Garage feature and how we've expanded that internationally, which helps with Fitment. We also recently announced a motorcycle parts finder in that business, and it tends to help and be benefited also from a cross-border trade.
To give you a sense of the scale, we've got hundreds of millions of listings in our parts business. And what I'm excited by is one of the first evolutions that we did was take all of that inventory and make it available on our Motors app, which is a dedicated separate app for vehicle enthusiasts, and now you've got vehicles and parts and accessories in a one-stop shop from that perspective. So you'll continue to hear further updates from us about that category. It's our next big category of focus and one where we're coming into it from a position of strength."

So first, on the friction, the whole idea of bringing commerce and payments together gives us great opportunities to remove friction. So on the selling side, people now only have to set up for a single account and get selling, all of their claims are managed in one place, tons of benefits from there. 
One of the ones that I'm really excited by is that since I worked at eBay the last time starting in 2001, unpaid items have been on this platform forever. And so now we've eliminated it and fixed price virtually. We're doing so in best offer. And so sellers won't have to face that issue and it takes friction out of the platform.
On the buyers side, it allows us to open up new opportunities for different forms of payments. So clearly, we've already integrated Apple Pay and Google Pay, but we launched a partnership with Afterpay in our Australia business for buy now, pay later. Afterpay is a very strong brand in that market, and that's bringing us new customers. It's already at 10% of our business there. And we're continuing to look at new opportunities for forms of payment for our buyers.
Secondarily is on the seller financing side. We launched a partnership in the U.K. with YouLend and opening up more opportunities for sellers now that we're processing such a large volume of payments through the business.
So like I said in the call, the way I look at it is the migration is complete, but we're just getting started in terms of the opportunity of what we can do with commerce and payments together in a single flow and single experience."

And I'm excited that we're starting to launch express because that will give our auction sellers the ability to drive some more visibility for them and then to have a tool that they haven't been able to use before.
In terms of the shipping services, this has been a constant march for us. Last year, we expanded in the U.S. to have USPS, UPS and FedEx in there and did the same thing with Royal Mail and Australia Post to greatly exceed the amount of tracking. On the specific shipping test that's going on now, it's kind of too early to tell.
What I would say in general is how to think about this, Brian, is I'm trying to get the whole company focused on how do we make things as simple and as easy to do on the platform. So what we're doing with our new seller flows, with computer vision and trading cards is how do we take all the work out of the listing process. We're trying to do the same type of thing with our sellers and the stores product and making it really easy to get that set up on the platform. And shipping is one of those areas where there's an opportunity to take a lot of the friction out.
So the new partnerships that we've created, the integrated tracking, the smoother returns process is all part of this evolution of just make the whole platform so much easier to use. And so we'll keep you posted on how these tests roll out, but I'm happy with the progress so far."

So on the first one, look, I've been talking since last July about a game-changing level of trust on the platform, and we've been doing that kind of category by category. So the authentication that we've been doing in the luxury categories really takes trust off the table these 2-year warranties that we put in place for Certified Refurbished does the same thing. 
And eBay actually has a good sized business and industrial business in capital equipment, and bidadoo allows us to put a whole different level of trust in there. They're a long-time seller and partner on eBay and the capabilities that they will bring to that category will help bring a new level of trust and just help buyers and sellers in that category move forward. So that's what I would say on bidadoo.
On the C2C, that's really just the lapping of the COVID dynamics that we saw from last year in terms of the number of sellers that came on during that time period and just some of the macro dynamics. What I'd tell you is I'm really happy with the progress and continue to be a huge focus for us is on our C2C selling experience, bringing them on to the platform, making it extremely easy, making that payment sign-up process really simple. And so that's going to continue to be something that we're going to focus on quarter after quarter because as I mentioned in the past, we -- when we talk about high-value buyers, that includes buyers who sell. So by nature, it helps drive them up their buyer cohort curves as well as by bringing that unique inventory. So we're going to continue to push forward there.

If you take that and you pair it with the strategy that Jamie has laid out and the momentum that we're going forward with, I think the eBay franchise kind of is pretty misunderstood. And one of the things that we need to do a better job is just really ensuring that the investor community understand a little better.
And again, your point is well made. The momentum we've shown on the buyback and capital allocation, as you progress through 2021 from the $2 billion to the $5 billion and now the $7 billion is really a sort of a reflection of that in terms of our thought process around balanced and disciplined capital allocation.

But the idea is we want buyers to be able to see in real detail the actual item that they're going to be buying. And so you're going to see us launching a couple of sneakers in the coming weeks using this. And it's a very early pilot that we're doing with select sellers.
But it's all about building trust on the platform. I bought a $4,000 Oboe on the platform last year, and it was great. I could see a lot of images, but the opportunity to really get in there in 3D and see what a pre-loved product looks like is an interesting opportunity.
So like I said, it's early, you'll start to see some products that we have using that technology. But what I'm excited by is like the innovation and computer vision, we're using our AI resources and computer vision resources here to do some interesting things that, over time, I think will really change the buying experience on eBay.
To your question on C2C, it looks pretty similar to historical behaviors and consistent in terms of them coming on to the platform, continuing to list and then turning into buyers. What I'd say is the other thing is that a lot of our business sellers actually started out as C2C sellers. So it's another reason we lean in there.
I was visiting with a seller up in Seattle, and he started many years ago. He had an extra set of tires, sold them on eBay and then just started to sell a couple more things than tires, now pivoted several times now runs a huge lug nuts business as a business seller with a warehouse and lots of employees. So that's the other kind of key focus for us on C2C is that's how a lot of our B2C sellers actually got their start in the platform."

What are you hoping? Were probably hoping to solve for your sellers with that? And if you could add some color on how significant you think that opportunity could be relative to the $1 billion run rate that you're approaching for the on-site Promoted Listings business?
And then just second for Steve, to what extent, I guess, put simply, will you go to exit low-value buyers? You said you expect the metric to remain under pressure, and the strategy certainly seems sound. But is your goal here to ultimately exit all of those low-value buyers? I'm just hoping you can add some context for the scope of the strategy."

So an affiliate can actually come on to the platform and be an affiliate. But the two definitely work hand-in-hand together. The whole vision there is really connecting enthusiasts to sellers. So being out on the platforms where those enthusiasts are and letting our sellers partake in that advertising by putting really interesting items in front of those enthusiasts of driving that marketing because eBay has been doing this marketing, and when we do it in cooperation with our sellers, it gives us a really broad reach.
For sellers, it gives them another tool as well to take all the great inventory that they have on eBay and put it out in front of sellers in various communities, in different places in search, et cetera, to really drive that traffic to their business on eBay.
I'll let Steve take the second one, and maybe I'll add on a bit."

And I think we're constantly thinking about acquisition of buyers and growth on the platform. And really, it's about really changing our strategy and our focus.
And I sort of just want to reiterate about the value that those buyers bring. So if I think about our top 20 high-value buyers or 20% of our buyers who deliver 75% of our GMV, and those buyers are making 6 different purchases 6 different times a year and over $800 and that buys itself, whereas the low-value buyers were about 50% of our buyers who generate about 5% of our GMV. 
So you can obviously see why we're focused on that strategy as we continue to evolve the platform, focused on the enthusiasts, focused on cross-category selling, but it's very, very important that we continue to have a pipeline as we evolve the business and grow it going forward."
