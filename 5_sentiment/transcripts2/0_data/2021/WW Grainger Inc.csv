I'm excited that our new CFO, Dee Merriwether is here with me. Dee brings a wealth of financial and operational expertise and a deep understanding of Grainger's business that will serve us well. She has been with Grainger for 8 years in finance, pricing and sales leadership roles. It's great to have her as our new CFO. 
For the call today, I'd like to provide an overview of 2020, highlighting accomplishments and challenges. Clearly, much of the year has been shaped by epidemic, but I'll also highlight our progress on key strategic initiatives. Then I'll turn it over to Dee to review the details of our fourth quarter results. I'll close by discussing how we will resegment the business to more closely reflect how we think about the company, and we'll also touch on our high level opportunities and priorities for both the high-touch and endless assortment businesses. 
2020 was obviously one of the most challenging and intense years in history. Through it all, we demonstrated agility, resilience and a steadfast focus on supporting our customers and team members. At the start of the pandemic, we laid out 3 basic priorities. To serve our customers well, support our team members and ensure we remain strong financially. I can confidently say we've been able to accomplish all 3, and I'm proud of how the team has continued to execute on our purpose to keep the world working by living our principles every day. 
Over the last year, we persevered through the pandemic while continuing to deliver an exceptional customer experience. We've deepened relationships with existing customers and develop new relationships, many of which have returned from multiple purchases. We helped our customers secure product, manage their inventory and solve their problems as we further embed keep stock and our other solutions in their facilities. 
Grainger was sometimes the only vendor our customers allowed on their sites to support their operations. A testament to our deep customer relationships. Another priority was to support our team members. We operated with the perspective that the pandemic would be challenging and longer in duration than we wanted, but that it would eventually end. As such, we maintained a stable workforce, deploy personnel to safely and effectively serve customers and supported team members to ensure their safety and well-being. The pandemic is first and foremost, a humanitarian crisis and supporting our team members has remained a huge priority. 
Finally, we have remained very strong financially, generating over $1.1 billion in operating cash flow in this difficult year. As it became clear that our business model will be resilient throughout the pandemic, we reverted from a temporary focus on cash preservation to our longer-term strategic priority of growing the business profitably. The Grainger team has been active in serving our communities through this time of need. We have great team members who value giving back to others. As a company, we provided monetary and product donations to organizations like the Red Cross and the Children's First Fund to support the pandemic response.  
Key leadership challenge this year was balancing our pandemic response while continuing to build the company for the future. Throughout, we remain focused on executing against our strategic initiatives. Within our high-touch solutions model, we improve the way customers find the products they need. We know this is core to our growth. 
In 2020, we launched our product information management system, which provides the foundation for our merchandising efforts. We now have over $2.8 billion of our product assortment remerchandised, $1.6 billion completed in 2020 alone. We also made enhancements to our search functionality and mobile app, resulting in a better user experience. We added features like search by image, where you can take a picture of the product you're looking for and get accurate matches to relevant items quickly and easily. 
We took a significant step forward with our marketing capabilities in 2020. We brought more capabilities in-house to develop the competitive advantage of industry-specific knowledge. These efforts helped us gain share and increase customer acquisition with the Grainger brand. We developed new capabilities to support on-site inventory management, including vending solutions and technology, allowing us to remotely upgrade or alter installations to better serve customers during the pandemic. 
We also opened a new distribution center in Louisville earlier this year, now our largest facility with the capacity to stock 700,000 products in a strategic geographic location. We leveraged the building to test product expansion on a set of new categories with very strong results.  
We also made strong progress with our endless assortment businesses. Zoro continued to expand its product portfolio, adding 2.5 million items in 2020 to bring the total SKUs to over $6 million. Zoro also improved its marketing capabilities, resulting in improved ROI and higher customer repeat rates. They are leveraging the Monotaro playbook to improve the fundamental growth and profitability of the business. Monotaro continued its exceptional growth and profitability performance. All in all, a great year for the assortment team. 
Now before I review our 2020 results, I think it's helpful to step back and take a look at the impact that pandemic has had on our operating performance. From a revenue perspective, we started to see a shift to pandemic-related products starting in mid-February of last year. In late March, as pandemic product demand surged, we saw a significant decline in other non pandemic product as lockdowns took hold. Since that point, we have seen continued strong sales of pandemic products, which has ebbed and flowed based on the virus, including another surge in the fourth quarter, which mirrored the increase in case counts. 
Nonpandemic products are slowly coming back and while not yet at pre pandemic levels, they have improved quite a bit from APR Lowe's. We expect the pandemic to continue to impact revenue through at least the first half of 2021 and and then start to moderate as vaccinations take hold. Steve will detail our forward-looking thoughts in a bit. 
The pandemic has also had a big impact on gross profit, driven by 2 main factors. First, we were impacted by product and customer mix. Dynamic products are generally lower margin and we sold large quantities to health care and government customers, which typically receive more favorable pricing. This was exasperated early on as we initially prioritized product allocation to those most in need, like health systems and those in the front lines. So sell-through margins have been negatively affected by these mix impacts. 
The second driver is that we have been aggressive in supporting our customers by trying to anticipate the needs they might have. As a result, we placed large orders for certain products in Q2 of last year. As we have gone through the pandemic surges, the supply demand picture has changed rapidly for some products, and we had to revalue our inventory to reflect this reality. The vast majority of our purchases have worked well, a few have not. We have reverted to our normal purchasing processes, and we'll continue to monitor market dynamics as the situation unfolds. The impact on GP is easier to understand sequentially. Our GP dropped significantly in Q2 and has been impacted the remainder of the year. Moving forward, we expect U.S. GP to improve sequentially and to exit 2021 as high or higher than we started in Q1 2020. 
Finally, as we look at SG&A, overall net costs were lower despite some increased costs for enhanced safety including protocols and workforce disruptions. The team was able to tightly control costs while also continuing to invest for the long term. 
Despite these unique and challenging circumstances, we were still able to deliver strong overall performance in 2020. A few of the highlights. We delivered organic constant currency daily sales growth of 3.5% and at the total company level, driven by our above-market growth of 800 basis points in the U.S. due in part to pandemic-related sales. Also we achieved over 18% daily sales growth in the endless assortment businesses. We delivered operating margin of 11.2%, reflecting strong SG&A leverage, which helped to offset the previously mentioned pandemic fuel GP headwinds. We generated over $1.1 billion in operating cash flow or returning $939 million to shareholders to dividends and buybacks. And we remain disciplined in our capital deployment, maintaining strong adjusted ROIC of over 28% for the company. 
In order to focus on our core high-touch and endless assortment businesses, we divested [indiscernible] in China, 2 noncore businesses abroad. Overall, I am confident in the direction we are heading and very excited about the future. We have gained significant share and strong capabilities. We are in a very good position to deliver strong performance this year and for years to come as the pandemic loses its grip. With that, I will turn it over to Dee to take us through the fourth quarter results. Dee?"

Organic daily sales, which adjust for the divestitures of Fabory in China finished up 5.6% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. Underpinned by growth in our U.S. segment and continued impressive performance in our endless assortment businesses. 
In the U.S., we realized strong outgrowth to the broader Mr. Market which contracted about 1.5% to 2% versus prior year. Our gains were driven by pandemic related demand, which remains at elevated levels, sales to new customers and growth with midsize customers. The endless assortment model continues to deliver with 20% growth in daily sales again in the fourth quarter, while also generating improved operating margins. We remain very excited about the future of this business, and we'll discuss our plans to provide further transparency as we introduce our new GAAP reportable segments for 2021. 
At the total company level, margin pressure continues to be driven by pandemic-related headwinds, primarily in the U.S. segment. I will detail the pandemic mix more in the slides. In addition, we continue to see business unit mix impact as we experienced significant growth from our endless assortment businesses. 
SG&A costs were favorable by $42 million year-over-year as we captured 235 basis points of SG&A leverage in the period through prudent cost controls in the U.S. and Canada, and we gained strong extent leverage in our endless assortment businesses. This resulted in Q4 operating margin at 10%, down 75 basis points from the fourth quarter last year. 
From a cash flow perspective, the business continues to produce robust cash flow, with operating cash flow of $336 million at 170% of net adjusted earnings. And free cash flow of $291 million. We restarted our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter and completed $500 million of repurchases in the period. Finally, we delivered strong return on invested capital at over 28% for the full year. 
Turning to our U.S. segment. Daily sales increased 3.7% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. On the product side, sales of pandemic-related products remains elevated, up 49% for the quarter. But have tapered off in the peak in the second quarter. We continue to see meaningful improvement in our nonpandemic product trends, which has improved to down 7% in the quarter, exiting the year with December at lowest decline, down 5%. 
We've also seen a significant uptick in new customer acquisitions month-over-month with encouraging signs of repeat buying. From a customer perspective, we see improved growth with both large and mid-priced customers with a latter growing about 6% in the quarter, continuing to show signs of improvement from earlier in the year. Gross margin of 35.7% was down 290 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. 
The unfavorable variance in gross margin was driven most notably by pandemic-related headwinds, which accounted for nearly 90% of the GP decline. The pandemic impact were driven by continued product and customer mix and mark-to-market inventory adjustments, which D.G. outlined earlier, as well as freight-related surcharges, net of pass-through shipping charges to customers. 
In the second half of 2020, we started getting solid traction on price realization, which nearly offset continued cost headwinds as we exited the year. From an SG&A perspective, we gained 155 basis points of leverage with cost decreasing approximately $14 million year-over-year. The reduction was driven primarily by decreased travel expenses, lower depreciation and general operating efficiencies. 
Operating margin declined to 12.8% in the fourth quarter as the pandemic impact of gross margin weighted more heavily than the SG&A leverage gained. Adjusted return on invested capital was a very healthy 36.5% for the full year of 2020. 
Now looking at pandemic product trends. While sales of pandemic-related products decreased from the second quarter through October. Continued demand for key products, including mass, gloves and cleaning supply has kept pandemic sales elevated year-over-year, and we saw this pick up again in the last few months of the year as cases spiked headed into the winter. 
We've also seen customers across industries prepare for the vaccine distribution may be related to slightly different products like those required to work in refrigerated stores units. January sales remain elevated, so have tapered off from Q4. 
On the nonpandemic side, things continue to get better. We exited the year with December down 5% and have continued to see improvement with January, roughly flat year-over-year. Looking at share gain on Slide 10. We estimate the U.S. MRO market declined between 1.5% to 2% in the fourth quarter, showing strong improvement from the mid-teens decline we saw in the second quarter. Ranger was able to capture roughly 550 basis points of outgrowth fueled by pandemic-related sales and our growth initiatives. 
On a full year basis, we estimate that we have outgrown the broader MRO market by roughly 800 basis points. This outgrowth was aided by significant pandemic-related volume some of which, particularly in the second and third quarters was related to large onetime orders that are unlikely to reoccur. We estimate that approximately 250 basis points of the market growth in 2020 was a result of these nonrepeating pandemic transactions. 
Accordingly, as we move into 2021 and last these pandemic sales pipes, we expect to see some volatility in our year-over-year share gain metric. That being said, we are confident in our ability to serve new and existing customers during these challenging times. We believe we are doing the right things in merchandising, marketing and sales effectiveness to drive repeat purchases and produced 300 to 400 basis points of sustainable outgrowth in our U.S. high-touch business. 
Moving to our other businesses. Organic daily sales increased 14.6% or 13% on a constant currency basis. The endless assortment business grew at an approximately 20% with strong results in both Minuto and Zoro during the quarter. For our international high search business in both Mexico and Cromwell, we saw continued sequential improvement. However, both businesses remain impacted by pandemic-related shutdown. 
Overall, operating margins for other businesses were up 210 basis points. The favorability was driven by significant SG&A leverage and endless assortment notably at Zoro, which lapped heavy investment spend in the prior year period. Zoro continues to execute the playbook and deliver low single-digit results for the year. 
Turning to Slide 12. The Canadian market has seen an overall economic slowdown during the pandemic, which has notably impacted our natural resource and export customers. Throughout the pandemic, our team in Canada has remained focused on serving new and existing customers well while also accelerating our customer diversification efforts. 
In Canada, daily sales decreased 3.2% or 4.4% on a constant currency basis. Volumes in Canada reflect the pandemic-driven slowdown. However, the business continued to improve sequentially. We have positive sales growth in the month of December, and we believe the business is well suited for post pandemic growth. Gross margin at Granter Canada declined 1,040 basis points year-over-year this is primarily driven by lapping significant onetime supply chain efficiencies and to a lesser extent, the impact of pandemic related headwinds. Cost management and the benefit of pandered subsidies resulted in 315 basis points of SG&A leverage. 
Given the continued uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and the subsequent path of economic recovery, we will not be providing formal guidance at this time. This picture reminds fluid as does the shape of the pandemic and the customer demand for pandemic products. Similar to the last few quarters, we want to continue providing some insights into how we're thinking about the current quarter's performance. From a sales perspective, our preliminary results for January show year-over-year sales of about 9% at the total company level on a daily organic constant currency basis. 
While this is a strong start to the quarter, we faced more difficult comps in February and March when pandemic sales started to spike. With this, we expect daily sales to moderate and end the first quarter, up between 3% and 5% organically. Note, we'll also have 1 less selling day this quarter. From a gross margin perspective, we expect GP improvement of around 50 to 100 basis points sequentially versus Q4 2020. This anticipated lift is underpinned by a slowdown in pandemic product demand, continued price cost recovery and the lapping of freight headwinds experienced in Q4 2020. 
On a year-over-year basis, this would imply, GP will be down between 150 to 200 basis points in the quarter. With respect to SG&A, we expect costs will end up sequentially as business activity progresses and things like variable comp reset with the start of the new year. With this, we anticipate SG&A of between $730 million to $750 million for the first quarter of 2021. While this is up slightly versus Q4 2020, we will still be down meaningfully year-over-year. As always, we remain focused on managing near-term headwinds while continuing to invest in the business for the long term. 
From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to our balanced framework. For 2021, we anticipate investing between $225 million and $275 million back into the business. These CapEx investments include DC expansion in Japan, continue IT and Keepstock investments in the U.S. and normal levels of maintenance capital. Beyond that, we anticipate executing a similar dividend and share repurchase strategy, putting between $600 million to $700 million to work on repurchases in 2021. 
Although we are not providing 2021 guidance, I thought it might be helpful to provide some insights as to how a post tandem recovery could play out through the year. As is the largest portion of our business and one of the most impacted by the pandemic, we have targeted our U.S. segment on Slide 14 and 15, to give you some context. As we have saw continued progress on vacuum distribution and a return to near full economic activity as we enter into the second half of 2021, we would expect our results to trend back towards more normalized levels. 
On Slide 14, we map out year-over-year sales growth in dollars. Similar to our pandemic nonpandemic sales chart, you can see the quarter-to-quarter sales pipes from pandemic-related products, most pronounced in the second quarter, which remained elevated through the year and finished up $835 million or 54% in 2020. This drove pandemic product mix as a percent of total sales to 28%, a large increase compared to 19% in 2019. Conversely, nonpandemic sales were down dramatically in the second quarter and remains depressed through the balance of the year, finishing down $540 million or 8% in 2020. These trends did improve sequentially. 
In 2021, we expect to face lapping headwinds as pandemic sales continue to moderate from the spikes we saw last year. That being said, I think it's important to remember that more than 70% of our sales comes from nonpandemic products and as the economy recovers and these sales rebound, it should more than offset the lapping headwinds from pandemic related products. This will also help to normalize our product mix back towards pre COVID level accordingly, we would expect to see year-over-year growth in 2021, but the magnitude will be determined by the pace of the economic recovery. Related to gross profit margin, as product mix trends towards pre pandemic levels, we would expect to see improved GP rates throughout the year. This includes sequential improvement from Q4 2020, beginning in Q1 2021. We expect to exit the year with U.S. GP rates as high or higher than Q1 2020 levels. I want to reiterate, while this commentary relates to the U.S. business, we showcased it because it represents more than 70% of the total company results and was the most heavily impacted by the pandemic. 
With that, I will turn it back over to D.G."

Turning to Slide 17. I am excited to announce changes to our GAAP reporting structure, which will better align our financial disclosure to the way we manage the company, while also providing increased transparency for the investment community. Beginning in 2021, we will shift our segments to high-touch North America and endless assortment. Thinking about these businesses under 2 new segments is consistent with our strategic priorities for each segment and how our teams are organized internally. Our new high-touch North America segment is comprised of our Grainger branded businesses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. This further solidifies the work we have done over the last couple of years to create a consistent go-to-market approach across the region while also merging the commercial functions of these businesses into a single organization. It also reflects the fact that we run the supply chain as 1 entity across the region. We feel confident that these businesses are well situated to support our customers with quicker more coordinated decisions to drive profitable share gain and exceptional customer solutions across North America. Given the growing size and importance of our endless assortment model, the timing is right to begin providing stand-alone disclosures for this important business. 
Our endless assortment segment will consist of our Monotaro and Zoro businesses, which operate primarily in Japan, Korea, the U.S. and the U.K. We continue to more closely align the operations of these businesses, taking the lead from the success we've had at Monotaro. Alongside these changes, we will also take the opportunity to simplify our corporate cost allocation and intercompany sales methodologies to better align with industry best practices. Given the amount of change, we wanted to preview the resegmentation this morning in preparation of shifting to the new structure, starting with our first quarter 2021 results. Between now and our Q1 earnings call, the team will be working to file our 2020 10-K in normal course under our historical presentation. And then shortly thereafter, we expect to file an 8-K with 3-year recast and summary financials reflecting the new segmentation. Including quarterly information for the 2020 period. 
On March 9, we then plan to host a modeling call to help you fully understand the change and to answer any additional questions that you may have. This should position us well for our Q1 call on April 30, which I would point out is a week later or so than normal. 
Going forward, given our new endless assortment reportable segment, we will be pushing back our earnings call calendar to align with Monotaro schedule. Shifting gears, we continue to execute against our business priorities. In our Itouch Solutions model, we remain focused on remerchandising our product line to ensure customers and team members can find the right solutions quickly. We know that re merchandise categories see increased sell-through rates while also significantly improving the user experience. So this work is an important pillar in our share gain efforts. We expect to remerchandise an additional $1.5 billion of product in 2021. This process has become embedded in the way we work and will be a constant moving forward. 
We will continue to invest in and improve our marketing efforts, which supports all customers and has delivered proven share gain over the past few years. We'll continue to deepen customer relationship with Keepstock and further strengthen our keepstock offer to create more value for customers and ensure we have a competitive advantage. We will continue to improve our offer and sales strategy with both large, multisite customers, as well as midsized customers. And lastly, we will continue to improve the path that we are on with our Canada operations as part of the North American Grainger business unit. Our improved cost position, exceptional service, and early success in expanding into new customer segments gives us confidence that we are on the right path in Canada. We will update you on Canada's performance as part of the high-touch North America segment. 
In our endless assortment model, we expect to add over 2 million items to Zoro in the U.S. in 2021, pushing us to over 8 million SKUs on the site. We will work to continue improving profitability through enhance marketing efforts, we will further leverage analytics to refine our customer acquisition funnel and to improve customer repeat rates at Zoro. MonotaRO Flex its resilience in 2020, and we'll look to continue momentum in 2021. The business expects to launch new product and order management systems in the first half of the year to further improve internal processing and shortened lead times. Additionally, work continues on 2 new fulfillment centers with the ibaraki facility expected to be completed in mid-2021. There's a lot of great work being done across the organization, and I am excited about the opportunities in front of us in 2021 and beyond. 
On Slide '19, I just wanted to reiterate our earnings truth algorithm as we have shed noncore businesses over the last few years and moved forward with more streamlined reportable segments, the path to long-term growth comes into clear focus. On the operational side, we feel we are well situated to gain share profitably in our North America high-touch business. This includes 300 to 400 basis points of sustainable annual outgrowth in the U.S., improving top line performance in Canada and operating margin expansion as GP rates recover, and we continue to gain SG&A leverage. In the endless assortment, we expect to continue to produce 20% annual top line growth, while also ramping margins at Zoro U.S. into the -- into the high single digits over the next 3 to 5 years. These strong growth drivers alongside a business that generates consistent free cash flow and has significant capital allocation flexibility, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver strong returns, for our shareholders. 
I'm proud of our results for the quarter and the full year and want to thank our team members for their commitment to safety and customer service. I also want to thank our customers and suppliers who have been great partners throughout this challenging time. We have needed to work together more than ever over the past year and those relationships have been crucial. We have gained share, improved our merchandising and marketing capabilities, deepened our customer relationships and expanded our assortment while improving margins in thorough. We're in a strong financial position to grow the business profitably moving forward. We remain committed to fulfilling our purpose of keeping the world working throughout this pandemic as well as continuing to execute our strategy, so we can achieve this purpose for years to come. 
And with that, we will open the line up for questions."

I mean, the reality is that more people are shipping product to their homes than ever, as you're probably aware of, and that has driven a fairly tight freight market, but we don't expect to be impacted all that much by that. In terms of inventory adjustments, just to be clear, in the second quarter of 2020, we took a number of actions to try to get product for our customers to protect service. Many of those worked out, some did not work out as we expected. And we received that product in mostly Q3, I'd say. And so every week that goes by, we learn more. We expect it to match anything we take in inventory to the actual pandemic sales as we learn more. So we would expect that to be -- there's still to be some of those inventory adjustments in the first half of the year, but to slowly fall off after that, basically. So yes, the ramp we show is more like what we'd expect to see, right."

I curious, dig, you kind of left off with the -- affirming the 3% to 4% outgrowth as your long-term algorithm. For '21, is it reasonable to net kind of 2.5% of call out large pandemic orders against that as a thought as we kind of model out the year? Yes. In the U.S., I think the way to think about it is we gained 800 basis points of share in 2020. $250 million of that, we think is nonrepeating. So you'd say $550 million is what we think is real share gain. If we gained 400 basis points of real share gain ex those orders, you subtract $250 million from that, and we'd be at $150 million in the year and across the 2 years, we'd be $950 million. I think the 2 year story. I think the main point here is that and I hear it from customers every time I talk to them and I talk to customers every week at a minimum, we are viewed very favorably in terms of how we've handled this. And certainly, we took extra risk with inventory, and it certainly had an impact on our GP. But we are in a great position from a relationship perspective. And we will have a very strong 2-year share gain period, and we will exit those 2 years with very strong economics. And so for us, that's really the main point. And that's what we've always been trying to do. And so yes, you do have to subtract the $250 million. But in any case, it's going to be a very strong share gain over those 2 years. 
Okay. That makes sense. And then on the -- again, to kind of affirming exit pitch there. The high single-digit margin at Zoro. If you said it, I missed it, but where was that in 2020? And directionally, does Zoro scale profitability in '21?"

So we've certainly seen some restock. We don't get a lot of restock given what we sell, but we certainly have seen volumes pick up with manufacturing. We still are in a very challenged state with hospitality, airlines, cruise lines, those types of things. And so I think what's going to happen is certain segments seem to turn on as we recover here and they don't alternate one. So you probably don't see a huge sort of restock.

The feedback is very, very good. Our cost structure is in the right place. We have stabilization in gross profit ex some of the inventory efficiency issues we talked about this quarter, which are not operational. So we feel like the business was roughly breakeven last year in the midst of a pandemic. We actually think it's on a very good path.

What happens when you add SKUs as you get growth and you get customer acquisition first and then you're able to get repeat buy. And that does not add much expense to the business. So you do, as you grow, get fixed cost leverage with that investment in product SKUS. That isn't the full story.

So I guess my question is, how did this legacy business trend in 2020? Just so we can try to separate out the underlying business from the surge or new business that came online over the last year. Just to help model out the trajectory because I would assume that the underlying business carries more leverage to the industrial economy than the surge business that came on. 
Yes. So that's a great question and mostly unanswerable, I would say. So let me give you some customer examples to give you a sense. So when the pandemic hit in Q2 of 2020, we are the largest industrial safety supplier. We are used to selling things like N95. So we are not used to selling N95 to hospitals. Just to be clear, hospitals haven't historically been big users of N95 and N95 typically go into places like grain elevators and dirty manufacturing processes. So all of a sudden, all of our product was being shifted to hospitals and governments. We have gotten back to a more normal mix across what we call pandemic product than we did before. But I think there's still a lot of messiness. There's still a lot of customers in the industrial economy that haven't come back and aren't using safety products maybe like they did before if they don't have the activity. So I think it's a really interesting question and one that is super hard to get at. And look, I would also point out that there's a lot of safety products, even in hospital systems, hospital systems this year have done incredible things to protect people to save people. They have been unable to do a lot of the historical safety maintenance things that they might have done. They just have been full out. Many of them have been full out on COVID. And there's a backlog of things that they will need to do, fundings available. That they just haven't done. So I think it's a really interesting question and 1 that is really hard. And I'm sorry to give you some anecdotes. But certainly, I have a lot of them, where I think there is some pent-up demand for normal pandemic product. No. I appreciate all of that. And then just kind of following up, could you provide some color or numbers around the margin difference between pandemic and non pandemic revenues? Just as we try to model out this margin trajectory into 2021, as that shift normalizes? Yes. I mean, if -- and we haven't provided that. I will say that the $500 million in non pandemic that we were short in 2020. That probably has normal increment decrement numbers that you've seen from us. The $800 million in pandemic that we sold above normal would have a lot lower incremental margins, quite a bit lower, maybe less than half as you think about it, which sort of gets you to what happened to our overall slight decline in operating earnings for the full year. So that may be a way to sort of to allow you to sort of hunt and think about it."

I'm excited that our new CFO, Dee Merriwether is here with me. Dee brings a wealth of financial and operational expertise and a deep understanding of Grainger's business that will serve us well. She has been with Grainger for 8 years in finance, pricing and sales leadership roles. It's great to have her as our new CFO.
For the call today, I'd like to provide an overview of 2020, highlighting accomplishments and challenges. Clearly, much of the year has been shaped by the pandemic, but I'll also highlight our progress on key strategic initiatives. Then I'll turn it over to Dee to review the details of our fourth quarter results. I'll close by discussing how we will resegment the business to more closely reflect how we think about the company, and we'll also touch on our high level opportunities and priorities for both the high-touch and endless assortment businesses.  
2020 was obviously one of the most challenging and intense years in history. Through it all, we demonstrated agility, resilience and a steadfast focus on supporting our customers and team members. At the start of the pandemic, we laid out 3 basic priorities: to serve our customers well, support our team members and ensure we remain strong financially. I can confidently say we've been able to accomplish all 3, and I'm proud of how the team has continued to execute on our purpose to keep the world working by living our principles every day.  
Over the last year, we persevered through the pandemic while continuing to deliver an exceptional customer experience. We've deepened relationships with existing customers and developed new relationships, many of which have returned from multiple purchases. We helped our customers secure product, manage their inventory and solve their problems as we further embed KeepStock and our other solutions in their facilities.  Grainger was sometimes the only vendor our customers allowed on their sites to support their operations; a testament to our deep customer relationships. 
Another priority was to support our team members. We operated with the perspective that the pandemic would be challenging and longer in duration than we wanted, but that it would eventually end. As such, we maintained a stable workforce, deployed personnel to safely and effectively serve customers and supported team members to ensure their safety and well-being. The pandemic is, first and foremost, a humanitarian crisis, and supporting our team members has remained a huge priority.
Finally, we have remained very strong financially, generating over $1.1 billion in operating cash flow in this difficult year. As it became clear that our business model will be resilient throughout the pandemic, we reverted from a temporary focus on cash preservation to our longer-term strategic priority of growing the business profitably. 
The Grainger team has been active in serving our communities through this time of need. We have great team members who value giving back to others. As a company, we provided monetary and product donations to organizations like the Red Cross and the Children's First Fund to support the pandemic response.   
Key leadership challenge this year was balancing our pandemic response while continuing to build the company for the future. Throughout, we remain focused on executing against our strategic initiatives. 
Within our high-touch solutions model, we improve the way customers find the products they need. We know this is core to our growth.  In 2020, we launched our product information management system, which provides the foundation for our merchandising efforts. We now have over $2.8 billion of our product assortment remerchandised, $1.6 billion completed in 2020 alone. We also made enhancements to our search functionality and mobile app, resulting in a better user experience. We added features like search by image, where you can take a picture of the product you're looking for and get accurate matches to relevant items quickly and easily.  
We took a significant step forward with our marketing capabilities in 2020. We brought more capabilities in-house to develop the competitive advantage of industry-specific knowledge. These efforts helped us gain share and increase customer acquisition with the Grainger brand. We developed new capabilities to support on-site inventory management, including vending solutions and technology, allowing us to remotely upgrade or alter installations to better serve customers during the pandemic.  
We also opened a new distribution center in Louisville earlier this year, now our largest facility, with the capacity to stock 700,000 products in a strategic geographic location. We leveraged the building to test product expansion on a set of new categories with very strong results. 
We also made strong progress with our endless assortment businesses. Zoro continued to expand its product portfolio, adding 2.5 million items in 2020 to bring the total SKUs to over 6 million. Zoro also improved its marketing capabilities, resulting in improved ROI and higher customer repeat rates. They are leveraging the MonotaRO playbook to improve the fundamental growth and profitability of the business.  MonotaRO continued its exceptional growth and profitability performance. All in all, a great year for the endless assortment team.  
Now before I review our 2020 results, I think it's helpful to step back and take a look at the impact the pandemic has had on our operating performance. From a revenue perspective, we started to see a shift to pandemic-related products starting in mid-February of last year. In late March, as pandemic product demand surged, we saw a significant decline in other non-pandemic product as lockdowns took hold. Since that point, we have seen continued strong sales of pandemic products, which has ebbed and flowed based on the virus, including another surge in the fourth quarter, which mirrored the increase in case counts.  
Non-pandemic products are slowly coming back, and while not yet at pre-pandemic levels, they have improved quite a bit from April lows. We expect the pandemic to continue to impact revenue through at least the first half of 2021 and then start to moderate as vaccinations take hold. Steve will detail our forward-looking thoughts in a bit.  
The pandemic has also had a big impact on gross profit, driven by 2 main factors: First, we were impacted by product and customer mix. Pandemic products are generally lower-margin, and we sold large quantities to health care and government customers, which typically receive more favorable pricing. This was exasperated early on as we initially prioritized product allocation to those most in need like health systems and those in the front lines. So sell-through margins have been negatively affected by these mix impacts.  
The second driver is that we have been aggressive in supporting our customers by trying to anticipate the needs they might have. As a result, we placed large orders for certain products in Q2 of last year. As we have gone through the pandemic surges, the supply-demand picture has changed rapidly for some products and we had to revalue our inventory to reflect this reality. The vast majority of our purchases have worked well, a few have not. We have reverted to our normal purchasing processes, and we'll continue to monitor market dynamics as the situation unfolds. 
The impact on GP is easier to understand sequentially. Our GP dropped significantly in Q2 and has been impacted the remainder of the year. Moving forward, we expect U.S. GP to improve sequentially and to exit 2021 as high or higher than we started in Q1 2020.
Finally, as we look at SG&A, overall net costs were lower despite some increased costs for enhanced safety including protocols and workforce disruptions. The team was able to tightly control costs while also continuing to invest for the long term.
Despite these unique and challenging circumstances, we were still able to deliver strong overall performance in 2020. A few of the highlights: We delivered organic constant currency daily sales growth of 3.5% at the total company level, driven by our above-market growth of 800 basis points in the U.S. due in part to pandemic-related sales. Also, we achieved over 18% daily sales growth in the endless assortment businesses. We delivered operating margin of 11.2%, reflecting strong SG&A leverage, which helped to offset the previously mentioned pandemic fuel GP headwinds. We generated over $1.1 billion in operating cash flow while returning $939 million to shareholders to dividends and buybacks. And we remain disciplined in our capital deployment, maintaining strong adjusted ROIC of over 28% for the company.
In order to focus on our core high-touch and endless assortment businesses, we divested Fabory and China, 2 non-core businesses abroad. 
Overall, I am confident in the direction we are heading and very excited about the future. We have gained significant share and strong capabilities. We are in a very good position to deliver strong performance this year and for years to come as the pandemic loses its grip. With that, I will turn it over to Dee to take us through the fourth quarter results. Dee?"

Organic daily sales, which adjust for the divestitures of Fabory and China, finished up 5.6% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. Underpinned by growth in our U.S. segment and continued impressive performance in our endless assortment businesses.  
In the U.S., we realized strong outgrowth to the broader MRO market which contracted about 1.5% to 2% versus prior year. Our gains were driven by pandemic-related demand, which remains at elevated levels, sales to new customers and growth with midsized customers. The endless assortment model continues to deliver with 20% growth in daily sales again in the fourth quarter, while also generating improved operating margins. We remain very excited about the future of this business, and we'll discuss our plans to provide further transparency as we introduce our new GAAP reportable segments for 2021.  
At the total company level, margin pressure continues to be driven by pandemic-related headwinds, primarily in the U.S. segment. I will detail the pandemic mix more in a few slides. In addition, we continue to see business unit mix impact as we experienced significant growth from our endless assortment businesses.  
SG&A costs were favorable by $42 million year-over-year as we captured 235 basis points of SG&A leverage in the period through prudent cost controls in the U.S. and Canada, and we gained strong expense leverage in our endless assortment businesses. This resulted in Q4 operating margin at 10%, down 75 basis points from the fourth quarter last year.  
From a cash flow perspective, the business continues to produce robust cash flow, with operating cash flow of $336 million at 170% of net adjusted earnings, and free cash flow of $291 million. We restarted our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter and completed $500 million of repurchases in the period. Finally, we delivered strong return on invested capital at over 28% for the full year.  
Turning to our U.S. segment. Daily sales increased 3.7% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. On the product side, sales of pandemic-related products remains elevated, up 49% in the quarter, but have tapered off in the peak in the second quarter. We continue to see meaningful improvement in our non-pandemic products trends, which has improved to down 7% in the quarter, exiting the year with December at lowest decline, down 5%.  
We've also seen a significant uptick in new customer acquisitions month-over-month with encouraging signs of repeat buying. From a customer perspective, we see improved growth with both large and midsized customers, with the latter growing about 6% in the quarter, continuing to show signs of improvement from earlier in the year. Gross margin of 35.7% was down 290 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.  The unfavorable variance in gross margin was driven most notably by pandemic-related headwinds, which accounted for nearly 90% of the GP decline. The pandemic impact was driven by continued product and customer mix and mark-to-market inventory adjustments, which D.G. outlined earlier, as well as freight-related surcharges, net of pass-through shipping charges to customers.  
In the second half of 2020, we started getting solid traction on price realization, which nearly offset continued cost headwinds as we exited the year. From an SG&A perspective, we gained 155 basis points of leverage with cost decreasing approximately $14 million year-over-year. The reduction was driven primarily by decreased travel expenses, lower depreciation and general operating efficiencies.  
Operating margin declined to 12.8% in the fourth quarter as the pandemic impact of gross margin weighted more heavily than the SG&A leverage gained. Adjusted return on invested capital was a very healthy 36.5% for the full year of 2020.  
Now looking at pandemic product trends. While sales of pandemic-related products decreased from the second quarter through October, continued demand for key products, including masks, gloves and cleaning supply has kept pandemic sales elevated year-over-year, and we saw this pick up again in the last few months of the year as cases spiked headed into the winter.  
We've also seen customers across industries prepare for the vaccine distribution maybe related but slightly different products like those required to work in refrigerated storage units. January sales remain elevated and have tapered off from Q4.  
On the non-pandemic side, things continue to get better. We exited the year with December down 5% and have continued to see improvement with January, roughly flat year-over-year. Looking at share gain on Slide 10. We estimate the U.S. MRO market decline between 1.5% to 2% in the fourth quarter, showing strong improvement from the mid-teens decline we saw in the second quarter. Grainger was able to capture roughly 550 basis points of outgrowth, fueled by pandemic-related sales and our growth initiatives.  
On a full-year basis, we estimate that we have outgrown the broader MRO market by roughly 800 basis points. This outgrowth was aided by significant pandemic-related volume, some of which, particularly in the second and third quarters, was related to large onetime orders that are unlikely to reoccur. We estimate that approximately 250 basis points of the market growth in 2020 was a result of these non-repeating pandemic transactions.  
Accordingly, as we move into 2021 and lap these  pandemic sales spikes, we expect to see some volatility in our year-over-year share gain metric. That being said, we are confident in our ability to serve new and existing customers during these challenging times. We believe we are doing the right things in merchandising, marketing and sales effectiveness to drive repeat purchases and produce 300 to 400 basis points of sustainable outgrowth in our U.S. high-touch business.  
Moving to our other businesses. Organic daily sales increased 14.6% or 13% on a constant currency basis. The endless assortment business grew at an approximately 20%, with strong results in both MonotaRO and Zoro during the quarter. For our international high-touch business in both Mexico and Cromwell, we saw continued sequential improvement. However, both businesses remain impacted by pandemic-related shutdown.  
Overall, operating margins for other businesses were up 210 basis points. The favorability was driven by significant SG&A leverage and endless assortment, notably at Zoro, which lapped heavy investment spend in the prior year period.  Zoro continues to execute the MonotaRO playbook and deliver low single-digit results for the year.  
Turning to Slide 12. The Canadian market has seen an overall economic slowdown during the pandemic, which has notably impacted our natural resource and export customers. Throughout the pandemic, our team in Canada has remained focused on serving new and existing customers well while also accelerating our customer diversification efforts.  
In Canada, daily sales decreased 3.2%, or 4.4% on a constant currency basis. Volumes in Canada reflect the pandemic-driven slowdown. However, the business continued to improve sequentially. We have positive sales growth in the month of December, and we believe the business is well suited for post-pandemic growth. Gross margin at Grainger Canada declined 1,040 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily driven by lapping significant onetime supply chain efficiencies, and to a lesser extent, the impact of pandemic-related headwinds. Cost management and the benefit of pandemic-related subsidies resulted in 315 basis points of SG&A leverage. 
Given the continued uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and the subsequent path of economic recovery, we will not be providing formal guidance at this time. This picture remains fluid, as does the shape of the pandemic and the customer demand for pandemic products. Similar to the last few quarters, we want to continue providing some insights into how we're thinking about the current quarter's performance. From a sales perspective, our preliminary results for January show year-over-year sales of about 9% at the total company level on a daily organic constant currency basis.  While this is a strong start to the quarter, we faced more difficult comps in February and March when pandemic sales started to spike. With this, we expect daily sales to moderate and end the first quarter up between 3% and 5% organically. Note, we'll also have 1 less selling day this quarter. 
From a gross margin perspective, we expect GP improvement of around 50 to 100 basis points sequentially versus Q4 2020. This anticipated lift is underpinned by a slowdown in pandemic product demand, continued price cost recovery and the lapping of freight headwinds experienced in Q4 2020.  
On a year-over-year basis, this would imply GP will be down between 150 to 200 basis points in the quarter. 
With respect to SG&A, we expect costs will inch up sequentially as business activity progresses and if things like variable comp reset with the start of the new year. With this, we anticipate SG&A of between $730 million to $750 million for the first quarter of 2021. While this is up slightly versus Q4 2020, we will still be down meaningfully year-over-year. As always, we remain focused on managing near-term headwinds while continuing to invest in the business for the long term.  
From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to our balanced framework. For 2021, we anticipate investing between $225 million and $275 million back into the business. These CapEx investments include DC expansion in Japan, continued IT and KeepStock investments in the U.S., and normal levels of maintenance capital. Beyond that, we anticipate executing a similar dividend and share repurchase strategy, putting between $600 million to $700 million to work on repurchases in 2021.  
Although we are not providing 2021 guidance, I thought it might be helpful to provide some insights as to how a post-pandemic recovery could play out through the year. As it's the largest portion of our business and one of the most impacted by the pandemic, we have charted our U.S. segment on Slide 14 and 15, to give you some context. As we have seen continued progress on vaccine distribution and a return to near full economic activity as we enter into the second half of 2021, we would expect our results to trend back towards more normalized levels.  
On Slide 14, we map out year-over-year sales growth in dollars. Similar to our pandemic/non-pandemic sales chart, you can see the quarter-to-quarter sales spikes from pandemic-related products, most pronounced in the second quarter, which remained elevated through the year, and finished up $835 million or 54% in 2020. This drove pandemic product mix as a percent of total sales to 28%, a large increase compared to 19% in 2019. Conversely, non-pandemic sales were down dramatically in the second quarter and remains depressed through the balance of the year, finishing down $540 million or 8% in 2020. These trends did improve sequentially.  
In 2021, we expect to face lapping headwinds as pandemic sales continue to moderate from the spikes we saw last year. That being said, I think it's important to remember that more than 70% of our sales comes from non-pandemic products, and as the economy recovers and these sales rebound, it should more than offset the lapping headwinds from pandemic-related products. This will also help to normalize our product mix back towards pre-COVID levels. Accordingly, we would expect to see year-over-year growth in 2021, but the magnitude will be determined by the pace of the economic recovery. 
Related to gross profit margin, as product mix trends towards pre-pandemic levels, we would expect to see improved GP rates throughout the year. This includes sequential improvement from Q4 2020, beginning in Q1 2021. We expect to exit the year with U.S. GP rates as high or higher than Q1 2020 levels. 
I want to reiterate, while this commentary relates to the U.S. business, we showcased it because it represents more than 70% of the total company results and was the most heavily impacted by the pandemic.  
With that, I will turn it back over to D.G."

Turning to Slide 17. I am excited to announce changes to our GAAP reporting structure, which will better align our financial disclosure to the way we manage the company, while also providing increased transparency for the investment community. Beginning in 2021, we will shift our segments to high-touch North America and endless assortment. Thinking about these businesses under 2 new segments is consistent with our strategic priorities for each segment and how our teams are organized internally. Our new high-touch North America segment is comprised of our Grainger-branded businesses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. This further solidifies the work we have done over the last couple of years to create a consistent go-to-market approach across the region while also merging the commercial functions of these businesses into a single organization. It also reflects the fact that we run the supply chain as 1 entity across the region. We feel confident that these businesses are well situated to support our customers with quicker more coordinated decisions to drive profitable share gain and exceptional customer solutions across North America. Given the growing size and importance of our endless assortment model, the timing is right to begin providing stand-alone disclosures for this important business.  
Our endless assortment segment will consist of our MonotaRO and Zoro businesses, which operate primarily in Japan, Korea, the U.S. and the U.K. We continue to more closely align the operations of these businesses, taking a lead from the success we've had at MonotaRO. Alongside these changes, we will also take the opportunity to simplify our corporate cost allocation and intercompany sales methodologies to better align with industry best practices. 
Given the amount of change, we wanted to preview the resegmentation this morning in preparation of shifting to the new structure, starting with our first quarter 2021 results. Between now and our Q1 earnings call, the team will be working to file our 2020 10-K in normal course under our historical presentation. And then shortly thereafter, we expect to file an 8-K with 3-year recast and summary financials reflecting the new segmentation. Including quarterly information for the 2020 period.  
On March 9, we then plan to host a modeling call to help you fully understand the change and to answer any additional questions that you may have. This should position us well for our Q1 call on April 30, which I would point out is a week later or so than normal.  Going forward, given our new endless assortment reportable segment, we will be pushing back our earnings call calendar to align with MonotaRO's schedule. 
Shifting gears, we continue to execute against our business priorities. In our high-touch solutions model, we remain focused on remerchandising our product line to ensure customers and team members can find the right solutions quickly. We know that remerchandise categories see increased sell-through rates while also significantly improving the user experience, so this work is an important pillar in our share gain efforts. We expect to remerchandise an additional $1.5 billion of product in 2021. This process has become embedded in the way we work and will be a constant moving forward.  
We will continue to invest in and improve our marketing efforts, which supports all customers and has delivered proven share gain over the past few years. We'll continue to deepen customer relationship with KeepStock and further strengthen our KeepStock offer to create more value for customers and ensure we have a competitive advantage. We will continue to improve our offer and sales strategy with both large, multisite customers, as well as midsized customers. And lastly, we will continue to improve the path that we are on with our Canada operations as part of the North America Grainger business unit. Our improved cost position, exceptional service, and early success in expanding into new customer segments gives us confidence that we are on the right path in Canada. We will update you on Canada's performance as part of the high-touch North America segment.  
In our endless assortment model, we expect to add over 2 million items to Zoro in the U.S. in 2021, pushing us to over 8 million SKUs on the site. We will work to continue improving profitability through enhanced marketing efforts, we will further leverage analytics to refine our customer acquisition funnel and to improve customer repeat rates at Zoro. MonotaRO flexed its resilience in 2020, and we'll look to continue momentum in 2021. The business expects to launch new product and order management systems in the first half of the year to further improve internal processing and shorten lead times. Additionally, work continues on 2 new fulfillment centers, with the Ibaraki facility expected to be completed in mid-2021. There's a lot of great work being done across the organization, and I am excited about the opportunities in front of us in 2021 and beyond.  
On Slide '19, I just wanted to reiterate our earnings growth algorithm. As we have shed non-core businesses over the last few years and moved forward with more streamlined reportable segments, the path to long-term growth comes into clearer focus. On the operational side, we feel we are well situated to gain share profitably in our North America high-touch business. This includes 300 to 400 basis points of sustainable annual outgrowth in the U.S., improving top line performance in Canada and operating margin expansion as GP rates recover, and we continue to gain SG&A leverage. In the endless assortment, we expect to continue to produce 20% annual top line growth, while also ramping margins at Zoro U.S. into the mid -- into the high single digits over the next 3 to 5 years. These strong growth drivers, alongside a business that generates consistent free cash flow and has significant capital allocation flexibility, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.  
I'm proud of our results for the quarter and the full year and want to thank our team members for their commitment to safety and customer service. I also want to thank our customers and suppliers who have been great partners throughout this challenging time. We have needed to work together more than ever over the past year, and those relationships have been crucial. We have gained share, improved our merchandising and marketing capabilities, deepened our customer relationships, and expanded our assortment while improving margins at Zoro. We are in a strong financial position to grow the business profitably moving forward. We remain committed to fulfilling our purpose of keeping the world working throughout this pandemic as well as continuing to execute our strategy, so we can achieve this purpose for years to come.  
And with that, we will open the line up for questions."

And Ryan, I would also comment that given the relationships we have with government and health care customers and the way pandemic sales were throughout the year, our incremental margins on pandemic sales were a lot lower than what we lost. On the smaller loss of revenue for non-pandemic. So we do expect profitability to improve, and we expect to have growth as non-pandemic recovers."

In terms of inventory adjustments, just to be clear, in the second quarter of 2020, we took a number of actions to try to get product for our customers to protect service. Many of those worked out; some did not work out as we expected. And we received that product in mostly Q3, I'd say. And so every week that goes by, we learn more. We expect it to match anything we take in inventory to the actual pandemic sales as we learn more, so we would expect that to be -- there's still to be some of those inventory adjustments in the first half of the year, but to slowly -- to fall off after that, basically. So yes, the ramp we show is more like what we'd expect to see, Ryan."

If we gained 400 basis points of real share gain ex those orders, you'd subtract 250 from that, and we'd be at 150 in the year, and across the 2 years, we'd be 950. 
I think the 2-year story, I think the main point here is that, and I hear it from customers every time I talk to them, and I talk to customers every week at a minimum, we are viewed very favorably in terms of how we've handled this. And certainly, we took extra risk with inventory, and it certainly had an impact on our GP. But we are in a great position from a relationship perspective.

So we've certainly seen some restock. We don't get a lot of restock given what we sell, but we certainly have seen volumes pick up with manufacturing. We still are in a very challenged state with hospitality, airlines, cruise lines, those types of things. And so I think what's going to happen is certain segments seem to turn on as we recover here and they don't all turn up once.

Secondly, though, I would say the performance in Canada last year was  pretty good. We've seen growth now in December, and January was good for Canada, which is the first time we've seen that in 4 or 5 years. We have very good customer feedback when I talk to customers there. The feedback is very, very good. Our cost structure is in the right place. We have stabilization in gross profit ex some of the inventory efficiency issues we talked about this quarter, which are not operational. So we feel like the business was roughly breakeven last year in the midst of a pandemic. We actually think it's on a very good path. And we think in the next several years, it's going to be profitable, growing part of the portfolio. We've taken all the hard action now, and we are grinding out customers, and we aren't losing contracts anymore. I mean, it just feels very, very different. And I think we've also built some deep customer relationships through the pandemic. So it's going to be a profitable part of the North America portfolio, albeit not as big as it once was, but it will start growing now, is our expectation."

So when we've talked about remerchandising as a priority, that is mostly in the Grainger brand. So that is mostly making sure that we have very highly curated product data so it is easier for our customers and team members to find product than anybody else on the roughly 2 million items we would have in the U.S. 
With Zoro, we are expanding the offer. You don't have as much curation with that model. You couldn't possibly, given the number of SKUs we have. What happens when you add SKUs is you get growth. And you get customer acquisition first, and then you're able to get repeat buy. And that does not add much expense to the business. So you do, as you grow, get fixed cost leverage with that investment in product SKUs. That isn't the full story. Part of the full story is we're also growing with existing customers and getting repeat buy, and that adds to some of the fixed cost leverage as well. Hopefully, that answers the question, Nigel."

So let me give you some customer examples to give you a sense. 
So when the pandemic hit in Q2 of 2020, we are the largest industrial safety supplier. We are used to selling things like N95. We are not used to selling N95 to hospitals, just to be clear. Hospitals haven't historically been big users of N95. N95s typically go into places like grain elevators and dirty manufacturing processes. So all of a sudden, all of our product was being shifted to hospitals and governments. 
We have gotten back to a more normal mix across what we call pandemic product than we did before, but I think there's still a lot of messiness. There's still a lot of customers in the industrial economy that haven't come back and aren't using safety products maybe like they did before if they don't have the activity. So I think it's a really interesting question and one that is super hard to get at. 
And I would also point out that there's a lot of safety products, even in hospital systems. Hospital systems, this year, have done incredible things to protect people, to save people. They have been unable to do a lot of the historical safety maintenance things that they might have done. They just have been full out -- many of them have been full out on COVID. And there's a backlog of things that they will need to do, fundings available, that they just haven't done. 
So I think it's a really interesting question and one that is really hard. And I'm sorry to give you some anecdotes. But certainly, I have a lot of them, where I think there is some pent-up demand for normal pandemic product."

Today, I'll provide a brief overview of our first quarter results, key initiatives and encouraging signs for our business as the economy recovers. Of note, this will be our first quarter with results aligned to our 2 new reportable segments. Also, as MonotaRO, our majority-owned subsidiary, is a publicly traded company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, we have now aligned the timing of our earnings releases. 
I am very proud of the way the Grainger team has continued to serve our customers through the recovery and has addressed new challenges as they arise. We are supporting many customers through vaccination deployment, including pharmacies and other large sites. Recently, we partnered with the State University Medical Center, the National Guard and the Department of Health to support a mass vaccination site. We outfitted the site with important pandemic-related products like safety equipment as well as more traditional MRO product needed to support the operation, like power and extension cords, lighting and traffic columns. As it ramped up, this site has been able to facilitate thousands of vaccination today. 
We're seeing vaccination distribution progressing around the world, albeit at different speeds. In the U.S., as more of the population gets vaccinated, we're seeing many customers return to their normal operations and purchasing patterns. This is evident as our non-pandemic sales continue to return to normal levels and as sales in most end markets grow sequentially. In the U.K., we're seeing business activity rise. In Canada, slower vaccine distribution and potential shutdowns are slowing the business recovery. We're also seeing a modestly slower recovery in Japan. No matter what stage of the recovery our customers are in, our relationships with them are very strong, given our support of their operations over the past year. 
Part of being there for our customers meant having the products they needed when they needed it. To bring this to life, at this time last year, when customers need a hand sanitizer, we sold them 55 gallon drums and they were filling their own containers. As supply constraints eased, customers reverted back to purchasing more normal PPE SKUs and far fewer 55 gallon drums. 
As I've said before, we took calculated risks in procuring pandemic products and reasonable alternatives, especially in the second quarter of 2020. As the pandemic progressed and market dynamics changed, we had to revalue some of our inventory in Q4 and again in Q1. We anticipate further price deterioration on some of these noncore alternatives pandemic products. While our profitability on these products including all potential write-downs was below normal, supporting our customers by taking these risks was the right thing to do. We improved relationships with our existing customers, developed new repeat business and delivered strong incremental growth at lower but still profitable margins. 
On last quarter's call, we shared our first quarter expectations. As it relates to revenue in the first quarter, all of our businesses surpassed our outlook. We expected first quarter company GP to be down 150 to 200 basis points versus prior year, and our actual results fell within this stated range. Excluding the inventory adjustments, our U.S. GP was up versus prior year, giving us further confidence in the path forward. Based on our strong results and improving economic trends, we are providing full year guidance, which we will discuss in a few minutes. 
Within our High-Touch Solutions segment, We continue to make progress on our key initiatives across geographies. The U.S. has seen positive signs of economic recovery with growth of non-pandemic sales in virtually all segments. The exception is health care, which has very high pandemic-fueled comps. Gross margins are returning to pre-pandemic levels in the U.S., net of inventory adjustments. In Canada, the path to recovery is slower as they struggle to get the virus under control. Despite this, Grainger Canada achieved its revenue and margin targets in the first quarter. 
The Endless Assortment segment grew over 27% as we execute the playbook and gain momentum with our strategy. The team continues to add SKUs beyond traditional MRO products, which helps grow web traffic. Our continued marketing efforts and more targeted discounting strategies are working well in driving operating margin expansion at Zoro. Also, we are gaining real traction with new customer acquisition [indiscernible] Zoro MonotaRO. 
Finally, I'm excited to announce that MonotaRO opened its newest distribution center in Ibaraki, Japan, which will allow the business to stock additional high-demand products locally. 
Shifting to the financial results. We achieved organic daily sales growth of 5.9% for the total company on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., we started to lap the volatility of 2020. And in the first quarter of 2021, we drove approximately 250 basis points of market outgrowth. To normalize for all the volatility, we looked at a 2-year average share gain, which we believe is a more reasonable measure about growth. Using this, we averaged 475 basis points of annual market outgrowth from 2019 to 2021. We anticipate showing both measures going forward. 
Endless Assortment had strong performance in the quarter with 27.4% daily sales growth. For the total company, we delivered operating margin of 11.6%, with 210 basis points in adjusted SG&A leverage more than offsetting the anticipated GP pressure from pandemic inventory adjustments. To be clear, we expect to sell through the remainder of these noncore pandemic products and complete any potential market-driven inventory adjustments by the end of Q2. 
Finally, we generated $294 million in operating cash flow, returned $56 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks and maintained strong ROIC of 30.3%. All in all, we are very pleased with this performance and our trajectory. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dee to take us through our first quarter results. Dee?"

We'll also continue to provide transparency into the U.S., Canada, MonotaRO and the Zoro U.S. business. As we lap the pandemic, we will continue to provide pandemic-related data to clarify our results, especially for the U.S. 
Turning to our quarterly results. Organic daily sales, which adjusts for the divestitures of Fabory in China finished up 7% and 5.9% on a constant currency basis, underpinned by growth in both segments. Note that we have 1 less selling day in Q1 2021 versus Q1 2020. 
At the total company level, GP was down 190 basis points. A 180 basis points of this was driven by pandemic-fueled inventory adjustments in the U.S., consistent with what we shared in our Q4 2020 earnings call. We anticipated the need for adjustments. As D.G. shared, we expect to complete any potential market-driven inventory adjustments by the end of the second quarter, and we estimate the amount will be similar to or lower than Q1. This expectation has been factored into our GP ramp as well as our 2021 guidance. 
Endless Assortment expanded gross margins overall, driven by continued improvement at Zoro. While the mix impact of growing these businesses is dilutive to company gross margin, it drives incremental gross profit and earnings dollars and is an important driver for company performance. 
SG&A of $735 million was favorable by $43 million year-over-year, in line with our expectations shared last quarter. We captured 210 basis points of SG&A leverage in the period through continued proven cost control in the High-Touch Solutions segment and strong expense leverage in Endless Assortment. This resulted in total company operating margin of 11.6%, up 20 basis points over last year. 
The business continues to produce robust cash flow with operating cash flow of $294 million, 124% of net adjusted earnings and free cash flow of $221 million. We also returned $175 million back to shareholders through repurchases and $81 million of dividends in the period. 
Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment. Daily sales increased 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020. We started to lap the pandemic sales spike in mid-February, resulting in more challenging comparisons. In the U.S., daily sales were up 3.5%. In Canada, daily sales were up 3.3% in U.S. dollars, however, still down 2.8% in local days and local currency. Canada's decline was primarily driven by pandemic disruptions, most notably with our natural resource customer. As we diversified beyond natural resources, we are seeing improvements in our targeted end markets, including health care, higher education and manufacturing. 
For the segment, GP finished the quarter at 37.4%, a sequential improvement of 30 basis points versus Q4 2020 and down 230 basis points versus the prior year. The year-over-year decline was due to the inventory adjustments in the U.S. and pandemic mix in Canada. Excluding the adjustment, U.S. GP would have been up versus prior year, which is a better indicator of expected performance moving forward. We have included a chart towards the end of this presentation, which highlights the impact of the pandemic inventory adjustments in the U.S. by quarter. 
Finally, we continue to gain SG&A leverage with a cost down $24 million, driven by reduced travel expenses and general operating efficiencies in both the U.S. and Canada. Canada expanded operating margins 110 basis points over prior year. As a part of our commitment to providing continued transparency of our U.S. and Canadian businesses, we've included a chart with details in the appendix. 
Moving on to Slide 9. Looking at pandemic product growth trends. We have started to lap the spike experienced in early 2020. For reference, pandemic product sales grew 41% in the first quarter of 2020. Accordingly, growth rates have eased throughout the quarter this year, growing a very modest 1% year-over-year. Pandemic mix as a percent of the total remained elevated at 25%. As a comparison point, mix was 19% in 2019 and rose to 28% for the full year of 2020. 
Most importantly, though, on the non-pandemic side, things continue to improve. We started to see year-over-year sales growth in non-pandemic product sales in March of this year, with daily sales dollars increasing sequentially each month during the quarter, with April ending up roughly 36%, the highest growth to date in 2021. This is a very encouraging sign that trends, especially for customer business activities, are beginning to revert to more normal levels. 
Looking at share gain on Slide 10. We estimate the U.S. MRO market grew between 0.5% to 1.5% in the first quarter, showing continued improvement as the economy recovers. We knew there will be tremendous noise in measuring share gains throughout 2021, given the extreme volatility of the prior year. Our 2020 share gain was inflated due to the pandemic corresponding -- correspondingly, our 2021 share gain will be muted as we lap the unusual sales pipes from non-repeat orders. We outgrew the market by roughly 250 basis points in the quarter, and we lapped the pandemic sales pipe. 
To eliminate the noise and better understand our market outgrowth, we've also provided a 2-year average share gain metric. While imperfect, it does normalize activity across the 2-year period and provides a more reasonable view into our share gains since the end of 2019. The 2-year average was approximately 475 basis points. Each quarter, we plan to share both numbers. We think this will be especially helpful in the second quarter given the extreme volatility. 
We remain confident in our ability to serve new and existing customers during these challenging times and to produce 300 to 400 basis points of sustainable ARP growth in our U.S. High-Touch Solutions business. 
Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Daily sales increased 27.4% or 23.3% on a constant currency basis, driven by new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO as well as MonotaRO's continued pursuit of large enterprise customers in Japan. I will share some of our key growth metrics to provide further color into how we think about these businesses. 
GP expanded 35 basis points year-over-year, driven by Zoro's improved discounting strategies. Operating margins expanded 185 basis points due primarily to substantial SG&A leverage at Zoro. 
Moving to Slide 12. We have provided further transparency on the results of both businesses. As you're aware, MonotaRO is a public company, and as such, MonotaRO follows Japanese generally accounted -- accepted accounting principles, or JGAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP. 
In Grainger's consolidated results, we translate MonotaRO financials into U.S. dollars and U.S. GAAP. In addition, we continue to report MonotaRO's results 1 month in arrears. As a result, the numbers we disclosed will differ somewhat from MonotaRO's public statements. In local currency and using Japan's local selling days, we occasionally differ from U.S. -- which occasionally differ from U.S. selling days, MonotaRO's daily sales grew 25.5% with GP finishing the quarter at 26.5%, 10 basis points below prior year. Operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 12%. 
This is a very strong quarter for MonotaRO. We're excited for the new distribution center that will allow them to stock many of their fastest moving items locally. They also continue to make enhancements in both product information and order management systems, helping to improve the customer search experience and delivery speed, preparing them for the future. 
Switching to Zoro U.S., margin is our strongest average daily sales month at Zoro's inception in 2010, with daily sales up 15.2%, driven by strong customer acquisition. In addition, we drove solid SG&A leverage resulting in 370 basis points of operating margin expansion. 
I'd like to spend a minute on the metrics we are using to measure progress on our growth initiatives for both Zoro and MonotaRO. On the left side of the chart, we've listed total registered users for both businesses. This is a long-standing metric that MonotaRO has shared externally. Growing our registered user base is an important driver of top line performance. And as you can see, both businesses have shown tremendous progress. 
Moving to the right side, Zoro is aggressively adding SKUs to the portfolio. Having an expansive assortment is a key factor to Zoro's customer acquisition and growth strategy. As of Q1 2021, we had a total of 6.7 million SKUs available online. We are excited by our robust pipeline and targeting to reach 10 million total SKUs by 2024. 
Before I discuss our full year 2021 guidance, I'd like to first provide additional color on the quarter to help you understand what we expect as the economy recovers and our business performance improves. From a sales perspective, our preliminary results for April are strong. As last April was our softest sales month of the year, we expect to grow -- we expect our growth to moderate in May and June and to end the second quarter up between 14% and 16% on a daily organic basis. Note that our reported revenue growth will be about 280 basis points lower as Fabory in China, both of those businesses were divested after June of 2020. 
We expect Q2 company GP to be roughly flat on a sequential basis, which implies down about 30 basis points year-over-year. The pandemic impacts, including inventory adjustments and mix continue to improve both sequentially and year-over-year. We're starting to see modest cost inflation, especially on some specific product categories on raw materials such as resin and steel. While the quarters may still be a bit bumpy as the timing of cost increases and price actions do not align perfectly, we expect price/cost spread to be neutral for the year. 
We're also starting to see general inflation in the freight market, especially in ocean freight rates and LTL shipping. In the second quarter, we expect air shipment will be muted as we're lapping inflated prior year costs from air shipment. 
For SG&A, We expect to see cost step up most notably in the second quarter as business activity resumes. Specifically, we expect increases in travel variable compensation and merit as well as advertising business we take advantage of hiring returns. With this, we anticipate SG&A between $780 million and $800 million for the second quarter of 2021 and to remain in this general range for the remaining quarters of the year. This will drive leverage for the full year versus both 2020 and 2019. 
As always, we remain focused on managing costs while continuing to invest in the business for the long term. We have learned a great deal due to the pandemic and don't expect all costs to return to pre-pandemic levels in before. Related to U.S. GP, we still expect to see improved rates of pandemic mix reverts to more normal levels and as we put non-core and inventory adjustments behind us. Rev rate margins are stabilizing, and we maintain our expectation that we will exit the year with U.S. GP rate as high or higher with Q1 2020 levels. 
As a reminder, this relates to the U.S. business. We choose to highlight it because it represents more than 70% of the total company results and was most heavily impacted by the pandemic. As we become more comfortable with the pace of the economic recovery, primarily in the U.S., coupled with our recent performance, we are providing full year 2021 guidance and we'll provide updates as we move through the year. 
For the total company, we expect daily sales growth between 8.5% and 11% or 10% and 12.5% organically, driven by strong top line performance in both segments. Within our High-Touch Solutions segment, we anticipate the U.S. business will grow between 7% and 9.5% based on estimated MRO market growth between 6.5% and 9%. This yields 1-year market outgrowth of roughly 50 basis points and a 2-year average annual outgrowth of 425 basis points. The 2-year average normalizes for the extreme bills pipes experienced in 2020 and anchors to 2019. 
In Canada, the recovery is a bit more choppy than the U.S. with a slower vaccine rollout and recent business shutdowns. With that in mind, we do expect volumes to stabilize as we move through the year. We expect Endless Assortment to continue growing at roughly 20% as the MonotaRO team delivers consistently strong results and as we rapidly add SKUs and continue to drive greater marketing efficiencies at Zoro. 
From a profitability perspective, total company GP is expected to be between 36.1% and 36.6%, up -- and 70 basis points in 2021. Both the High-Touch Solutions and Endless Assortment segment are expanding gross profit margin. However, there is a roughly 30 basis point dilutive impact to total company GP as a lower-margin Endless Assortment growth outpaces the High-Touch Solutions segment. Both segments are expected to deliver high ROIC and drive GP and earnings dollars growth for the company. 
For High-Touch Solutions, our GP guidance incorporates the sequential improvement in the back half of the year as we move beyond the unfavorable pandemic impacts and get back to more normal business operations. For the year in the U.S., we expect our price/cost spread to be neutral. Total company operating margins are expected to be between 11.8% and 12.4% and expand between 50 and 115 basis points versus 2020. At the midpoint, we expect our operating lines will be back to 2019 levels. 
Operating margin improvement are expected to be driven by both GP expansion versus 2020 loans and SG&A leverage as we grow the top line while maintaining cost discipline. These top line and profitability target as well as continued execution of our [indiscernible] purchase program are expected to produce earnings per share between $19 and $2.50. That's growth between 17.5% and 26.5%. 
Continuing with guidance on Slide 17. In addition to the total company guidance, we wanted to provide some additional color by segment as well as our plans for capital allocation. At the segment level, we expect operating margin expansion in both of our reportable segment with margins in High-Touch Solutions between 13.2% and 13.7% and Endless Assortment ranging between 8.8% and 9.2%.  Cromwell  represented and other is expected to reduce operating losses and anticipate closing the year with operating margin down approximately 7%. We expect to cut Cromwell's losses in half and return the business to profitability in the back half of 2022. 
From a cash flow perspective for the year, we expect operating cash flow to be between $1 billion and $1.2 billion. Our capital expenditures outlook for the year remains between $225 million and $275 million. The large majority of our investment this year includes DC expansion in Japan, keep stock enhancements in the U.S., continued IT investment and a normal level of maintenance capital. We expect the balance of our cash to be used to fund our quarterly dividend and to continue executing against our new share repurchase authorization. 
For 2021, we are expecting between $600 million and $700 million of share repurchases, which continues to reflect our confidence in successfully executing our strategy and growth initiatives. And I'll close with a highlight on our dividend announced this week, representing 50 consecutive years of dividend increases, a testament to the strength and stability of our business and our commitment to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks."

We've already seen -- we're getting away a little bit from the U.S. supply chain. The U.S. supply chain still makes up the bulk of the shipments, but not -- we'll not be in that position forever. 
And one of the thing -- the reason that's important is on any way you look at it, the return on invested capital of the business going forward is going to be very strong. Today, if we allocate some of the U.S. inventory is strong, very strong. And as it goes forward, it will even be stronger.

Today, I'll provide a brief overview of our first quarter results, key initiatives and encouraging signs for our business as the economy recovers. Of note, this will be our first quarter with results aligned to our 2 new reportable segments. Also, as MonotaRO, our majority-owned subsidiary, is a publicly traded company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, we have now aligned the timing of our earnings releases. 
I am very proud of the way the Grainger team has continued to serve our customers through the recovery and has addressed new challenges as they arise. We are supporting many customers through vaccination deployment, including pharmacies and other large sites. Recently, we partnered with the State University Medical Center, the National Guard and the Department of Health to support a mass vaccination site. We outfitted the site with important pandemic-related products like safety equipment as well as more traditional MRO product needed to support the operation, like power and extension cords, lighting and traffic columns. As it ramped up, this site has been able to facilitate thousands of vaccination today. 
We're seeing vaccination distribution progressing around the world, albeit at different speeds. In the U.S., as more of the population gets vaccinated, we're seeing many customers return to their normal operations and purchasing patterns. This is evident as our non-pandemic sales continue to return to normal levels and as sales in most end markets grow sequentially. In the U.K., we're seeing business activity rise. In Canada, slower vaccine distribution and potential shutdowns are slowing the business recovery. We're also seeing a modestly slower recovery in Japan. No matter what stage of the recovery our customers are in, our relationships with them are very strong, given our support of their operations over the past year. 
Part of being there for our customers meant having the products they needed when they needed it. To bring this to life, at this time last year, when customers needed hand sanitizer, we sold them 55 gallon drums and they were filling their own containers. As supply constraints eased, customers reverted back to purchasing more normal PPE SKUs and far fewer 55 gallon drums. 
As I've said before, we took calculated risks in procuring pandemic products and reasonable alternatives, especially in the second quarter of 2020. As the pandemic progressed and market dynamics changed, we had to revalue some of our inventory in Q4 and again in Q1. We anticipate further price deterioration on some of these noncore alternative pandemic products. While our profitability on these products including all potential write-downs was below normal, supporting our customers by taking these risks was the right thing to do. We improved relationships with our existing customers, developed new repeat business and delivered strong incremental growth at lower but still profitable margins. 
On last quarter's call, we shared our first quarter expectations. As it relates to revenue in the first quarter, all of our businesses surpassed our outlook. We expected first quarter company GP to be down 150 to 200 basis points versus prior year, and our actual results fell within this stated range. 
Excluding the inventory adjustments, our U.S. GP was up versus prior year, giving us further confidence in the path forward. Based on our strong results and improving economic trends, we are providing full year guidance, which we will discuss in a few minutes. 
Within our High-Touch Solutions segment, we continue to make progress on our key initiatives across geographies. The U.S. has seen positive signs of economic recovery with growth of non-pandemic sales in virtually all segments. The exception is health care, which has very high pandemic-fueled comps. Gross margins are returning to pre-pandemic levels in the U.S., net of inventory adjustments. In Canada, the path to recovery is slower as they struggle to get the virus under control. Despite this, Grainger Canada achieved its revenue and margin targets in the first quarter. 
The Endless Assortment segment grew over 27% as we execute the playbook and gain momentum with our strategy. The team continues to add SKUs beyond traditional MRO products, which helps grow web traffic, our continued marketing efforts and more targeted discounting strategies are working well in driving operating margin expansion at Zoro. Also, we are gaining real traction with new customer acquisition [ at both ] Zoro, MonotaRO. 
Finally, I'm excited to announce that MonotaRO has opened its newest distribution center in Ibaraki, Japan, which will allow the business to stock additional high-demand products locally. 
Shifting to the financial results. We achieved organic daily sales growth of 5.9% for the total company on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., we started to lap the volatility of 2020. And in the first quarter of 2021, we drove approximately 250 basis points of market outgrowth. To normalize for all the volatility, we looked at a 2-year average share gain, which we believe is a more reasonable measure of our growth. Using this, we averaged 475 basis points of annual market outgrowth from 2019 to 2021. We anticipate showing both measures going forward. 
Endless Assortment had strong performance in the quarter with 27.4% daily sales growth. For the total company, we delivered operating margin of 11.6%, with 210 basis points in adjusted SG&A leverage more than offsetting the anticipated GP pressure from pandemic inventory adjustments. To be clear, we expect to sell through the remainder of these noncore pandemic products and complete any potential market-driven inventory adjustments by the end of Q2. 
Finally, we generated $294 million in operating cash flow, returned $256 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks and maintained strong ROIC of 30.3%. All in all, we are very pleased with this performance and our trajectory. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dee to take us through our first quarter results. Dee?"

We'll also continue to provide transparency into the U.S., Canada, MonotaRO and the Zoro U.S. business. As we lap the pandemic, we will continue to provide pandemic-related data to clarify our results, especially for the U.S. 
Turning to our quarterly results. Organic daily sales, which adjusts for the divestitures of Fabory in China finished up 7% and 5.9% on a constant currency basis, underpinned by growth in both segments. Note that we have 1 less selling day in Q1 2021 versus Q1 2020. 
At the total company level, GP was down 190 basis points. A 180 basis points of this was driven by pandemic-fueled inventory adjustments in the U.S., consistent with what we shared in our Q4 2020 earnings call. We anticipated the need for adjustments. As D.G. shared, we expect to complete any potential market-driven inventory adjustments by the end of the second quarter, and we estimate the amount will be similar to or lower than Q1. This expectation has been factored into our GP ramp as well as our 2021 guidance. 
Endless Assortment expanded gross margins overall, driven by continued improvement at Zoro. While the mix impact of growing these businesses is dilutive to company gross margin, it drives incremental gross profit and earnings dollars and is an important driver for company performance. 
SG&A of $735 million was favorable by $43 million year-over-year, in line with our expectations shared last quarter. We captured 210 basis points of SG&A leverage in the period through continued proven cost control in the High-Touch Solutions segment and strong expense leverage in Endless Assortment. This resulted in total company operating margin of 11.6%, up 20 basis points over last year. 
The business continues to produce robust cash flow with operating cash flow of $294 million, 124% of net adjusted earnings and free cash flow of $221 million. We also returned $175 million back to shareholders through repurchases and $81 million of dividends in the period. 
Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment. Daily sales increased 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020. We started to lap the pandemic sales spike in mid-February, resulting in more challenging comparisons. In the U.S., daily sales were up 3.5%. In Canada, daily sales were up 3.3% in U.S. dollars, however, still down 2.8% in local days and local currency. Canada's decline was primarily driven by pandemic disruptions, most notably with our natural resource customer. As we diversified beyond natural resources, we are seeing improvements in our targeted end markets, including health care, higher education and manufacturing. 
For the segment, GP finished the quarter at 37.4%, a sequential improvement of 30 basis points versus Q4 2020 and down 230 basis points versus the prior year. The year-over-year decline was due to the inventory adjustments in the U.S. and pandemic mix in Canada. Excluding the adjustment, U.S. GP would have been up versus prior year, which is a better indicator of expected performance moving forward. We have included a chart towards the end of this presentation, which highlights the impact of the pandemic inventory adjustments in the U.S. by quarter. 
Finally, we continue to gain SG&A leverage with our cost down $24 million, driven by reduced travel expenses and general operating efficiencies in both the U.S. and Canada. Canada expanded operating margins 110 basis points over prior year. 
As a part of our commitment to providing continued transparency of our U.S. and Canadian businesses, we've included a chart with details in the appendix. 
Moving on to Slide 9. Looking at pandemic product growth trends. We have started to lap the spike experienced in early 2020. For reference, pandemic product sales grew 41% in the first quarter of 2020. Accordingly, growth rates have eased throughout the quarter this year, growing a very modest 1% year-over-year. Pandemic mix as a percent of the total remained elevated at 25%. As a comparison point, mix was 19% in 2019 and rose to 28% for the full year of 2020. Most importantly, though, on the non-pandemic side, things continue to improve. We started to see year-over-year sales growth in non-pandemic product sales in March of this year, with daily sales dollars increasing sequentially each month during the quarter, with April ending up roughly 36%, the highest growth to date in 2021. This is a very encouraging sign that trends, especially for customer business activities, are beginning to revert to more normal levels. 
Looking at share gain on Slide 10. We estimate the U.S. MRO market grew between 0.5% to 1.5% in the first quarter, showing continued improvement as the economy recovers. We knew there will be tremendous noise in measuring share gains throughout 2021, given the extreme volatility of the prior year. Our 2020 share gain was inflated due to the pandemic. Correspondingly, our 2021 share gain will be muted as we lap the unusual sales spikes from non-repeat orders. We outgrew the market by roughly 250 basis points in the quarter as we lapped the pandemic sales spike. 
To eliminate the noise and better understand our market outgrowth, we've also provided a 2-year average share gain metric. While imperfect, it does normalize activity across the 2-year period and provides a more reasonable view into our share gains since the end of 2019. The 2-year average was approximately 475 basis points. Each quarter, we plan to share both numbers. We think this will be especially helpful in the second quarter given the extreme volatility. 
We remain confident in our ability to serve new and existing customers during these challenging times and to produce 300 to 400 basis points of sustainable outgrowth in our U.S. High-Touch Solutions business. 
Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Daily sales increased 27.4% or 23.3% on a constant currency basis, driven by new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO as well as MonotaRO's continued pursuit of large enterprise customers in Japan. I will share some of our key growth metrics to provide further color into how we think about these businesses. 
GP expanded 35 basis points year-over-year, driven by Zoro's improved discounting strategies. Operating margins expanded 185 basis points due primarily to substantial SG&A leverage at Zoro. 
Moving to Slide 12. We have provided further transparency on the results of both businesses. As you're aware, MonotaRO is a public company, and as such, MonotaRO follows Japanese generally accounted -- accepted accounting principles, or JGAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP. 
In Grainger's consolidated results, we translate MonotaRO financials into U.S. dollars and U.S. GAAP. In addition, we continue to report MonotaRO's results 1 month in arrears. As a result, the numbers we disclosed will differ somewhat from MonotaRO's public statements. In local currency and using Japan's local selling days, we occasionally differ from U.S. -- which occasionally differ from U.S. selling days. MonotaRO's daily sales grew 25.5% with GP finishing the quarter at 26.5%, 10 basis points below prior year. Operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 12%. This is a very strong quarter for MonotaRO. We're excited for the new distribution center that will allow them to stock many of their fastest moving items locally. They also continue to make enhancements in both product information and order management systems, helping to improve the customer search experience and delivery speed, preparing them for the future. 
Switching to Zoro U.S., March is our strongest average daily sales month since Zoro's inception in 2010, with daily sales up 15.2%, driven by strong customer acquisition. In addition, we drove solid SG&A leverage, resulting in 370 basis points of operating margin expansion. 
I'd like to spend a minute on the metrics we are using to measure progress on our growth initiatives for both Zoro and MonotaRO. On the left side of the chart, we've listed total registered users for both businesses. This is a long-standing metric that MonotaRO has shared externally. Growing our registered user base is an important driver of top line performance. And as you can see, both businesses have shown tremendous progress. 
Moving to the right side, Zoro is aggressively adding SKUs to the portfolio. Having an expansive assortment is a key factor to Zoro's customer acquisition and growth strategy. As of Q1 2021, we had a total of 6.7 million SKUs available online. We are excited by our robust pipeline and targeting to reach 10 million total SKUs by 2024. 
Before I discuss our full year 2021 guidance, I'd like to first provide additional color on the current quarter to help you understand what we expect as the economy recovers and our business performance improves. From a sales perspective, our preliminary results for April are strong. As last April was our softest sales month of the year, we expect to grow -- we expect our growth to moderate in May and June and to end the second quarter up between 14% and 16% on a daily organic basis. Note that our reported revenue growth will be about 280 basis points lower as Fabory in China, both of those businesses were divested after June of 2020. 
We expect Q2 company GP to be roughly flat on a sequential basis, which implies down about 30 basis points year-over-year. The pandemic impacts, including inventory adjustments and mix continue to improve both sequentially and year-over-year. We're starting to see modest cost inflation, especially on some specific product categories on raw materials such as resin and steel. While the quarters may still be a bit bumpy as the timing of cost increases and price actions do not align perfectly, we expect price/cost spread to be neutral for the year. 
We're also starting to see general inflation in the freight market, especially in ocean freight rates and LTL shipping. In the second quarter, we expect freight headwind will be muted as we're lapping inflated prior year costs from air shipment. 
For SG&A, We expect to see cost step up most notably in the second quarter as business activity resumes. Specifically, we expect increases in travel, variable compensation and merit as well as advertising spend as we take advantage of higher returns. With this, we anticipate SG&A between $780 million and $800 million for the second quarter of 2021 and to remain in this general range for the remaining quarters of the year. This will drive leverage for the full year versus both 2020 and 2019. 
As always, we remain focused on managing costs while continuing to invest in the business for the long term. We've learned a great deal due to the pandemic and don't expect all costs to return to pre-pandemic levels than before. Related to U.S. GP, we still expect to see improved rates of pandemic mix reverts to more normal levels and as we put noncore pandemic and inventory adjustments behind us. Rev rate margins are stabilizing, and we maintain our expectation that we will exit the year with U.S. GP rate as high or higher with Q1 2020 levels. 
As a reminder, this slide relates to the U.S. business. We choose to highlight it because it represents more than 70% of the total company results and was most heavily impacted by the pandemic. As we become more comfortable with the pace of the economic recovery, primarily in the U.S., coupled with our recent performance, we are providing full year 2021 guidance and we'll provide updates as we move through the year. 
For the total company, we expect daily sales growth between 8.5% and 11% or 10% and 12.5% organically, driven by strong top line performance in both segments. Within our High-Touch Solutions segment, we anticipate the U.S. business will grow between 7% and 9.5% based on estimated MRO market growth between 6.5% and 9%. This yields 1-year market outgrowth of roughly 50 basis points and a 2-year average annual outgrowth of 425 basis points. The 2-year average normalizes for the extreme sales spikes experienced in 2020 and anchors to 2019. 
In Canada, the recovery is a bit more choppy than the U.S. with a slower vaccine rollout and recent business shutdowns. With that in mind, we do expect volumes to stabilize as we move through the year. We expect Endless Assortment to continue growing at roughly 20% as the MonotaRO team delivers consistently strong results and as we rapidly add SKUs and continue to drive greater marketing efficiencies at Zoro. 
From a profitability perspective, total company GP is expected to be between 36.1% and 36.6%, up in 2020 and 70 basis points in 2021. Both the High-Touch Solutions and Endless Assortment segment are expanding gross profit margin. However, there is a roughly 30 basis point dilutive impact to total company GP as a lower-margin Endless Assortment growth outpaces the High-Touch Solutions segment. Both segments are expected to deliver high ROIC and drive GP and earnings dollars growth for the company. 
For High-Touch Solutions, our GP guidance incorporates the sequential improvement in the back half of the year as we move beyond the unfavorable pandemic impacts and get back to more normal business operations. For the year in the U.S., we expect our price/cost spread to be neutral. Total company operating margins are expected to be between 11.8% and 12.4% and expand between 50 and 115 basis points versus 2020. At the midpoint, we expect our operating lines will be back to 2019 levels. 
Operating margin improvement are expected to be driven by both GP expansion versus 2020 loans and SG&A leverage as we grow the top line while maintaining cost discipline. These top line and profitability target as well as continued execution of our share purchase program are expected to produce earnings per share between $19 and $20.50. That's growth between 17.5% and 26.5%. 
Continuing with guidance on Slide 17. In addition to the total company guidance, we wanted to provide some additional color by segment as well as our plans for capital allocation. At the segment level, we expect operating margin expansion in both of our reportable segment with margins in High-Touch Solutions between 13.2% and 13.7% and Endless Assortment ranging between 8.8% and 9.2%. Cromwell represented and Other is expected to reduce operating losses and anticipate closing the year with operating margin down approximately 7%. We expect to cut Cromwell's losses in half and return the business to profitability in the back half of 2022. 
From a cash flow perspective for the year, we expect operating cash flow to be between $1 billion and $1.2 billion. Our capital expenditures outlook for the year remains between $225 million and $275 million. The large majority of our investment this year includes DC expansion in Japan, keep stock enhancements in the U.S., continued IT investment and a normal level of maintenance capital. We expect the balance of our cash to be used to fund our quarterly dividend and to continue executing against our new share repurchase authorization. 
For 2021, we are expecting between $600 million and $700 million of share repurchases, which continues to reflect our confidence in successfully executing our strategy and growth initiatives. And I'll close with a highlight on our dividend announced this week, representing 50 consecutive years of dividend increases, a testament to the strength and stability of our business and our commitment to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks."

And so if you go back to 2019, what we see is a very consistent increase in non-pandemic relative to that 2019 anchor. And we see the pandemic sales continue to be elevated but not as elevated as time goes on. And so really, if you think about the revenue outlook for us, we're basically taking run rates and looking at what we think is going to happen with run rate. And that gets us to the numbers we're talking about. So you don't have to believe a lot about anything really changing in the macro versus just continued recovery. We still have some segments that are struggling, that aren't anywhere near where they were before. But a lot of the economy is really back and running fairly smoothly and the non-pandemic is as well with those segments."

We expect -- the one thing I'd point out is over time, and you've already started to see this, as we've added SKUs into the assortment, we actually leveraged third-party shipper relationships more. We've already seen -- we're getting away a little bit from the U.S. supply chain. The U.S. supply chain still makes up the bulk of the shipments, but not -- we'll not be in that position forever. 
And one of the thing -- the reason that's important is on any way you look at it, the return on invested capital of the business going forward is going to be very strong.

Today, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter results and progress toward our goals as the economy recovers. Before we get into details on the quarter, I'd like to spend a moment highlighting -- strategy and the principles that drive our actions. It all starts with our purpose. We keep the world working. We shared this with all team members across the company in 2019. 
[Audio Gap] 
The Grainger Edge has guided us through the pandemic, and I'm proud of how the Grainger team has continued to embrace it. It's also been a strong foundation for how we serve our customers and helped us through the challenges of the last 18 months. 
Speaking of challenges, 2021 has provided plenty. The year has been characterized by strong demand but a very challenging supply chain environment. Raw material shortages, labor shortages and transportation challenges have been the norm NOR, particularly in the second quarter. These challenges are industry-wide. And while we're not immune to them, we are uniquely positioned to leverage our scale and navigate through these ongoing difficulties. 
Importantly, this year, the supply chain has become a competitive sport. And while we've had obstacles and things are messier than normal, our customer research suggests we are navigating the obstacles well and providing very strong relative service during this time. We are actively leveraging our network. For example, for a customer located in New York, we would typically fulfill their entire order from our Northeast DC. Due to supply constraints or product delays, now part of the order may only be available in Louisville. In this case, the order may be fulfilled from Louisville, adding an extra day and incremental cost to the order. But we are able to leverage our network to provide and protect our great service. 
We are also leveraging our branches for more shipping in this environment. In addition, we have accelerated the ramp of our Louisville DC, which has helped alleviate capacity constraints. This building is a great asset for Grainger, and will continue to ramp capacity through the next 18 months. The good news is that we still have very high availability in our network even if the product comes from an alternate location. 
I've had the opportunity to be in the field quite a bit this past quarter and have been excited to spend time with the customers and hear their feedback. I'm hearing consistently that, while we may be delivering a bit differently than the past, we are serving our customers better than the competition. [indiscernible] pandemic inventory and partnering closely with our suppliers to work through any supply constraints, inbound lead time challenges and any potential cost increases. 
Additionally, shortage in the labor market have had a significant impact for all companies this year. In response, we have increased our wages to attract and retain talent, especially in our distribution centers. We've implemented robust training programs to onboard new team members and train existing team members to work throughout our buildings. We have made great progress in closing staffing gaps and will continue to do so over the third quarter. 
Finally, transportation has been very challenging. That is clearly linked to the product and labor shortages. While we have always prioritized optimal routes and cost efficiencies, over the last few months, we have partnered with our carriers in new ways to ensure we are meeting customer expectations. We have also added new partners to our carrier mix to handle our volume and provide us flexibility. 
It's important to note that the overall freight market is volatile and uncertain. While we are confident in our current plans to manage these challenges, there are a lot of moving pieces and constraints across all modes, parcel, LTL and ocean freight. For example, the ocean freight market has been uncertain as the pandemic surges again in Asia and container costs fluctuate. We are ready to respond to any of these dynamics. 
We expect the supply chain challenges to last through the end of the year and likely well into next year. I have no doubt, as we continue to live the Grainger Edge and follow our principles, we'll not only get through these challenges, but will deliver strong results and take market share. 
Turning to our financial highlights. The bottom line is that our performance has been in line with our expectations and what we communicated on our last earnings call. The only exception that this has been gross profit impacted primarily by the changes in May to the CDC mask guidelines halfway through the quarter. Heading into the second quarter, all external factors were pointing to a reopening in the U.S. around or sometime after the fourth of July, giving us a full quarter to sell through as much of our remaining pandemic inventory as possible. 
Based on our internal scenario planning, we thought that potential adjustments in Q2 would fall so our demand for pandemic products, especially masks, declined rapidly. As a result of the sudden weakening of demand, we had more pandemic inventory remaining than expected, and we took a $63 million adjustment, about $15 million more than our internal scenario planning. We believe this completes any material pandemic-related inventory adjustments. Without this incremental change, GP would have been roughly flat sequentially. We understand that CDC has just changed guidance again this week. While the situation is fluid, we do not expect any material change in our outlook as a result of this change. 
Shifting to the other financial results. We achieved strong organic daily sales growth of 15% for the company on a constant currency basis within our guided range. When compared to 2019, Q2 was up about 14% on a daily organic basis, a positive indicator of our strong performance and recovery beyond the pandemic. 
Our High-Touch Solutions North America segment grew 12.7% on a daily constant currency basis. In the U.S., we lapped the most extreme volatility of 2020. Looking at the 2-year average in the second quarter of 2021, we drove approximately 275 basis points of average market outgrowth. We remain very confident in our ability to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market on an ongoing basis. We expect the volatility of 2020 and 2021 to average out and get back to normal heading into 2022. 
Our Canadian business drove positive operating earnings growth for the quarter and managed expense as well. We are seeing continued momentum in targeted end markets, especially heavy manufacturing and higher education as schools prepare to reopen in the fall. And we continue to diversify the business beyond natural resources. 
The Endless Assortment model had another impressive quarter with 23.9% daily sales growth on a constant currency basis, fueled by strong customer acquisition. Lastly, we generated $269 million in operating cash flow and achieved strong ROIC of 29.2%. 
Turning to our quarterly results for the company. I've discussed most of what's on this slide, but I wanted to point out 2 additional items. First, our SG&A was $790 million, in line with the guided range provided on our first quarter call. As expected, we increased SG&A for the quarter as we continue to invest in marketing and in our people through increased variable compensation and wage rates in the DCs. This resulted in total company operating margin of 10.4%, down 70 basis points compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the $15 million incremental inventory adjustment, GP would have been roughly flat sequentially and operating margin would have been 10.9%. Resulting EPS would have been around $4.50. 
With that, I will turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail on our 2 segments. Dee?"

Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment. We continue to see a robust recovery with daily sales up 13.7% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and  up 9.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019.

We continue to see a robust recovery with daily sales up 13.7% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and  up 9.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. In the U.S., we saw strong growth in our nonpandemic product category with product mix returning to more normal levels. 
For the segment, GP finished the quarter at 36.9%, down 125 basis points versus the prior year. I think it's important to note that without the $63 million of inventory adjustment, GP would have been up 125 basis points year-over-year. This 250 basis point swing demonstrates that our underlying GP rate would have otherwise been a healthy 39.4%. Coupled with our focus on achieving price/cost neutrality, we are confident that our run rate GP remains strong. 
SG&A in the segment ramped as expected to $640 million -- in operating margin, approximately 315 basis points year-over-year. Consistent with last quarter, we have included a chart with details on the U.S. and the Canadian businesses on the first page of the appendix. 
On Slide 10, looking at pandemic product trends, I want to highlight 2 things before we dive into the Q2 numbers. First, we lapped the extreme growth experience last year and saw decreased demand for PPE products. Accordingly, pandemic sales declined approximately 28% versus 2020. However, that's an impressive 27% increase versus 2019. We estimate July 2021 will be down about 28% over July 2020, in line with what we saw in the second quarter of this year. 
More importantly, we see the trend in our non-dynamic sales as a positive sign of economic recovery. During the quarter, we grew 31% versus 2020 and up 7% versus 2019. We're seeing end markets like commercial, which include our severely disrupted customers in hospitality, along with heavy manufacturing, make a significant comeback. We estimate that for the month of July 2021, nonpandemic sales growth of about 22%. 
As it relates to pandemic product mix, while we 
expected it to taper off to near pre-pandemic levels to about 20% by year-end, we're seeing this happen more quickly now at about 22% of sales. In total, our U.S. High-Touch Solutions business is up about 12% for the second quarter of 2021 and up 10% over 2019. 
Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 11, we are lapping the highest concentration of large pandemic purchases of the prior year. At this time, the market declined between 14% and 15% and we saw outsized share gains of roughly 1,200 basis points. For Q2 2021, we're seeing the opposite effect. We estimate the U.S. MRO market grew between 18.5% and 19.5%. The U.S. High-Touch business grew 12.4%, about 650 basis points lower than the market. 
To normalize for the volatility, we calculated the 2-year average share gain to be 275 basis points over the market. There's some noise in the market number because across industrials, given the dynamics and fluctuations over the last 2 years. Therefore, the 2-year average is a better estimate of what's really going on. As I previously noted, our U.S. High-Touch business is up 10% over 2019. As the impact of the pandemic subside, coupled with our -- 
Now let's cover our U.S. GP rate. As previously discussed, our second quarter GP decline resulted from the $63 million inventory adjustment. This adjustment lowered U.S. GP by 270 basis points. Without this, our underlying U.S. GP rate is 39.8% in the second quarter. As we look to the remainder of 2021, it is important to note we are operating in a very challenging and fluid environment. We're doing everything within our control to exit the year with a Q4 GP rate at or above the Q1 2020 levels or 40.1%. 
We remain confident in our ability to achieve this target for a few reasons. First, as noted earlier, we anticipate no further material pandemic-related inventory adjustments. Excluding the inventory impact, our GP rate is nearing this level already. 
As we discussed on Slide 10, our pandemic product mix is close to pre-pandemic levels, and we expect this to fully normalize in the second half. And we've seen evidence that we can continue to maintain price/cost neutrality. On the cost side, we have a robust process to partner with our suppliers and understand the specific raw material impacts as well as other conditions that may result in increased costs. 
As it relates to price, our goal is to continue to maintain competitiveness in the market and pass what is applicable. In the first half, we were slightly above neutrality and as we expect to take additional price increases in the second half to offset what we're expecting in costs. Even in this inflationary environment, we are confident we will be able to execute and achieve neutrality through the remainder of the year. 
Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Daily sales increased 23% or 23.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued strength in new customer acquisitions at both Zoro and MonotaRO as well as growth of larger enterprise customers in MonotaRO.  GP expanded 75 basis points year-over-year driven by positive trends at both businesses and operating margin finished up 95 basis points over the prior year. I'll go into more detail on the next slide as we provide further transparency on the results of both of these businesses. 
Moving to Slide 14. Please remember that MonotaRO is a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP and is reported in our results 1 month in arrears. As a result, the numbers we disclosed would differ somewhat from MonotaRO's public statements. 
In local currency and using Japan's local selling days, which occasionally differ from U.S. selling days, MonotaRO's daily sales grew 16.7%, with GP finishing the quarter at 26.4%, 25 basis points above the prior year. Operating margin decreased 15 basis points to 12% as they continue to ramp up operations at the Ibaraki DC. Again, another strong quarter for MonotaRO. 
Switching to Zoro U.S., daily sales grew 32.6% as it laps its softest quarter of 2020. Zoro GP grew 95 basis points to 31.5% and achieved 320 basis points of operating margin expansion through substantial SG&A leverage in the quarter. All in all, very impressive results. 
Moving to Slide 15. In addition to the strong financial performance, we're seeing positive results with our key operating metrics. As you saw in the first quarter, we've listed total registered users for both businesses, an important driver of top line performance. Both MonotaRO and Zoro have shown progress and are up over 20% over the second quarter last year. 
On the right, Zoro continues to actively -- for the year. We remain encouraged by our progress with SKU additions beyond traditional MRO. 
Now I'll provide commentary as it relates to the upcoming quarter and our expectations for the full year. For the third quarter, on a total company level, we expect our revenue growth to be between 10% and 11% on a daily organic basis. We believe any material pandemic-related inventory adjustments are complete, and we expect GP to be up between 100 and 120 basis points year-over-year and to improve sequentially. SG&A is anticipated to fall between $805 million and $815 million as we continue to invest in marketing and wages in the DCs to remain competitive. 
Transitioning to our total company guidance, I'd like to provide some brief commentary on how we're trending so far. We expect strong sales to continue, while GP operating margin and EPS will face pressure as a result of the incremental inventory adjustments and freight costs, along with investments and increased DC wages and marketing. While we are maintaining our guidance, we expect results to trend towards the low end of our range with the exception of revenue. We expect revenue to be near the midpoint. 
As it relates to our segment operating margins, we think that some of the supply chain challenges as well as the first half inventory adjustment will weigh more heavily on the High-Touch Solutions segment, and therefore, High-Touch operating margin may trend at the low end of the range. At the same time, we believe Endless Assortment, driven by strong performance and improving margins, may end the year at the high end, both helping to support delivery of total company results. 
We are not adjusting guidance as we are confident in our ability to deliver results within our guidance ranges. As we learn more, we'll continue to keep you apprised of any changes. With that, I'll turn it back over to D.G. for some closing remarks."

First, I'm proud to announce that earlier this month, Grainger was certified as a Great Place to Work, a true testament to the exceptional team member experience we've built and an important milestone in advancing the Grainger Edge. 
Second is our tenth year of publicly reporting our ESG efforts. I wanted to share highlights from our new corporate responsibility report. At Grainger, we embrace our obligation to operate -- 2 years early. We just set a new goal last year to reduce the absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030.  We're also committed to helping our customers achieve their ESG goals through our products and services. We now offer more than 100,000 environmentally friendly products through this portfolio -- In 2017, Grainger signed the Chicago network equity pledge focused on achieving 50% representation of women in leadership positions by 2030. And this year, we formed the ESG Leadership Council, which I chair. The council is comprised of Grainger leaders who provide strategic direction and oversight on our ESG efforts. You can find the new report at graingeresg.com. With that, we will open up the line for questions."

And I would expect MonotaRO to have much higher sales per customer. One is -- in the Japanese market, there is no industrial distributors, broadline industrial distributors like there are in the U.S. that are direct to customer. So actually, the MonotaRO business is starting to build a pretty strong enterprise customer solution, and they're having some success there. We don't expect Zoro to do that because the competition in the U.S. is much more stiff on that front. And so they have some larger customers that Zoro doesn't have. Zoro is focused on that small business more fully and really focused there. So I think that's probably the primary difference, and I would expect that difference to continue. We expect the growth rates to be strong in both businesses, and we expect the margins to improve to high single digits in Zoro over the next couple of years. And so we feel like it's a great story. But I would expect that metric to be slightly different."

There are still some segments that are pretty, pretty significantly disrupted and some that are ranging.

In this year's, we're very pleased with the trajectory they're on. They're ahead of plan and doing very well. But this year's number in the second quarter, I wouldn't assume that that's going to be the number we see going forward because that is off of a very low number, given the supply decisions that we made last year.

But that is our goal. And we continue to focus on making sure we deliver a great customer experience and manage the business for long-term share gain and long-term margin expansion.

Today, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter results and progress toward our goals as the economy recovers. Before we get into details on the quarter, I'd like to spend a moment highlighting our Grainger Edge framework.
Two years ago, we launched this framework that defines who we are, why we exist and where we're going. It covers our purpose, aspiration strategy and the principles that drive our actions. It all starts with our purpose. We keep the world working. We shared this with all team members across the company in 2019. While the concepts weren't new and many were already part of our operational DNA, the framework provided clarity at who we are and what we do as well as the common language for our team members.
The Grainger Edge has guided us through the pandemic, and I'm proud of how the Grainger team has continued to embrace it. It's also been a strong foundation for how we serve our customers and helped us through the challenges of the last 18 months.
Speaking of challenges, 2021 has provided plenty. The year has been characterized by strong demand but a very challenging supply chain environment. Raw material shortages, labor shortages and transportation challenges have been the norm, particularly in the second quarter. These challenges are industry-wide. And while we're not immune to them, we are uniquely positioned to leverage our scale and navigate through these ongoing difficulties.
Importantly, this year, the supply chain has become a competitive sport. And while we've had obstacles and things are messier than normal, our customer research suggests we are navigating the obstacles well and providing very strong relative service during this time. We are actively leveraging our network. For example, for a customer located in New York, we would typically fulfill their entire order from our Northeast DC. Due to supply constraints or product delays, now part of the order may only be available in Louisville. In this case, the order may be fulfilled from Louisville, adding an extra day and incremental cost to the order. But we are able to leverage our network to provide and protect our great service.
We are also leveraging our branches for more shipping in this environment. In addition, we have accelerated the ramp of our Louisville DC, which has helped alleviate capacity constraints. This building is a great asset for Grainger and will continue to ramp capacity through the next 18 months. The good news is that we still have very high availability in our network even if the product comes from an alternate location.
I've had the opportunity to be in the field quite a bit this past quarter and have been excited to spend time with the customers and hear their feedback. I'm hearing consistently that while we may be delivering a bit differently than the past, we are serving our customers better than the competition. We have validated this through feedback on our recent customer surveys, and the vast majority said we were doing better than other distributors right now. We are also investing in non-pandemic inventory and partnering closely with our suppliers to work through any supply constraints, inbound lead time challenges and any potential cost increases.
Additionally, shortage in the labor market have had a significant impact for all companies this year. In response, we have increased our wages to attract and retain talent, especially in our distribution centers. We've implemented robust training programs to onboard new team members and train existing team members to work throughout our buildings. We have made great progress in closing staffing gaps and will continue to do so over the third quarter.
Finally, transportation has been very challenging. That is clearly linked to the product and labor shortages. While we have always prioritized optimal routes and cost efficiencies, over the last few months, we have partnered with our carriers in new ways to ensure we are meeting customer expectations. We have also added new partners to our carrier mix to handle our volume and provide us flexibility.
It's important to note that the overall freight market is volatile and uncertain. While we are confident in our current plans to manage these challenges, there are a lot of moving pieces and constraints across all modes, parcel, LTL and ocean freight. For example, the ocean freight market has been uncertain as the pandemic surges again in Asia and container costs fluctuate. We are ready to respond to any of these dynamics.
We expect the supply chain challenges to last through the end of the year and likely well into next year. I have no doubt, as we continue to live the Grainger Edge and follow our principles, we'll not only get through these challenges, but we'll deliver strong results and take market share.
Turning to our financial highlights. The bottom line is that our performance has been in line with our expectations and what we communicated on our last earnings call. The only exception to this has been gross profit impacted primarily by the changes in May to the CDC mask guidelines halfway through the quarter. Heading into the second quarter, all external factors were pointing to a reopening in the U.S. around or sometime after the 4th of July, giving us a full quarter to sell through as much of our remaining pandemic inventory as possible.
Based on our internal scenario planning, we thought that potential adjustments in Q2 would fall somewhere between $45 million and $50 million, while we couldn't predict precisely how far the demand curve would fall or when. Then, when the CDC mask guidance changed in mid-May, we saw our demand for pandemic products, especially masks, declined rapidly.
As a result of the sudden weakening of demand, we had more pandemic inventory remaining than expected, and we took a $63 million adjustment, about $15 million more than our internal scenario planning. We believe this completes any material pandemic-related inventory adjustments. Without this incremental change, GP would have been roughly flat sequentially. We understand that CDC has just changed guidance again this week. While the situation is fluid, we do not expect any material change in our outlook as a result of this change.
Shifting to the other financial results. We achieved strong organic daily sales growth of 15% for the company on a constant currency basis within our guided range. When compared to 2019, Q2 was up about 14% on a daily organic basis, a positive indicator of our strong performance and recovery beyond the pandemic.
Our High-Touch Solutions North America segment grew 12.7% on a daily constant currency basis. In the U.S., we lapped the most extreme volatility of 2020. Looking at the 2-year average in the second quarter of 2021, we drove approximately 275 basis points of average market outgrowth. We remain very confident in our ability to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market on an ongoing basis. We expect the volatility of 2020 and 2021 to average out and get back to normal heading into 2022.
Our Canadian business drove positive operating earnings growth for the quarter and managed expenses well. We are seeing continued momentum in targeted end markets, especially heavy manufacturing and higher education as schools prepare to reopen in the fall. And we continue to diversify the business beyond natural resources.
The Endless Assortment model had another impressive quarter with 23.9% daily sales growth on a constant currency basis, fueled by strong customer acquisition. Lastly, we generated $269 million in operating cash flow and achieved strong ROIC of 29.2%.
Turning to our quarterly results for the company. I've discussed most of what's on this slide, but I wanted to point out 2 additional items. First, our SG&A was $790 million, in line with the guided range provided on our first quarter call. As expected, we increased SG&A for the quarter as we continued to invest in marketing and in our people through increased variable compensation and wage rates in the DCs.
This resulted in total company operating margin of 10.4%, down 70 basis points compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the $15 million incremental inventory adjustment, GP would have been roughly flat sequentially and operating margin would have been 10.9%. The resulting EPS would have been around $4.50.
With that, I will turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail on our 2 segments. Dee?"

We continue to see a robust recovery with daily sales up 13.7% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and up 9.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. In the U.S., we saw strong growth in our non-pandemic product category with product mix returning to more normal levels.
For the segment, GP finished the quarter at 36.9%, down 125 basis points versus the prior year. I think it's important to note that without the $63 million of inventory adjustment, GP would have been up 125 basis points year-over-year. This 250 basis point swing demonstrates that our underlying GP rate would have otherwise been a healthy 39.4%. Coupled with our focus on achieving price/cost neutrality, we are confident that our run rate GP remains strong.
SG&A in the segment ramped as expected to $640 million, lapping the lowest point of SG&A spend in the second quarter of 2020. Canada continued to make solid progress and expanded operating margin approximately 315 basis points year-over-year. Consistent with last quarter, we have included a chart with details on the U.S. and the Canadian businesses on the first page of the appendix.
On Slide 10, looking at pandemic product trends, I want to highlight 2 things before we dive into the Q2 numbers. First, we lapped the extreme growth experienced last year and saw decreased demand for PPE products. Accordingly, pandemic sales declined approximately 28% versus 2020. However, that's an impressive 27% increase versus 2019. We estimate July 2021 will be down about 28% over July 2020, in line with what we saw in the second quarter of this year.
More importantly, we see the trend in our non-dynamic sales as a positive sign of economic recovery. During the quarter, we grew 31% versus 2020 and up 7% versus 2019. We're seeing end markets like commercial, which include our severely disrupted customers in hospitality, along with heavy manufacturing, make a significant comeback. We estimate that for the month of July 2021, non-pandemic sales growth of about 22%.
As it relates to pandemic product mix, while we expected it to taper off to near pre-pandemic levels to about 20% by year-end, we're seeing this happen more quickly now at about 22% of sales. In total, our U.S. High-Touch Solutions business is up about 12% for the second quarter of 2021 and up 10% over 2019.
Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 11, we are lapping the highest concentration of large pandemic purchases of the prior year. At this time, the market declined between 14% and 15% and we saw outsized share gains of roughly 1,200 basis points. For Q2 2021, we're seeing the opposite effect. We estimate the U.S. MRO market grew between 18.5% and 19.5%. The U.S. High-Touch business grew 12.4%, about 650 basis points lower than the market.
To normalize for the volatility, we calculated the 2-year average share gain to be 275 basis points over the market. There's some noise in the market number because -- across industrials, given the dynamics and fluctuations over the last 2 years. Therefore, the 2-year average is a better estimate of what's really going on. As I previously noted, our U.S. High-Touch business is up 10% over 2019. As the impact of the pandemic subsides, coupled with our strong progress on key initiatives and our return on investments like marketing, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our share gain goals.
Now let's cover our U.S. GP rate. As previously discussed, our second quarter GP decline resulted from the $63 million inventory adjustment. This adjustment lowered U.S. GP by 270 basis points. Without this, our underlying U.S. GP rate is 39.8% in the second quarter. As we look to the remainder of 2021, it is important to note we are operating in a very challenging and fluid environment. We're doing everything within our control to exit the year with a Q4 GP rate at or above the Q1 2020 levels or 40.1%.
We remain confident in our ability to achieve this target for a few reasons. First, as noted earlier, we anticipate no further material pandemic-related inventory adjustments. Excluding the inventory impacts, our GP rate is nearing this level already.
As we discussed on Slide 10, our pandemic product mix is close to pre-pandemic levels, and we expect this to fully normalize in the second half. And we've seen evidence that we can continue to maintain price/cost neutrality. On the cost side, we have a robust process to partner with our suppliers and understand the specific raw material impacts as well as other conditions that may result in increased costs.
As it relates to price, our goal is to continue to maintain competitiveness in the market and pass what is applicable. In the first half, we were slightly above neutrality and as we expect to take additional price increases in the second half to offset what we're expecting in costs. Even in this inflationary environment, we are confident we will be able to execute and achieve neutrality through the remainder of the year.
Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Daily sales increased 23% or 23.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued strength in new customer acquisitions at both Zoro and MonotaRO as well as growth of larger enterprise customers in MonotaRO. GP expanded 75 basis points year-over-year driven by positive trends at both businesses, and operating margin finished up 95 basis points over the prior year. I'll go into more detail on the next slide as we provide further transparency on the results of both of these businesses.
Moving to Slide 14. Please remember that MonotaRO is a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP and is reported in our results 1 month in arrears. As a result, the numbers we disclose will differ somewhat from MonotaRO's public statements.
In local currency and using Japan's local selling days, which occasionally differ from U.S. selling days, MonotaRO's daily sales grew 16.7% with GP finishing the quarter at 26.4%, 25 basis points above the prior year. Operating margin decreased 15 basis points to 12% as they continue to ramp up operations at the Ibaraki DC. Again, another strong quarter for MonotaRO.
Switching to Zoro U.S., daily sales grew 32.6% as it laps its softest quarter of 2020. Zoro GP grew 95 basis points to 31.5% and achieved 320 basis points of operating margin expansion through substantial SG&A leverage in the quarter. All in all, very impressive results.
Moving to Slide 15. In addition to the strong financial performance, we're seeing positive results with our key operating metrics. As you saw in the first quarter, we've listed total registered users for both businesses, an important driver of top line performance. Both MonotaRO and Zoro have shown progress and are up over 20% over the second quarter last year.
On the right, Zoro continues to actively add SKUs to the portfolio. At the end of the second quarter of 2021, we had a total of 7.5 million SKUs available online, close to our goal of 8 million for the year. We remain encouraged by our progress with SKU additions beyond traditional MRO.
Now I'll provide commentary as it relates to the upcoming quarter and our expectations for the full year. For the third quarter, on a total company level, we expect our revenue growth to be between 10% and 11% on a daily organic basis. We believe any material pandemic-related inventory adjustments are complete, and we expect GP to be up between 100 and 120 basis points year-over-year and to improve sequentially. SG&A is anticipated to fall between $805 million and $815 million as we continue to invest in marketing and wages in the DCs to remain competitive.
Transitioning to our total company guidance, I'd like to provide some brief commentary on how we're trending so far. We expect strong sales to continue while GP, operating margin and EPS will face pressure as a result of the incremental inventory adjustments and freight costs, along with investments and increased DC wages and marketing. While we are maintaining our guidance, we expect results will trend towards the low end of our range with the exception of revenue. We expect revenue to be near the midpoint.
As it relates to our segment operating margins, we think that some of the supply chain challenges as well as the first half inventory adjustment will weigh more heavily on the High-Touch Solutions segment and therefore, High-Touch operating margin may trend at the low end of the range. At the same time, we believe Endless Assortment, driven by strong performance and improving margins, may end the year at the high end, both helping to support delivery of total company results.
We are not adjusting guidance as we are confident in our ability to deliver results within our guidance ranges. As we learn more, we'll continue to keep you apprised of any changes. With that, I'll turn it back over to D.G. for some closing remarks."

Before I open it up for questions, I wanted to share 2 recent company accomplishments. First, I'm proud to announce that earlier this month, Grainger was certified as a Great Place to Work, a true testament to the exceptional team member experience we've built and an important milestone in advancing the Grainger Edge.
Second, it's our 10th year of publicly reporting our ESG efforts. I wanted to share highlights from our new corporate responsibility report. At Grainger, we embrace our obligation to operate sustainably and with a long-term fact-based view of critical issues regarding the environment, society at large and corporate governance.
For example, in 2012, we became the first industrial distributor to publicly disclose our carbon footprint. In 2013, we became the first in our industry to set a public greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, which we achieved 2 years early. We just set a new goal last year to reduce the absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030.
We're also committed to helping our customers achieve their ESG goals through our products and services. We now offer more than 100,000 environmentally friendly products. Through this portfolio, we're able to help customers maintain sustainable facilities via efficient energy management, water conservation, waste reduction and improved indoor air quality.
In 2017, Grainger signed The Chicago Network Equity Pledge focused on achieving 50% representation of women in leadership positions by 2030. And this year, we formed the ESG Leadership Council, which I chair. The council is comprised of Grainger leaders who provide strategic direction and oversight on our ESG efforts. You can find the new report at graingeresg.com.

I think if you step back, I think we find that comparisons to 2019 or early 2020 are probably better than last year at this point because there's so much messiness in the year-over-year numbers. But our general thinking is we will exit the year with having gained significant share and in a better spot from an economic perspective with similar GP and better SG&A leverage.
And that's kind of the model going forward. We feel like we're priced competitively. We feel like we can hold GP in each of our business units fairly consistently over time and get some SG&A leverage. And so our whole model is based on consistent share gain and slightly expanding operating margins. Typically, we would expect GP to hold relatively flat as a percentage moving forward with some SG&A leverage."

The mask mandate change that's happened in the last couple of days, I will say that every single external announcement in the pandemic has driven behavior. So we are expecting in the short term to get some increased mask sales. We haven't flown that through.
You're right, there's a potential, but it's so early. 48 hours' worth of  revenue wouldn't give us any indication. And things are so fluid and change so fast, it's really hard to tell.

We don't expect Zoro to do that because the competition in the U.S. is much more stiff on that front. And so they have some larger customers that Zoro doesn't have. Zoro is focused on that small business more fully and really focused there.

There's just some customers that don't allow visits, but I've been in front of probably 10 to 15 customers in the last 6, 7 weeks. And those conversations feel very normal, and we're talking about how to expand the business, really leveraging the work we've done to help them stay up and running in the pandemic and keep their people safe to try to improve their relationship and grow. And I think that's going to be a positive story moving forward."

And then I guess sort of related to that, I think there's a whole litany of end markets and business activities that are sort of post-COVID change. Is it -- whether it's a customer group or end market, where do you see sort of the biggest difference in that interaction, someone buying differently, wanting you to handle a bigger scope of what they're doing?
Because I would imagine that we go through 2020 and even early '21 and the recovery, everyone is just sort of too busy to make big sweeping structural changes, but maybe now with maybe the smoke clearing a bit more. Anything you've seen out there where someone has just said, here's how we're running this process differently? Again, it could be an end market, could be kind of a customer practice, but just curious high level where you guys have seen the biggest change."

One is the pandemic did teach a lot of our customers that having a digital solution is pretty important. And the other is having an inventory solution is pretty important. And so almost every conversation we have with customers now centers on how can we install processes so that it's really easy to order and that we can help them manage inventory and keep inventory levels where they need to be.
Those are the 2 biggest changes. Those are really across all customers. Obviously, there's differences by segment. There are still some segments that are pretty, pretty significantly disrupted and some that are ranging. But I think from a customer interest standpoint, helping them manage their inventory and getting them the right digital solution are the 2 things that are even more intense. Even though they've always been important, they're really intent right now."

But what I will say is there is going to be a lot of lumpiness in every quarter-to-quarter comparison this year for reasons that mostly have to do with supply. So last year in the second quarter, we prioritized supply for health care and government customers of pandemic products. And so we turned off a whole bunch of volume that Zoro probably could have sold. So Zoro did not have the kind of growth last year that certainly it was used to.
In this year's, we're very pleased with the trajectory they're on. They're ahead of plan and doing very well. But this year's number in the second quarter, I wouldn't assume that, that's going to be the number we see going forward because that is off of a very low number, given the supply decisions that we made last year.
We still have a lot of confidence in Zoro's ability to grow 20% going forward, but there's going to be some lumpiness in the back half of the year. There's going to be bad compares. In the summer last year, we had a bunch of consumer business as we were the only ones that have product that we're going to compare against. Still be strong growth but may not be quite as much as you're used to seeing. That will all work its way out, and we expect very consistent strong growth in the Zoro business."

The Grainger Edge is our framework that defines who we are, why we exist and where we're going while establishing a set of operating principles. I'm proud of the ways that we use the principles to guide decisions and deliver results.
I wanted to start this quarter with a big thank you. Things are very challenging on many fronts. Given the ongoing pandemic and labor and material shortages, nothing in the world seems to be working exactly the way it should. Our manufacturing partners, transportation partners, Grainger team members, and certainly our customers, are all finding harder than ever to keep the world working. I want to thank all of them for their tremendous efforts. I also want to offer a particular thank you to the frontline workers who continue to go above and beyond. Grainger is proud to support the hospital staff, government agencies, teachers and many others who continue to do great work in a very challenging environment.
I might say that in spite of these challenges, we performed very well, but in reality, it's partly because of how we are wired that Grainger is doing so well. We've seen strong demand this quarter, especially in the U.S. We have product available in our network and have been able to ship it to customers quickly. Our service to customers has been exceptional given the circumstances. We are leveraging our scale, demonstrating our agility and gaining share. Our goal is to always be in an advantaged position to help our customers solve their problems.
As I've been out with customers this past quarter time and again, I hear that Grainger is executing well. Customers tell me that they are pleased with our performance, and you can see this in our revenue growth.
While the current supply chain environment is volatile and uncertain, we are confident in our current plans and our readiness to respond to any evolving dynamics. In the face of labor and material shortages throughout the supply chain, we are providing strong relative service and helping our customers avoid disruptions. We continue to actively leverage our network even if sometimes we add to the orders from less optimal locations at a higher cost. We are investing in inventory while actively monitoring the freight market and the West Coast ports.
And as it relates to labor, we have made great progress in closing staffing gaps and training team members, which has resulted in improvements, especially in our DC operations. Our customer research shows that this is driving customer satisfaction.
Turning to our financial highlights. Demand in the quarter was robust, resulting in strong revenue and gross margin performance and well-managed SG&A. We achieved organic daily sales growth of 11.9% for the total company on a constant currency basis. When compared to Q3 2019, the quarter was up 17.3% on a daily organic basis, driven primarily by core non-pandemic product sales, which is a positive indicator of our underlying run rate performance.
Our High-Touch Solutions in North America segment grew 11.6% on a daily constant currency basis. In the U.S., we drove approximately 100 basis points of share outgrowth versus the prior year and 475 basis points on a 2-year average. We remain confident in our ability to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market on an ongoing basis. Our service to customers, especially the last 2 years, has contributed to meaningful share gain.
Our Endless Assortment segment finished the quarter with 14.9% daily sales growth on a constant currency basis. I'd like to note 2 things that temporarily moderated growth in this segment. First, Zoro lapped a very strong third quarter in 2020. For context, we opened up pandemic product supply to Zoro customers in Q3 2020 that was previously reserved mostly for government and health care customers. In the third quarter 2021, Zoro managed to drive 11.9% revenue growth. And when we compare that to Q3 2019, we are up 30.6%, which is really strong.
Also MonotaRO was impacted by several external factors, including a slow start to vaccinations and a generally slower Japanese economy. In local days and local currency, sales were up about 17.5% compared to Q3 2020. And MonotaRO continues to take share, especially as COVID restrictions lift and we grow with our targeted enterprise customers. And as we look at results versus Q3 2019, MonotaRO sales are up over 37%.
We feel that the comparison to 2019 for both businesses is more indicative of our underlying business strength. We still expect the segment to close the year with growth at about 20% above prior year. We saw strong gross margin expansion across all segments, even above our expectations that we discussed last quarter. High-Touch Solutions North America was up 140 basis points over Q3 of the prior year, and Endless Assortment was up 115 basis points. Dee will cover the drivers for both segments.
Lastly, we returned $327 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the third quarter, and we maintained strong return on invested capital of 31.4%.
Turning to our quarterly results for the company. I've discussed most of what's on this slide but wanted to point out a few additional items. First, our SG&A was $812 million, right where we thought it would be. We continue to invest in marketing and labor, primarily through increased variable compensation and wage rates in the DCs. And like many companies, we're also starting to see increased health care costs as team members return to routine medical visits and undergo deferred elective procedures. And while overall spending is up versus the prior year, we are still gaining significant leverage when compared to 2019.
Our operating earnings were $438 million, up 17.4%. And our resulting EPS is $5.65 for the quarter, which is growth of 25%. Overall, it was a really strong quarter.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail. Dee?"

Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment. We continue to see a robust recovery with daily sales up 12% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and up 14.5% compared to the third quarter of 2019. In the U.S., we saw strong growth, especially",1278,"Thanks, D.G. Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment. We continue to see a robust recovery with daily sales up 12% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and up 14.5% compared to the third quarter of 2019. In the U.S., we saw strong growth, especially in our core non-pandemic product categories. Both large and midsized customers saw significant growth at 10% and 19%, respectively.
Canada continues to be slow as recurring shutdowns in many of the larger provinces kept businesses closed or operating at minimal capacity. As vaccination rates improve and businesses reopen, we expect more typical purchasing behavior to resume and sales to follow. Canadian daily sales were up 11.7% or 5.7% in local days and local currency compared to the third quarter of 2020.
For the High-Touch Solutions segment, GP margin finished the quarter at 39.4%, up 140 basis points versus the prior year third quarter. Our focus and diligence on managing price/cost spread contributed to our GP improvement. In the quarter, we saw strong price realization to customers both on contract and web pricing. Our realization was better than anticipated, and as a result, price/cost spread was above neutral.
In addition, consistent with the second quarter, our U.S. pandemic product mix was about 22%, an improvement versus 28% in the third quarter of 2020. We are confident that our run rate GP remains strong and will finish in line with the expectations we set forth for the fourth quarter.
On Slide 20, you'll find a chart with details on the U.S. and Canadian businesses. This information has been provided to help bridge our prior reportable segments to our new High-Touch Solutions North American segment. I'd like to give you some advanced notice that we will continue to show daily sales and gross margin by business. However, as our operating expenses across the segment have become more intertwined, our operating margin by geography will no longer be provided in our 2022 reporting.
On Slide 9, taking a deeper dive into High-Touch Solutions for the U.S. The Delta variant and the renewed mask mandates in July reversed the declining trend we were seeing in the second quarter for pandemic products. As the virus surged, we saw pandemic product demand pick back up, especially for masks. However, of particular note, our core non-pandemic sales growth was at or above 20% every month in the third quarter. We are encouraged to see this growth as a sign of more regular business and economic activity.
When comparing core non-pandemic sales to Q3 2019, sales were up 12%, which is quite strong. In total, our U.S. High-Touch Solutions business is up 12% for the third quarter 2021 and up 16% as compared to 2019.
Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 10. In the third quarter, as expected, we saw our share gain grow as we lap more reasonable yet still inflated Q3 2020 comparisons. In the quarter, we estimate that the U.S. market grew between 10.5% and 11.5%, resulting in our estimated outgrowth of approximately 100 basis points versus Q3 2020.
To normalize for volatility, we are continuing to show the 2-year average share gain, which was about 475 basis points over the market for the third quarter of 2021, a really exceptional result. Given the noise and fluctuations in the market number across industrials, the 2-year average is a better estimate of our true market outgrowth. We remain focused on our key initiatives, which give us confidence in our ability to achieve our U.S. share gain goal of growing 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market.
Now let's cover our U.S. GP rate. We saw a significant lift in the High-Touch U.S. GP performance in the quarter. Sequentially, we wanted to comment on 2 of the biggest factors that make up the difference between the second quarter and the third quarter. First, the biggest contributor, the inventory adjustments are behind us as anticipated. In addition, we are seeing greater price realization than expected. I'll note that while we sold some of the pandemic inventory that was previously written down, the impact to GP was immaterial.
We're encouraged by these results and are confident in our ability to achieve our expected 40.1% GP rate in Q4 based on continued pandemic mix improvements, our expected price realization in the fourth quarter and our ability to navigate supply chain challenges.
Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Daily sales increased 12.7% or 14.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued strength in our new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO as well as growth of larger enterprise customers at MonotaRO. GP expanded 115 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by Zoro U.S. We took a number of pricing actions based on evolving market conditions, and we deemphasized lower-margin channels. In addition, we experienced improved freight efficiencies at Zoro, primarily as a result of fewer B2C customers who typically place smaller orders that are more expensive to ship.
Operating margin for the segment finished up 80 basis points over the prior year third quarter due primarily to improved gross profit margin. I'll go into more detail on the next slide as we provide further transparency on the results for both businesses.
Moving to Slide 13. In local currency and using Japan's local selling days, which occasionally differ from U.S. selling days, MonotaRO daily sales grew 17.5% compared to the third quarter of 2020. GP margin finished the quarter at 25.8%, 30 basis points below the prior year third quarter, as we continue to grow with enterprise customers. As a result, operating margin decreased 65 basis points to 12%.
Switching to Zoro U.S. Daily sales grew 11.9% as compared to the strongest sales quarter of 2020. Zoro GP grew 375 basis points to 33.9% and achieved 325 basis points of operating margin expansion.
In addition to the strong financial performance in the segment, we also continue to execute well on our key initiatives. First, when it comes to our registered users, we saw continued growth across both businesses, which is an important driver of top line performance. And on the right, Zoro continues to actively add SKUs to the portfolio. At the end of the third quarter of 2021, we had a total of 8 million SKUs available online, achieving our goal for the year a quarter early, adding nearly 2 million SKUs in the last 9 months. We remain encouraged by our progress with SKU additions.
Once again, I would like to provide some color commentary as it relates to the fourth quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter for revenues, we expect total company daily sales to be between 11.5% and 12.5%. We anticipate company gross margin will fall between 37.2% and 37.4%. As discussed before, we expect the U.S. GP rate to exit the year at or above pre-pandemic levels. And for SG&A, we expect a similar level of spending in the fourth quarter as we saw in the third quarter, between $810 million and $815 million with increased variable compensation, wages and health care expenses. And while it's unclear at this point, we may have some additional risk as it relates to vaccine mandate costs.
Given the strong performance in the quarter, we remain confident in our guidance range. For the full year, we expect revenue to be at or above the midpoint and all other metrics to be stronger than the low end of the range we discussed at the end of the second quarter, but likely still below the midpoint given the pandemic inventory adjustments taken in the first half.
With that, I would like to turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks."

The answer to that question is no. In terms of inventory position, we've been able to serve both the High-Touch model and Zoro well throughout this period.
What I would say is that if you're thinking about Zoro's growth, there's a couple of things that are impacting Zoro's growth rate in the quarter, and they will get better as we move forward. One was, last year, we opened up in the third quarter the safety products to Zoro. And as a result, customer acquisitions and revenue were extremely high, and a lot of the customer acquisitions were consumers as well as people are just looking and scrambling to find product.
The other thing is we've been very clear and focused on attractive business acquisitions. And as a result, we have shut off some channels for acquisition network as profitable long term. And so -- and that's going away moving forward as well. And so that's been a bit of a drag on Zoro, but it hasn't been because we haven't been shipping product from Zoro. We've been serving customers well across both models."

Can you just help us frame this opportunity going forward? Is there any risk around Zoro cannibalization? And then what kind of gross margin tailwinds could this bring to the company?"

So yes, I mean, that was a big part of the reason for resetting prices was we had gone through a long period of decline with midsized customers. And here, we're really talking about midsized customers that have some sort of mechanical complexity, so think about midsized manufacturers or companies that really value some of the technical product support search capabilities of the Grainger model. Obviously, since the price reset, we've captured a lot of that back.
We're still fairly significantly below our high point with midsized customers. We feel like we've got a long runway ahead of us. We are getting smarter all the time. We are not seeing much cannibalization with Zoro. Zoro tends to focus on smaller businesses and businesses that are maybe a little more narrow in what their needs are. And so they tend to segment to different types of customers more. The Grainger midsized customer typically has fairly high mechanical complexity or complexity of some type.
And so we are really pleased with what we're seeing. I would say, I think we went from about $2 billion to less than $1 billion in that space over a 10-year period. And now we've covered some of that. We haven't recovered all of it. We think we can get back above $2 billion. So we think we've got a long runway ahead."

So we generally try to think about managing costs as well as we possibly can. We are obviously working with our suppliers on a constant basis in this environment to make sure that we are taking cost increases that make sense and pushing back things if they don't make sense. Our suppliers have been great about sort of working with us to find the right path for cost increases.
And then on transportation, sort of the same thing. We really are focused on understanding what cost increases are reasonable and working with our suppliers and our partners to get the right outcome. We price to market.
I think in general, when you have inflationary periods, not this type of inflationary period but normal inflationary periods, we've historically probably been able to take market price increases and not have as much cost increase or have it delayed. And so we will sometimes have a period of advantage.
I think right now, given the pace of cost increases, I think we're pretty well matched and we'll continue to be pretty well matched, and that's our expectation given there's been a lot of off-cycle cost increases, and we've been able to price those through as we go.
So I would say I don't think there's a big gap right now or a big benefit right now. It's just -- it's a fairly wild time obviously in the supply chain, and we are -- I think we're navigating through it well."

And so I think the amount of work that's required to navigate here is much more than you would find in a typical setting.
One of the things we did do is we saw some challenges coming on the horizon. We actually order -- preordered a bunch of product early in the year, try to get inventory in. And we have been able to build some inventory throughout the year, maybe not as much as we'd like, but we have been able to build some inventory. That's helped us. Our supplier management team and product teams are working very closely together to find -- make sure we've got the right substitute products so we can serve customers if there's a gap in a particular supplier that can't provide us product.
We are actively prioritizing product coming off of Asia. We have up wages and distribution centers and gotten staffing right. So we are basically clean consistently now, which is good. That was a little bit of a challenge back in May.
So basically, if you follow the supply chain view at every single step, we are working at it every single step of the way.

And then I appreciate the color on kind of the inventory repricing and kind of about one for one or kind of matching that in real time, not a lot of temporary benefits. But maybe just looking at the other side of the equation with some bigger customers on contract, how are you sort of keeping up with the price/cost equation there? Is it getting a little bit more kind of exotic with things like surcharges? And then what are you anchoring that sort of stuff to? Because inflation feels a little bit more unusual than just like, hey, steel is higher. I mean everything is higher, and not every product category has like the same pain points. How are you managing with that and customers that are maybe on a bit more long-term contract or tend to be a little bit more inflexible in price?"

The Grainger Edge is our framework that defines who we are, why we exist and where we're going while establishing a set of operating principles. I'm proud of the ways that we use the principles to guide decisions and deliver results.
I wanted to start this quarter with a big thank you. Things are very challenging on many fronts. Given the ongoing pandemic and labor and material shortages, nothing in the world seems to be working exactly the way it should. Our manufacturing partners, transportation partners, Grainger team members, and certainly our customers, are all finding harder than ever to keep the world working. I want to thank all of them for their tremendous efforts. I also want to offer a particular thank you to the frontline workers who continue to go above and beyond. Grainger is proud to support the hospital staff, government agencies, teachers and many others who continue to do great work in a very challenging environment.
I might say that in spite of these challenges, we performed very well, but in reality, it's partly because of how we are wired that Grainger is doing so well. We've seen strong demand this quarter, especially in the U.S. We have product available in our network and have been able to ship it to customers quickly. Our service to customers has been exceptional given the circumstances. We are leveraging our scale, demonstrating our agility and gaining share. Our goal is to always be in an advantaged position to help our customers solve their problems.
As I've been out with customers this past quarter time and again, I hear that Grainger is executing well. Customers tell me that they are pleased with our performance, and you can see this in our revenue growth.
While the current supply chain environment is volatile and uncertain, we are confident in our current plans and our readiness to respond to any evolving dynamics. In the face of labor and material shortages throughout the supply chain, we are providing strong relative service and helping our customers avoid disruptions. We continue to actively leverage our network even if sometimes we have to                 the orders from less optimal locations at a higher cost. We are investing in inventory while actively monitoring the freight market and the West Coast ports.
And as it relates to labor, we have made great progress in closing staffing gaps and training team members, which has resulted in improvements, especially in our DC operations. Our customer research shows that this is driving customer satisfaction.
Turning to our financial highlights. Demand in the quarter was robust, resulting in strong revenue and gross margin performance and well-managed SG&A. We achieved organic daily sales growth of 11.9% for the total company on a constant currency basis. When compared to Q3 2019, the quarter was up 17.3% on a daily organic basis, driven primarily by core non-pandemic product sales, which is a positive indicator of our underlying run rate performance.
Our High-Touch Solutions in North America segment grew 11.6% on a daily constant currency basis. In the U.S., we drove approximately 100 basis points of share outgrowth versus the prior year and 475 basis points on a 2-year average. We remain confident in our ability to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market on an ongoing basis. Our service to customers, especially the last 2 years, has contributed to meaningful share gain.
Our Endless Assortment segment finished the quarter with 14.9% daily sales growth on a constant currency basis. I'd like to note 2 things that temporarily moderated growth in this segment. First, Zoro lapped a very strong third quarter in 2020. For context, we opened up pandemic product supply to Zoro customers in Q3 2020 that was previously reserved mostly for government and health care customers. In the third quarter 2021, Zoro managed to drive 11.9% revenue growth. And when we compare that to Q3 2019, we are up 30.6%, which is really strong.
Also MonotaRO was impacted by several external factors, including a slow start to vaccinations and a generally slower Japanese economy. In local days and local currency, sales were up about 17.5% compared to Q3 2020. And MonotaRO continues to take share, especially as COVID restrictions lift and we grow with our targeted enterprise customers. And as we look at results versus Q3 2019, MonotaRO sales are up over 37%.
We feel that the comparison to 2019 for both businesses is more indicative of our underlying business strength. We still expect the segment to close the year with growth at about 20% above prior year. We saw strong gross margin expansion across all segments, even above our expectations that we discussed last quarter. High-Touch Solutions North America was up 140 basis points over Q3 of the prior year, and Endless Assortment was up 115 basis points. Dee will cover the drivers for both segments.
Lastly, we returned $327 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the third quarter, and we maintained strong return on invested capital of 31.4%.
Turning to our quarterly results for the company. I've discussed most of what's on this slide but wanted to point out a few additional items. First, our SG&A was $812 million, right where we thought it would be. We continue to invest in marketing and labor, primarily through increased variable compensation and gripped wage rates in the DCs. And like many companies, we're also starting to see increased health care costs as team members return to routine medical visits and undergo deferred elective procedures. And while overall spending is up versus the prior year, we are still gaining significant leverage when compared to 2019.
Our operating earnings were $438 million, up 17.4%. And our resulting EPS is $5.65 for the quarter, which is growth of 25%. Overall, it was a really strong quarter.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail. Dee?"

We continue to see a robust recovery with daily sales up 12% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and up 14.5% compared to the third quarter of 2019. In the U.S., we saw strong growth, especially in our core non-pandemic product categories. Both large and midsized customers saw significant growth at 10% and 19%, respectively.
Canada continues to be slow as recurring shutdowns in many of the larger provinces kept businesses closed or operating at minimal capacity. As vaccination rates improve and businesses reopen, we expect more typical purchasing behavior to resume and sales to follow. Canadian daily sales were up 11.7% or 5.7% in local days and local currency compared to the third quarter of 2020.
For the High-Touch Solutions segment, GP margin finished the quarter at 39.4%, up 140 basis points versus the prior year third quarter. Our focus and diligence on managing price/cost spread contributed to our GP improvement. In the quarter, we saw strong price realization to customers both on contract and web pricing. Our realization was better than anticipated, and as a result, price/cost spread was above neutral.
In addition, consistent with the second quarter, our U.S. pandemic product mix was about 22%, an improvement versus 28% in the third quarter of 2020. We are confident that our run rate GP remains strong and will finish in line with the expectations we set forth for the fourth quarter.
On Slide 20, you'll find a chart with details on the U.S. and Canadian businesses. This information has been provided to help bridge our prior reportable segments to our new High-Touch Solutions North American segment. I'd like to give you some advanced notice that we will continue to show daily sales and gross margin by business. However, as our operating expenses across the segment have become more intertwined, our operating margin by geography will no longer be provided in our 2022 reporting.
On Slide 9, taking a deeper dive into High-Touch Solutions for the U.S. The Delta variant and the renewed mask mandates in July reversed the declining trend we were seeing in the second quarter for pandemic products. As the virus surged, we saw pandemic product demand pick back up, especially for masks. However, of particular note, our core non-pandemic sales growth was at or above 20% every month in the third quarter. We are encouraged to see this growth as a sign of more regular business and economic activity.
When comparing core non-pandemic sales to Q3 2019, sales were up 12%, which is quite strong. In total, our U.S. High-Touch Solutions business is up 12% for the third quarter 2021 and up 16% as compared to 2019.
Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 10. In the third quarter, as expected, we saw our share gain grow as we lap more reasonable yet still inflated Q3 2020 comparisons. In the quarter, we estimate that the U.S. market grew between 10.5% and 11.5%, resulting in our estimated outgrowth of approximately 100 basis points versus Q3 2020.
To normalize for volatility, we are continuing to show the 2-year average share gain, which was about 475 basis points over the market for the third quarter of 2021, a really exceptional result. Given the noise and fluctuations in the market number across industrials, the 2-year average is a better estimate of our true market outgrowth. We remain focused on our key initiatives, which give us confidence in our ability to achieve our U.S. share gain goal of growing 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market.
Now let's cover our U.S. GP rate. We saw a significant lift in the High-Touch U.S. GP performance in the quarter. Sequentially, we wanted to comment on 2 of the biggest factors that make up the difference between the second quarter and the third quarter. First, the biggest contributor, the inventory adjustments are behind us as anticipated. In addition, we are seeing greater price realization than expected. I'll note that while we sold some of the pandemic inventory that was previously written down, the impact to GP was immaterial.
We're encouraged by these results and are confident in our ability to achieve our expected 40.1% GP rate in Q4 based on continued pandemic mix improvements, our expected price realization in the fourth quarter and our ability to navigate supply chain challenges.
Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Daily sales increased 12.7% or 14.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued strength in our new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO as well as growth of larger enterprise customers at MonotaRO. GP expanded 115 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by Zoro U.S. We took a number of pricing actions based on evolving market conditions, and we deemphasized lower-margin channels. In addition, we experienced improved freight efficiencies at Zoro, primarily as a result of fewer B2C customers who typically place smaller orders that are more expensive to ship.
Operating margin for the segment finished up 80 basis points over the prior year third quarter due primarily to improved gross profit margin. I'll go into more detail on the next slide as we provide further transparency on the results for both businesses.
Moving to Slide 13. In local currency and using Japan's local selling days, which occasionally differ from U.S. selling days, MonotaRO daily sales grew 17.5% compared to the third quarter of 2020. GP margin finished the quarter at 25.8%, 30 basis points below the prior year third quarter, as we continue to grow with enterprise customers. As a result, operating margin decreased 65 basis points to 12%.
Switching to Zoro U.S. Daily sales grew 11.9% as compared to the strongest sales quarter of 2020. Zoro GP grew 375 basis points to 33.9% and achieved 325 basis points of operating margin expansion.
In addition to the strong financial performance in the segment, we also continue to execute well on our key initiatives. First, when it comes to our registered users, we saw continued growth across both businesses, which is an important driver of top line performance. And on the right, Zoro continues to actively add SKUs to the portfolio. At the end of the third quarter of 2021, we had a total of 8 million SKUs available online, achieving our goal for the year a quarter early, adding nearly 2 million SKUs in the last 9 months. We remain encouraged by our progress with SKU additions.
Once again, I would like to provide some color commentary as it relates to the fourth quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter for revenues, we expect total company daily sales to be between 11.5% and 12.5%. We anticipate company gross margin will fall between 37.2% and 37.4%. As discussed before, we expect the U.S. GP rate to exit the year at or above pre-pandemic levels. And for SG&A, we expect a similar level of spending in the fourth quarter as we saw in the third quarter, between $810 million and $815 million with increased variable compensation, wages and health care expenses. And while it's unclear at this point, we may have some additional risk as it relates to vaccine mandate costs.
Given the strong performance in the quarter, we remain confident in our guidance range. For the full year, we expect revenue to be at or above the midpoint and all other metrics to be stronger than the low end of the range we discussed at the end of the second quarter, but likely still below the midpoint given the pandemic inventory adjustments taken in the first half.
With that, I would like to turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks."

The answer to that question is no. In terms of inventory position, we've been able to serve both the High-Touch model and Zoro well throughout this period.
What I would say is that if you're thinking about Zoro's growth, there's a couple of things that are impacting Zoro's growth rate in the quarter, and they will get better as we move forward. One was, last year, we opened up in the third quarter the safety products to Zoro. And as a result, customer acquisitions and revenue were extremely high, and a lot of the customer acquisitions were consumers as well as people are just looking and scrambling to find product.
The other thing is we've been very clear and focused on attractive business acquisitions. And as a result, we have shut off some channels for acquisition network as profitable long term. And so -- and that's going away moving forward as well. And so that's been a bit of a drag on Zoro, but it hasn't been because we haven't been shipping product from Zoro. We've been serving customers well across both models."

Can you just help us frame this opportunity going forward? Is there any risk around Zoro cannibalization? And then what kind of gross margin tailwinds could this bring to the company?"

So yes, I mean, that was a big part of the reason for resetting prices was we had gone through a long period of decline with midsized customers. And here, we're really talking about midsized customers that have some sort of mechanical complexity, so think about midsized manufacturers or companies that really value some of the technical product support search capabilities of the Grainger model. Obviously, since the price reset, we've captured a lot of that back.
We're still fairly significantly below our high point with midsized customers. We feel like we've got a long runway ahead of us. We are getting smarter all the time. We are not seeing much cannibalization with Zoro. Zoro tends to focus on smaller businesses and businesses that are maybe a little more narrow in what their needs are. And so they tend to segment to different types of customers more. The Grainger midsized customer typically has fairly high mechanical complexity or complexity of some type.
And so we are really pleased with what we're seeing. I would say, I think we went from about $2 billion to less than $1 billion in that space over a 10-year period. And now we've covered some of that. We haven't recovered all of it. We think we can get back above $2 billion. So we think we've got a long runway ahead."

So we generally try to think about managing costs as well as we possibly can. We are obviously working with our suppliers on a constant basis in this environment to make sure that we are taking cost increases that make sense and pushing back things if they don't make sense. Our suppliers have been great about sort of working with us to find the right path for cost increases.
And then on transportation, sort of the same thing. We really are focused on understanding what cost increases are reasonable and working with our suppliers and our partners to get the right outcome. We price to market.
I think in general, when you have inflationary periods, not this type of inflationary period but normal inflationary periods, we've historically probably been able to take market price increases and not have as much cost increase or have it delayed. And so we will sometimes have a period of advantage.
I think right now, given the pace of cost increases, I think we're pretty well matched and we'll continue to be pretty well matched, and that's our expectation given there's been a lot of off-cycle cost increases, and we've been able to price those through as we go.
So I would say I don't think there's a big gap right now or a big benefit right now. It's just -- it's a fairly wild time obviously in the supply chain, and we are -- I think we're navigating through it well."

And so I think the amount of work that's required to navigate here is much more than you would find in a typical setting.
One of the things we did do is we saw some challenges coming on the horizon. We actually order -- preordered a bunch of product early in the year, try to get inventory in. And we have been able to build some inventory throughout the year, maybe not as much as we'd like, but we have been able to build some inventory. That's helped us. Our supplier management team and product teams are working very closely together to find -- make sure we've got the right substitute products so we can serve customers if there's a gap in a particular supplier that can't provide us product.
We are actively prioritizing product coming off of Asia. We have up wages and distribution centers and gotten staffing right. So we are basically clean consistently now, which is good. That was a little bit of a challenge back in May.
So basically, if you follow the supply chain view at every single step, we are working at it every single step of the way.

Earlier in the year, we talked about the fact that it would be a little lumpy because of the timing as it relates to when we could pass on price with customers. But similar to some of the actions that D.G. articulated that we are executing as it relates to supply chain, that also goes for the commercial teams as they are working with customers to pass on price.
So we're close to the end of the year now, and a lot of those discussions that both our sales team and then online, we've been able to pass on these costs pretty effectively. So that applies to contract customers as well as web-based customers."

We have put in a number of improvements to help us be more effective in planning customers' inventory and fulfilling customers' inventory through KeepStock. We continue to get significant growth out of KeepStock. Certainly, as heavy manufacturing has come back this year, it's been very, very good for our KeepStock business and that -- because that's a really heavy KeepStock area.

And so we haven't invested a lot more or -- and we haven't invested any less in inside sales. We consider it to be an important part of our future, and we've liked the results we've had.

The Grainger Edge is our framework that defines who we are, why we exist and where we're going while establishing a set of operating principles. I'm proud of the ways that we use the principles to guide decisions and deliver results.
I wanted to start this quarter with a big thank you. Things are very challenging on many fronts. Given the ongoing pandemic and labor and material shortages, nothing in the world seems to be working exactly the way it should. Our manufacturing partners, transportation partners, Grainger team members and certainly our customers are all finding harder than ever to keep the world working. I want to thank all of them for their tremendous efforts. I also want to offer a particular thank you to the frontline workers who continue to go above and beyond. Grainger is proud to support the hospital staff, government agencies, teachers and many others who continue to do great work in a very challenging environment.
I might say that in spite of these challenges, we performed very well, but in reality, it's partly because of how we are wired that Grainger is doing so well. We've seen strong demand this quarter, especially in the U.S. We have product available in our network and have been able to ship it to customers quickly. Our service to customers has been exceptional given the circumstances. We are leveraging our scale, demonstrating our agility and gaining share. Our goal is to always be in an advantaged position to help our customers solve their problems. As I've been out with customers this past quarter time and again, I hear that Grainger is executing well. Customers tell me that they are pleased with our performance, and you can see this in our revenue growth.
While the current supply chain environment is volatile and uncertain, we are confident in our current plans and our readiness to respond to any evolving dynamics. In the face of labor and material shortages throughout the supply chain, we are providing strong relative service and helping our customers avoid disruptions. We continue to actively leverage our network even if sometimes we have orders from less optimal locations at a higher cost. We are investing in inventory while actively monitoring the freight market and the West Coast ports.
And as it relates to labor, we have made great progress in closing staffing gaps and training team members, which has resulted in improvements, especially in our DC operations. Our customer research shows that this is driving customer satisfaction.
Turning to our financial highlights. Demand in the quarter was robust, resulting in strong revenue and gross margin performance and well-managed SG&A. We achieved organic daily sales growth of 11.9% for the total company on a constant currency basis. When compared to Q3 2019, the quarter was up 17.3% on a daily organic basis, driven primarily by core non-pandemic product sales, which is a positive indicator of our underlying run rate performance.
Our High-Touch Solutions North America segment grew 11.6% on a daily constant currency basis. In the U.S., we drove approximately 100 basis points of share outgrowth versus the prior year and 475 basis points on a 2-year average. We remain confident in our ability to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market on an ongoing basis. Our service to customers, especially the last 2 years, has contributed to meaningful share gain.
Our Endless Assortment segment finished the quarter with 14.9% daily sales growth on a constant currency basis. I'd like to note 2 things that temporarily moderated growth in this segment. First, Zoro lapped a very strong third quarter in 2020. For context, we opened up pandemic product supply to Zoro customers in Q3 2020 that was previously reserved mostly for government and health care customers. In the third quarter 2021, Zoro managed to drive 11.9% revenue growth, and when we compare that to Q3 2019, we are up 30.6%, which is really strong.
Also MonotaRO was impacted by several external factors, including a slow start to vaccinations and a generally slower Japanese economy. In local days and local currency, sales were up about 17.5% compared to Q3 2020. And MonotaRO continues to take share, especially as COVID restrictions lift, and we grow with our targeted enterprise customers. And as we look at results versus Q3 2019, MonotaRO sales are up to over 37%.
We feel that the comparison to 2019 for both businesses is more indicative of our underlying business strength. We still expect the segment to close the year with growth at about 20% above prior year. We saw strong gross margin expansion across all segments, even above our expectations that we discussed last quarter. High-Touch Solutions North America was up 140 basis points over Q3 of the prior year, and Endless Assortment was up 115 basis points. Dee will cover the drivers for those segments.
Lastly, we returned $327 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the third quarter, and we maintained strong return on invested capital of 31.4%.
Turning to our quarterly results for the company. I've discussed most of what's on this slide but wanted to point out a few additional items. First, our SG&A was $812 million, right where we thought it would be. We continued to invest in marketing and labor, primarily through increased variable compensation and wage rates in the DCs. And like many companies, we're also starting to see increased health care costs as team members return to routine medical visits and undergo deferred elective procedures. And while overall spending is up versus the prior year, we are still gaining significant leverage when compared to 2019.
Our operating earnings were $438 million, up 17.4%. And our resulting EPS is $5.65 for the quarter, which is growth of 25%. Overall, it was a really strong quarter.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail. Dee?"

Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment, we continued to see a robust recovery with daily sales up 12% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and up 14.5% compared to the third quarter of 2019. In the U.S., we saw strong growth, especially in our core non-pandemic product categories. Both large and midsized customers saw significant growth at 10% and 19%, respectively.
Canada continues to be slow as recurring shutdowns in many of the larger provinces kept businesses closed or operating at minimal capacity. As vaccination rates improve and businesses reopen, we expect more typical purchasing behavior to resume and sales to follow. Canadian daily sales were up 11.7% or 5.7% in local days and local currency compared to the third quarter of 2020.
For the High-Touch Solutions segment, GP margin finished the quarter at 39.4%, up 140 basis points versus the prior year third quarter. Our focus and diligence on managing price/cost spread contributed to our GP improvement. In the quarter, we saw strong price realization to customers, both on-contract and web pricing. Our realization was better than anticipated and, as a result, price/cost spread was above neutral.
In addition, consistent with the second quarter, our U.S. pandemic product mix was about 22%, an improvement versus 28% in the third quarter of 2020. We are confident that our run rate GP remains strong and will finish in line with the expectations we set forth for the fourth quarter.
On Slide 20, you'll find a chart with details on the U.S. and Canadian businesses. This information has been provided to help bridge our prior reportable segments to our new High-Touch Solutions North American segment. I'd like to give you some advance notice that we will continue to show daily sales and gross margin by business. However, as our operating expenses across the segment have become more intertwined, our operating margin by geography will no longer be provided in our 2022 reporting.
On Slide 9, taking a deeper dive into High-Touch Solutions for the U.S. The Delta variant and the renewed mask mandates in July reversed the declining trend we were seeing in the second quarter for pandemic products. As the virus surged, we saw pandemic product demand pick back up, especially for masks. However, of particular note, our core non-pandemic sales growth was at or above 20% every month in the third quarter. We are encouraged to see this growth as a sign of more regular business and economic activity.
When comparing core non-pandemic sales to Q3 2019, sales were up 12%, which is quite strong. In total, our U.S. High-Touch Solutions business is up 12% for the third quarter 2021 and up 16% as compared to 2019.
Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 10. In the third quarter, as expected, we saw our share gain grow as we lap more reasonable yet still inflated Q3 2020 comparisons. In the quarter, we estimate that the U.S. market grew between 10.5% and 11.5%, resulting in our estimated outgrowth of approximately 100 basis points versus Q3 2020.
To normalize for volatility, we are continuing to show the 2-year average share gain, which was about 475 basis points over the market for the third quarter of 2021. A really exceptional result. Given the noise and fluctuations in the market number across industrials, the 2-year average is a better estimate of our true market outgrowth. We remain focused on our key initiatives, which give us confidence in our ability to achieve our U.S. share gain goal of growing 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market.
Now let's cover our U.S. GP rate. We saw a significant lift in the High-Touch U.S. GP performance in the quarter. Sequentially, we wanted to comment on 2 of the biggest factors that make up the difference between the second quarter and the third quarter. First, the biggest contributor, the inventory adjustments, are behind us as anticipated. In addition, we are seeing greater price realization than expected. I'll note that while we sold some of the pandemic inventory that was previously written down, the impact to GP was immaterial.
We're encouraged by these results and are confident in our ability to achieve our expected 40.1% GP rate in Q4 based on continued pandemic mix improvements, our expected price realization in the fourth quarter and our ability to navigate supply chain challenges.
Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Daily sales increased 12.7% or 14.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued strength in our new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO as well as growth of larger enterprise customers at MonotaRO. GP expanded 115 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by Zoro U.S. We took a number of pricing actions based on evolving market conditions, and we deemphasized lower-margin channels. In addition, we experienced improved freight efficiencies at Zoro, primarily as a result of fewer B2C customers who typically place smaller orders that are more expensive to ship.
Operating margin for the segment finished up 80 basis points over the prior year third quarter due primarily to improved gross profit margin. I'll go into more detail on the next slide as we provide further transparency on the results for both businesses.
Moving to Slide 13. In local currency and using Japan's local selling days, which occasionally differ from U.S. selling days, MonotaRO daily sales grew 17.5% compared to the third quarter of 2020. GP margin finished the quarter at 25.8%, 30 basis points below the prior year third quarter, as we continue to grow with enterprise customers. As a result, operating margin decreased 65 basis points to 12%.
Switching to Zoro U.S. Daily sales grew 11.9% as compared to the strongest sales quarter of 2020. Zoro GP grew 375 basis points to 33.9% and achieved 325 basis points of operating margin expansion.
In addition to the strong financial performance in the segment, we also continued to execute well on our key initiatives. First, when it comes to our registered users, we saw continued growth across both businesses, which is an important driver of top line performance. And on the right, Zoro continues to actively add SKUs to the portfolio. At the end of the third quarter of 2021, we had a total of 8 million SKUs available online, achieving our goal for the year a quarter early, adding nearly 2 million SKUs in the last 9 months. We remain encouraged by our progress with SKU additions.
Once again, I would like to provide some color commentary as it relates to the fourth quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter, for revenues, we expect total company daily sales to be between 11.5% and 12.5%. We anticipate company gross margin will fall between 37.2% and 37.4%. As discussed before, we expect the U.S. GP rate to exit the year at or above pre-pandemic levels. And for SG&A, we expect a similar level of spending in the fourth quarter as we saw in the third quarter, between $810 million and $815 million with increased variable compensation, wages and health care expenses. And while it's unclear at this point, we may have some additional risk as it relates to vaccine mandate costs.
Given the strong performance in the quarter, we remain confident in our guidance range. For the full year, we expect revenue to be at or above the midpoint and all other metrics to be stronger than the low end of the range we discussed at the end of the second quarter, but likely still below the midpoint given the pandemic inventory adjustments taken in the first half.

In terms of inventory position, we've been able to serve both the High-Touch model and Zoro well throughout this period. What I would say is that if you're thinking about Zoro's growth, there's a couple of things that are impacting Zoro's growth rate in the quarter, and they will get better as we move forward. One was, last year, we opened up in the third quarter the safety products to Zoro and, as a result, customer acquisitions and revenue were extremely high, and a lot of the customer acquisitions were consumers as well, as people are just looking and scrambling to find product.
The other thing is we've been very clear and focused on attractive business acquisitions and, as a result, we have shut off some channels for acquisition that weren't as profitable long term. And so -- and that's going away moving forward as well. And so that's been a bit of a drag on Zoro, but it hasn't been because we haven't been shipping product from Zoro. We've been serving customers well across both models."

So yes, I mean, that was -- a big part of the reason for resetting prices was we had gone through a long period of decline with midsized customers. And here, we're really talking about midsized customers that have some sort of mechanical complexity, so think about midsized manufacturers or companies that really value some of the technical product support, search capabilities of the Grainger model. Obviously, since the price reset, we've captured a lot of that back.
We're still fairly significantly below our high point with midsized customers. We feel like we've got a long runway ahead of us. We are getting smarter all the time. We are not seeing much cannibalization with Zoro. Zoro tends to focus on smaller businesses and businesses that are maybe a little more narrow in what their needs are. And so they tend to segment to different types of customers more. The Grainger midsized customer typically has fairly high mechanical complexity or complexity of some type.
And so we are really pleased with what we're seeing. I would say, I think we went from about $2 billion to less than $1 billion in that space over a 10-year period, and now we've covered some of that. We haven't recovered all of it. We think we can get back above $2 billion. So we think we've got a long runway ahead."

So we generally try to think about managing costs as well as we possibly can. We are, obviously, working with our suppliers on a constant basis in this environment to make sure that we are taking cost increases that make sense and pushing back things if they don't make sense. Our suppliers have been great about sort of working with us to find the right path for cost increases.
And then on transportation, sort of the same thing. We really are focused on understanding what cost increases are reasonable and working with our suppliers and our partners to get the right outcome. We price to market.
I think, in general, when you have inflationary periods, not this type of inflationary period but normal inflationary periods, we've historically probably been able to take market price increases and not have as much cost increase or have it delayed. And so we will sometimes have a period of advantage.
I think right now, given the pace of cost increases, I think we're pretty well matched, and we'll continue to be pretty well matched, and that's our expectation given there's been a lot of off-cycle cost increases, and we've been able to price those through as we go.
So I would say, I don't think there's a big gap right now or a big benefit right now. It's just -- it's a fairly wild time, obviously, in the supply chain, and we are -- I think we're navigating through it well."

And so I think the amount of work that's required to navigate here is much more than you would find in a typical setting.
One of the things we did do is we saw some challenges coming on the horizon. We actually ordered -- preordered a bunch of products early in the year and tried to get inventory in. And we have been able to build some inventory throughout the year, maybe not as much as we'd like, but we have been able to build some inventory. That's helped us. Our supplier management team and product teams are working very closely together to find -- make sure we've got the right substitute products so we can serve customers if there's a gap in a particular supplier that can't provide us product.
We are actively prioritizing product coming off of Asia. We have upped wages in distribution centers and gotten staffing right. So we are basically clean consistently now, which is good. That was a little bit of a challenge back in May.
So basically, if you follow the supply chain view at every single step, we are working at it every single step of the way.

I would say the OSHA ruling and how that comes down is probably more of a question mark in terms of vaccine mandate cost. We are ready to do what we need to do and prepare to do whatever needs to happen. We are hopeful that the vaccine mandate is done in a way that doesn't hurt the supply chain. I've been in our transportation depots and our facilities and our customers' facilities, and a vaccine mandate that's not well thought through could cause significant problems to an already challenged supply chain.
And so we are -- we don't know where all that's going to land, just to be clear, but we are prepared. And we've done some things to prepare for any eventuality there and trying to understand what the best path forward is going to be depending on how all that shakes out."
