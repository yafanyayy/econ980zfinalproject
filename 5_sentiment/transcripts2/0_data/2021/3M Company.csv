The 3M team finished the year strong as we continue to execute well, innovate for our customers and fight the pandemic from every angle. In an uncertain economic environment, we delivered organic growth in all business groups and geographic areas, along with margin expansion, a double-digit increase in earnings and strong cash flow during the fourth quarter. 
Throughout 2020, I am proud of how 3M stepped up to help meet the extraordinary challenges facing the world, which includes our comprehensive response to COVID-19. Last year, we also took actions to transform for the future, advance our core values and strengthen our balance sheet through robust cash generation. At the same time, we know that more work remains to deliver for our customers, shareholders and all stakeholders. 
Moving forward, we will build on our progress and continue to prioritize investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. 3M is well positioned as we head into 2021. And today, we are providing guidance for the year, where we expect a return to healthy growth. Overall, I'm confident in our ability to deliver a successful 2021, lead through the economic recovery and capitalize on opportunities from emerging trends that are favorable to 3M and our market-leading businesses. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Company-wide, total sales in the fourth quarter increased to $8.6 billion, with organic growth of 6% and earnings of $2.38 per share, up 22% year-on-year on an adjusted basis. Demand remains strong in end markets such as personal safety, home cleaning and semiconductors, and we saw sequential improvement in general industrial and automotive OEM. We also saw ongoing weakness in other end markets, including health care and oral care elective procedures, which declined sequentially as they continued to be impacted by COVID-19. 
Geographically, organic growth was led by the Americas, up 8%, with the United States up 9%. EMEA grew 6% and Asia Pacific grew 2%, with China up 14%. Our team delivered another quarter of good operational performance. We expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins to over 27% with all business groups above 26% and increased our adjusted cash flow to $2.1 billion. 
That wraps up my opening comments. I will come back to discuss our full year performance along with my perspective on 2021 after Monish takes you through the details of the quarter. Monish?"

Please turn to Slide 6. Company-wide, fourth quarter sales were $8.6 billion, up 5.8% year-on-year. This result was better than we had anticipated. Our personal safety team continued to execute well",1631,"Thank you, Mike. And I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. Company-wide, fourth quarter sales were $8.6 billion, up 5.8% year-on-year. This result was better than we had anticipated. Our personal safety team continued to execute well in expanding respirator production to support pandemic-related demand. We also saw continued end-market strength through year-end in automotive OEM, electronics and home improvement. 
Strong operating rigor and disciplined cost management drove robust adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion, up 20%, with adjusted operating margins of 21.5%, up 250 basis points year-on-year. 
On the right-hand side of this slide, you can see the components that impacted margins. Organic volume growth, along with our ongoing cost management and productivity efforts, were the biggest contributor to our margin improvement, adding 160 basis points. Included in this 160 basis point benefit were 2 items that I had called out during a conference in early December. 
First, we exited a product line within our closure, masking and packaging business and sold the related property in Q4. This resulted in a pretax gain of $54 million or 60 basis points margin benefit. Please note that this gain is included in Safety and Industrial's Q4 operating income. 
And second, we had increased our respirator mask reserve by $107 million in Q4, which resulted in a 90 basis point headwind to margins year-on-year. For the full year, we increased our respirator mask reserve by roughly $130 million, which is a little higher than the $100 million average over the last few years. This increase in our reserve is reflected in corporate and unallocated. 
As you may have noticed, adjusting for last year's significant litigation charge, our fourth quarter corporate and unallocated expense was up approximately $100 million year-on-year. This increase was primarily driven by our update to our respirator mask reserve, along with impact from ongoing legal costs as we continue to manage PFAS and other legal proceedings. 
Turning to selling prices and raw materials, which was an 80 basis point year-on-year benefit to margins. This benefit was driven by the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material cost versus last year's fourth quarter. Note, approximately half of our fourth quarter selling price performance was benefited by lower year-on-year volume-related customer rebates and markets that were most impacted by the pandemic. 
Acquisition and divestitures contributed 10 basis points year-on-year. Foreign currency net of hedging impacts decreased margins by 10 basis points. And lastly, while the fourth quarter pretax restructuring charge of $137 million was similar to last year's charge, restructuring provided a 10 basis point benefit to margins year-on-year due to this year's higher sales. 
Let's now turn to Slide 7 for a closer look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter earnings were $2.38 per share, up 22% from last year on an adjusted basis. First, as discussed on the prior slide, organic growth and ongoing cost management and productivity efforts delivered $0.43 per share to earnings growth. This included a $0.09 benefit from the gain on sale of property and a $0.10 headwind from the increased respirator mask reserve. 
Acquisitions and divestitures reduced earnings by $0.02, and foreign exchange impacts added $0.02 to per-share earnings year-on-year. The strength of the 3M business model, strong cash flow and liquidity position gave us the opportunity in Q4 to retire $1 billion of debt early that was due to mature in 2021. As a result, we incurred higher net interest in the quarter which, combined with higher shares outstanding, reduced earnings by $0.03. 
Finally, a lower tax rate versus last year provided a $0.03 benefit to earnings per share. The lower tax rate was primarily a function of the mix of pretax income around the world. 
Please turn to Slide 8 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. We delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow of $2.1 billion, up 16% year-over-year, with conversion of 151%. Cash flows in the quarter were primarily driven by robust income and daily management of working capital. 
For the full year, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $6.7 billion, up 18%. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $422 million and were $1.5 billion for the year. During the quarter, we returned $848 million to our shareholders via dividends and $3.4 billion for the year. Share repurchases remain suspended throughout the quarter given the continued global economic uncertainty. 
Our strong fourth quarter cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to strengthen our capital structure. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand and reduced net debt by $1.3 billion or 9% sequentially. 
For the year, we improved our net debt position by $4.1 billion or 23%. As a result, we exited the year with net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.5, down from 2.3 at the end of 2019. This significant improvement in our net debt position, along with our strong cash flow generation capability, provides us increased financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. 
Please turn to Slide 9, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q4. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 11.4% year-on-year in the fourth quarter. This result includes an approximate 10 percentage point benefit from pandemic-related respirator mask demand. Overall, general industrial manufacturing activity continued to improve during Q4. However, customers and channel partners continue to remain cautious given ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. 
Personal safety posted double-digit organic growth year-on-year driven by continued demand for respirators. Industrial adhesives and tapes grew mid-single digits, while the electrical markets business was up low single digits. 
The strong growth in the residential housing market continue to drive good performance in our roofing granules business, which was up double digits organically versus Q4 of last year. The rest of the Safety and Industrial portfolio, namely automotive aftermarket, abrasives and closure and masking, declined year-on-year. Safety and Industrial's fourth quarter segment operating margins were 27.7%, up 690 basis points, driven by strong leverage on sales growth and continued productivity and spending discipline, along with the previously mentioned gain on sale of real estate. 
Moving to Transportation and Electronics. After a challenging last 2 years, fourth quarter organic sales growth turned positive, up 1.4% as compared to last year. Our electronics-related business was up 2% with continued strong growth in semiconductor, factory automation and data centers, which was partially offset by year-on-year softness in consumer electronics. 
Our auto OEM business was up 18% year-on-year compared to the 3% increase in global car and light truck builds. For the full year, our automotive business outperformed global builds by approximately 700 basis points. 
Advanced materials and transportation safety returned to growth year-on-year driven by improving end market trends in automotive and highway infrastructure. Commercial solutions continued to be down year-on-year due to negative pandemic-related impacts on advertising spend and demand for workplace cleaning and safety products and solutions. Transportation and Electronics' fourth quarter operating margins were 21.8%, up 100 basis points on positive sales growth and continued cost discipline. 
Turning to Health Care. Some parts of the world were challenged with rising COVID-19 cases throughout Q4. As a result, those health care providers experienced sequential declines in the elective procedure volumes, which negatively impacted parts of our business. At the same time, we continue to experience strong pandemic-related demand for respirators to protect frontline health care workers, which more than offset the headwinds from the decline in elective procedure volumes. As a result, our Health Care business delivered fourth quarter organic sales growth of 6.6% versus last year. 
The Medical Solutions business grew low double digits driven by continued strong respiratory demand. Excluding respirators, organic growth in this business was flat. Our oral care business organic sales were flat year-over-year as it dealt with rising COVID cases. 
The separation and purification business increased low double digits year-on-year. This business continues to experience solid demand for biopharma filtration solutions in support of the pharmaceutical industry's research and manufacturing efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutic treatments for COVID. 
Turning to health information systems, which declined mid-single digits organically, as hospitals continue to remain cautious relative to the information technology investments. And finally, food safety was up low single digits organically versus last year. Health Care's fourth quarter operating margins were 24.7%, up 340 basis points year-on-year, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 31.7%. Fourth quarter margins were driven by continued strong execution and cost management, which was partially offset by the higher year-on-year restructuring costs. 
Lastly, fourth quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was up 10% as retailers saw continued strong customer demand throughout the holiday season. Growth in this business continues to be driven by strong consumer demand for our category-leading brands, namely Filtrete, Scotch, ScotchBlue, Scotch-Brite, Command and Meguiar's. We also continue to see very strong growth in e-commerce channels as the pandemic has accelerated years' worth of changes in consumer shopping behavior. 
Organic sales growth within Consumer continued to be led by home improvement and home care businesses, each up double digits organically. Stationery and office declined low single digits as many business offices and schools remain partially or fully closed due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic. Consumer's operating margins were 23.5%, about similar to last year. As we have previously mentioned, we have been stepping up investments in advertising and merchandising and new product innovation to address changing consumer demand trends. Lastly, similar to Health Care, operating margins were impacted by higher year-on-year restructuring costs. 
That wraps up the review of fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 10, and I will hand it back over to Mike. Mike?"

We posted an organic sales decline of 2% and adjusted earnings of $8.74 per share. We increased adjusted free cash flow by 18% to $6.7 billion with a conversion rate of 132%, which demonstrates the strength of our business model and our continued ability to perform across economic cycles. Additionally, we posted a good return on invested capital of 18% and expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins to over 27%, up 100 basis points year-on-year. 
Our strong cash flow, along with disciplined capital allocation, helped us reduce net debt by over $4 billion in the year. During the year, we strengthened our Health Care portfolio with the successful integration of Acelity and the completion of the divestiture of drug delivery. We returned $3.8 billion to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. And last year marked our 62nd consecutive year of dividend increases. Beyond financial results, 2020 was a year where 3M stepped up when we were needed the most. 
Please turn to Slide 11. Throughout the pandemic, 3Mers have been relentless in applying science to improve lives and make the world a better place. Our COVID-19 response has been guided by 3 priorities: protecting our employees, fighting the pandemic from every angle and delivering for our customers and shareholders. Beginning last January, we immediately activated our surge capacity and doubled our production of respirators to help protect nurses, doctors and first responders. We have since worked tirelessly to bring on more capacity, which includes additional investments from 3M and partnerships with governments at all levels. 
In total, last year, we produced and delivered 2 billion respirators globally, with approximately half in the United States. Today, we are at an annual run rate of 2.5 billion respirators, a fourfold increase versus 2019. 
At the same time, we've worked closely with governments, law enforcement and retailers to fight fraud. To date, we have helped identify more than 8 million counterfeit respirators, protecting health care workers from bad actors. 
Beyond providing respirators and other important personal protective equipment, we have helped the world recover in other ways. For example, our biopharma filtration solutions have enabled the development and manufacture of critical vaccines and therapeutics. We also took significant actions throughout the year to position ourselves for long-term growth and value creation. 
We continue to strengthen our innovation, which remains at the center of our 3M model. And last year, we invested $3.4 billion in the combination of research and development and CapEx. Our team also found ways to innovate differently and faster in response to the pandemic and to serve growing market trends. We formed partnerships with other companies to expand respirator production. We introduced new daily face coverings. And we quickly adapted our cleaning product lines to serve new customers. We created new products to improve indoor air quality, biopharma filtration and automotive electrification, just a few of our priority growth platforms. We rolled out cutting-edge solutions to improve the performance of electric car batteries, one element of our work to enable more sustainable vehicle designs. 
For the full year, our priority growth platforms grew 7%, outperforming the markets they serve. We also continue to see benefits from the global operating model we implemented last January. Our model enabled us to respond to the pandemic with agility and resilience, from our significant expansion of PPE production to our ability to maintain business continuity, serve our customers and ensure the integrity of our supply chain. Our enterprise operations team is applying learnings from our expansion of respirator production into other areas of 3M. For example, we are deploying new technology and using our analytic platforms to double our Filtrete capacity. 
We also took steps to optimize our model and further streamline our organization, initiating a restructuring in December that will reduce annual operating costs by $250 million to $300 million. 
In summary, as I look across 2020, I am proud of our accomplishments and our people, from the 50,000 3Mers in our factories, to our colleagues who volunteered to relocate and help scale up new respirator lines, to the retirees who came back to staff our hotline, answering calls from home. People across 3M have stepped up to make a difference, and I thank our entire team for their incredible contributions in 2020. 
Please turn to Slide 12. We expect to deliver a strong performance in 2021 with organic growth of 3% to 6%, improved earnings, margin expansion and strong cash flow. And Monish will take you through the details shortly. 
We have aggressively prioritized investments throughout the pandemic, and we will accelerate our efforts in 2021 with ongoing focus on growth, productivity and sustainability. We will increase investments in areas with strong growth opportunities such as personal safety, home improvement and health care with continued emphasis on our priority growth platforms. The rapid movement to an even more digital-first world also opens additional opportunities for 3M. 
We are pioneering innovations that improve performance of data centers and semiconductor manufacturing, which will be more relevant moving forward. We will also do more to leverage e-commerce, along with digital technologies to better serve our customers. Ultimately, we have big opportunities to unleash 3M Science and drive sustainable long-term growth, and we will ensure that our teams have the resources to capitalize. 
We continue to advance the digitization of 3M while also accelerating our use of data and analytics in everything we do. Further strengthening our supply chain is a priority in 2021 with a focus on highly sustainable, disruptive and safe manufacturing technology, which will help us deliver on our promises to customers and shareholders. 
To that end, I want to close by talking about the commitments we will keep in 2021 and beyond: leading our industry in science, society and sustainability. 3M Science drives our business forward. We leverage and combine our technologies in unique ways across the company, creating new products and new lines of business, and we are positioned to do even more to deliver differentiated value for our customers into the future. 
In a similar way, 3M is partnering with our communities to improve society. In 2020, we took steps to advance our core values, including diversity, equity and inclusion. And in the coming year, we will hold ourselves accountable to new goals to support underrepresented groups at 3M, building on our recent progress. We will also be releasing a new global diversity, equity and inclusion report with details on our metrics. 
We remain committed to sustainability, which includes using science to proactively manage PFAS and and to enable success in our ongoing work with communities and governments to advance our environmental stewardship. We will continue to increase investments to make our factories more sustainable, including $100 million in investments this year, which is included in our 2021 CapEx guidance, to further reduce water usage and improve water quality around our manufacturing sites. 
To help address questions you have been asking, I would also like to touch on our strong history of working with governments and leveraging science to solve big challenges around the world. We have had productive conversations with President Biden's transition team and now the administration about their COVID-19 response, and we have open lines of communication. We will continue to do all we can to get respirators and other personal protective equipment to frontline workers and help America and the world beat the pandemic. 
On environmental stewardship, we share a common goal with governments of improving water quality and doing so in a way that is based on sound science, established regulatory processes and collaboration with a broad range of stakeholders. We look forward to working with President Biden's administration and congressional leaders to pursue these shared goals, including through the remediation of PFAS, where appropriate. And we aim to build on the successful public-private partnerships that 3M has led globally throughout our history as a company. 
To wrap up, we are confident about what's ahead in 2021 and in our ability to create more value from the 3M model and build an even more competitive and sustainable enterprise. 
I will now turn the call over to Monish to cover the details of our guidance. Monish?"
289194,693511107,2181489,"3M Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","3M Company","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Please turn to Slide 13.

As Mike mentioned, we are initiating full year 2021 guidance as end-market visibility has continued to improve despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. As a result, we will no longer be reporting monthly sales updates as we had in 2020. 
Looking at sales. We are forecasting total sales growth of 5% to 8%, with organic growth in the range of 3% to 6%. Earnings per share is projected to be between $9.20 and $9.70 or up 5% to 11% on an adjusted basis. The primary contributors to earnings growth in 2021 include: organic sales growth, productivity as we continue to increase our focus on operating rigor through daily management and leveraging the use of data and data analytics, and our ongoing efforts to advance and streamline our global operating model. And lastly, we anticipate benefits from foreign currency due to the weaker U.S. dollar. 
Partially offsetting these benefits are anticipated year-on-year headwinds from the Q4 2020 gain on sale of real estate, an expected increase in areas such as travel, variable incentive compensation and advertising and merchandising investments. 
Turning to cash. We expect another year of robust cash flow, with free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. 
From a capital allocation perspective, our first priority remains investing organically in our business, including R&D and CapEx. As we have noted, we are increasing investments in growth, productivity and sustainability in 2021. As a result, CapEx for the year is expected to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. 
Returning cash to shareholders remains a high priority for 3M, including both dividends, along with a disciplined approach to share repurchases, which we plan to restart in 2021. Please see the appendix in today's slide presentation for additional details regarding our 2021 full year guidance. 
Please turn to Slide 14. Here you see a breakdown of our expectations for organic growth by business group, along with some of the key macroeconomic and market indicators we incorporated into our planning. Overall, the pace and success of the COVID-19 vaccine deployment and adoption will be critical for the global economy. The 2 broadest macroeconomic indicators, global GDP and IPI, are both expected to grow mid-single digits. 
The overall electronics market is expected to be up mid-single digits. In addition, global car and light truck builds are expected to grow 14% versus 2020. Also, while health care and oral care elective procedure volumes have improved off the Q2 lows of 2020, they are currently not expected to return to pre-COVID levels until the later part of 2021. We are also monitoring the ability and pace for people to return to the workplace and students to return to school. And finally, consumer spending, particularly retail sales and home improvement demand and e-commerce, also are factors in our planning. 
Taking these factors into account, we expect the following organic growth expectations for our business groups in 2021. Starting with Safety and Industrial, where we anticipate organic local currency growth to be up mid-single digits. Transportation and Electronics is expected to be up low to high single digits. This wider range contemplates the potential for end-market variability, particularly in automotive and electronics. And finally, both our Health Care and Consumer businesses are projected to grow in the low to mid-single digits this year. 
In 2021, we will prioritize capital to our greatest market opportunities, deliver for our customers, drive commercial intensity, improve operating rigor, enhance daily management, leverage data and data analytics and continue to streamline our organization. As a result, we expect solid revenue growth, improved margins and earnings, robust free cash flow and a continued strong capital structure and financial flexibility. 
To wrap up, in the spirit of continuous improvement, there's always more we can do and will do. I would like to thank all 3Mers for the hard work and the progress that we have made in an unprecedented year. 
With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

And as you know, we've done a great job as a team trying to keep our costs under control. You can see that in Q3 results, you can see that in Q4. How it'll bounce back will actually all depend on where we see the recovery of the pandemic and how the vaccine plays itself out. 
Currently, as you can see from the guidance that we have given you, there is headwind that we are planning on the bounce-back of $0.35 to $0.45 that was put in there. And there are 2 or 3 things in there, Deane. One is, as you think about the property sales that are year-over-year that are non-repeat. Secondly, all these indirect costs, travel is a big piece of that, that comes back. And the third one is the variable compensation that gets reset for 2021. And from a 4Q to 1Q also, there would be a reset and an increase in cost. 
So those are the factors we are looking at. And I would just say, from a quarter perspective, it's all going to depend on our -- how revenue comes across, how growth happens, how the economy recovers. 
The other piece, just to keep in mind, as Mike mentioned, our plan is to invest more in opportunities on growth, productivity and sustainability. And that also will have an impact on each quarter, depending on how the economy recovers."

I think you're asking what's our cadence on how we're going to look at 2021. So what -- we're going to be as helpful as we can. As you know, Joe, we have initiated annual guidance and based on where we see some of the end markets that I mentioned about in my prepared remarks. Based on that, we'll see where -- how those end markets play out. That will determine how our quarterly things play out. Our guidance is, right now, organic, 3% to 6% with 5% to 8% growth in total, including FX. 
One of the things that we have seen over the pandemic, Joe, is our normal trends that historically would see, don't seem to play itself out. So for example, in December, the company usually sees deceleration. We didn't see the deceleration. Similarly on a month-to-month trend, sometimes, what you see in variability in the months was higher due to COVID. And so therefore, my personal belief is I think you're going to see more variability throughout the year, depending on how different parts of the world play itself out. 
We are also aggressively prioritizing our investments throughout on all the 3 items Mike mentioned: growth, productivity and sustainability. Again, that will have an impact based on how revenue plays itself out. We would love to go heavy and invest early so that we can capture the growth that's coming. But we'll have to see how the world recovers. So we'll have to just walk through that. 
And then just another piece for you to keep in mind as you're thinking about the quarters is, from a restructuring charge perspective, we had announced a charge in the fourth quarter. You're going to see the balance of that chart somewhere between $110 million to $160 million in the second half of this year, and we'll tighten that as we go through the quarter. So our goal is to be as helpful as we can throughout and through the various interactions we have with all of you is to tell you what's going on in the world, but that's the way we see it right now. So hopefully, I answered your question, Joe."

And the benefit from restructuring is anywhere between $0.20 to $0.30. 
If you think of the headwinds, as I mentioned before, there's property sales that don't repeat. Some of the indirect costs, that will snap back. Example, travel and variable compensation is in that range of 35% to 45%. And then on the restructuring side, the $0.20 to $0.30, I would ask you to think about 2 pieces. One is for all the other actions that the company had taken other than the fourth quarter, there's a carryover benefit of, give or take, $100 million. And then the benefits of the restructuring that we announced in the fourth quarter is another $75 million of benefit -- $75 million to $100 million. And then, of course, it's offset by the charge that we're going to take of $110 million to $160 million.

So first, just to answer your question to give you the 20% to 21.5%. That's correct. So it's 21.3% is the perfect number.

So first, just to answer your question to give you the 20% to 21.5%. That's correct. So it's 21.3% is the perfect number. 
If you think about 2021 and how we look at margin, I'll just elevate first to say our general view over the long term is growth at or above macro, sustainable margin improvement, strong cash that ultimately helps us have a very strong capital structure. So keeping that in mind, we would say that's basically how we are thinking about long term. 
Things to factor in from a margin guide perspective. As Mike mentioned, we are going to invest properly in growth, productivity and sustainability. So that's going to have one factor. The second factor is going to be the amount of productivity that we are generating. We've got a lot of proprietary technologies that we are rolling out in supply chain. Mike mentioned that the stability of our supply chain is one of our priorities for 2021. We're going to continue that path. So you should see benefit from the productivity actions that the supply chain team is driving. 
The third piece is making sure that we have factored in correctly the snapback of 2020 costs. We have shown you that as $0.35 to $0.45 of headwind, again, on the 3 items that I mentioned before. 
And I would say the last one to think about this is thinking about what revenue is going to be and what growth looks like quarter-to-quarter. And that's going to also have a pretty big impact on where we end up from a margin perspective. So those are all the factors that we are putting in here as we think about.

We have -- even in the middle of the pandemic, we continue to make very good progress on some of what you outlined there. And part of it is the digitization of 3M, transforming our company, deploying new ERP and ecosystem around that. That continues to move forward. We are also now operating for 1 year, our new operating model that we launched in January of 2020. And that -- we moved ahead in the middle of the pandemic. We benefited from it. We saw the benefits come in our ability to respond to just the dynamics that we hit -- we saw in our markets as we went through the year. 
So I would say we benefited from it. It validated where we are going with the 3M model. It validated the strengths of the 3M model and how we apply our innovation in our markets. And I would say it encouraged us to continue to really press ahead. And I talked about that in my prepared remarks about the digitization, improving our operations. I see it in terms of more agility, shorter cycle times, improved response. And ultimately, it's really at the foundation of how we drive productivity, operational improvements as we go. So that's becoming the way we take advantage of it. That's how we focus it. 
And so planning broadly as part of that, we're getting, I would say, better in terms of cycle times and I -- better at using the greater visibility on data and the analytics that go with it. So it's -- I'm encouraged with the progress we made, and I believe there's more to come as we go through 2021."

I look at also the ability to see visibility of data. So there's data democratization, where we can see stuff that is happening much faster on a daily basis. So it's all about driving the operating rigor, getting the daily management, quickly going into root cause and then finding sustainable improvements.

So Acelity, I would say, is one of the divisions that does get impacted the highest due to hospitalization rate and elective surgeries. But overall, when you just step back and say, what has Acelity done? I would say, as the volumes came up in Q2, post Q2 lows, the business has continued to grow tremendously through those Q2 lows. 
The reason why Acelity is so good for 3M, I think there are a couple of things. One is it's in a market that is ever growing right now based on where our demographics are. Secondly, it gives 3M a lot more relevance when it comes to talking to caregivers. Third is it gets us into a post-acute space and a home care space, which I think post-COVID is going to be a trend from a home care perspective. 
And then what 3M brings to Acelity is the synergies that it can bring. One is its brand, its global reach and its ability to do global and high-speed manufacturing it brings it to that. And 3M did already have an advanced wound care business. So when you put this together, it basically makes it a very good acquisition for 3M. 
We have seen growth in both. We have made positive income in third and fourth quarter. And we are very encouraged with all the work that the health care team is doing that this business will keep growing. But of course, it will be partially dependent on how the world recovers from electives."

And so if you look at our 4 go-to-market models, they each have a little different dynamic. The Safety and Industrial business, our channel partners remain cautious there. You're seeing continued demand for us in safety and personal protective equipment. 
We saw some improvement in our industrial adhesives and tapes business as we went through Q4. Other businesses are still seeing end-market decline. And so we're not seeing material restocking in those safety or industrial channels globally. 
Transportation and Electronics, they're pretty much in balance with demand. There's some tight supply. Monish mentioned supply chain, things that we're watching, everybody is watching around semiconductor. And that is really to the strong demand in their end markets. 
Health Care, generally steady as the end markets have now adjusted to the changes in areas like elective procedures in the middle of COVID. There's -- Q4, we kind of saw a resurgence of COVID cases impact that but pretty steady as we come into the year. 
And Consumer is, I would say, mixed. We see high demand and home improvement. That continues. That's lower-than-normal levels in that channel. And we see really elevated levels still in office and retail, as you've seen the slowdown because of the work remotely kind of economy that we're in.

As you correctly stated, there's a lot of uncertainty right now in the world. As we saw end markets starting to stabilize, our visibility got better. We started an annual guidance of 3% to 6%. And I think as the world recovers, we should be able to get there. We are confident that innovation that we are doing should help us get to solid growth and grow at or above macro in the long run. 
When you think about 1Q, one of the things that we have seen over the last 6 months that I've at least been here and longer for this team is some of the historical trends have just not played themselves out. So December didn't slow down as historically has been. With that said, I don't think January has started off very weak. 
But the things that we are watching are, where does hospitalization go? What happens to elective procedures, both in the hospital and the oral care space? So we're pretty cautious in that and seeing what we are seeing right now. 
On the industrial side, making sure that industrial activity continues. Our customers continue to buy inventory will be the second piece that we got to watch. Third, as I've mentioned, on the auto side and on the electronic side, where both of them are starting to combine together, how does the supply chain play itself out and what the volume of auto production is going to be? 
And then the last one to think about is from a consumer perspective, we had an extremely strong consumer growth. You saw we grew nearly 10% with a very strong holiday season. The question is, does that strength continue in retail? When do schools reopen? Also, 
just a reminder, from a tactical basis, we are hitting that point where we start lapping year-over-year pandemic demand. So 3M had nearly $100 million of disposable respirator sales last year, 1Q '20, again driven by the pandemic. So we are lapping that. 
And then on the income side to think through, Nicole, is what is the volume going to look like. And I mentioned, we are quite cautious on what we are seeing. And then just on the tactical side, what else are we going to invest? How fast we're going to invest in each of the quarters in the areas Mike mentioned? And then from a -- quarter-over-quarter sequential basis, as we reset variable compensation, for the first quarter as well as as we start stepping into advertising, merchandising investments will have an impact. 
So hopefully, I gave you the things we are looking at, Nicole, as we are thinking about the quarter."

The 3M team finished the year strong as we continue to execute well, innovate for our customers and fight the pandemic from every angle. In an uncertain economic environment, we delivered organic growth in all business groups and geographic areas, along with margin expansion, a double-digit increase in earnings and strong cash flow during the fourth quarter.
Throughout 2020, I am proud of how 3M stepped up to help meet the extraordinary challenges facing the world, which includes our comprehensive response to COVID-19. Last year, we also took actions to transform for the future, advance our core values and strengthen our balance sheet through robust cash generation. At the same time, we know that more work remains to deliver for our customers, shareholders and all stakeholders.
Moving forward, we will build on our progress and continue to prioritize investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. 3M is well positioned as we head into 2021. And today, we are providing guidance for the year where we expect a return to healthy growth. Overall, I'm confident in our ability to deliver a successful 2021, lead through the economic recovery and capitalize on opportunities from emerging trends that are favorable to 3M and our market-leading businesses.
Please turn to Slide 5. Company-wide, total sales in the fourth quarter increased to $8.6 billion, with organic growth of 6% and earnings of $2.38 per share, up 22% year-on-year on an adjusted basis. Demand remains strong in end markets such as personal safety, home cleaning and semiconductors, and we saw sequential improvement in general industrial and automotive OEM. We also saw ongoing weakness in other end markets, including health care and oral care elective procedures, which declined sequentially as they continued to be impacted by COVID-19.
Geographically, organic growth was led by the Americas, up 8%, with the United States up 9%. EMEA grew 6% and Asia Pacific grew 2%, with China up 14%. Our team delivered another quarter of good operational performance. We expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins to over 27% with all business groups above 26% and increased our adjusted cash flow to $2.1 billion.
That wraps up my opening comments. I will come back to discuss our full year performance along with my perspective on 2021 after Monish takes you through the details of the quarter. Monish?"

Please turn to Slide 6. Company-wide, fourth quarter sales were $8.6 billion, up 5.8% year-on-year. This result was better than we had anticipated. Our personal safety team continued to execute well",1634,"Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. Company-wide, fourth quarter sales were $8.6 billion, up 5.8% year-on-year. This result was better than we had anticipated. Our personal safety team continued to execute well in expanding respirator production to support pandemic-related demand.
We also saw continued end-market strength through year-end in automotive OEM, electronics and home improvement. Strong operating rigor and disciplined cost management drove robust adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion, up 20%, with adjusted operating margins of 21.5%, up 250 basis points year-on-year.
On the right-hand side of this slide, you can see the components that impacted margins. Organic volume growth, along with our ongoing cost management and productivity efforts, were the biggest contributor to our margin improvement, adding 160 basis points. Included in this 160 basis point benefit were 2 items that I had called out during a conference in early December.
First, we exited a product line within our closure, masking and packaging business and sold the related property in Q4. This resulted in a pretax gain of $54 million or 60 basis points margin benefit. Please note that this gain is included in Safety and Industrial's Q4 operating income.
And second, we had increased our respirator mask reserve by $107 million in Q4, which resulted in a 90 basis point headwind to margins year-on-year. For the full year, we increased our respirator mask reserve by roughly $130 million, which is a little higher than the $100 million average over the last few years. This increase in our reserve is reflected in Corporate and Unallocated.
As you may have noticed, adjusting for last year's significant litigation charge, our fourth quarter Corporate and Unallocated expense was up approximately $100 million year-on-year. This increase was primarily driven by our update to our respirator mask reserve, along with impacts from ongoing legal costs as we continue to manage PFAS and other legal proceedings.
Turning to selling prices and raw materials, which was an 80 basis point year-on-year benefit to margins. This benefit was driven by the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material cost versus last year's fourth quarter. Note, approximately half of our fourth quarter selling price performance was benefited by lower year-on-year volume-related customer rebates and markets that were most impacted by the pandemic.
Acquisition and divestitures contributed 10 basis points year-on-year. Foreign currency net of hedging impacts decreased margins by 10 basis points. And lastly, while the fourth quarter pretax restructuring charge of $137 million was similar to last year's charge, restructuring provided a 10 basis point benefit to margins year-on-year due to this year's higher sales.
Let's now turn to Slide 7 for a closer look at earnings per share. Fourth quarter earnings were $2.38 per share, up 22% from last year on an adjusted basis. First, as discussed on the prior slide, organic growth and ongoing cost management and productivity efforts delivered $0.43 per share to earnings growth. This included a $0.09 benefit from the gain on sale of property and a $0.10 headwind from the increased respirator mask reserve.
Acquisitions and divestitures reduced earnings by $0.02, and foreign exchange impacts added $0.02 to per-share earnings year-on-year. The strength of the 3M business model, strong cash flow and liquidity position gave us the opportunity in Q4 to retire $1 billion of debt early that was due to mature in 2021. As a result, we incurred higher net interest in the quarter, which, combined with higher shares outstanding, reduced earnings by $0.03.
Finally, a lower tax rate versus last year provided a $0.03 benefit to earnings per share. The lower tax rate was primarily a function of the mix of pretax income around the world.
Please turn to Slide 8 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. We delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow of $2.1 billion, up 16% year-over-year, with conversion of 151%. Cash flows in the quarter were primarily driven by robust income and daily management of working capital.
For the full year, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $6.7 billion, up 18%. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $422 million and were $1.5 billion for the year. During the quarter, we returned $848 million to our shareholders via dividends and $3.4 billion for the year. Share repurchases remain suspended throughout the quarter given the continued global economic uncertainty.
Our strong fourth quarter cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to strengthen our capital structure. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand and reduced net debt by $1.3 billion or 9% sequentially.
For the year, we improved our net debt position by $4.1 billion or 23%. As a result, we exited the year with net debt to EBITDA of 1.5, down from 2.3 at the end of 2019. This significant improvement in our net debt position, along with our strong cash flow generation capability, provides us increased financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure.
Please turn to Slide 9, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q4. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 11.4% year-on-year in the fourth quarter. This result includes an approximate 10 percentage point benefit from pandemic-related respirator mask demand. Overall, general industrial manufacturing activity continued to improve during Q4. However, customers and channel partners continue to remain cautious given ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.
Personal safety posted double-digit organic growth year-on-year driven by continued demand for respirators. Industrial adhesives and tapes grew mid-single digits, while the electrical markets business was up low single digits.
The strong growth in the residential housing market continue to drive good performance in our roofing granules business, which was up double digits organically versus Q4 of last year. The rest of the Safety and Industrial portfolio, namely automotive aftermarket, abrasives and closure and masking, declined year-on-year. Safety and Industrial's fourth quarter segment operating margins were 27.7%, up 690 basis points, driven by strong leverage on sales growth and continued productivity and spending discipline, along with the previously mentioned gain on sale of real estate.
Moving to Transportation and Electronics. After a challenging last 2 years, fourth quarter organic sales growth turned positive, up 1.4% as compared to last year. Our electronics-related business was up 2% with continued strong growth in semiconductor, factory automation and data centers, which was partially offset by year-on-year softness in consumer electronics.
Our auto OEM business was up 18% year-on-year compared to the 3% increase in global car and light truck builds. For the full year, our automotive business outperformed global builds by approximately 700 basis points.
Advanced materials and transportation safety returned to growth year-on-year driven by improving end market trends in automotive and highway infrastructure. Commercial solutions continued to be down year-on-year due to negative pandemic-related impacts on advertising spend and demand for workplace cleaning and safety products and solutions. Transportation and Electronics' fourth quarter operating margins were 21.8%, up 100 basis points on positive sales growth and continued cost discipline.
Turning to Health Care. Some parts of the world were challenged with rising COVID-19 cases throughout Q4. As a result, those health care providers experienced sequential declines in the elective procedure volumes, which negatively impacted parts of our business.
At the same time, we continue to experience strong pandemic-related demand for respirators to protect frontline health care workers, which more than offset the headwinds from the decline in elective procedure volumes. As a result, our Health Care business delivered fourth quarter organic sales growth of 6.6% versus last year.
The Medical Solutions business grew low double digits driven by continued strong respirator demand. Excluding respirators, organic growth in this business was flat. Our oral care business organic sales were flat year-over-year as it dealt with rising COVID cases.
The separation and purification business increased low double digits year-on-year. This business continues to experience solid demand for biopharma filtration solutions in support of the pharmaceutical industry's research and manufacturing efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutic treatments for COVID.
Turning to health information systems, which declined mid-single digits organically, as hospitals continued to remain cautious relative to the information technology investments. And finally, food safety was up low single digits organically versus last year.
Health Care's fourth quarter operating margins were 24.7%, up 340 basis points year-on-year, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 31.7%. Fourth quarter margins were driven by continued strong execution and cost management, which was partially offset by the higher year-on-year restructuring costs.
Lastly, fourth quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was up 10% as retailers saw continued strong customer demand throughout the holiday season. Growth in this business continues to be driven by strong consumer demand for our category-leading brands, namely Filtrete, Scotch, ScotchBlue, Scotch-Brite, Command and Meguiar's. We also continue to see very strong growth in e-commerce channels as the pandemic has accelerated years' worth of changes in consumer shopping behavior.
Organic sales growth within Consumer continued to be led by our home improvement and home care businesses, each up double digits organically. Stationery and office declined low single digits as many business offices and schools remain partially or fully closed due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic.
Consumer's operating margins were 23.5% or similar to last year. As we have previously mentioned, we have been stepping up investments in advertising and merchandising and new product innovation to address changing consumer demand trends. Lastly, similar to Health Care, operating margins were impacted by higher year-on-year restructuring costs.
That wraps up the review of fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 10, and I will hand it back over to Mike. Mike?"

Looking at our 2020 performance, we posted an organic sales decline of 2% and adjusted earnings of $8.74 per share. We increased adjusted free cash flow by 18% to $6.7 billion with a conversion rate of 132%, which demonstrates the strength of our business model and our continued ability to perform across economic cycles. Additionally, we posted a good return on invested capital of 18% and expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins to over 27%, up 100 basis points year-on-year.
Our strong cash flow, along with disciplined capital allocation, helped us reduce net debt by over $4 billion in the year. During the year, we strengthened our Health Care portfolio with the successful integration of Acelity and the completion of the divestiture of drug delivery. We returned $3.8 billion to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, and last year marked our 62nd consecutive year of dividend increases. Beyond financial results, 2020 was a year where 3M stepped up when we were needed the most.
Please turn to Slide 11. Throughout the pandemic, 3Mers have been relentless in applying science to improve lives and make the world a better place. Our COVID-19 response has been guided by 3 priorities: protecting our employees, fighting the pandemic from every angle and delivering for our customers and shareholders.
Beginning last January, we immediately activated our surge capacity and doubled our production of respirators to help protect nurses, doctors and first responders. We have since worked tirelessly to bring on more capacity, which includes additional investments from 3M and partnerships with governments at all levels.
In total, last year, we produced and delivered 2 billion respirators globally, with approximately half in the United States. Today, we are at an annual run rate of 2.5 billion respirators, a fourfold increase versus 2019.
At the same time, we have worked closely with governments, law enforcement and retailers to fight fraud. To date, we have helped identify more than 8 million counterfeit respirators, protecting health care workers from bad actors.
Beyond providing respirators and other important personal protective equipment, we have helped the world recover in other ways. For example, our biopharma filtration solutions have enabled the development and manufacture of critical vaccines and therapeutics. We also took significant actions throughout the year to position ourselves for long-term growth and value creation.
We continue to strengthen our innovation, which remains at the center of our 3M model. And last year, we invested $3.4 billion in the combination of research and development and CapEx. Our team also found ways to innovate differently and faster in response to the pandemic and to serve growing market trends. We formed partnerships with other companies to expand respirator production. We introduced new daily face coverings. And we quickly adapted our cleaning product lines to serve new customers.
We created new products to improve indoor air quality, biopharma filtration and automotive electrification, just a few of our priority growth platforms. We rolled out cutting-edge solutions to improve the performance of electric car batteries, one element of our work to enable more sustainable vehicle designs.
For the full year, our priority growth platforms grew 7%, outperforming the markets they serve. We also continue to see benefits from the global operating model we implemented last January. Our model enabled us to respond to the pandemic with agility and resilience, from our significant expansion of PPE production to our ability to maintain business continuity, serve our customers and ensure the integrity of our supply chain.
Our enterprise operations team is applying learnings from our expansion of respirator production into other areas of 3M. For example, we are deploying new technology and using our analytic platforms to double our Filtrete capacity. We also took steps to optimize our model and further streamline our organization, initiating a restructuring in December that will reduce annual operating costs by $250 million to $300 million.
In summary, as I look across 2020, I am proud of our accomplishments and our people, from the 50,000 3Mers in our factories to our colleagues who volunteered to relocate and help scale up new respirator lines, to the retirees who came back to staff our hotline, answering calls from home. People across 3M have stepped up to make a difference, and I thank our entire team for their incredible contributions in 2020.
Please turn to Slide 12. We expect to deliver a strong performance in 2021 with organic growth of 3% to 6%, improved earnings, margin expansion and strong cash flow. And Monish will take you through the details shortly.
We have aggressively prioritized investments throughout the pandemic, and we will accelerate our efforts in 2021 with ongoing focus on growth, productivity and sustainability. We will increase investments in areas with strong growth opportunities such as personal safety, home improvement and health care with continued emphasis on our priority growth platforms.
The rapid movement to an even more digital-first world also opens additional opportunities for 3M. We are pioneering innovations that improve performance of data centers and semiconductor manufacturing, which will be more relevant moving forward. We will also do more to leverage e-commerce, along with digital technologies to better serve our customers. Ultimately, we have big opportunities to unleash 3M Science and drive sustainable long-term growth, and we will ensure that our teams have the resources to capitalize.
We continue to advance the digitization of 3M while also accelerating our use of data and analytics in everything we do. Further strengthening our supply chain is a priority in 2021 with a focus on highly sustainable, disruptive and safe manufacturing technology, which will help us deliver on our promises to customers and shareholders.
To that end, I want to close by talking about the commitments we will keep in 2021 and beyond: leading our industry in science, society and sustainability. 3M Science drives our business forward. We leverage and combine our technologies in unique ways across the company, creating new products and new lines of business, and we are positioned to do even more to deliver differentiated value for our customers into the future.
In a similar way, 3M is partnering with our communities to improve society. In 2020, we took steps to advance our core values, including diversity, equity and inclusion. And in the coming year, we will hold ourselves accountable to new goals to support underrepresented groups at 3M, building on our recent progress. We will also be releasing a new global diversity, equity and inclusion report with details on our metrics.
We remain committed to sustainability, which includes using science to proactively manage PFAS and to enable success in our ongoing work with communities and governments to advance our environmental stewardship. We will continue to increase investments to make our factories more sustainable, including $100 million in investments this year, which is included in our 2021 CapEx guidance, to further reduce water usage and improve water quality around our manufacturing sites.
To help address questions you have been asking, I would also like to touch on our strong history of working with governments and leveraging science to solve big challenges around the world. We have had productive conversations with President Biden's transition team and now the administration about their COVID-19 response, and we have open lines of communication. We will continue to do all we can to get respirators and other personal protective equipment to frontline workers and help America and the world beat the pandemic.
On environmental stewardship, we share a common goal with governments of improving water quality and doing so in a way that is based on sound science, established regulatory processes and collaboration with a broad range of stakeholders. We look forward to working with President Biden's administration and congressional leaders to pursue these shared goals, including through the remediation of PFAS, where appropriate. And we aim to build on the successful public-private partnerships that 3M has led globally throughout our history as a company.
To wrap up, we are confident about what's ahead in 2021 and in our ability to create more value from the 3M model and build an even more competitive and sustainable enterprise. I will now turn the call over to Monish to cover the details of our guidance. Monish?"

As Mike mentioned, we are initiating full year 2021 guidance as end-market visibility has continued to improve despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. As a result, we will no longer be reporting monthly sales updates as we had in 2020.
Looking at sales. We are forecasting total sales growth of 5% to 8%, with organic growth in the range of 3% to 6%. Earnings per share is projected to be between $9.20 and $9.70 or up 5% to 11% on an adjusted basis. The primary contributors to earnings growth in 2021 include: organic sales growth, productivity as we continue to increase our focus on operating rigor through daily management and leveraging the use of data and data analytics and our ongoing efforts to advance and streamline our global operating model. And lastly, we anticipate benefits from foreign currency due to the weaker U.S. dollar.
Partially offsetting these benefits are anticipated year-on-year headwinds from the Q4 2020 gain on sale of real estate, an expected increase in areas such as travel, variable incentive compensation and advertising and merchandising investments.
Turning to cash. We expect another year of robust cash flow, with free cash flow conversion in the range of 95% to 105%. From a capital allocation perspective, our first priority remains investing organically in our business, including R&D and CapEx. As we have noted, we are increasing investments in growth, productivity and sustainability in 2021. As a result, CapEx for the year is expected to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion.
Returning cash to shareholders remains a high priority for 3M, including both dividends, along with a disciplined approach to share repurchases, which we plan to restart in 2021. Please see the appendix in today's slide presentation for additional details regarding our 2021 full year guidance.
Please turn to Slide 14. Here, you see a breakdown of our expectations for organic growth by business group, along with some of the key macroeconomic and market indicators we incorporated into our planning. Overall, the pace and success of the COVID-19 vaccine deployment and adoption will be critical for the global economy. The 2 broadest macroeconomic indicators, global GDP and IPI, are both expected to grow mid-single digits.
The overall electronics market is expected to be up mid-single digits. In addition, global car and light truck builds are expected to grow 14% versus 2020. Also, while health care and oral care elective procedure volumes have improved off the Q2 lows of 2020, they are currently not expected to return to pre-COVID levels until the later part of 2021.
We are also monitoring the ability and pace for people to return to the workplace and students to return to school. And finally, consumer spending, particularly retail sales and home improvement demand and e-commerce also are factors in our planning.
Taking these factors into account, we expect the following organic growth expectations for our business groups in 2021. Starting with Safety and Industrial, where we anticipate organic local currency growth to be up mid-single digits. Transportation and Electronics is expected to be up low to high single digits. This wider range contemplates the potential for end-market variability, particularly in automotive and electronics. And finally, both our Health Care and Consumer businesses are projected to grow in the low to mid-single digits this year.
In 2021, we will prioritize capital to our greatest market opportunities, deliver for our customers, drive commercial intensity, improve operating rigor, enhance daily management, leverage data and data analytics and continue to streamline our organization. As a result, we expect solid revenue growth, improved margins and earnings, robust free cash flow and a continued strong capital structure and financial flexibility.

And as you know, we've done a great job as a team trying to keep our costs under control. You can see that in Q3 results, you can see that in Q4. How it'll bounce back will actually all depend on where we see the recovery of the pandemic and how the vaccine plays itself out.
Currently, as you can see from the guidance that we have given you, there is headwind that we are planning on the bounce-back of $0.35 to $0.45 that was put in there. And there are 2 or 3 things in there, Deane. One is, as you think about the property sales that are year-over-year that are non-repeat. Secondly, all these indirect costs, travel is a big piece of that, that comes back. And the third one is the variable compensation that gets reset for 2021. And from a 4Q to 1Q also, there would be a reset and an increase in cost.
So those are the factors we are looking at. And I would just say, from a quarter perspective, it's all going to depend on our -- how revenue comes across, how growth happens, how the economy recovers.
The other piece, just to keep in mind, as Mike mentioned, our plan is to invest more in opportunities on growth, productivity and sustainability. And that also will have an impact on each quarter, depending on how the economy recovers."

So what -- we're going to be as helpful as we can. As you know, Joe, we have initiated annual guidance. And based on where we see some of the end markets that I mentioned about in my prepared remarks, based on that, we'll see where -- how those end markets play out. That will determine how our quarterly things play out. Our guidance is, right now, organic, 3% to 6% with 5% to 8% growth in total, including FX.
One of the things that we have seen over the pandemic, Joe, is our normal trends that historically would see, don't seem to play itself out. So for example, in December, the company usually sees deceleration. We didn't see the deceleration. Similarly on a month-to-month trend, sometimes, what you see in variability in the months was higher due to COVID. And so therefore, my personal belief is I think you're going to see more variability throughout the year, depending on how different parts of the world play itself out.
We are also aggressively prioritizing our investments throughout on all the 3 items Mike mentioned: growth, productivity and sustainability. Again, that will have an impact based on how revenue plays itself out. We would love to go heavy and invest early so that we can capture the growth that's coming. But we'll have to see how the world recovers. So we'll have to just walk through that.
And then just another piece for you to keep in mind as you're thinking about the quarters is, from a restructuring charge perspective, we had announced a charge in the fourth quarter. You're going to see the balance of that charge somewhere between $110 million to $160 million in the second half of this year, and we'll tighten that as we go through the quarter.
So our goal is to be as helpful as we can throughout and through the various interactions we have with all of you, is to tell you what's going on in the world. But that's the way we see it right now. So hopefully, I answered your question, Joe."

And the benefit from restructuring is anywhere between $0.20 to $0.30.
If you think of the headwinds, as I mentioned before, there's property sales that don't repeat. Some of the indirect costs, that will snap back. Example, travel and variable compensation is in that range of 35% to 45%. And then on the restructuring side, the $0.20 to $0.30, I would ask you to think about 2 pieces.
One is for all the other actions that the company had taken other than the fourth quarter, there's a carryover benefit of, give or take, $100 million. And then the benefits of the restructuring that we announced in the fourth quarter is another $75 million of benefit -- $75 million to $100 million. And then, of course, it's offset by the charge that we're going to take of $110 million to $160 million.

So first, just to answer your question to give you the 20% to 21.5%, that's correct. So it's -- 21.3% is the perfect number.
If you think about 2021 and how we look at margin, I'll just elevate first to say our general view over the long term is growth at or above macro, sustainable margin improvement, strong cash that ultimately helps us have a very strong capital structure. So keeping that in mind, we would say that's basically how we are thinking about long term.
Things to factor in from a margin guide perspective. As Mike mentioned, we are going to invest properly in growth, productivity and sustainability. So that's going to have one factor.
The second factor is going to be the amount of productivity that we are generating. We've got a lot of proprietary technologies that we are rolling out in supply chain. Mike mentioned that the stability of our supply chain is one of our priorities for 2021. We're going to continue that path. So you should see benefit from the productivity actions that the supply chain team is driving.
The third piece is making sure that we have factored in correctly the snapback of 2020 costs. We have shown you that as $0.35 to $0.45 of headwind, again, on the 3 items that I mentioned before.
And I would say the last one to think about this is thinking about what revenue is going to be and what growth looks like quarter-to-quarter. And that's going to also have a pretty big impact on where we end up from a margin perspective.
So those are all the factors that we are putting in here as we think about. But long-term growth, at or above macro sustainable margin improvements and then strong cash."

And depending on how the end markets play out in those 4 businesses, they're going to flex up or down. So I don't know if I answered your question, Nigel, but that's the way I look at it from an R&D perspective."

A couple of them we look at is polypropylene, wood pulp, ethylene are areas that we look at and say all of them are showing inflation.
The second is, as you're seeing also from different industrials, is logistics cost is higher. Whether it's air or truck, the logistics costs are higher, so we're seeing inflation there.
And the third piece, even though the economies still are not that very strong from a labor shortage perspective, that's an other area where we are seeing inflation in manpower costs. So those are the 3 areas that we are seeing. We have a great sourcing team that's working to minimize that as much as they can.
And then also, your specific question on pricing, our aim is to have prices that will go up on a year-over-year to take into account the inflation that we are seeing."

We have -- even in the middle of the pandemic, we continue to make very good progress on some of what you outlined there. And part of it is the digitization of 3M, transforming our company, deploying new ERP and ecosystem around that. That continues to move forward.
We are also now operating for 1 year our new operating model that we launched in January of 2020. And that -- we moved ahead in the middle of the pandemic. We benefited from it. We saw the benefits come and our ability to respond to just the dynamics that we hit -- we saw in our markets as we went through the year.
So I would say we benefited from it. It validated where we are going with the 3M model. It validated the strengths of the 3M model and how we apply our innovation in our markets. And I would say it encouraged us to continue to really press ahead.
And I talked about that in my prepared remarks about the digitization, improving our operations. I see it in terms of more agility, shorter cycle times, improved response. And ultimately, it's really at the foundation of how we drive productivity, operational improvements as we go. So that's becoming the way we take advantage of it. That's how we focus it.
And so planning broadly as part of that, we're getting, I would say, better in terms of cycle times and I -- better at using the greater visibility on data and the analytics that go with it.

I look at also the ability to see visibility of data. So there's data democratization, where we can see stuff that is happening much faster on a daily basis. So it's all about driving the operating rigor, getting the daily management, quickly going into root cause and then finding sustainable improvements.

So Acelity, I would say, is one of the divisions that does get impacted the highest due to hospitalization rate and elective surgeries. But overall, when you just step back and say, what has Acelity done? I would say, as the volumes came up in Q2, post Q2 lows, the business has continued to grow tremendously through those Q2 lows.
The reason why Acelity is so good for 3M, I think there are a couple of things. One is it's in a market that is ever growing right now based on where our demographics are. Secondly, it gives 3M a lot more relevance when it comes to talking to caregivers. Third is it gets us into a post-acute space and a home care space, which I think post-COVID is going to be a trend from a home care perspective.
And then what 3M brings to Acelity is the synergies that it can bring. One is its brand, its global reach and its ability to do global and high-speed manufacturing. It brings it to that. And 3M did already have an advanced wound care business. So when you put this together, it basically makes it a very good acquisition for 3M.
We have seen growth in both. We have made positive income in third and fourth quarter. And we are very encouraged with all the work that the health care team is doing that this business will keep growing. But of course, it will be partially dependent on how the world recovers from electives."

We saw some improvement in our industrial adhesives and tapes business as we went through Q4. Other businesses are still seeing end-market declines. And so we're not seeing material restocking in those safety or industrial channels globally.
Transportation and Electronics, they're pretty much in balance with demand. There's some tight supply. Monish mentioned supply chain, things that we're watching, everybody is watching around semiconductor. And that is really to the strong demand in their end markets.
Health Care, generally steady as the end markets have now adjusted to the changes in areas like elective procedures in the middle of COVID. There's -- Q4, we kind of saw a resurgence of COVID cases impact that but pretty steady as we come into the year.
And Consumer is, I would say, mixed. We see high demand in home improvement. That continues. That's lower-than-normal levels in that channel. And we see really elevated levels still in office and retail, as you've seen the slowdown because of the work remotely kind of economy that we're in.

It's a question that we keep asking ourselves and try to get as much visibility as we can. As you correctly stated, there's a lot of uncertainty right now in the world.

As you correctly stated, there's a lot of uncertainty right now in the world. As we saw end markets starting to stabilize, our visibility got better. We started an annual guidance of 3% to 6%. And I think as the world recovers, we should be able to get there. We are confident that the innovation that we are doing should help us get to solid growth and grow at or above macro in the long run.
When you think about 1Q, one of the things that we have seen over the last 6 months that I've at least been here and longer for this team is some of the historical trends have just not played themselves out. So December didn't slow down as historically has been. With that said, I don't think January has started off very weak.
But the things that we are watching are, where does hospitalization go? What happens to elective procedures, both in the hospital and the oral care space? So we're pretty cautious in that and seeing what we are seeing right now.
On the industrial side, making sure that industrial activity continues. Our customers continue to buy inventory will be the second piece that we got to watch.
Third, as I've mentioned, on the auto side and on the electronics side, where both of them are starting to combine together, how does the supply chains play itself out and what the volume of auto production is going to be?
And then the last one to think about is from a consumer perspective, we had an extremely strong consumer growth. You saw we grew nearly 10% with a very strong holiday season. The question is, does that strength continue in retail? When do schools reopen?
Also, just a reminder, from a tactical basis, we are hitting that point where we start lapping year-over-year pandemic demand. So 3M had nearly $100 million of disposable respirator sales last year, 1Q '20, again driven by the pandemic. So we are lapping that.
And then on the income side to think through, Nicole, is what is the volume going to look like. And I mentioned, we are quite cautious on what we are seeing. And then just on the tactical side, what else are we going to invest? How fast are we going to invest in each of the quarters in the areas Mike mentioned?
And then from a quarter-over-quarter sequential basis, as we reset variable compensation, for the first quarter as well as, as we start stepping into advertising, merchandising investments will have an impact. So hopefully, I gave you the things we are looking at, Nicole, as we are thinking about the quarter."

The first quarter was strong for 3M, with broad-based organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas. Our team executed well and posted record sales, robust cash flow and expanded margins, along with a double-digit increase in earnings per share. We saw encouraging improvement in many of our end markets, while others remained well below pre-pandemic levels. We also faced and addressed ongoing supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19, exacerbated by improving macroeconomic trends and winter storm Uri, all of which are increasing the cost of doing business. 
I am proud of the way 3Mers have stepped up to manage and overcome these challenges, keeping our factories running, expanding our manufacturing capacity, and driving innovation for our customers across our businesses. We have found new ways to engage with customers and create solutions no matter where we are around the world, learnings we will take forward as we come out of the pandemic. 
Looking ahead, we expect continued strengthening of the global economy, though we anticipate the recovery to be uneven as the trajectory of the pandemic, rollout of vaccines and government policies evolve in different stages around the world. We are confident in our business as we navigate COVID-19 uncertainty. And with 1 quarter behind us, we are maintaining our full year guidance for organic growth, earnings per share and cash flow. 
Our team remains focused on driving growth improving operational performance and delivering for our customers and shareholders. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Company-wide, total sales increased to $8.9 billion, with organic growth of 8% and earnings of $2.77 per share, up 27% year-on-year on an adjusted basis. Geographically, organic growth was led by Asia Pacific, up 13%, with China up 32%. Growth in the Americas was 6%, with the United States up 7%, while EMEA grew 6%. We expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins to nearly 28%, with all business groups above 23% and increased free cash flow to $1.4 billion with a conversion rate of 86%. 
3M increased our dividend in the first quarter, marking our 63rd straight year of increases. We also continue to build 3M for the long-term and prioritize investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. While we manage end-market challenges related to COVID-19, we are investing to capitalize on global growth opportunities in health care, electronics, home improvement, personal safety, and other favorable market trends. This includes our priority growth platforms, which grew 10% in the quarter as we apply science to advance growing areas like automotive electrification, and  biopharma filtration. The fundamental strengths of 3M, our unique technology platforms, advanced manufacturing, global capabilities and leading brands position us well to win in these markets into the future. 
We are accelerating digital strategies across 3M and expanding our use of data and data analytics to better serve our customers and improve performance. For example, we are using new cloud-based technologies to provide better insights into our global workflows from raw material purchase through product delivery, which is helping us navigate the current supply chain challenges. We are stepping up our leadership in sustainability with significant new commitments that will bend the curve on carbon emissions, water use and improving water quality. 
In a similar way, we are implementing a long-term plan to advance equity and inclusion as we launch new scholarship programs and a new goal to create 5 million opportunities in STEM education, with initial efforts focused here in the twin cities. At the same time, 3M continues to help lead the fight against COVID-19, with 630 million respirators distributed in the first quarter. We are also providing our expertise as we engage with the Biden administration and governments around the world on how to better prepare for future pandemics. Overall, I am pleased with our performance in the first quarter as we remain focused on driving growth, improving productivity and advancing sustainability. 
To provide additional insight on that last point, sustainability, I will now turn it over to 3M's Chief Technology Officer, John Banovetz. John?"

I'm proud to lead 3M's Research and Development and Sustainability teams. Every day, we bring our innovation to bear on tough challenges, which includes applying 3M science to create a more efficient company and a more sustainable world. As you may have seen, in February, we announced expanded sustainability goals. We plan to commit approximately $1 billion over the next 20 years through both capital and operating investments to make our operations more efficient and effective with a focus on air, water and waste. 
First, we are committing to become carbon-neutral across our global operations. We expect to rapidly bend our curve of emissions with 2019 as our baseline and aggressive milestones along the way: a 50% reduction by 2030, 80% by 2040 and 100% by 2050. 
Second, 3M plans to reduce water use at our facilities by 25% over the next decade, targeting a 10% reduction by 2022 and 20% reduction by 2025. Third, at our largest locations, we are taking action and installing advanced filtration technology that will return even higher quality water to the environment after its use in our operations. These goals are driven by science and a clearly defined path. We have identified the investments and technologies that will enable our success from thermal oxidizers to reverse osmosis, and work is already underway. 
At 3M's facility in Antwerp, for example, we have expanded our thermal oxidizer system and reduced our carbon emissions by 1 million tons per year. Overall, our thermal oxidizers reduce our carbon footprint by more than 90% when fully installed. And in Decatur, Alabama, we have implemented a water treatment system with granular activated carbon, also known as a GAC system, that has improved the quality of water we return to the environment by 90%. We intend to add complementary technology that will further improve water quality by 2024. 
We will continue to advance new state-of-the-art technologies, including through partnerships with customers, governments, communities and others to further accelerate our progress. Our actions demonstrate 3M's commitment to continuous improvement and our ongoing work to advance our environmental stewardship. Over the last 2 decades, 3M has reduced our emissions by 70%, while doubling revenues. Our headquarters is fully powered by renewable electricity and 40% of 3M's global electricity use is now renewable, on our way to 100%. Every new 3M product includes a sustainability value commitment. And over the last 5 years, our innovations have helped customers avoid 75 million tons of emissions. And just last week, we committed to reduce our use of new plastic made from petroleum, also known as virgin fossil-based plastic, by 125 million pounds by 2025 through new packaging and innovative product design in our Consumer business. 
We recognize the urgency of the world's climate and environmental challenges and are focused on making a difference both today and in future generations. I encourage you to read our Annual Sustainability Report to be released in early May for more details on our progress and priorities.

289194,708649137,2258971,"3M Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","3M Company","Executives","Thank you, John, and I wish you all a very good morning. Company-wide first quarter sales were $8.9 billion, up 9.6% year-on-year or an increase of 8% on an organic basis. Sales growth, combined with operating rigor and disciplined cost management, drov",2022,"Thank you, John, and I wish you all a very good morning. 
Company-wide first quarter sales were $8.9 billion, up 9.6% year-on-year or an increase of 8% on an organic basis. Sales growth, combined with operating rigor and disciplined cost management, drove adjusted operating income of $2 billion, up 19%, with adjusted operating margins of 22.5%, up 170 basis points year-on-year. First quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings per share were $2.77, up 27% compared to last year's adjusted results. 
On this slide, you can see the components that impacted both margins and earnings per share. Organic volume growth, along with our ongoing cost management and productivity efforts, were the biggest contributors to first quarter operating margins and earnings, adding 150 basis points to margins and $0.34 to earnings per share year-on-year. 
Turning to selling prices and raw materials. As Mike mentioned, we experienced increasing costs, particularly for raw materials and logistics due to the impacts from the strengthening end markets, ongoing COVID pandemic, along with winter storm URI. As a result, first quarter net selling price and raw materials performance reduced both operating margins and earnings per share by 20 basis points and $0.01, respectively. In our view, we expect global supply chain dynamics to remain fluid and for raw material and logistics headwinds to persist. Therefore, we now anticipate a full year raw materials and logistics headwind of $0.30 to $0.50 per share versus a prior expectation of flat to a $0.10 headwind at the start of the year. 
Looking at the second quarter, we currently anticipate a net selling price and raw materials headwinds to operating margins in the range of 75 to 125 basis points. We are taking multiple actions to address these increased headwinds, including selling price increases, global sourcing efforts, improving yields in our factories and ongoing demand planning, given the dynamic environment. We expect these actions will gain traction as we move through the year, particularly in the second half. 
Moving to divestiture impacts. The lost income from the drug delivery divestiture in May of last year was neutral to margins, however, was a $0.03 headwind year-on-year to earnings. Foreign currency, net of hedging impacts, added 40 basis points to margins and $0.13 to earnings per share as the U.S. dollar weakened against most major currencies year-on-year. We continue to expect foreign exchange to be an earnings benefit of $0.15 per share for the full year. 
3 other nonoperating items impacted our year-on-year earnings per share performance. First, our continued strong cash flow and liquidity position give us the opportunity in Q1 to redeem an additional $450 million of debt early that was due to mature in 2022. As a result, we incurred higher net interest expense of approximately $0.02 per share versus Q1 last year. This impact was more than offset by year-on-year nonoperating pension benefit of $0.05 per share. Combined, these items resulted in lower net nonoperating expense of $0.03 per share versus last year's first quarter. 
Secondly, a lower tax rate versus last year provided a $0.14 benefit to earnings per share. The lower tax rate was primarily a function of non-repeating favorable adjustments related to U.S. tax treatment of international income, along with regional income mix and equity-based compensation. Our full year 2021 tax rate expectations remained unchanged in the range of 20% to 21%. Finally, average diluted shares were up 1% year-on-year, which reduced per share earnings by $0.02. 
Please turn to Slide 8 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. We delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with first quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.4 billion, up 49% year-on-year with conversion of 86%. Cash flows in the quarter were primarily driven by robust growth in cash flow from operations, along with our ongoing daily management of working capital. First quarter capital expenditures were $310 million. For the full year, we continue to expect CapEx to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $858 million and share repurchases of $231 million. Our strong cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to strengthen our capital structure. 
We ended the quarter with $13 billion in net debt, a reduction of nearly $5 billion since the end of Q1 last year. As a result, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has declined significantly from 2.2 a year ago to 1.4 at the end of Q1. Our net debt position, along with our strong cash flow generation capability, continues to provide us financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. 
Please turn to Slide 9, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q1. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 10.3% year-on-year in the first quarter. This result includes a 6.4 percentage point benefit from pandemic-related respirator demand. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate strong pandemic-related respirator mass demand. However, the year-on-year contribution to sales growth will decline as we lap last year's quarterly comparisons. Overall, general industrial manufacturing activity continued to improve during Q1, resulting in a pickup in growth across the portfolio. 
Personal safety posted double-digit organic growth year-on-year, driven by ongoing demand for respirators. Industrial adhesives and tapes grew low double digits, primarily due to strong demand across industrial and electronics end markets. The continued strength in the residential housing market drove good performance in our roofing's granules business, which was up double digits organically versus Q1 of last year. 
Turning to the rest of the Safety and Industrial businesses. Automotive aftermarket grew high single digits organically. The electrical markets business was up mid-single digits and abrasives grew low single digits. While our closure and masking business declined year-on-year, Safety and Industrial's first quarter segment operating margins were 24.4%, up 70 basis points year-on-year. Operating margins were driven by leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by increase in raw materials, logistics and legal costs. 
Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which delivered a strong start to the year with first quarter organic sales growth of 9.8% despite the well-known semiconductor supply chain constraints. Our electronics-related business was up high teens organically with continued strength in semiconductor, factory automation and data centers, along with strong demand for consumer electronic devices, namely tablets and TVs. Our auto OEM business was up 21% year-on-year compared to the 14% increase in global car and light truck builds. Looking ahead, we continue to monitor the global semiconductor supply chain and its potential impact on the electronics and automotive industries. 
Turning to advanced materials, which increased mid-single digits, largely as a result of the year-on-year increase in automotive builds. And finally, our transportation safety business was flat year-on-year, while commercial solutions declined slightly. 
Transportation and Electronics first quarter operating margins were 23.3%, up 260 basis points year-on-year, benefiting from strong leverage on sales growth and prior year COVID-related asset write-downs, which were partially offset by increases in raw materials and logistics costs. 
Turning to our Health Care business. Health care providers continue to be challenged from the ebbs and flows of COVID-19 cases as elective procedure volumes still remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, we continue to experience strong pandemic-related demand for respirators to protect frontline health care workers, which more than offset the headwinds from the decline in elective procedure volumes. As a result, our Health Care business delivered first quarter organic sales growth of 9.3% versus last year. 
The Medical Solutions business grew high single digits, driven by continued strong respirator demand. Excluding respirators, organic growth in this business was down low single digits due to the ongoing year-on-year impact of lower procedure volumes. Organic sales for our oral care business increased double digits year-on-year. This result is primarily due to last year's COVID-related comp as dental offices started closing their doors during Q1 last year. The separation and purification business increased low teens year-on-year. This business continues to experience solid demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutics development and manufacturing, along with improving demand trends for water filtration solutions. Health information systems returned to positive organic growth, up mid-single digits, while food safety declined mid-single digits organically versus last year's strong comparison. 
Health Care's first quarter operating margins were 22.7%, up 120 basis points year-on-year. First quarter margins were driven by leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by supply chain disruptions and increasing raw materials and logistics costs. 
Lastly, first quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was 7.8% year-on-year, with strength across most retail channels led by e-commerce. Organic sales growth continued to be led by a home improvement business, up double digits organically, driven by strong demand for command adhesives, filtrate air quality solutions and ScotchBlue Painters tape. Stationery and office returned to positive organic growth in Q1, up mid-single digits with ongoing strength in consumer demand for packaging and shipping products. This business also delivered improved growth in Scotch brand office tapes as we start to lap the COVID-related impacts from remote work and school trends. And finally, our home care business was up low single digits organically versus last year's strong comparison. 
Consumer's operating margins were 21.1% or similar to last year as leverage on sales growth was offset by increasing cost for raw materials, logistics, outsourced hard goods manufacturing and increased investments in advertising and merchandising. 
Please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion of our full year 2021 guidance. As you can see from our Q1 results, we are off to a good start to the year. Looking ahead, as Mike mentioned, we expect continued strengthening of the global economy, along with increasing opportunities in end markets with favorable trends. However, we foresee that the improvement will remain fluid and uneven as we go through 2021, given the ongoing impact of the pandemic. 
As a result, we anticipate a number of items that will need to be navigated as we go through the year. For example, starting with the evolving impacts from COVID, including respirator demand, health care elective procedures, supply chains, shutdowns and government response. Next, the continued constrained supply of semiconductor chips and related impacts to consumer electronics and automotive OEM production. In addition, the expected increase in cost for raw materials and logistics and in some cases, constrained availability. And finally, we expect to increase investments through the year in growth, productivity and sustainability along with managing ongoing legal costs as PFAS and other legal proceedings progress. Thus, taking these items into account, along it with being early in the year, we think it's prudent to maintain our full year guidance of 3% to 6% for organic growth, earnings per share of $9.20 to $9.70 and free cash flow conversion of 95% to 105%. 
Turning to the second quarter, let me highlight a few items of note. First, we expect continued strong execution by the 3M team in the face of a very fluid and uncertain environment. As I mentioned during my remarks, we have increased the expected headwind from raw materials and logistics costs for the full year. We are taking several actions, including increasing selling prices to address these headwinds as we go through the year. These actions will take a little time to gain traction. Therefore, we anticipate a second quarter year-on-year operating margin headwind of 75 to 125 basis points from selling prices net of higher raw materials and logistics costs. And finally, we expect a pretax restructuring charge in the range of $25 million to $50 million as we continue our actions related to our December 2020 announcement. 
To wrap up, we are off to a good start for the year delivering broad-based growth, strong operational execution and robust cash flows. We are prioritizing capital to our greatest opportunities for growth, productivity and sustainability while focused on delivering for our customers, improving operating rigor and enhancing daily management. 
With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

I wouldn't say that we see anything unusual there. It's what comes with a normal pickup in the marketplace. When you look at it, a good measure for us is what's happening with channel inventories. And I would say we seem very much in line with what you have written about in your reports that we see the changes due to growth trends. Overall, inventory in our industrial channels remains still relatively low. Transportation electronics, with the supply chain impacts from the semiconductor shortage, we're seeing some challenges there. And it's just the responding with that -- with the disruption from the semiconductor shortage. Health Care is pretty steady, reacting to the trend still, electric procedures well below pre-pandemic level. So that's impacting there. And in Consumer, it's a mixed case. We have high demand and home improvements, so we're seeing lower levels there. So I would say we -- you see a little lower levels when you see the pickup, but it's responding to the marketplace. Otherwise, I would say the trends in the quarter were -- the ordering trends were pretty much in line with what we expected, a little better than we expected in March, which was really reflected in our broad-based growth. But otherwise, nothing unusual."

And so we would expect that growth to continue on those platforms as we continue to find customer solutions in those areas. Second comments kind of around the vitality of the NPVI or the part of it. We've talked about NPVI in the past, and that's definitely an important metric for 3M, without a question, but it's also a secondary metric for us. The primary, obviously, being our growth in our profitability for that. 
I'd say, over the last few years, our NPVI and things have trended to be about in the mid-20s, if you take an average over the last 5 years or so, which is, I think roughly a pretty good guide for 3M overall. And obviously, COVID had some of that impact on trends here in the near-term as well as we've gone forward. And then kind of the, as you said, the commoditization or the churn, I personally don't think a whole lot about that. I think about, are we aligned with our customers? Are we solving customer needs? Are our R&D resources geared toward growth and solving those issues for our customers and making sure that we can deliver our technologies and our solutions to our customers in order to be able to grow and sustain profitable margin and ROIC."

As regards legal fees, and you can see this more -- our legal costs, you can see this more as you -- as we file our Q this morning. But there are a couple of things. You'll see the PFAS reserves are up around $50 million between the end of fourth quarter to this quarter. And then the mass respirator accrual is up approximately $20 million. To predict what exactly is going to be in the second half of the year is quite tough. But what we do see is as we prepare for some of these trials, example, the combat arms trial that's on in Florida right now with the MDL as well as some of the other cases that will start picking up in PFAS, we expect that our legal fees -- or legal cost to prepare for these trials will go up during the second half of this year."

I don't think any trend seems to be normal, Nigel. You've seen trends that seem to be completely abnormal compared to what the past has been compared to monthly cyclicality as well as compared to quarterly cyclicality. So I'll just start with that as the first piece. 
The second I would say is one thing you can definitely count on us in Q2 is strong execution. We are also confident that end markets are going to pick up, but I think they're going to be uneven. And for the second quarter, we are still monitoring quite a few things. One, of course, Mike just mentioned about what happens with the stationery, how does that return to work come in. The return to work impacts not just the stationery business, but it impacts our graphics business, it impacts our signage business and what happens there and what people spend, I think, is going to be important to watch. 
The second piece is as pandemic is still playing out in parts of the world, elective procedures continue to be remain -- to be below pre-pandemic level. So we'll see how that plays out. The well-known semiconductor chip shortage, how it impacts auto, how it impacts consumer electronics is another piece. And then when you think about supply chain disruption, the supply chain disruption, one is, of course, the raw material costs and logistics costs that I've talked about quite a bit. The other one, of course, is product availability and making sure that there is product available from our suppliers to continue to keep us manufacturing. Now I'll tell you this that our supply chain team has done an amazing job keeping the factories running, making sure we are delivering to our customers, thanks to the relationship they have with their -- with the suppliers, and we appreciate all the work the suppliers have also done to partner with us to minimize disruption as much as possible. 
We are also raising prices, but it's going to take a little bit of time. The inflation has come in faster. So you're going to see 75 to 125 basis points of headwind, which is the net of price versus inflation and logistics. As I also mentioned that we're going to do restructuring, which was announced in Q4 of 2020, we had told you it's somewhere between $250 million to $300 million charge for the year. As of first quarter, we are at $150 million. So we got approximately $100 million to $150 million to go for the remaining of the year. The second quarter is going to see $25 million to $50 million of restructuring charge, the balance will come in 3Q and 4Q. And then if this economy continues to go the way it is, outlook is that indirect costs, travel costs, some of the legal costs that we talked about will keep going up. Any other onetime headwinds will also go up as regards compensation. And then our goal is, as Mike has mentioned, we have tremendous areas that we can invest in. And our goal is for the long run, we want to keep investing in growth, productivity and sustainability. And put all that into play, that's why we felt it prudent to maintain guidance. And also to answer your question, it's hard to follow normal seasonality trends with all these other things in play."

As you know, volume is the biggest piece that drives margin leverage for 3M. You should assume the normal 30% to 40% margin leverage that you would get.

So a lot of long term, I would say, end markets growing, we'll have to figure out what happens in the second quarter with all of these from an end market perspective. 
Similarly, on supply chain disruption, there are 2 pieces. One is, of course, the inflation that we've told you about, which will cost 75 to 125 basis points of headwind between price and inflation and the raw material and logistics costs as well as making sure that we have all the product availability that we have.

Again, it's too early to say because it's a very dynamic situation that changes every day. And again, the relationship we have with our suppliers helps us get the product as much as we can, but they are also constrained right now with the overall supply chain situation in the world. 
The other headwind is $25 million to $50 million of restructuring. So this is still a part of the overall restructuring program we announced in Q4. We are done up to $150 million in Q1. We're going to take another $25 million to $50 million in Q2, and the balance will come in Q3 and Q4. Indirect costs. So as the economies are starting to open up, you are going to see hopefully, ad merch and travel start to go up. So that's a headwind to Q1.

Do you assume that, that could become a headwind as soon as this later this year or the headwind really comes in '22?"

We saw continue to see strong demand. That's 630 million respirators delivered in Q1. And still in the quarter, 90% going to health care workers and I would say, first responders and increasingly essential industries. The demand as we move forward, it's going to depend on a few factors. The first is what's going to be the demand in health care. And that's going to depend on how the pandemic plays out. And I would say how governments respond to dynamics in the pandemic. And there's been changing in protocol of use of respirators, for example, is one of those dynamics. As Monish said, this is one of the areas where we're working through the uncertainties as there's -- that demand, there's also governments, and we're working with governments around the world on stockpile strategies and continue to supply into those. 
And then there is consumer demand and increasing demand in industrial as economies recover. So we see some shifting as we go forward over time from the high priority, more than 90% into health care, shifting more into industrial and consumer. And then the demand overall, how much is it going to be relative to the impact on the overall enterprise relative to SIBG, that's going to depend on how each of those play out. But we're expecting to continue to see demand as we -- in Industrial and Consumer and Health Care as we go through the year."

The second priority is dividend. We did increase dividend 1% this year. It's the 63rd year of consecutive dividend increase. Our third priority is M&A. As you know, we are busy integrating Acelity. It's doing very well and integrating well into 3M. We don't see another acquisition in the size of Acelity in the near future, but we are always looking for opportunities where we believe that it's complementary to 3M's strengths as well as 3M can add value and synergies.

U.S. is one of those areas where we are -- in the end, we're a net exporter of of goods out of the United States because we have a stronger footprint here. And that's also true in much of the portfolio that we serve semiconductor fabrication with. We build that out close to -- the end users close to the customers. So we have significant resources in Asia, for example. We also supply a significant portion of it from capacity in the U.S. and even some capacity in Europe. So it's it is -- I think we're well positioned if we see that shift, and that's -- it's going to take time to play out. And as has been the case for us throughout history, as we see market dynamics change and shift around the world, we'll invest to build up that capacity where it's needed.

We also talked that we will be increasing our investments in growth, productivity and sustainability in '21 as we see some of the trends playing out that can help us continue to grow in the longer term. And so that's the second headwind. 
And then the third, as has come through that I've talked about, it's the raw material and logistics cost increase, partially offset by the price increases that we are trying to do, increase our yield and then managing all the other costs that we have, whether it's legal costs as PFAS and combat arms and some of those proceedings proceed as well as any other investments that we want to make as we keep seeing growth opportunities in the long term. That's why I would say 30 to 40 is the normal. You should see in the long term, but 2021 is just a little odd for these reasons."

The first quarter was strong for 3M, with broad-based organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas. Our team executed well and posted record sales, robust cash flow and expanded margins, along with a double-digit increase in earnings per share. We saw encouraging improvement in many of our end markets, while others remained well below pre-pandemic levels. We also faced and addressed ongoing supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19, exacerbated by improving macroeconomic trends and winter storm Uri, all of which are increasing the cost of doing business. 
I am proud of the way 3Mers have stepped up to manage and overcome these challenges, keeping our factories running, expanding our manufacturing capacity, and driving innovation for our customers across our businesses. We have found new ways to engage with customers and create solutions no matter where we are around the world, learnings we will take forward as we come out of the pandemic. 
Looking ahead, we expect continued strengthening of the global economy, though we anticipate the recovery to be uneven as the trajectory of the pandemic, rollout of vaccines and government policies evolve in different stages around the world. We are confident in our business as we navigate COVID-19 uncertainty. And with 1 quarter behind us, we are maintaining our full year guidance for organic growth, earnings per share and cash flow. 
Our team remains focused on driving growth, improving operational performance and delivering for our customers and shareholders. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Company-wide, total sales increased to $8.9 billion, with organic growth of 8% and earnings of $2.77 per share, up 27% year-on-year on an adjusted basis. Geographically, organic growth was led by Asia Pacific, up 13%, with China up 32%. Growth in the Americas was 6%, with the United States up 7%, while EMEA grew 6%. We expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins to nearly 28%, with all business groups above 23% and increased free cash flow to $1.4 billion with a conversion rate of 86%. 
3M increased our dividend in the first quarter, marking our 63rd straight year of increases. We also continue to build 3M for the long-term and prioritize investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. While we manage end-market challenges related to COVID-19, we are investing to capitalize on global growth opportunities in health care, electronics, home improvement, personal safety, and other favorable market trends. This includes our priority growth platforms, which grew 10% in the quarter as we apply science to advance growing areas like automotive electrification, and  biopharma filtration. The fundamental strengths of 3M, our unique technology platforms, advanced manufacturing, global capabilities and leading brands position us well to win in these markets into the future. 
We are accelerating digital strategies across 3M and expanding our use of data and data analytics to better serve our customers and improve performance. For example, we are using new cloud-based technologies to provide better insights into our global workflows from raw material purchase through product delivery, which is helping us navigate the current supply chain challenges. We are stepping up our leadership in sustainability with significant new commitments that will bend the curve on carbon emissions, water use and improving water quality. 
In a similar way, we are implementing a long-term plan to advance equity and inclusion as we launch new scholarship programs and a new goal to create 5 million opportunities in STEM education, with initial efforts focused here in the twin cities. At the same time, 3M continues to help lead the fight against COVID-19, with 630 million respirators distributed in the first quarter. 
We are also providing our expertise as we engage with the Biden administration and governments around the world on how to better prepare for future pandemics. Overall, I am pleased with our performance in the first quarter as we remain focused on driving growth, improving productivity and advancing sustainability. 
To provide additional insight on that last point, sustainability, I will now turn it over to 3M's Chief Technology Officer, John Banovetz. John?"

I'm proud to lead 3M's Research and Development and Sustainability teams. Every day, we bring our innovation to bear on tough challenges, which includes applying 3M science to create a more efficient company and a more sustainable world. As you may have seen, in February, we announced expanded sustainability goals. We plan to commit approximately $1 billion over the next 20 years through both capital and operating investments to make our operations more efficient and effective with a focus on air, water and waste. 
First, we are committing to become carbon-neutral across our global operations. We expect to rapidly bend our curve of emissions with 2019 as our baseline and aggressive milestones along the way: a 50% reduction by 2030, 80% by 2040 and 100% by 2050. 
Second, 3M plans to reduce water use at our facilities by 25% over the next decade, targeting a 10% reduction by 2022 and 20% reduction by 2025. Third, at our largest locations, we are taking action and installing advanced filtration technology that will return even higher quality water to the environment after its use in our operations. These goals are driven by science and a clearly defined path. We have identified the investments and technologies that will enable our success from thermal oxidizers to reverse osmosis, and work is already underway. 
At 3M's facility in Antwerp, for example, we have expanded our thermal oxidizer system and reduced our carbon emissions by 1 million tons per year. Overall, our thermal oxidizers reduce our carbon footprint by more than 90% when fully installed. And in Decatur, Alabama, we have implemented a water treatment system with granular activated carbon, also known as a GAC system, that has improved the quality of water we return to the environment by 90%. We intend to add complementary technology that will further improve water quality by 2024. 
We will continue to advance new state-of-the-art technologies, including through partnerships with customers, governments, communities and others to further accelerate our progress. Our actions demonstrate 3M's commitment to continuous improvement and our ongoing work to advance our environmental stewardship. Over the last 2 decades, 3M has reduced our emissions by 70%, while doubling revenues. 
Our headquarters is fully powered by renewable electricity and 40% of 3M's global electricity use is now renewable, on our way to 100%. Every new 3M product includes a sustainability value commitment. And over the last 5 years, our innovations have helped customers avoid 75 million tons of emissions. And just last week, we committed to reduce our use of new plastic made from petroleum, also known as virgin fossil-based plastic, by 125 million pounds by 2025 through new packaging and innovative product design in our Consumer business. 
We recognize the urgency of the world's climate and environmental challenges and are focused on making a difference both today and in future generations. I encourage you to read our Annual Sustainability Report to be released in early May for more details on our progress and priorities.

289194,708649137,2259416,"3M Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","3M Company","Executives","Thank you, John, and I wish you all a very good morning. Company-wide first quarter sales were $8.9 billion, up 9.6% year-on-year or an increase of 8% on an organic basis. Sales growth, combined with operating rigor and disciplined cost management, drove",2022,"Thank you, John, and I wish you all a very good morning. Company-wide first quarter sales were $8.9 billion, up 9.6% year-on-year or an increase of 8% on an organic basis. Sales growth, combined with operating rigor and disciplined cost management, drove adjusted operating income of $2 billion, up 19%, with adjusted operating margins of 22.5%, up 170 basis points year-on-year. First quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings per share were $2.77, up 27% compared to last year's adjusted results. 
On this slide, you can see the components that impacted both margins and earnings per share. Organic volume growth, along with our ongoing cost management and productivity efforts, were the biggest contributors to first quarter operating margins and earnings, adding 150 basis points to margins and $0.34 to earnings per share year-on-year. 
Turning to selling prices and raw materials. As Mike mentioned, we experienced increasing costs, particularly for raw materials and logistics due to the impacts from the strengthening end markets, ongoing COVID pandemic, along with winter storm Uri. As a result, first quarter net selling price and raw materials performance reduced both operating margins and earnings per share by 20 basis points and $0.01, respectively. 
In our view, we expect global supply chain dynamics to remain fluid and for raw material and logistics headwinds to persist. Therefore, we now anticipate a full year raw materials and logistics headwind of $0.30 to $0.50 per share versus a prior expectation of flat to a $0.10 headwind at the start of the year. 
Looking at the second quarter, we currently anticipate a net selling price and raw materials headwinds to operating margins in the range of 75 to 125 basis points. We are taking multiple actions to address these increased headwinds, including selling price increases, global sourcing efforts, improving yields in our factories and ongoing demand planning, given the dynamic environment. We expect these actions will gain traction as we move through the year, particularly in the second half. 
Moving to divestiture impacts. The lost income from the drug delivery divestiture in May of last year was neutral to margins, however, was a $0.03 headwind year-on-year to earnings. Foreign currency, net of hedging impacts, added 40 basis points to margins and $0.13 to earnings per share as the U.S. dollar weakened against most major currencies year-on-year. We continue to expect foreign exchange to be an earnings benefit of $0.15 per share for the full year. 
Three other nonoperating items impacted our year-on-year earnings per share performance. First, our continued strong cash flow and liquidity position give us the opportunity in Q1 to redeem an additional $450 million of debt early that was due to mature in 2022. As a result, we incurred higher net interest expense of approximately $0.02 per share versus Q1 last year. This impact was more than offset by year-on-year nonoperating pension benefit of $0.05 per share. Combined, these items resulted in lower net nonoperating expense of $0.03 per share versus last year's first quarter. 
Secondly, a lower tax rate versus last year provided a $0.14 benefit to earnings per share. The lower tax rate was primarily a function of non-repeating favorable adjustments related to U.S. tax treatment of international income, along with regional income mix and equity-based compensation. Our full year 2021 tax rate expectations remained unchanged in the range of 20% to 21%. Finally, average diluted shares were up 1% year-on-year, which reduced per share earnings by $0.02. 
Please turn to Slide 8 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. We delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with first quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.4 billion, up 49% year-on-year with conversion of 86%. Cash flows in the quarter were primarily driven by robust growth in cash flow from operations, along with our ongoing daily management of working capital. First quarter capital expenditures were $310 million. For the full year, we continue to expect CapEx to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. 
During the quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $858 million and share repurchases of $231 million. Our strong cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to strengthen our capital structure. 
We ended the quarter with $13 billion in net debt, a reduction of nearly $5 billion since the end of Q1 last year. As a result, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has declined significantly from 2.2 a year ago to 1.4 at the end of Q1. Our net debt position, along with our strong cash flow generation capability, continues to provide us financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. 
Please turn to Slide 9, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q1. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 10.3% year-on-year in the first quarter. This result includes a 6.4 percentage point benefit from pandemic-related respirator demand. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate strong pandemic-related respirator mass demand. However, the year-on-year contribution to sales growth will decline as we lap last year's quarterly comparisons. 
Overall, general industrial manufacturing activity continued to improve during Q1, resulting in a pickup in growth across the portfolio. 
Personal safety posted double-digit organic growth year-on-year, driven by ongoing demand for respirators. Industrial adhesives and tapes grew low double digits, primarily due to strong demand across industrial and electronics end markets. The continued strength in the residential housing market drove good performance in our roofing's granules business, which was up double digits organically versus Q1 of last year. 
Turning to the rest of the Safety and Industrial businesses. Automotive aftermarket grew high single digits organically. The electrical markets business was up mid-single digits and abrasives grew low single digits. While our closure and masking business declined year-on-year. 
Safety and Industrial's first quarter segment operating margins were 24.4%, up 70 basis points year-on-year. Operating margins were driven by leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by increase in raw materials, logistics and legal costs. 
Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which delivered a strong start to the year with first quarter organic sales growth of 9.8% despite the well-known semiconductor supply chain constraints. Our electronics-related business was up high teens organically with continued strength in semiconductor, factory automation and data centers, along with strong demand for consumer electronic devices, namely tablets and TVs. Our auto OEM business was up 21% year-on-year compared to the 14% increase in global car and light truck builds. 
Looking ahead, we continue to monitor the global semiconductor supply chain and its potential impact on the electronics and automotive industries. 
Turning to advanced materials, which increased mid-single digits, largely as a result of the year-on-year increase in automotive builds. And finally, our transportation safety business was flat year-on-year, while commercial solutions declined slightly. 
Transportation and Electronics first quarter operating margins were 23.3%, up 260 basis points year-on-year, benefiting from strong leverage on sales growth and prior year COVID-related asset write-downs, which were partially offset by increases in raw materials and logistics costs. 
Turning to our Health Care business. Health care providers continue to be challenged from the ebbs and flows of COVID-19 cases as elective procedure volumes still remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, we continue to experience strong pandemic-related demand for respirators to protect frontline health care workers, which more than offset the headwinds from the decline in elective procedure volumes. As a result, our Health Care business delivered first quarter organic sales growth of 9.3% versus last year. 
The Medical Solutions business grew high single digits, driven by continued strong respirator demand. Excluding respirators, organic growth in this business was down low single digits due to the ongoing year-on-year impact of lower procedure volumes. Organic sales for our oral care business increased double digits year-on-year. This result is primarily due to last year's COVID-related comp as dental offices started closing their doors during Q1 last year. 
The separation and purification business increased low teens year-on-year. This business continues to experience solid demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutics development and manufacturing, along with improving demand trends for water filtration solutions. Health information systems returned to positive organic growth, up mid-single digits, while food safety declined mid-single digits organically versus last year's strong comparison. 
Health Care's first quarter operating margins were 22.7%, up 120 basis points year-on-year. First quarter margins were driven by leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by supply chain disruptions and increasing raw materials and logistics costs. 
Lastly, first quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was 7.8% year-on-year, with strength across most retail channels led by e-commerce. Organic sales growth continued to be led by a home improvement business, up double digits organically, driven by strong demand for command adhesives, filtrate air quality solutions and ScotchBlue Painters Tape. 
Stationery and office returned to positive organic growth in Q1, up mid-single digits with ongoing strength in consumer demand for packaging and shipping products. This business also delivered improved growth in Scotch brand office tapes as we start to lap the COVID-related impacts from remote work and school trends. And finally, our home care business was up low single digits organically versus last year's strong comparison. 
Consumer's operating margins were 21.1% or similar to last year as leverage on sales growth was offset by increasing cost for raw materials, logistics, outsourced hard goods manufacturing and increased investments in advertising and merchandising. 
Please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion of our full year 2021 guidance. As you can see from our Q1 results, we are off to a good start to the year. Looking ahead, as Mike mentioned, we expect continued strengthening of the global economy, along with increasing opportunities in end markets with favorable trends. However, we foresee that the improvement will remain fluid and uneven as we go through 2021, given the ongoing impact of the pandemic. 
As a result, we anticipate a number of items that will need to be navigated as we go through the year. For example, starting with the evolving impacts from COVID, including respirator demand, health care elective procedures, supply chains, shutdowns and government response. Next, the continued constrained supply of semiconductor chips and related impacts to consumer electronics and automotive OEM production. In addition, the expected increase in cost for raw materials and logistics and in some cases, constrained availability. 
And finally, we expect to increase investments through the year in growth, productivity and sustainability along with managing ongoing legal costs as PFAS and other legal proceedings progress. Thus, taking these items into account, along it with being early in the year, we think it's prudent to maintain our full year guidance of 3% to 6% for organic growth, earnings per share of $9.20 to $9.70 and free cash flow conversion of 95% to 105%. 
Turning to the second quarter, let me highlight a few items of note. First, we expect continued strong execution by the 3M team in the face of a very fluid and uncertain environment. As I mentioned during my remarks, we have increased the expected headwind from raw materials and logistics costs for the full year. We are taking several actions, including increasing selling prices to address these headwinds as we go through the year. These actions will take a little time to gain traction. Therefore, we anticipate a second quarter year-on-year operating margin headwind of 75 to 125 basis points from selling prices net of higher raw materials and logistics costs. 
And finally, we expect a pretax restructuring charge in the range of $25 million to $50 million as we continue our actions related to our December 2020 announcement. 
To wrap up, we are off to a good start for the year delivering broad-based growth, strong operational execution and robust cash flows. We are prioritizing capital to our greatest opportunities for growth, productivity and sustainability while focused on delivering for our customers, improving operating rigor and enhancing daily management. 
With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

When you look at it, a good measure for us is what's happening with channel inventories. And I would say we seem very much in line with what you have written about in your reports that we see the changes due to growth trends. 
Overall, inventory in our industrial channels remains still relatively low. Transportation and Electronics, with the supply chain impacts from the semiconductor shortage, we're seeing some challenges there. And it's just the responding with that -- with the disruption from the semiconductor shortage. Health Care is pretty steady, reacting to the trend still, electric procedures well below pre-pandemic level. So that's impacting there. And in Consumer, it's a mixed case. We have high demand and home improvements, so we're seeing lower levels there. So I would say we -- you see a little lower levels when you see the pickup, but it's responding to the marketplace. 
Otherwise, I would say the trends in the quarter were -- the ordering trends were pretty much in line with what we expected, a little better than we expected in March, which was really reflected in our broad-based growth. But otherwise, nothing unusual."

One of the things that I always try to put my finger on, it's always just a little bit difficult is the flip side of the new product development, what's going on, on kind of end-of-life and commoditization at the low end. And so the effort to counter that. If you have any color there, that would be interesting also."

So maybe on the first part around our priority growth platforms and our PGPs or so, they're about 5% of the overall portfolio, I would say, and growing quite a bit, I think, as Mike referenced. We've seen approximately about a 10% growth over the last quarter of those platforms and they continue to grow. And as you know, they sit in high-growth market spaces for us. And so we would expect that growth to continue on those platforms as we continue to find customer solutions in those areas. 
Second comments kind of around the vitality of the NPVI or the part of it. We've talked about NPVI in the past, and that's definitely an important metric for 3M, without a question, but it's also a secondary metric for us. The primary, obviously, being our growth in our profitability for that. 
I'd say, over the last few years, our NPVI and things have trended to be about in the mid-20s, if you take an average over the last 5 years or so, which is, I think roughly a pretty good guide for 3M overall. And obviously, COVID had some of that impact on trends here in the near-term as well as we've gone forward. 
And then kind of the, as you said, the commoditization or the churn, I personally don't think a whole lot about that. I think about, are we aligned with our customers? Are we solving customer needs? Are our R&D resources geared toward growth and solving those issues for our customers and making sure that we can deliver our technologies and our solutions to our customers in order to be able to grow and sustain profitable margin and ROIC."

As regards legal fees, and you can see this more -- or legal costs, you can see this more as you -- as we file our Q this morning. But there are a couple of things. You'll see the PFAS reserves are up around $50 million between the end of fourth quarter to this quarter. And then the mass respirator accrual is up approximately $20 million. To predict what exactly is going to be in the second half of the year is quite tough. But what we do see is as we prepare for some of these trials, example, the combat arms trial that's on in Florida right now with the MDL as well as some of the other cases that will start picking up in PFAS, we expect that our legal fees -- or legal cost to prepare for these trials will go up during the second half of this year."

I don't think any trend seems to be normal, Nigel. You've seen trends that seem to be completely abnormal compared to what the past has been compared to monthly cyclicality as well as compared to quarterly cyclicality. So I'll just start with that as the first piece. 
The second I would say is one thing you can definitely count on us in Q2 is strong execution. We are also confident that end markets are going to pick up, but I think they're going to be uneven. And for the second quarter, we are still monitoring quite a few things. One, of course, Mike just mentioned about what happens with the stationery, how does that return to work come in. The return to work impacts not just the stationery business, but it impacts our graphics business, it impacts our signage business and what happens there and what people spend, I think, is going to be important to watch. 
The second piece is as pandemic is still playing out in parts of the world, elective procedures continue to be below pre-pandemic level. So we'll see how that plays out. The well-known semiconductor chip shortage, how it impacts auto, how it impacts consumer electronics is another piece. 
And then when you think about supply chain disruption, the supply chain disruption, one is, of course, the raw material costs and logistics costs that I've talked about quite a bit. The other one, of course, is product availability and making sure that there is product available from our suppliers to continue to keep us manufacturing. Now I'll tell you this that our supply chain team has done an amazing job keeping the factories running, making sure we are delivering to our customers, thanks to the relationship they have with the suppliers, and we appreciate all the work the suppliers have also done to partner with us to minimize disruption as much as possible. 
We are also raising prices, but it's going to take a little bit of time. The inflation has come in faster. So you're going to see 75 to 125 basis points of headwind, which is the net of price versus inflation and logistics. As I also mentioned that we're going to do restructuring, which was announced in Q4 of 2020, we had told you it's somewhere between $250 million to $300 million charge for the year. As of first quarter, we are at $150 million. So we got approximately $100 million to $150 million to go for the remaining of the year. 
The second quarter is going to see $25 million to $50 million of restructuring charge, the balance will come in 3Q and 4Q. And then if this economy continues to go the way it is, outlook is that indirect costs, travel costs, some of the legal costs that we talked about will keep going up. Any other onetime headwinds will also go up as regards compensation. And then our goal is, as Mike has mentioned, we have tremendous areas that we can invest in. And our goal is for the long run, we want to keep investing in growth, productivity and sustainability. 
And put all that into play, that's why we felt it prudent to maintain guidance. And also to answer your question, it's hard to follow normal seasonality trends with all these other things in play."

As you know, volume is the biggest piece that drives margin leverage for 3M. You should assume the normal 30% to 40% margin leverage that you would get. The amount of volume is going to depend on a lot of the uncertainties that I've talked about, whether it's elective procedures, whether it is semiconductor, chip availability for auto and consumer, whether it is the strength in stationery remains, whether our oil and gas -- whether the oil and gas industry picks up. So a lot of long term, I would say, end markets growing, we'll have to figure out what happens in the second quarter with all of these from an end market perspective. 
Similarly, on supply chain disruption, there are 2 pieces. One is, of course, the inflation that we've told you about, which will cost 75 to 125 basis points of headwind between price and inflation and the raw material and logistics costs as well as making sure that we have all the product availability that we have.

Again, it's too early to say because it's a very dynamic situation that changes every day. And again, the relationship we have with our suppliers helps us get the product as much as we can, but they are also constrained right now with the overall supply chain situation in the world. 
The other headwind is $25 million to $50 million of restructuring. So this is still a part of the overall restructuring program we announced in Q4. We are done up to $150 million in Q1. We're going to take another $25 million to $50 million in Q2, and the balance will come in Q3 and Q4. Indirect costs. So as the economies are starting to open up, you are going to see hopefully, ad merch and travel start to go up. So that's a headwind to Q1. And then our increase, as we are starting to see the economy starting to pick up, our investments in growth productivity and sustainability will continue to increase.

And still in the quarter, 90% going to health care workers and I would say, first responders and increasingly essential industries. The demand as we move forward, it's going to depend on a few factors. The first is what's going to be the demand in health care. And that's going to depend on how the pandemic plays out. And I would say how governments respond to dynamics in the pandemic. And there's been changing in protocol of use of respirators, for example, is one of those dynamics. 
As Monish said, this is one of the areas where we're working through the uncertainties as there's -- that demand, there's also governments, and we're working with governments around the world on stockpile strategies and continue to supply into those. 
And then there is consumer demand and increasing demand in industrial as economies recover. So we see some shifting as we go forward over time from the high priority, more than 90% into health care, shifting more into industrial and consumer.

The prioritization hasn't changed. Our first priority is always invest in R&D. Mike mentioned the areas that we have as we think about just a few and even John talked about whether it's biopharma, home improvement, personal safety, digital, semiconductor, health care. There are tremendous opportunities that we believe we can keep investing in. So that's our first priority. I think, in the long run, that will give us the best return. 
The second priority is dividend. We did increase dividend 1% this year. It's the 63rd year of consecutive dividend increase. Our third priority is M&A. As you know, we are busy integrating Acelity. It's doing very well and integrating well into 3M. We don't see another acquisition in the size of Acelity in the near future, but we are always looking for opportunities where we believe that it's complementary to 3M's strengths as well as 3M can add value and synergies. 
And then our last priority is share repurchase. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we did have $231 million of share repurchases. 
I think the strength that we have right now, Julian, 1.4 net leverage gives us a lot of flexibility to go either way as well as gives us strategic opportunities to deploy when needed."

And we certainly had a good start to the year. Transportation and Electronics off to a strong start, much like the rest of the company. They're still facing some considerable uncertainties in that marketplace. And we've talked about the chip shortage and its impact on both electronics and automotive. 
I think you see kind of changing dynamics in the build rates, much of it reflecting that dynamic. Electronics, I would say, consumer electronics is off to a strong start. Tablets and TVs really driving a lot of that. So it's how are these trends going to play out through the year, and it still reflects, I would say, a wider range of outcomes. And it also is going to depend on how the pandemic plays out. Some of these are dynamics being driven by the pandemic and its impact on the economy in general. 
So I would say that wide range that we came into the year, we still have a wide range view of how the uncertainties will impact these key market segments. But again, off to a strong start, automotive above the build rates, our growth in consumer electronics, above the build rates there. So we are -- we're winning in the marketplace with our solutions, and we're well positioned. We'll see how the market dynamics take us as we go through the year."

And when we talked about things that were going on, obviously, in personal safety, but also home improvement and other areas that the trends were strong. 
So that's how we're prioritizing growth based on the market trends, where we can create unique and differentiated value. Priority growth platforms tend to represent both of those strong markets. As John mentioned earlier, these are higher growth market segments. And then we have the investments that we make in the trends coming out of the pandemic, and we're stepping those up as we see the opportunity. So we're really driving those based on the growth opportunity that we see in front of us as we go through 2021, not locked in on a plan that we put together for our priority growth platforms before the year started. So I -- it is what we see as an opportunity to drive the growth and the growth outlook that we had for the year as we came into 2021."

And industrial mineral products in the U.S. with a strong residential housing growth. All of those are driving what's going on in the Americas and across the Safety and Industrial business group. 
Transportation and Electronics, it's driven globally the strong growth that you saw by semiconductor fabrication, data centers, what I talked about earlier, in consumer electronics. Those are not the big drivers, obviously, in the U.S. at this point. The automotive is the driver in the U.S. and we're seeing -- I would say we're seeing good performance on our spec ins. We're winning additional spec ins in the OEMs and as that -- as the build rates pick up in the U.S., we'll see TEBG, the transportation business from the automotive side, get a strong contribution. 
We are -- Monish talked about some of the areas of uncertainties and things that we're looking at, commercial solutions and the demand for graphics that are part of that, the transportation safety products, those are still flat year-over-year growth even in decline in key end-market segments.

U.S. is one of those areas where we are -- in the end, we're a net exporter of goods out of the United States because we have a stronger footprint here. 
And that's also true in much of the portfolio that we serve semiconductor fabrication with. We build that out close to -- the end users close to the customers. So we have significant resources in Asia, for example. We also supply a significant portion of it from capacity in the U.S. and even some capacity in Europe. So it is -- I think we're well positioned if we see that shift, and that's -- it's going to take time to play out. And as has been the case for us throughout history, as we see market dynamics change and shift around the world, we'll invest to build up that capacity where it's needed.

Since you're talking about the second quarter and my memory failed me earlier, sorry. So Steve's question earlier also on -- if you're looking at Q1 versus Q2, just another point is FX, which is $0.13 benefit in Q1. For the year, we still see that to be $0.15. Again, we'll see where currencies move as the world plays itself out. And then from a tax rate perspective, we were at 16.4% for the first quarter, and our plan is 20% to 21% for the year.

And about 1/3 of our intellectual property sits in our manufacturing operations, process technologies.

Similarly, at the beginning of the year, we reset our comp, so that's a headwind. We also had a property sale in fourth quarter of last year of approximately $50 million of gain. That's a nonrepeat. So all of those are one-time headwinds coming into the year that we talked about. We also talked that we will be increasing our investments in growth, productivity and sustainability in '21 as we see some of the trends playing out that can help us continue to grow in the longer term. And so that's the second headwind. 
And then the third, as has come through that I've talked about, it's the raw material and logistics cost increase, partially offset by the price increases that we are trying to do, increase our yield and then managing all the other costs that we have, whether it's legal costs as PFAS and combat arms and some of those proceedings proceed as well as any other investments that we want to make as we keep seeing growth opportunities in the long term.

The first quarter was strong for 3M, with broad-based organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas. Our team executed well and posted record sales, robust cash flow and expanded margins, along with a double-digit increase in earnings per share. We saw encouraging improvement in many of our end markets, while others remained well below pre-pandemic levels. We also faced and addressed ongoing supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19, exacerbated by improving macroeconomic trends and winter storm Uri, all of which are increasing the cost of doing business. 
I am proud of the way 3Mers have stepped up to manage and overcome these challenges, keeping our factories running, expanding our manufacturing capacity, and driving innovation for our customers across our businesses. We have found new ways to engage with customers and create solutions no matter where we are around the world, learnings we will take forward as we come out of the pandemic. 
Looking ahead, we expect continued strengthening of the global economy, though we anticipate the recovery to be uneven as the trajectory of the pandemic, rollout of vaccines and government policies evolve in different stages around the world. We are confident in our business as we navigate COVID-19 uncertainty. And with 1 quarter behind us, we are maintaining our full year guidance for organic growth, earnings per share and cash flow. 
Our team remains focused on driving growth, improving operational performance and delivering for our customers and shareholders. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Company-wide, total sales increased to $8.9 billion, with organic growth of 8% and earnings of $2.77 per share, up 27% year-on-year on an adjusted basis. Geographically, organic growth was led by Asia Pacific, up 13%, with China up 32%. Growth in the Americas was 6%, with the United States up 7%, while EMEA grew 6%. We expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins to nearly 28%, with all business groups above 23% and increased free cash flow to $1.4 billion with a conversion rate of 86%. 
3M increased our dividend in the first quarter, marking our 63rd straight year of increases. We also continue to build 3M for the long-term and prioritize investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. While we manage end-market challenges related to COVID-19, we are investing to capitalize on global growth opportunities in health care, electronics, home improvement, personal safety, and other favorable market trends. This includes our priority growth platforms, which grew 10% in the quarter as we apply science to advance growing areas like automotive electrification, and  biopharma filtration. The fundamental strengths of 3M, our unique technology platforms, advanced manufacturing, global capabilities and leading brands position us well to win in these markets into the future. 
We are accelerating digital strategies across 3M and expanding our use of data and data analytics to better serve our customers and improve performance. For example, we are using new cloud-based technologies to provide better insights into our global workflows from raw material purchase through product delivery, which is helping us navigate the current supply chain challenges. We are stepping up our leadership in sustainability with significant new commitments that will bend the curve on carbon emissions, water use and improving water quality. 
In a similar way, we are implementing a long-term plan to advance equity and inclusion as we launch new scholarship programs and a new goal to create 5 million opportunities in STEM education, with initial efforts focused here in the twin cities. At the same time, 3M continues to help lead the fight against COVID-19, with 630 million respirators distributed in the first quarter. 
We are also providing our expertise as we engage with the Biden administration and governments around the world on how to better prepare for future pandemics. Overall, I am pleased with our performance in the first quarter as we remain focused on driving growth, improving productivity and advancing sustainability. 
To provide additional insight on that last point, sustainability, I will now turn it over to 3M's Chief Technology Officer, John Banovetz. John?"

I'm proud to lead 3M's Research and Development and Sustainability teams. Every day, we bring our innovation to bear on tough challenges, which includes applying 3M science to create a more efficient company and a more sustainable world. As you may have seen, in February, we announced expanded sustainability goals. We plan to commit approximately $1 billion over the next 20 years through both capital and operating investments to make our operations more efficient and effective with a focus on air, water and waste. 
First, we are committing to become carbon-neutral across our global operations. We expect to rapidly bend our curve of emissions with 2019 as our baseline and aggressive milestones along the way: a 50% reduction by 2030, 80% by 2040 and 100% by 2050. 
Second, 3M plans to reduce water use at our facilities by 25% over the next decade, targeting a 10% reduction by 2022 and 20% reduction by 2025. Third, at our largest locations, we are taking action and installing advanced filtration technology that will return even higher quality water to the environment after its use in our operations. These goals are driven by science and a clearly defined path. We have identified the investments and technologies that will enable our success from thermal oxidizers to reverse osmosis, and work is already underway. 
At 3M's facility in Antwerp, for example, we have expanded our thermal oxidizer system and reduced our carbon emissions by 1 million tons per year. Overall, our thermal oxidizers reduce our carbon footprint by more than 90% when fully installed. And in Decatur, Alabama, we have implemented a water treatment system with granular activated carbon, also known as a GAC system, that has improved the quality of water we return to the environment by 90%. We intend to add complementary technology that will further improve water quality by 2024. 
We will continue to advance new state-of-the-art technologies, including through partnerships with customers, governments, communities and others to further accelerate our progress. Our actions demonstrate 3M's commitment to continuous improvement and our ongoing work to advance our environmental stewardship. Over the last 2 decades, 3M has reduced our emissions by 70%, while doubling revenues. 
Our headquarters is fully powered by renewable electricity and 40% of 3M's global electricity use is now renewable, on our way to 100%. Every new 3M product includes a sustainability value commitment. And over the last 5 years, our innovations have helped customers avoid 75 million tons of emissions. And just last week, we committed to reduce our use of new plastic made from petroleum, also known as virgin fossil-based plastic, by 125 million pounds by 2025 through new packaging and innovative product design in our Consumer business. 
We recognize the urgency of the world's climate and environmental challenges and are focused on making a difference both today and in future generations. I encourage you to read our Annual Sustainability Report to be released in early May for more details on our progress and priorities. 
Please turn to Slide 7, and I'll turn it over to Monish. Monish?"
289194,708649137,2259492,"3M Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","3M Company","Executives","Thank you, John, and I wish you all a very good morning. Company-wide first quarter sales were $8.9 billion, up 9.6% year-on-year or an increase of 8% on an organic basis. Sales growth, combined with operating rigor and disciplined cost management, drove",2022,"Thank you, John, and I wish you all a very good morning. Company-wide first quarter sales were $8.9 billion, up 9.6% year-on-year or an increase of 8% on an organic basis. Sales growth, combined with operating rigor and disciplined cost management, drove adjusted operating income of $2 billion, up 19%, with adjusted operating margins of 22.5%, up 170 basis points year-on-year. First quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings per share were $2.77, up 27% compared to last year's adjusted results. 
On this slide, you can see the components that impacted both margins and earnings per share. Organic volume growth, along with our ongoing cost management and productivity efforts, were the biggest contributors to first quarter operating margins and earnings, adding 150 basis points to margins and $0.34 to earnings per share year-on-year. 
Turning to selling prices and raw materials. As Mike mentioned, we experienced increasing costs, particularly for raw materials and logistics due to the impacts from the strengthening end markets, ongoing COVID pandemic, along with winter storm Uri. As a result, first quarter net selling price and raw materials performance reduced both operating margins and earnings per share by 20 basis points and $0.01, respectively. 
In our view, we expect global supply chain dynamics to remain fluid and for raw material and logistics headwinds to persist. Therefore, we now anticipate a full year raw materials and logistics headwind of $0.30 to $0.50 per share versus a prior expectation of flat to a $0.10 headwind at the start of the year. 
Looking at the second quarter, we currently anticipate a net selling price and raw materials headwinds to operating margins in the range of 75 to 125 basis points. We are taking multiple actions to address these increased headwinds, including selling price increases, global sourcing efforts, improving yields in our factories and ongoing demand planning, given the dynamic environment. We expect these actions will gain traction as we move through the year, particularly in the second half. 
Moving to divestiture impacts. The lost income from the drug delivery divestiture in May of last year was neutral to margins, however, was a $0.03 headwind year-on-year to earnings. Foreign currency, net of hedging impacts, added 40 basis points to margins and $0.13 to earnings per share as the U.S. dollar weakened against most major currencies year-on-year. We continue to expect foreign exchange to be an earnings benefit of $0.15 per share for the full year. 
Three other nonoperating items impacted our year-on-year earnings per share performance. First, our continued strong cash flow and liquidity position give us the opportunity in Q1 to redeem an additional $450 million of debt early that was due to mature in 2022. As a result, we incurred higher net interest expense of approximately $0.02 per share versus Q1 last year. This impact was more than offset by year-on-year nonoperating pension benefit of $0.05 per share. Combined, these items resulted in lower net nonoperating expense of $0.03 per share versus last year's first quarter. 
Secondly, a lower tax rate versus last year provided a $0.14 benefit to earnings per share. The lower tax rate was primarily a function of non-repeating favorable adjustments related to U.S. tax treatment of international income, along with regional income mix and equity-based compensation. Our full year 2021 tax rate expectations remained unchanged in the range of 20% to 21%. Finally, average diluted shares were up 1% year-on-year, which reduced per share earnings by $0.02. 
Please turn to Slide 8 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. We delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with first quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.4 billion, up 49% year-on-year with conversion of 86%. Cash flows in the quarter were primarily driven by robust growth in cash flow from operations, along with our ongoing daily management of working capital. First quarter capital expenditures were $310 million. For the full year, we continue to expect CapEx to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. 
During the quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $858 million and share repurchases of $231 million. Our strong cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to strengthen our capital structure. 
We ended the quarter with $13 billion in net debt, a reduction of nearly $5 billion since the end of Q1 last year. As a result, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has declined significantly from 2.2 a year ago to 1.4 at the end of Q1. Our net debt position, along with our strong cash flow generation capability, continues to provide us financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. 
Please turn to Slide 9, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q1. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 10.3% year-on-year in the first quarter. This result includes a 6.4 percentage point benefit from pandemic-related respirator demand. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate strong pandemic-related respirator mass demand. However, the year-on-year contribution to sales growth will decline as we lap last year's quarterly comparisons. 
Overall, general industrial manufacturing activity continued to improve during Q1, resulting in a pickup in growth across the portfolio. 
Personal safety posted double-digit organic growth year-on-year, driven by ongoing demand for respirators. Industrial adhesives and tapes grew low double digits, primarily due to strong demand across industrial and electronics end markets. The continued strength in the residential housing market drove good performance in our roofing's granules business, which was up double digits organically versus Q1 of last year. 
Turning to the rest of the Safety and Industrial businesses. Automotive aftermarket grew high single digits organically. The electrical markets business was up mid-single digits and abrasives grew low single digits. While our closure and masking business declined year-on-year. 
Safety and Industrial's first quarter segment operating margins were 24.4%, up 70 basis points year-on-year. Operating margins were driven by leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by increase in raw materials, logistics and legal costs. 
Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which delivered a strong start to the year with first quarter organic sales growth of 9.8% despite the well-known semiconductor supply chain constraints. Our electronics-related business was up high teens organically with continued strength in semiconductor, factory automation and data centers, along with strong demand for consumer electronic devices, namely tablets and TVs. Our auto OEM business was up 21% year-on-year compared to the 14% increase in global car and light truck builds. 
Looking ahead, we continue to monitor the global semiconductor supply chain and its potential impact on the electronics and automotive industries. 
Turning to advanced materials, which increased mid-single digits, largely as a result of the year-on-year increase in automotive builds. And finally, our transportation safety business was flat year-on-year, while commercial solutions declined slightly. 
Transportation and Electronics first quarter operating margins were 23.3%, up 260 basis points year-on-year, benefiting from strong leverage on sales growth and prior year COVID-related asset write-downs, which were partially offset by increases in raw materials and logistics costs. 
Turning to our Health Care business. Health care providers continue to be challenged from the ebbs and flows of COVID-19 cases as elective procedure volumes still remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, we continue to experience strong pandemic-related demand for respirators to protect frontline health care workers, which more than offset the headwinds from the decline in elective procedure volumes. As a result, our Health Care business delivered first quarter organic sales growth of 9.3% versus last year. 
The Medical Solutions business grew high single digits, driven by continued strong respirator demand. Excluding respirators, organic growth in this business was down low single digits due to the ongoing year-on-year impact of lower procedure volumes. Organic sales for our oral care business increased double digits year-on-year. This result is primarily due to last year's COVID-related comp as dental offices started closing their doors during Q1 last year. 
The separation and purification business increased low teens year-on-year. This business continues to experience solid demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutics development and manufacturing, along with improving demand trends for water filtration solutions. Health information systems returned to positive organic growth, up mid-single digits, while food safety declined mid-single digits organically versus last year's strong comparison. 
Health Care's first quarter operating margins were 22.7%, up 120 basis points year-on-year. First quarter margins were driven by leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by supply chain disruptions and increasing raw materials and logistics costs. 
Lastly, first quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was 7.8% year-on-year, with strength across most retail channels led by e-commerce. Organic sales growth continued to be led by a home improvement business, up double digits organically, driven by strong demand for command adhesives, filtrate air quality solutions and ScotchBlue Painters Tape. 
Stationery and office returned to positive organic growth in Q1, up mid-single digits with ongoing strength in consumer demand for packaging and shipping products. This business also delivered improved growth in Scotch brand office tapes as we start to lap the COVID-related impacts from remote work and school trends. And finally, our home care business was up low single digits organically versus last year's strong comparison. 
Consumer's operating margins were 21.1% or similar to last year as leverage on sales growth was offset by increasing cost for raw materials, logistics, outsourced hard goods manufacturing and increased investments in advertising and merchandising. 
Please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion of our full year 2021 guidance. As you can see from our Q1 results, we are off to a good start to the year. Looking ahead, as Mike mentioned, we expect continued strengthening of the global economy, along with increasing opportunities in end markets with favorable trends. However, we foresee that the improvement will remain fluid and uneven as we go through 2021, given the ongoing impact of the pandemic. 
As a result, we anticipate a number of items that will need to be navigated as we go through the year. For example, starting with the evolving impacts from COVID, including respirator demand, health care elective procedures, supply chains, shutdowns and government response. Next, the continued constrained supply of semiconductor chips and related impacts to consumer electronics and automotive OEM production. In addition, the expected increase in cost for raw materials and logistics and in some cases, constrained availability. 
And finally, we expect to increase investments through the year in growth, productivity and sustainability along with managing ongoing legal costs as PFAS and other legal proceedings progress. Thus, taking these items into account, along it with being early in the year, we think it's prudent to maintain our full year guidance of 3% to 6% for organic growth, earnings per share of $9.20 to $9.70 and free cash flow conversion of 95% to 105%. 
Turning to the second quarter, let me highlight a few items of note. First, we expect continued strong execution by the 3M team in the face of a very fluid and uncertain environment. As I mentioned during my remarks, we have increased the expected headwind from raw materials and logistics costs for the full year. We are taking several actions, including increasing selling prices to address these headwinds as we go through the year. These actions will take a little time to gain traction. Therefore, we anticipate a second quarter year-on-year operating margin headwind of 75 to 125 basis points from selling prices net of higher raw materials and logistics costs. 
And finally, we expect a pretax restructuring charge in the range of $25 million to $50 million as we continue our actions related to our December 2020 announcement. 
To wrap up, we are off to a good start for the year delivering broad-based growth, strong operational execution and robust cash flows. We are prioritizing capital to our greatest opportunities for growth, productivity and sustainability while focused on delivering for our customers, improving operating rigor and enhancing daily management. 
With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

Transportation and Electronics are strong end markets for us in Q1. I wouldn't say that we see anything unusual there. It's what comes with a normal pickup in the marketplace. When you look at it, a good measure for us is what's happening with channel inventories. And I would say we seem very much in line with what you have written about in your reports that we see the changes due to growth trends. 
Overall, inventory in our industrial channels remains still relatively low. Transportation and Electronics, with the supply chain impacts from the semiconductor shortage, we're seeing some challenges there. And it's just the responding with that -- with the disruption from the semiconductor shortage. Health Care is pretty steady, reacting to the trend still, electric procedures well below pre-pandemic level. So that's impacting there. And in Consumer, it's a mixed case. We have high demand and home improvements, so we're seeing lower levels there. So I would say we -- you see a little lower levels when you see the pickup, but it's responding to the marketplace. 
Otherwise, I would say the trends in the quarter were -- the ordering trends were pretty much in line with what we expected, a little better than we expected in March, which was really reflected in our broad-based growth. But otherwise, nothing unusual."

And so we would expect that growth to continue on those platforms as we continue to find customer solutions in those areas. 
Second comments kind of around the vitality of the NPVI or the part of it. We've talked about NPVI in the past, and that's definitely an important metric for 3M, without a question, but it's also a secondary metric for us. The primary, obviously, being our growth in our profitability for that. 
I'd say, over the last few years, our NPVI and things have trended to be about in the mid-20s, if you take an average over the last 5 years or so, which is, I think roughly a pretty good guide for 3M overall. And obviously, COVID had some of that impact on trends here in the near-term as well as we've gone forward. 
And then kind of the, as you said, the commoditization or the churn, I personally don't think a whole lot about that. I think about, are we aligned with our customers? Are we solving customer needs? Are our R&D resources geared toward growth and solving those issues for our customers and making sure that we can deliver our technologies and our solutions to our customers in order to be able to grow and sustain profitable margin and ROIC."

So I'll keep all that first with the headwinds with some partial offsets that will take a little bit of time to implement. 
As regards legal fees, and you can see this more -- or legal costs, you can see this more as you -- as we file our Q this morning. But there are a couple of things. You'll see the PFAS reserves are up around $50 million between the end of fourth quarter to this quarter. And then the mass respirator accrual is up approximately $20 million. To predict what exactly is going to be in the second half of the year is quite tough. But what we do see is as we prepare for some of these trials, example, the combat arms trial that's on in Florida right now with the MDL as well as some of the other cases that will start picking up in PFAS, we expect that our legal fees -- or legal cost to prepare for these trials will go up during the second half of this year."

How big a return to school, how big a return to the workplace and when that will end up being what drives the answer to your question.

I don't think any trend seems to be normal, Nigel. You've seen trends that seem to be completely abnormal compared to what the past has been compared to monthly cyc",576,"So I'll just start with my 3 quarters that I've been here in the pandemic that we've seen. I don't think any trend seems to be normal, Nigel. You've seen trends that seem to be completely abnormal compared to what the past has been compared to monthly cyclicality as well as compared to quarterly cyclicality. So I'll just start with that as the first piece. 
The second I would say is one thing you can definitely count on us in Q2 is strong execution. We are also confident that end markets are going to pick up, but I think they're going to be uneven. And for the second quarter, we are still monitoring quite a few things. One, of course, Mike just mentioned about what happens with the stationery, how does that return to work come in. The return to work impacts not just the stationery business, but it impacts our graphics business, it impacts our signage business and what happens there and what people spend, I think, is going to be important to watch. 
The second piece is as pandemic is still playing out in parts of the world, elective procedures continue to be below pre-pandemic level. So we'll see how that plays out. The well-known semiconductor chip shortage, how it impacts auto, how it impacts consumer electronics is another piece. 
And then when you think about supply chain disruption, the supply chain disruption, one is, of course, the raw material costs and logistics costs that I've talked about quite a bit. The other one, of course, is product availability and making sure that there is product available from our suppliers to continue to keep us manufacturing. Now I'll tell you this that our supply chain team has done an amazing job keeping the factories running, making sure we are delivering to our customers, thanks to the relationship they have with the suppliers, and we appreciate all the work the suppliers have also done to partner with us to minimize disruption as much as possible. 
We are also raising prices, but it's going to take a little bit of time. The inflation has come in faster. So you're going to see 75 to 125 basis points of headwind, which is the net of price versus inflation and logistics. As I also mentioned that we're going to do restructuring, which was announced in Q4 of 2020, we had told you it's somewhere between $250 million to $300 million charge for the year. As of first quarter, we are at $150 million. So we got approximately $100 million to $150 million to go for the remaining of the year. 
The second quarter is going to see $25 million to $50 million of restructuring charge, the balance will come in 3Q and 4Q. And then if this economy continues to go the way it is, outlook is that indirect costs, travel costs, some of the legal costs that we talked about will keep going up. Any other onetime headwinds will also go up as regards compensation. And then our goal is, as Mike has mentioned, we have tremendous areas that we can invest in. And our goal is for the long run, we want to keep investing in growth, productivity and sustainability. 
And put all that into play, that's why we felt it prudent to maintain guidance. And also to answer your question, it's hard to follow normal seasonality trends with all these other things in play."

As you know, volume is the biggest piece that drives margin leverage for 3M. You should assume the normal 30% to 40% margin leverage that you would get. The amount of volume is going to depend on a lot of the uncertainties that I've talked about, whether it's elective procedures, whether it is semiconductor, chip availability for auto and consumer, whether it is the strength in stationery remains, whether our oil and gas -- whether the oil and gas industry picks up. So a lot of long term, I would say, end markets growing, we'll have to figure out what happens in the second quarter with all of these from an end market perspective. 
Similarly, on supply chain disruption, there are 2 pieces. One is, of course, the inflation that we've told you about, which will cost 75 to 125 basis points of headwind between price and inflation and the raw material and logistics costs as well as making sure that we have all the product availability that we have.

Again, it's too early to say because it's a very dynamic situation that changes every day. And again, the relationship we have with our suppliers helps us get the product as much as we can, but they are also constrained right now with the overall supply chain situation in the world. 
The other headwind is $25 million to $50 million of restructuring. So this is still a part of the overall restructuring program we announced in Q4. We are done up to $150 million in Q1. We're going to take another $25 million to $50 million in Q2, and the balance will come in Q3 and Q4. Indirect costs. So as the economies are starting to open up, you are going to see hopefully, ad merch and travel start to go up. So that's a headwind to Q1.

And still in the quarter, 90% going to health care workers and I would say, first responders and increasingly essential industries. The demand as we move forward, it's going to depend on a few factors. The first is what's going to be the demand in health care. And that's going to depend on how the pandemic plays out. And I would say how governments respond to dynamics in the pandemic. And there's been changing in protocol of use of respirators, for example, is one of those dynamics. 
As Monish said, this is one of the areas where we're working through the uncertainties as there's -- that demand, there's also governments, and we're working with governments around the world on stockpile strategies and continue to supply into those. 
And then there is consumer demand and increasing demand in industrial as economies recover. So we see some shifting as we go forward over time from the high priority, more than 90% into health care, shifting more into industrial and consumer. And then the demand overall, how much is it going to be relative to the impact on the overall enterprise relative to SIBG, that's going to depend on how each of those play out.

And we're accelerating, I would say, investments not only in our priority growth platforms, but other market trends that we were seeing that were opportunities for us. And when we talked about things that were going on, obviously, in personal safety, but also home improvement and other areas that the trends were strong. 
So that's how we're prioritizing growth based on the market trends, where we can create unique and differentiated value. Priority growth platforms tend to represent both of those strong markets. As John mentioned earlier, these are higher growth market segments. And then we have the investments that we make in the trends coming out of the pandemic, and we're stepping those up as we see the opportunity. So we're really driving those based on the growth opportunity that we see in front of us as we go through 2021, not locked in on a plan that we put together for our priority growth platforms before the year started. So I -- it is what we see as an opportunity to drive the growth and the growth outlook that we had for the year as we came into 2021."

And industrial mineral products in the U.S. with a strong residential housing growth. All of those are driving what's going on in the Americas and across the Safety and Industrial business group. 
Transportation and Electronics, it's driven globally the strong growth that you saw by semiconductor fabrication, data centers, what I talked about earlier, in consumer electronics. Those are not the big drivers, obviously, in the U.S. at this point. The automotive is the driver in the U.S. and we're seeing -- I would say we're seeing good performance on our spec ins. We're winning additional spec ins in the OEMs and as that -- as the build rates pick up in the U.S., we'll see TEBG, the transportation business from the automotive side, get a strong contribution. 
We are -- Monish talked about some of the areas of uncertainties and things that we're looking at, commercial solutions and the demand for graphics that are part of that, the transportation safety products, those are still flat year-over-year growth even in decline in key end-market segments.

Andrew, as you know, we -- our strategy is to be close to customers, invest in capacity to meet the demands regionally around the world. And that's true broadly across the enterprise. There are some key product and market segments where we have more of a critical center in key areas of the world. U.S. is one of those areas where we are -- in the end, we're a net exporter of goods out of the United States because we have a stronger footprint here. 
And that's also true in much of the portfolio that we serve semiconductor fabrication with. We build that out close to -- the end users close to the customers. So we have significant resources in Asia, for example. We also supply a significant portion of it from capacity in the U.S. and even some capacity in Europe. So it is -- I think we're well positioned if we see that shift, and that's -- it's going to take time to play out. And as has been the case for us throughout history, as we see market dynamics change and shift around the world, we'll invest to build up that capacity where it's needed. So we'll have time to adjust and add capacity, but we start in a good place relative to that market segment."

So that is why that's one of the uncertainties that we have called out in the second quarter and the total year that we got to navigate through this. And hopefully, as we get through the second quarter, we'll be in a better state to see where we are for the year. So hopefully, that answers your question. 
Since you're talking about the second quarter and my memory failed me earlier, sorry. So Steve's question earlier also on -- if you're looking at Q1 versus Q2, just another point is FX, which is $0.13 benefit in Q1. For the year, we still see that to be $0.15. Again, we'll see where currencies move as the world plays itself out. And then from a tax rate perspective, we were at 16.4% for the first quarter, and our plan is 20% to 21% for the year.

Similarly, at the beginning of the year, we reset our comp, so that's a headwind. We also had a property sale in fourth quarter of last year of approximately $50 million of gain. That's a nonrepeat. So all of those are one-time headwinds coming into the year that we talked about. We also talked that we will be increasing our investments in growth, productivity and sustainability in '21 as we see some of the trends playing out that can help us continue to grow in the longer term. And so that's the second headwind. 
And then the third, as has come through that I've talked about, it's the raw material and logistics cost increase, partially offset by the price increases that we are trying to do, increase our yield and then managing all the other costs that we have, whether it's legal costs as PFAS and combat arms and some of those proceedings proceed as well as any other investments that we want to make as we keep seeing growth opportunities in the long term.

The first quarter was strong for 3M, with broad-based organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas. Our team executed well and posted record sales, robust cash flow and expanded margins, along with a double-digit increase in earnings per share. We saw encouraging improvement in many of our end markets, while others remained well below pre-pandemic levels. We also faced and addressed ongoing supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19, exacerbated by improving macroeconomic trends and winter storm Uri, all of which are increasing the cost of doing business. 
I am proud of the way 3Mers have stepped up to manage and overcome these challenges, keeping our factories running, expanding our manufacturing capacity, and driving innovation for our customers across our businesses. We have found new ways to engage with customers and create solutions no matter where we are around the world, learnings we will take forward as we come out of the pandemic. 
Looking ahead, we expect continued strengthening of the global economy, though we anticipate the recovery to be uneven as the trajectory of the pandemic, rollout of vaccines and government policies evolve in different stages around the world. We are confident in our business as we navigate COVID-19 uncertainty. And with 1 quarter behind us, we are maintaining our full year guidance for organic growth, earnings per share and cash flow. 
Our team remains focused on driving growth, improving operational performance and delivering for our customers and shareholders. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Company-wide, total sales increased to $8.9 billion, with organic growth of 8% and earnings of $2.77 per share, up 27% year-on-year on an adjusted basis. Geographically, organic growth was led by Asia Pacific, up 13%, with China up 32%. Growth in the Americas was 6%, with the United States up 7%, while EMEA grew 6%. We expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins to nearly 28%, with all business groups above 23% and increased free cash flow to $1.4 billion with a conversion rate of 86%. 
3M increased our dividend in the first quarter, marking our 63rd straight year of increases. We also continue to build 3M for the long-term and prioritize investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. While we manage end-market challenges related to COVID-19, we are investing to capitalize on global growth opportunities in health care, electronics, home improvement, personal safety, and other favorable market trends. This includes our priority growth platforms, which grew 10% in the quarter as we apply science to advance growing areas like automotive electrification, and  biopharma filtration. The fundamental strengths of 3M, our unique technology platforms, advanced manufacturing, global capabilities and leading brands position us well to win in these markets into the future. 
We are accelerating digital strategies across 3M and expanding our use of data and data analytics to better serve our customers and improve performance. For example, we are using new cloud-based technologies to provide better insights into our global workflows from raw material purchase through product delivery, which is helping us navigate the current supply chain challenges. We are stepping up our leadership in sustainability with significant new commitments that will bend the curve on carbon emissions, water use and improving water quality. 
In a similar way, we are implementing a long-term plan to advance equity and inclusion as we launch new scholarship programs and a new goal to create 5 million opportunities in STEM education, with initial efforts focused here in the twin cities. At the same time, 3M continues to help lead the fight against COVID-19, with 630 million respirators distributed in the first quarter. 
We are also providing our expertise as we engage with the Biden administration and governments around the world on how to better prepare for future pandemics. Overall, I am pleased with our performance in the first quarter as we remain focused on driving growth, improving productivity and advancing sustainability. 
To provide additional insight on that last point, sustainability, I will now turn it over to 3M's Chief Technology Officer, John Banovetz. John?"

I'm proud to lead 3M's Research and Development and Sustainability teams. Every day, we bring our innovation to bear on tough challenges, which includes applying 3M science to create a more efficient company and a more sustainable world. As you may have seen, in February, we announced expanded sustainability goals. We plan to commit approximately $1 billion over the next 20 years through both capital and operating investments to make our operations more efficient and effective with a focus on air, water and waste. 
First, we are committing to become carbon-neutral across our global operations. We expect to rapidly bend our curve of emissions with 2019 as our baseline and aggressive milestones along the way: a 50% reduction by 2030, 80% by 2040 and 100% by 2050. 
Second, 3M plans to reduce water use at our facilities by 25% over the next decade, targeting a 10% reduction by 2022 and 20% reduction by 2025. Third, at our largest locations, we are taking action and installing advanced filtration technology that will return even higher quality water to the environment after its use in our operations. These goals are driven by science and a clearly defined path. We have identified the investments and technologies that will enable our success from thermal oxidizers to reverse osmosis, and work is already underway. 
At 3M's facility in Antwerp, for example, we have expanded our thermal oxidizer system and reduced our carbon emissions by 1 million tons per year. Overall, our thermal oxidizers reduce our carbon footprint by more than 90% when fully installed. And in Decatur, Alabama, we have implemented a water treatment system with granular activated carbon, also known as a GAC system, that has improved the quality of water we return to the environment by 90%. We intend to add complementary technology that will further improve water quality by 2024. 
We will continue to advance new state-of-the-art technologies, including through partnerships with customers, governments, communities and others to further accelerate our progress. Our actions demonstrate 3M's commitment to continuous improvement and our ongoing work to advance our environmental stewardship. Over the last 2 decades, 3M has reduced our emissions by 70%, while doubling revenues. 
Our headquarters is fully powered by renewable electricity and 40% of 3M's global electricity use is now renewable, on our way to 100%. Every new 3M product includes a sustainability value commitment. And over the last 5 years, our innovations have helped customers avoid 75 million tons of emissions. And just last week, we committed to reduce our use of new plastic made from petroleum, also known as virgin fossil-based plastic, by 125 million pounds by 2025 through new packaging and innovative product design in our Consumer business. 
We recognize the urgency of the world's climate and environmental challenges and are focused on making a difference both today and in future generations. I encourage you to read our Annual Sustainability Report to be released in early May for more details on our progress and priorities.

289194,708649137,2259563,"3M Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","3M Company","Executives","Thank you, John, and I wish you all a very good morning. Company-wide first quarter sales were $8.9 billion, up 9.6% year-on-year or an increase of 8% on an organic basis. Sales growth, combined with operating rigor and disciplined cost management, drove",2022,"Thank you, John, and I wish you all a very good morning. Company-wide first quarter sales were $8.9 billion, up 9.6% year-on-year or an increase of 8% on an organic basis. Sales growth, combined with operating rigor and disciplined cost management, drove adjusted operating income of $2 billion, up 19%, with adjusted operating margins of 22.5%, up 170 basis points year-on-year. First quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings per share were $2.77, up 27% compared to last year's adjusted results. 
On this slide, you can see the components that impacted both margins and earnings per share. Organic volume growth, along with our ongoing cost management and productivity efforts, were the biggest contributors to first quarter operating margins and earnings, adding 150 basis points to margins and $0.34 to earnings per share year-on-year. 
Turning to selling prices and raw materials. As Mike mentioned, we experienced increasing costs, particularly for raw materials and logistics due to the impacts from the strengthening end markets, ongoing COVID pandemic, along with winter storm Uri. As a result, first quarter net selling price and raw materials performance reduced both operating margins and earnings per share by 20 basis points and $0.01, respectively. 
In our view, we expect global supply chain dynamics to remain fluid and for raw material and logistics headwinds to persist. Therefore, we now anticipate a full year raw materials and logistics headwind of $0.30 to $0.50 per share versus a prior expectation of flat to a $0.10 headwind at the start of the year. 
Looking at the second quarter, we currently anticipate a net selling price and raw materials headwinds to operating margins in the range of 75 to 125 basis points. We are taking multiple actions to address these increased headwinds, including selling price increases, global sourcing efforts, improving yields in our factories and ongoing demand planning, given the dynamic environment. We expect these actions will gain traction as we move through the year, particularly in the second half. 
Moving to divestiture impacts. The lost income from the drug delivery divestiture in May of last year was neutral to margins, however, was a $0.03 headwind year-on-year to earnings. Foreign currency, net of hedging impacts, added 40 basis points to margins and $0.13 to earnings per share as the U.S. dollar weakened against most major currencies year-on-year. We continue to expect foreign exchange to be an earnings benefit of $0.15 per share for the full year. 
Three other nonoperating items impacted our year-on-year earnings per share performance. First, our continued strong cash flow and liquidity position give us the opportunity in Q1 to redeem an additional $450 million of debt early that was due to mature in 2022. As a result, we incurred higher net interest expense of approximately $0.02 per share versus Q1 last year. This impact was more than offset by year-on-year nonoperating pension benefit of $0.05 per share. Combined, these items resulted in lower net nonoperating expense of $0.03 per share versus last year's first quarter. 
Secondly, a lower tax rate versus last year provided a $0.14 benefit to earnings per share. The lower tax rate was primarily a function of non-repeating favorable adjustments related to U.S. tax treatment of international income, along with regional income mix and equity-based compensation. Our full year 2021 tax rate expectations remained unchanged in the range of 20% to 21%. Finally, average diluted shares were up 1% year-on-year, which reduced per share earnings by $0.02. 
Please turn to Slide 8 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. We delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with first quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.4 billion, up 49% year-on-year with conversion of 86%. Cash flows in the quarter were primarily driven by robust growth in cash flow from operations, along with our ongoing daily management of working capital. First quarter capital expenditures were $310 million. For the full year, we continue to expect CapEx to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. 
During the quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $858 million and share repurchases of $231 million. Our strong cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to strengthen our capital structure. 
We ended the quarter with $13 billion in net debt, a reduction of nearly $5 billion since the end of Q1 last year. As a result, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has declined significantly from 2.2 a year ago to 1.4 at the end of Q1. Our net debt position, along with our strong cash flow generation capability, continues to provide us financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. 
Please turn to Slide 9, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q1. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 10.3% year-on-year in the first quarter. This result includes a 6.4 percentage point benefit from pandemic-related respirator demand. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate strong pandemic-related respirator mass demand. However, the year-on-year contribution to sales growth will decline as we lap last year's quarterly comparisons. 
Overall, general industrial manufacturing activity continued to improve during Q1, resulting in a pickup in growth across the portfolio. 
Personal safety posted double-digit organic growth year-on-year, driven by ongoing demand for respirators. Industrial adhesives and tapes grew low double digits, primarily due to strong demand across industrial and electronics end markets. The continued strength in the residential housing market drove good performance in our roofing's granules business, which was up double digits organically versus Q1 of last year. 
Turning to the rest of the Safety and Industrial businesses. Automotive aftermarket grew high single digits organically. The electrical markets business was up mid-single digits and abrasives grew low single digits. While our closure and masking business declined year-on-year. 
Safety and Industrial's first quarter segment operating margins were 24.4%, up 70 basis points year-on-year. Operating margins were driven by leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by increase in raw materials, logistics and legal costs. 
Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which delivered a strong start to the year with first quarter organic sales growth of 9.8% despite the well-known semiconductor supply chain constraints. Our electronics-related business was up high teens organically with continued strength in semiconductor, factory automation and data centers, along with strong demand for consumer electronic devices, namely tablets and TVs. Our auto OEM business was up 21% year-on-year compared to the 14% increase in global car and light truck builds. 
Looking ahead, we continue to monitor the global semiconductor supply chain and its potential impact on the electronics and automotive industries. 
Turning to advanced materials, which increased mid-single digits, largely as a result of the year-on-year increase in automotive builds. And finally, our transportation safety business was flat year-on-year, while commercial solutions declined slightly. 
Transportation and Electronics first quarter operating margins were 23.3%, up 260 basis points year-on-year, benefiting from strong leverage on sales growth and prior year COVID-related asset write-downs, which were partially offset by increases in raw materials and logistics costs. 
Turning to our Health Care business. Health care providers continue to be challenged from the ebbs and flows of COVID-19 cases as elective procedure volumes still remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, we continue to experience strong pandemic-related demand for respirators to protect frontline health care workers, which more than offset the headwinds from the decline in elective procedure volumes. As a result, our Health Care business delivered first quarter organic sales growth of 9.3% versus last year. 
The Medical Solutions business grew high single digits, driven by continued strong respirator demand. Excluding respirators, organic growth in this business was down low single digits due to the ongoing year-on-year impact of lower procedure volumes. Organic sales for our oral care business increased double digits year-on-year. This result is primarily due to last year's COVID-related comp as dental offices started closing their doors during Q1 last year. 
The separation and purification business increased low teens year-on-year. This business continues to experience solid demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutics development and manufacturing, along with improving demand trends for water filtration solutions. Health information systems returned to positive organic growth, up mid-single digits, while food safety declined mid-single digits organically versus last year's strong comparison. 
Health Care's first quarter operating margins were 22.7%, up 120 basis points year-on-year. First quarter margins were driven by leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by supply chain disruptions and increasing raw materials and logistics costs. 
Lastly, first quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was 7.8% year-on-year, with strength across most retail channels led by e-commerce. Organic sales growth continued to be led by a home improvement business, up double digits organically, driven by strong demand for command adhesives, filtrate air quality solutions and ScotchBlue Painters Tape. 
Stationery and office returned to positive organic growth in Q1, up mid-single digits with ongoing strength in consumer demand for packaging and shipping products. This business also delivered improved growth in Scotch brand office tapes as we start to lap the COVID-related impacts from remote work and school trends. And finally, our home care business was up low single digits organically versus last year's strong comparison. 
Consumer's operating margins were 21.1% or similar to last year as leverage on sales growth was offset by increasing cost for raw materials, logistics, outsourced hard goods manufacturing and increased investments in advertising and merchandising. 
Please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion of our full year 2021 guidance. As you can see from our Q1 results, we are off to a good start to the year. Looking ahead, as Mike mentioned, we expect continued strengthening of the global economy, along with increasing opportunities in end markets with favorable trends. However, we foresee that the improvement will remain fluid and uneven as we go through 2021, given the ongoing impact of the pandemic. 
As a result, we anticipate a number of items that will need to be navigated as we go through the year. For example, starting with the evolving impacts from COVID, including respirator demand, health care elective procedures, supply chains, shutdowns and government response. Next, the continued constrained supply of semiconductor chips and related impacts to consumer electronics and automotive OEM production. In addition, the expected increase in cost for raw materials and logistics and in some cases, constrained availability. 
And finally, we expect to increase investments through the year in growth, productivity and sustainability along with managing ongoing legal costs as PFAS and other legal proceedings progress. Thus, taking these items into account, along it with being early in the year, we think it's prudent to maintain our full year guidance of 3% to 6% for organic growth, earnings per share of $9.20 to $9.70 and free cash flow conversion of 95% to 105%. 
Turning to the second quarter, let me highlight a few items of note. First, we expect continued strong execution by the 3M team in the face of a very fluid and uncertain environment. As I mentioned during my remarks, we have increased the expected headwind from raw materials and logistics costs for the full year. We are taking several actions, including increasing selling prices to address these headwinds as we go through the year. These actions will take a little time to gain traction. Therefore, we anticipate a second quarter year-on-year operating margin headwind of 75 to 125 basis points from selling prices net of higher raw materials and logistics costs. 
And finally, we expect a pretax restructuring charge in the range of $25 million to $50 million as we continue our actions related to our December 2020 announcement. 
To wrap up, we are off to a good start for the year delivering broad-based growth, strong operational execution and robust cash flows. We are prioritizing capital to our greatest opportunities for growth, productivity and sustainability while focused on delivering for our customers, improving operating rigor and enhancing daily management. 
With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

Transportation and Electronics are strong end markets for us in Q1. I wouldn't say that we see anything unusual there. It's what comes with a normal pickup in the marketplace. When you look at it, a good measure for us is what's happening with channel inventories. And I would say we seem very much in line with what you have written about in your reports that we see the changes due to growth trends. 
Overall, inventory in our industrial channels remains still relatively low. Transportation and Electronics, with the supply chain impacts from the semiconductor shortage, we're seeing some challenges there. And it's just the responding with that -- with the disruption from the semiconductor shortage. Health Care is pretty steady, reacting to the trend still, electric procedures well below pre-pandemic level. So that's impacting there. And in Consumer, it's a mixed case. We have high demand and home improvements, so we're seeing lower levels there. So I would say we -- you see a little lower levels when you see the pickup, but it's responding to the marketplace. 
Otherwise, I would say the trends in the quarter were -- the ordering trends were pretty much in line with what we expected, a little better than we expected in March, which was really reflected in our broad-based growth. But otherwise, nothing unusual."

And so we would expect that growth to continue on those platforms as we continue to find customer solutions in those areas. 
Second comments kind of around the vitality of the NPVI or the part of it. We've talked about NPVI in the past, and that's definitely an important metric for 3M, without a question, but it's also a secondary metric for us. The primary, obviously, being our growth in our profitability for that. 
I'd say, over the last few years, our NPVI and things have trended to be about in the mid-20s, if you take an average over the last 5 years or so, which is, I think roughly a pretty good guide for 3M overall. And obviously, COVID had some of that impact on trends here in the near-term as well as we've gone forward. 
And then kind of the, as you said, the commoditization or the churn, I personally don't think a whole lot about that. I think about, are we aligned with our customers? Are we solving customer needs? Are our R&D resources geared toward growth and solving those issues for our customers and making sure that we can deliver our technologies and our solutions to our customers in order to be able to grow and sustain profitable margin and ROIC."

As regards legal fees, and you can see this more -- or legal costs, you can see this more as you -- as we file our Q this morning. But there are a couple of things. You'll see the PFAS reserves are up around $50 million between the end of fourth quarter to this quarter. And then the mass respirator accrual is up approximately $20 million. To predict what exactly is going to be in the second half of the year is quite tough. But what we do see is as we prepare for some of these trials, example, the combat arms trial that's on in Florida right now with the MDL as well as some of the other cases that will start picking up in PFAS, we expect that our legal fees -- or legal cost to prepare for these trials will go up during the second half of this year."

And for the second quarter, we are still monitoring quite a few things. One, of course, Mike just mentioned about what happens with the stationery, how does that return to work come in. The return to work impacts not just the stationery business, but it impacts our graphics business, it impacts our signage business and what happens there and what people spend, I think, is going to be important to watch. 
The second piece is as pandemic is still playing out in parts of the world, elective procedures continue to be below pre-pandemic level. So we'll see how that plays out. The well-known semiconductor chip shortage, how it impacts auto, how it impacts consumer electronics is another piece. 
And then when you think about supply chain disruption, the supply chain disruption, one is, of course, the raw material costs and logistics costs that I've talked about quite a bit. The other one, of course, is product availability and making sure that there is product available from our suppliers to continue to keep us manufacturing. Now I'll tell you this that our supply chain team has done an amazing job keeping the factories running, making sure we are delivering to our customers, thanks to the relationship they have with the suppliers, and we appreciate all the work the suppliers have also done to partner with us to minimize disruption as much as possible. 
We are also raising prices, but it's going to take a little bit of time. The inflation has come in faster. So you're going to see 75 to 125 basis points of headwind, which is the net of price versus inflation and logistics. As I also mentioned that we're going to do restructuring, which was announced in Q4 of 2020, we had told you it's somewhere between $250 million to $300 million charge for the year. As of first quarter, we are at $150 million. So we got approximately $100 million to $150 million to go for the remaining of the year. 
The second quarter is going to see $25 million to $50 million of restructuring charge, the balance will come in 3Q and 4Q. And then if this economy continues to go the way it is, outlook is that indirect costs, travel costs, some of the legal costs that we talked about will keep going up. Any other onetime headwinds will also go up as regards compensation. And then our goal is, as Mike has mentioned, we have tremendous areas that we can invest in. And our goal is for the long run, we want to keep investing in growth, productivity and sustainability. 
And put all that into play, that's why we felt it prudent to maintain guidance. And also to answer your question, it's hard to follow normal seasonality trends with all these other things in play."

As you know, volume is the biggest piece that drives margin leverage for 3M. You should assume the normal 30% to 40% margin leverage that you would get. The amount of volume is going to depend on a lot of the uncertainties that I've talked about, whether it's elective procedures, whether it is semiconductor, chip availability for auto and consumer, whether it is the strength in stationery remains, whether our oil and gas -- whether the oil and gas industry picks up. So a lot of long term, I would say, end markets growing, we'll have to figure out what happens in the second quarter with all of these from an end market perspective. 
Similarly, on supply chain disruption, there are 2 pieces. One is, of course, the inflation that we've told you about, which will cost 75 to 125 basis points of headwind between price and inflation and the raw material and logistics costs as well as making sure that we have all the product availability that we have.

And May, as we look at product availability, making sure that our suppliers continue to be able to provide all the goods over the quarter is what something we're working on. Again, it's too early to say because it's a very dynamic situation that changes every day. And again, the relationship we have with our suppliers helps us get the product as much as we can, but they are also constrained right now with the overall supply chain situation in the world. 
The other headwind is $25 million to $50 million of restructuring. So this is still a part of the overall restructuring program we announced in Q4. We are done up to $150 million in Q1. We're going to take another $25 million to $50 million in Q2, and the balance will come in Q3 and Q4. Indirect costs. So as the economies are starting to open up, you are going to see hopefully, ad merch and travel start to go up. So that's a headwind to Q1. And then our increase, as we are starting to see the economy starting to pick up, our investments in growth productivity and sustainability will continue to increase.

We saw continue to see strong demand. That's 630 million respirators delivered in Q1. And still in the quarter, 90% going to health care workers and I would say, first responders and increasingly essential industries. The demand as we move forward, it's going to depend on a few factors. The first is what's going to be the demand in health care. And that's going to depend on how the pandemic plays out. And I would say how governments respond to dynamics in the pandemic. And there's been changing in protocol of use of respirators, for example, is one of those dynamics. 
As Monish said, this is one of the areas where we're working through the uncertainties as there's -- that demand, there's also governments, and we're working with governments around the world on stockpile strategies and continue to supply into those. 
And then there is consumer demand and increasing demand in industrial as economies recover. So we see some shifting as we go forward over time from the high priority, more than 90% into health care, shifting more into industrial and consumer. And then the demand overall, how much is it going to be relative to the impact on the overall enterprise relative to SIBG, that's going to depend on how each of those play out.

Tablets and TVs really driving a lot of that. So it's how are these trends going to play out through the year, and it still reflects, I would say, a wider range of outcomes.

I think Andy touched a little bit on it, but it seems that we have plenty of visibility on semiconductor CapEx going up in the U.S. over the next several years. Given that semi capacity on the margin over the past decade has been added outside of North America, do you need to make any adjustments to your manufacturing footprint in North America to sort of play this growth? Or is it just nature of your process and fungible capacity and just applies better overall capacity utilization in North America given the assets you already have in place?"

Andrew, as you know, we -- our strategy is to be close to customers, invest in capacity to meet the demands regionally around the world. And that's true broadly across the enterprise. There are some key product and market segments where we have more of a critical center in key areas of the world. U.S. is one of those areas where we are -- in the end, we're a net exporter of goods out of the United States because we have a stronger footprint here. 
And that's also true in much of the portfolio that we serve semiconductor fabrication with. We build that out close to -- the end users close to the customers. So we have significant resources in Asia, for example. We also supply a significant portion of it from capacity in the U.S. and even some capacity in Europe. So it is -- I think we're well positioned if we see that shift, and that's -- it's going to take time to play out. And as has been the case for us throughout history, as we see market dynamics change and shift around the world, we'll invest to build up that capacity where it's needed. So we'll have time to adjust and add capacity, but we start in a good place relative to that market segment."

So that is why that's one of the uncertainties that we have called out in the second quarter and the total year that we got to navigate through this. And hopefully, as we get through the second quarter, we'll be in a better state to see where we are for the year. So hopefully, that answers your question. 
Since you're talking about the second quarter and my memory failed me earlier, sorry. So Steve's question earlier also on -- if you're looking at Q1 versus Q2, just another point is FX, which is $0.13 benefit in Q1. For the year, we still see that to be $0.15. Again, we'll see where currencies move as the world plays itself out. And then from a tax rate perspective, we were at 16.4% for the first quarter, and our plan is 20% to 21% for the year.

One is when we gave you the guide at the beginning of the year, we talked about the snapback of indirect costs that should, hopefully, in 2021, as people start traveling, as we start investing from an ad merch perspective would go up on a year over. 
Similarly, at the beginning of the year, we reset our comp, so that's a headwind. We also had a property sale in fourth quarter of last year of approximately $50 million of gain. That's a nonrepeat. So all of those are one-time headwinds coming into the year that we talked about. We also talked that we will be increasing our investments in growth, productivity and sustainability in '21 as we see some of the trends playing out that can help us continue to grow in the longer term. And so that's the second headwind. 
And then the third, as has come through that I've talked about, it's the raw material and logistics cost increase, partially offset by the price increases that we are trying to do, increase our yield and then managing all the other costs that we have, whether it's legal costs as PFAS and combat arms and some of those proceedings proceed as well as any other investments that we want to make as we keep seeing growth opportunities in the long term. That's why I would say 30% to 40% is the normal, you should see in the long term, but 2021 is just a little odd for these reasons."

3M's performance in the second quarter was strong as we posted organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas. Our team executed well and delivered increased earnings, expanded margins and robust cash flow. From a macro perspective, the global economy continues to improve, though uncertainty remains due to COVID-19 and heightened concern over the increase in Delta variant cases. We saw ongoing strength in many end markets, including home improvement, oral care and general industrial, along with a pickup in health care electric procedures. We continue to work to mitigate ongoing inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges as well as end market dynamics such as the semiconductor shortage impacting automotive build rates and electronics. We are also beginning to see a decline in pandemic-related demand for disposable respirators, which I will discuss on the next slide. 
Looking forward, we will stay focused on investing in emerging growth opportunities, improving productivity and advancing sustainability. We are confident in our ability to continue executing well in the face of COVID-19 uncertainties and are raising our full year guidance for organic growth to 6% to 9%, and earnings per share to $9.70 to $10.10. 
Please turn to Slide 5. In the second quarter, we delivered total sales of $8.9 billion. We posted organic growth of 21% versus a 13% decline in last year's second quarter, along with earnings of $2.59 per share. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins to over 27% and increased adjusted free cash flow to $1.6 billion with a conversion rate of 103%. Strong cash flow allowed us to further strengthen our balance sheet while returning $1.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
I am proud of our team's execution in a dynamic environment. We are finding new ways to innovate for customers and improve our operational performance. In addition to our strong day-to-day execution, we are investing to capitalize on favorable market trends and serve emerging customer needs. I want to share a few impactful examples. 
In Health Care, our innovative PREVENA therapy incision management system is the first and only medical device indicated by the U.S. FDA to help reduce surgical site infections in high-risk patients, helping lower the costly financial burden of complications, delivering on both improved clinical outcomes and cost savings for the health care system. 
In automotive electrification, we are building on 3M's long history in consumer electronics and now expanding our solutions for the future of transportation, including new display technologies for both electric and internal combustion engines, helping us drive above-market growth in our automotive business. 
In home improvement, we are building out a suite of innovations to help consumers personalize their homes, including our fast-growing line of command damage-free hanging solutions, $500 million franchise that leverages our world-class adhesive platform with even greater opportunities ahead. We have increased opportunities across our businesses to apply 3M science and drive long-term growth, and we will continue to invest and win in those areas. 
As you all have seen, the ongoing impact of COVID-19 is highly variable across geographies. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have increased our annual respirator production fourfold to $2.5 billion by activating idle surge capacity and building additional lines, while shifting 90% of distribution into health care to protect nurses, doctors and first responders. 
One of our strengths is to quickly adapt to changing marketplace needs. Global demand reached its peak in Q1 of this year, which included stockpiling from governments and hospitals. We are now seeing a deceleration in overall health care demand and our adjusting production, increasing supply to industrial and consumer channels while continuing to prioritize health care workers in the geographies seeing increased COVID-19 cases and elevated hospitalization rates. As we do this, we are reducing overall output to meet end-market trends. Like we have in the past, we are prepared to rapidly increase production in response to COVID-19-related needs or future emergencies when needed. 
As I reflect on the first half, I am pleased with our performance. We delivered strong sales and margin growth, along with good cash flow while building for the future and advancing sustainability with significant new carbon, water and plastic commitments. 
In the second half, in addition to investing in growth, productivity and sustainability, we also must navigate ongoing COVID-19 impacts and continue taking actions to address inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. We will do this by driving an unrelenting focus on operational performance, which includes improving service, quality, operating costs and cash generation. 
I would like to thank 3Mers for your commitment and resilience as we bring together people, ideas and science to help transform businesses, solve customer challenges, and improve lives around the world. That wraps up my opening comments, and I'll turn it over to Monish to cover more details on the quarter and our updated guidance. Monish?"

Please turn to Slide 6. Company-wide, second quarter sales were $8.9 billion, up 25% year-on-year or an increase of 21% on an organic basis. Sales growth, combined with operating rigor and disciplined cost management, drove adjusted operating income of $2 billion, up 40%, with adjusted operating margins of 22%, up 240 basis points year-on-year. 
Second quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings per share were $2.59, up 44% compared to last year's adjusted results. On this slide, you can see the components that impacted both operating margins and earnings per share as compared to Q2 last year. A strong year-on-year organic volume growth, along with ongoing productivity, restructuring efforts and other items, added 4.1 percentage points to operating margins and $0.89 to earnings per share year-on-year. 
Included in this margin and earnings benefit were a few items of note. First, during the quarter, the Brazilian Supreme Court issued a ruling that clarified the calculation of Brazil's federal sales-based social tax, essentially lowering the social tax that 3M should have paid in prior years. This favorable ruling added $91 million to operating income of 1 percentage points to operating margins and $0.12 to earnings per share. 
Next, as you will see later today in our 10-Q, we increased our other environmental liability by nearly $60 million and our respiratory liabilities by approximately $20 million as part of our regular review. In addition, we also incurred a year-on-year increase in ongoing legal defense costs. We are currently scheduled to begin a PFAS-related trial in Michigan in October, along with the next step in the combat arms year plug multi-district litigation, with one trial in September and one in October. 
And finally, during the second quarter, we incurred a pretax restructuring charge of approximately $40 million as part of the program we announced in Q4 of last year. 
Second quarter net selling price and raw materials performance reduced both operating margins and earnings per share by 140 basis points and $0.17, respectively. This headwind was larger than forecasted as we experienced broad-based cost increases for chemicals, resins, outsourced manufacturing and logistics as the quarter progressed. As a result of these increasing cost trends, we now forecast a full year raw materials and logistics cost headwind in the range of $0.65 to $0.80 per share versus a prior expectation of $0.30 to $0.50. 
As we have discussed, we have been and are taking multiple actions including increasing selling prices to address these cost headwinds. As a result, we expect continued improvement in our selling price performance in the second half of the year. However, given the pace of cost increases, we currently expect a third quarter net selling price and raw materials headwind to margins in the range of 50 to 100 basis points, which we anticipate will turn to a net benefit in the fourth quarter as our selling price and other actions start catching up to the increased costs. 
Moving to divestiture impacts. The lost income from the sale of drug delivery in May of last year was a headwind of 10 basis points to operating margins and $0.02 to earnings per share. Foreign currency, net of hedging impacts, reduced margins 20 basis points while benefiting earnings by $0.08 per share. Finally, 3 nonoperating items combined had a net neutral impact to earnings per share year-on-year. This result included a $0.06 earnings benefit from lower other expenses, that was offset by higher tax rate and diluted share count, which were each a headwind of $0.03 per share versus last year. 
Please turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. We delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with second quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.6 billion, up 2% year-on-year, along with conversion of 103%. Our year-on-year free cash flow performance was driven by strong double-digit growth in sales and income, which was mostly offset by a timing of an income tax payment of approximately $400 million in last year's Q3, which is traditionally paid in Q2. 
Through the first half of the year, we increased adjusted free cash flow to $3 billion versus $2.5 billion last year. Second quarter capital expenditures were $394 million and approximately $700 million year-to-date. For the full year, we are currently tracking to the low end of our expected CapEx range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, given vendor constraints and the pace of capital projects. 
During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $858 million and share repurchases of $503 million. Year-to-date, we have returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our strong cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to strengthen our capital structure. 
We ended the quarter with $12.7 billion in net debt, a reduction of $3.5 billion since the end of Q2 last year. As a result, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has declined from 1.9 a year ago to 1.3 at the end of Q2. Our net debt position, along with our strong cash flow generation capability, continues to provide us financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. 
Please turn to Slide 8, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q2. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 18% year-on-year in the second quarter, driven by improving industrial manufacturing activity and prior pandemic impacts. 
First, starting with our personal safety business, we posted double-digit organic growth in our head, face, gearing and fall protection solutions as demand in general industrial and construction end markets remains strong. However, this growth was more than offset by a decline in our overall respiratory portfolio due to last year's strong COVID-related demand resulting in an organic sales decline of low single digits for our personal safety business. 
Within our respiratory portfolio, second quarter disposable respirator sales increased 3% year-on-year but declined 11% sequentially as COVID-related hospitalizations declined. Looking ahead, we anticipate continued deceleration in disposable respirator demand through the balance of this year and into 2022. 
Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Organic growth was broad-based, led by double-digit increases in automotive aftermarket, roofing granules, abrasives, adhesives and tapes and electrical markets. Safety and Industrial's second quarter operating income was $718 million, up 15% versus last year. Operating margins were 22.1%, down 130 basis points year-on-year as leverage on sales growth was more than offset by increases in raw materials, logistics and ongoing legal costs. 
Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which grew 24% organically despite sustained challenges from semiconductor supply chain constraints. Organic growth was led by our auto OEM business, up 76% year-on-year compared to a 49% increase in global car and light truck builds. This outperformance was due to several factors. First, the regional mix of year-on-year growth in car and light truck builds were in regions where we have high dollar content per vehicle. Second, a year-on-year increase in sell-in of 3M products versus the change in build rate. Lastly, we continue to apply 3M innovation to vehicles, gaining penetration onto new platforms. 
Our electronics-related business was up double digits organically, with continued strength in semiconductor, factory automation and data centers, along with consumer electronic devices, namely tablets and TVs. Looking ahead, we continue to monitor the global semiconductor supply chain and its potential impact on the electronics and automotive industries. 
Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced materials, commercial solutions and transportation safety each grew double digits year-on-year. Second quarter operating income was $546 million, up over 50% year-on-year. Operating margins were 22%, up 340 basis points year-on-year driven by strong leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by increases in raw materials and logistic costs. 
Turning to our Health Care business, which delivered second quarter organic sales growth of 23%. Organic growth was driven by continued year-on-year and sequential improvements in health care electric procedure volumes as COVID-related hospitalizations decline. Our Medical Solutions business grew mid-teens organically or up approximately 20%, excluding the decline in disposable respirator demand. I am pleased with the performance of Acelity, which grew nearly 20% organically in the quarter as it helps us build on our leadership in Advanced Wound Care. 
Sales in our Oral Care business more than doubled from a year ago as patient visits have nearly returned to pre-COVID levels. The separation and purification business increased 10% year-on-year due to ongoing demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccine and therapeutics, along with improving demand for water filtration solutions. Health Information Systems grew high single digits, driven by strong growth in clinician solutions. And finally, food safety increased double digits organically as food safety activity returns, along with continued strong growth from new product introduction. 
Health Care's second quarter operating income was $576 million, up over 90% year-on-year. Operating margins were 25.3%, up 880 basis points. Second quarter margins were driven by leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by increasing raw materials and logistics costs, along with increased investments in growth. Lastly, second quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was 18% year-on-year with strong sell-in and sell-out trends across most retail channels. 
Our home improvement business continues to perform well, up high teens organically on top of a strong comparison from a year ago. This business continued to experience strong demand in many of our category-leading franchises, particularly command, filtrate and Meguiar's. 
Stationery and office grew strong double digits organically in Q2 as this business laps last year's COVID-related comparisons. We continue to see strength in consumer demand for scotch branded packaging and shipping products, along with improved sell-in trends in Post-it Solutions and Scotch branded home and office tapes 
as retailers prepare for back-to-school and return to work please. Our Home Care business was up low single digits organically versus last year's strong COVID-driven comparison. And finally, our Consumer health and safety business was up double digits as we lap COVID-related impacts from a year ago, along with improved supply of safety products for our retail customers. 
Consumer's operating income was $311 million, up 12% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21%, down 160 basis points as increased costs for raw materials, logistics and outsourced hard goods manufacturing, along with investments in advertising and merchandising more than offset leverage from sales growth. 
Please turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of our full year 2021 guidance. While uncertainty remains, we expect global economic and end market growth to remain strong. However, continue to be fluid as the world wrestles with ongoing COVID-related impacts that we all see and monitor. Therefore, there are a number of items that will need to be navigated as we go through the second half of the year. 
For example, we anticipate continued sequential improvement in health care elective procedure volumes. Also, we expect ongoing strength in the home improvement market and currently anticipate students returning to classrooms and more people returning to the workplace. Next, we remain focused on driving innovation and penetration with our global auto OEM and electronics customers. These 2 end markets continue to converge as highlighted by the well-known constraints in semiconductor chip supply. This limited chip supply is expected to reduce year-on-year automotive and electronics production volumes in the second half. As mentioned earlier, we expect demand for disposable respirators to wane and negatively impact second half revenues by approximately $100 million to $300 million year-on-year. 
Turning to raw materials and logistics. As noted, we anticipate a year-on-year earnings headwind of $0.65 to $0.80 per share for the full year or $0.40 to $0.55 in the second half due to rising cost pressures. We are taking a number of actions, including broad-based selling price increases to help mitigate this headwind. 
And finally, the restructuring program we announced last December remains on track. As part of this program, we expect to incur a pretax charge in the range of $60 million to $110 million in the second half of this year. 
Thus, taking into account our first half performance, along with these factors, we are raising our full year guidance for both organic growth and earnings per share. Organic growth is estimated to be 6% to 9%, up from the previous range of 3% to 6%. We now anticipate earnings of $9.70 to $10.10 per share against a prior range of $9.20 to $9.70.  Also, as you can see, we now expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 90% to 100% versus a prior range of 95% to 105%. This adjustment is primarily due to ongoing challenges in global supply chains, raw materials and logistics, which are expected to persist for some time. 
Turning to the third quarter, let me highlight a few items of note. First, we currently anticipate continued improvement in health care electric procedure volumes across most parts of the world. Global smartphone shipments are expected to be down high single digits year-on-year, while global car and light truck builds, I expect to be down 3% year-on-year. Relative to disposable respirators, we anticipate a year-on-year reduction in sales of $50 million to $100 million due to continued decline in global demand. As mentioned earlier, we are anticipating a third quarter year-on-year operating margin headwind of 50 to 100 basis points from selling prices, net of higher raw materials and logistic costs. 
On the restructuring front, which I previously discussed, we expect a Q3 pretax charge in the range of $50 million to $75 million as a part of this program. And finally, we expect higher investments in growth productivity and sustainability in the quarter, along with higher legal defense costs as proceedings progress. 
To wrap up, our team has delivered a strong first half performance, including broad-based growth, good operational execution, robust cash flows and an enhanced capital structure. With that being said, there's always more we can do and will do. We continue to prioritize capital to our greatest opportunities for growth, productivity and sustainability, while remaining focused on delivering for our customers, improving operating rigor and enhancing daily management. 
I want to thank our customers and vendors for their ongoing loyalty and partnership and especially our employees for their dedication, perseverance and execution in these uncertain times. With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

I would just start with the team has done a really nice job of continuing to drive margins up while still investing in the business. The sharp increase on a year-over-year basis is driven by a lot of the volume increase that you saw Q2 of last year versus Q2 of this year. Third, I would say the volume leverage has helped, but we still got hurt by raw materials and logistics costs, and we continue to invest in the business. 
I would -- to answer your specific question on what does it look like going forward, I think it all comes down to ultimately where does volume turn out to be, as I said in my prepared remarks that disposable respirators are starting to slow down. You're seeing a Q3 impact of $50 million to $100 million on a year-over-year basis and $100 million to $300 million for the second half. Some -- many -- most of that should hit the Health Care segment. So we'll see where volume plays itself out. But secondly, I think is how much investments we keep driving as we see hospitalizations increase and elective procedures go up. So I think it's going to be a trade between that. Overall, I would say the team and I, we all believe in continuous improvement. So we're going to keep driving productivity continuing to reduce cost, investing where we think it's the right place to invest and driving efficiency in SG&A as much as we can."

Industrial, more broadly, generally improving as we go in the second half. We talked about it in the first half, we saw broad-based growth across geographies, and we expect this to continue it. The uncertainty there is COVID and the impact on any increases in cases and hospitalizations. There are certainly some areas around the world where we're seeing that. And even as we talk about the decline in respirator -- disposable respirator demand globally, we're seeing areas that we are increasing supply. And so that's going to be one of the things that can impact second half geographically across the world.

So we're expecting to see stronger price broad-based as we get into the second half and into fourth quarter, we start to see a price raw positive impact. 
And if you look at where our channel inventories today, this is something we're always asking ourselves. It's a dynamic that we are continuously measuring and assessing every region of the world. And I would say, given the dynamics in the marketplace, the snapback in the economy, the fluid and uneven market dynamics, it's difficult to know what the right level is today. We get visibility on where our sell-in and sell-out is. With that snapback in demand, it's hard to get clear visibility on levels -- appropriate levels of inventory. There are some areas, of course, that are very visible, the ongoing semiconductor chip shortages, and they're impacting production volumes, and we are -- we see our inventory in the channel aligning with that. 
We've talked quite a bit about the visibility we're putting on N95 respirators specifically. But beyond that, it's really going to depend on how demand plays out in each market to really get a view as we go through third quarter of where inventory in the channel sets."

I think, Julian, it's a great question on Safety and Industrial. So to answer your specific question first on the impact, could it be negative on a year-over-year basis? As we said, and just a reminder, in 2019, we used to have revenue approximately $600 million of disposable respirators that went up to $1.4 billion in 2020. And as I look at the second half, we told you there could be a risk of $100 million to $300 million, which is the range of where we think disposable respirator volume would come down on a year-over-year basis. And if we go to that higher end of the range, which is $300 million, yes, the answer is you could definitely see negative volumes. 
What we have been doing as a part of this as health care demand has waned due to lower hospitalizations due to COVID and increase in electives is we have been moving production out from the hospital channel to different parts, which is industrial and governments, which we are actively doing. The other piece of Safety and Industrial is, as I mentioned in Q2, we have seen growth in quite a few other segments of Safety and Industrial, whether it's in our respiratory portfolio with our safety portfolio, with head and face masks, whether you've seen us increase in our abrasive business, in our adhesives business, our roofing granules. So all the other segments, automotive aftermarket, have seen increase. And depending on how the economy plays itself out, and as long as industrial activity continues, you should see continued growth in those areas. And our current assumption is that long term, those markets will come back. I think it's going to be a little fluid in the second half, depending on how COVID plays itself out. 
To answer your second question on margin, you're right, as we have seen in 2019 versus '20, we did get benefited a lot by the volume leverage that we got across Safety and Industrial. So ultimately, where volume lands in the second half will have an impact on where margins ultimately go. We are actively working on price increases, broad-based in that segment. It's -- how much of that is offset by price and raws and logistics cost is the second offset. And the third one is the ongoing legal fees or reserves that we have taken, will be the third one. And then the last one I would say is what do we invest in growth, productivity and sustainability and especially growth, because as industrial activity goes up in '22 and '23, we're going to continue to invest in that segment. So put all that together, that's how we see where margins are going to land."

That momentum is there right now, where we are seeing sell-in trends as retailers are planning to have people -- more people return to the workplace, kids in school, but depending on how the pandemic plays out, that could have an impact. And then on Safety and Industrial, as I mentioned in the prior question, I think there's an assumption that industrial activity continues. But currently, the supply chain shortages across the world also put a lot of variability onto what that demand looks like. 
And that's why when we put all that together, we said we are prudent to call the year at 6% to 9% for the year versus the 3% to 6% that we had said earlier. But overall, I -- go ahead."

For example, I would tell you, when we first gave our guide of $0.30 to $0.50, which is now been guided to $0.65 to $0.80, I would tell you, what we have seen is a broad-based increase in all commodities, whether it is polypropylene, chemical, resins we are seeing in our outsourced manufacturing goods, not just the labor cost, but other commodities that go into that also getting passed. And then logistics cost has continued to be a pretty strong headwind. 
Where that will peak, I think, in my view, and I may be wrong here, at some point, demand and supply need to start settling itself out. There's a lot of demand, there's not enough supply based on all the V-shape recovery with the congestion in the ports, et cetera. And until that stabilizes itself out, I think we're going to continue to see inflation. We have seen where crude prices have gone up much heavier than we had thought coming into the year. Polypropylene has remained strong or heavy inflationary. Ocean rates have gone up a lot in the last 3 to 6 months. So it's really hard for us to come back and say, when does it peak and when it start coming down. 
So we've taken what we know. We have put in all the factors that we know. We've had a prediction of where we think these things could go. And we have come up with $0.65 to $0.80, which currently is our best guide of where we think inflation is going to be. But with that said, as I've mentioned, we are taking broad-based price increases everywhere to help offset the mitigation of this. We are also increasing yield. We are working with our suppliers to reduce prices, et cetera. And then in -- so third quarter, we'll see a headwind of 50 to 100 basis points price versus raw. And in the fourth quarter, our anticipation is that we should be able to get it to be flat to positive, which means price will offset the raw material inflation."

And we -- as you know, we built additional capacity as we went through 2020. By the end of the year, we were at a run rate of 2.5 billion N95 respirators on an annual basis. And so that's the capacity we come into the year. Other manufacturers build capacity as well to respond to the pandemic. And I think you see some of them idling some of their capacity as demand comes off the peak. 
And we'll begin that process as well to idle lines to be ready for the next emergency or changes in COVID-19. I mean, we can ramp up quickly. So our strategy is to be in a position to be a leader in personal safety, personal protective equipment in normal times, and that's really serving the broader industrial markets, serving consumer markets, serving health care markets, and that's our strategy for where we manufacture and the volumes. And then we have that idle capacity so we can surge in times of emergency. 
I think we're in a better position than ever before globally to be able to respond to a pandemic. And I would add, it's been good to see governments following through on their commitments to stockpile. That's something that we have a number of efforts underway around the world that we're supporting as we come through the first half of the year. So that, I think, prepares the world better for the next emergency, the next pandemic. So it's going to -- it will depend. When you look at where are we going to end up with respirator demand, we think we'll end up somewhere above where we were pre pandemic. As use and protocols are changing around the world, we'll be well aligned to serve that. Our brand will be strong. We've got a leading brand position in PPE and can -- and really take advantage of that position around the world. 
And so I think we've got the model well aligned. I think there's a surge capacity that will be available. How much will depend both on the demand that comes in any kind of future emergency. And I think we're -- like I said, we're ready for our part of that."

I -- like I highlighted for the broader business, we saw broad-based growth, double-digit growth in our Transportation and Electronics, our Safety and Industrial and our Health Care businesses. Consumer was up mid-single digits as we came through the quarter. And our growth was led by general industrial, some of the segments that are growing there, including our abrasives portfolio. Auto, OEM had strong growth and electronics. It's an important market for us. It's 10% of our total revenue. It grew over 20% in the first half. Last year, second quarter, we saw 3% growth. So China recovered, if you remember, ahead of other regions around the world. 
And when you look at the second half, comparisons start to get a little more challenging. And so we're expecting just year-over-year comps, I would say, we expect to see a little more challenge there. We still see opportunities for growth across our businesses in some of the same areas that we've highlighted on a global basis. Automotive will continue to be a focus, penetrating with the OEMs there. And we see -- even though it's our smallest business, we see significant opportunities to serve Chinese consumers through our Consumer business, especially in areas like air and water quality.

The team continues to drive operating rigor so driving productivity and efficiency across the supply chain W.e are going after price increases, and our anticipation is that in the fourth quarter, we should be able to offset the price -- the raw and logistics cost impact. 
So I would boil it down to saying what margin will come down to in the second half and what incrementals are will depend on the volume, will depend on our ability to offset the price -- the raw and logistics pressure through price increase, continued productivity and good execution by the 3M team. And then finally, our decision on how much we're going to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability, plus a lot of these indirects that start snapping back, as hopefully, people start traveling. You've seen we've been very disciplined in the first half of making sure that we didn't spend ahead of what volumes come back. But as we see volumes coming back in, you're going to see those indirect start snapping back up. And then the last one is the legal fees and continuing to do what we think is right to protect ourselves as these cases go through. So that's all the factors that will ultimately impact what the incrementals are going to be."

3M's performance in the second quarter was strong as we posted organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas. Our team executed well and delivered increased earnings, expanded margins and robust cash flow. From a macro perspective, the global economy continues to improve, though uncertainty remains due to COVID-19 and heightened concern over the increase in Delta variant cases. We saw ongoing strength in many end markets, including home improvement, oral care and general industrial, along with a pickup in health care electric procedures. We continue to work to mitigate ongoing inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges as well as end market dynamics such as the semiconductor shortage impacting automotive build rates and electronics. We are also beginning to see a decline in pandemic-related demand for disposable respirators, which I will discuss on the next slide.  
Looking forward, we will stay focused on investing in emerging growth opportunities, improving productivity and advancing sustainability. We are confident in our ability to continue executing well in the face of COVID-19 uncertainties and are raising our full year guidance for organic growth to 6% to 9%, and earnings per share to $9.70 to $10.10.  
Please turn to Slide 5. In the second quarter, we delivered total sales of $8.9 billion. We posted organic growth of 21% versus a 13% decline in last year's second quarter, along with earnings of $2.59 per share. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins to over 27% and increased adjusted free cash flow to $1.6 billion with a conversion rate of 103%. Strong cash flow allowed us to further strengthen our balance sheet while returning $1.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  
I am proud of our team's execution in a dynamic environment. We are finding new ways to innovate for customers and improve our operational performance. In addition to our strong day-to-day execution, we are investing to capitalize on favorable market trends and serve emerging customer needs. I want to share a few impactful examples.  
In Health Care, our innovative PREVENA therapy incision management system is the first and only medical device indicated by the U.S. FDA to help reduce surgical site infections in high-risk patients, helping lower the costly financial burden of complications, delivering on both improved clinical outcomes and cost savings for the health care system.  
In automotive electrification, we are building on 3M's long history in consumer electronics and now expanding our solutions for the future of transportation, including new display technologies for both electric and internal combustion engines, helping us drive above-market growth in our automotive business.  
In home improvement, we are building out a suite of innovations to help consumers personalize their homes, including our fast-growing line of command damage-free hanging solutions, $500 million franchise that leverages our world-class adhesive platform with even greater opportunities ahead. We have increased opportunities across our businesses to apply 3M science and drive long-term growth, and we will continue to invest and win in those areas.  
As you all have seen, the ongoing impact of COVID-19 is highly variable across geographies. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have increased our annual respirator production fourfold to $2.5 billion by activating idle surge capacity and building additional lines, while shifting 90% of distribution into health care to protect nurses, doctors and first responders.  
One of our strengths is to quickly adapt to changing marketplace needs. Global demand reached its peak in Q1 of this year, which included stockpiling from governments and hospitals. We are now seeing a deceleration in overall health care demand and our adjusting production, increasing supply to industrial and consumer channels while continuing to prioritize health care workers in the geographies seeing increased COVID-19 cases and elevated hospitalization rates. As we do this, we are reducing overall output to meet end-market trends. Like we have in the past, we are prepared to rapidly increase production in response to COVID-19-related needs or future emergencies when needed.  
As I reflect on the first half, I am pleased with our performance. We delivered strong sales and margin growth, along with good cash flow while building for the future and advancing sustainability with significant new carbon, water and plastic commitments.  
In the second half, in addition to investing in growth, productivity and sustainability, we also must navigate ongoing COVID-19 impacts and continue taking actions to address inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. We will do this by driving an unrelenting focus on operational performance, which includes improving service, quality, operating costs and cash generation.  
I would like to thank 3Mers for your commitment and resilience as we bring together people, ideas and science to help transform businesses, solve customer challenges and improve lives around the world. That wraps up my opening comments. 
And I'll turn it over to Monish to cover more details on the quarter and our updated guidance. Monish?"

Please turn to Slide 6. Company-wide, second quarter sales were $8.9 billion, up 25% year-on-year or an increase of 21% on an organic basis. Sales growth, combined with operating rigor and disciplined cost management, drove adjusted operating income of $2 billion, up 40%, with adjusted operating margins of 22%, up 240 basis points year-on-year.  
Second quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings per share were $2.59, up 44% compared to last year's adjusted results. On this slide, you can see the components that impacted both operating margins and earnings per share as compared to Q2 last year. A strong year-on-year organic volume growth, along with ongoing productivity, restructuring efforts and other items, added 4.1 percentage points to operating margins and $0.89 to earnings per share year-on-year.  
Included in this margin and earnings benefit were a few items of note. First, during the quarter, the Brazilian Supreme Court issued a ruling that clarified the calculation of Brazil's federal sales-based social tax, essentially lowering the social tax that 3M should have paid in prior years. This favorable ruling added $91 million to operating income of 1 percentage points to operating margins and $0.12 to earnings per share.  
Next, as you will see later today in our 10-Q, we increased our other environmental liability by nearly $60 million and our respiratory liabilities by approximately $20 million as part of our regular review. In addition, we also incurred a year-on-year increase in ongoing legal defense costs. We are currently scheduled to begin a PFAS-related trial in Michigan in October, along with the next step in the combat arms year plug multi-district litigation, with one trial in September and one in October.  
And finally, during the second quarter, we incurred a pretax restructuring charge of approximately $40 million as part of the program we announced in Q4 of last year.  
Second quarter net selling price and raw materials performance reduced both operating margins and earnings per share by 140 basis points and $0.17, respectively. This headwind was larger than forecasted as we experienced broad-based cost increases for chemicals, resins, outsourced manufacturing and logistics as the quarter progressed. As a result of these increasing cost trends, we now forecast a full year raw materials and logistics cost headwind in the range of $0.65 to $0.80 per share versus a prior expectation of $0.30 to $0.50.  
As we have discussed, we have been and are taking multiple actions including increasing selling prices to address these cost headwinds. As a result, we expect continued improvement in our selling price performance in the second half of the year. However, given the pace of cost increases, we currently expect a third quarter net selling price and raw materials headwind to margins in the range of 50 to 100 basis points, which we anticipate will turn to a net benefit in the fourth quarter as our selling price and other actions start catching up to the increased costs.  
Moving to divestiture impacts. The lost income from the sale of drug delivery in May of last year was a headwind of 10 basis points to operating margins and $0.02 to earnings per share. Foreign currency, net of hedging impacts, reduced margins 20 basis points while benefiting earnings by $0.08 per share. 
Finally, 3 nonoperating items combined had a net neutral impact to earnings per share year-on-year. This result included a $0.06 earnings benefit from lower other expenses, that was offset by higher tax rate and diluted share count, which were each a headwind of $0.03 per share versus last year.  
Please turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. We delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with second quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.6 billion, up 2% year-on-year, along with conversion of 103%. Our year-on-year free cash flow performance was driven by strong double-digit growth in sales and income, which was mostly offset by a timing of an income tax payment of approximately $400 million in last year's Q3, which is traditionally paid in Q2.  
Through the first half of the year, we increased adjusted free cash flow to $3 billion versus $2.5 billion last year. Second quarter capital expenditures were $394 million and approximately $700 million year-to-date. For the full year, we are currently tracking to the low end of our expected CapEx range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, given vendor constraints and the pace of capital projects.  
During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $858 million and share repurchases of $503 million. Year-to-date, we have returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our strong cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to strengthen our capital structure.  
We ended the quarter with $12.7 billion in net debt, a reduction of $3.5 billion since the end of Q2 last year. As a result, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has declined from 1.9 a year ago to 1.3 at the end of Q2. Our net debt position, along with our strong cash flow generation capability, continues to provide us financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure.  
Please turn to Slide 8, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q2. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 18% year-on-year in the second quarter, driven by improving industrial manufacturing activity and prior pandemic impacts.  
First, starting with our personal safety business, we posted double-digit organic growth in our head, face, gearing and fall protection solutions as demand in general industrial and construction end markets remains strong. However, this growth was more than offset by a decline in our overall respiratory portfolio due to last year's strong COVID-related demand resulting in an organic sales decline of low single digits for our personal safety business.  
Within our respiratory portfolio, second quarter disposable respirator sales increased 3% year-on-year but declined 11% sequentially as COVID-related hospitalizations declined. Looking ahead, we anticipate continued deceleration in disposable respirator demand through the balance of this year and into 2022.  
Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Organic growth was broad-based, led by double-digit increases in automotive aftermarket, roofing granules, abrasives, adhesives and tapes and electrical markets. Safety and Industrial's second quarter operating income was $718 million, up 15% versus last year. Operating margins were 22.1%, down 130 basis points year-on-year as leverage on sales growth was more than offset by increases in raw materials, logistics and ongoing legal costs.
Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which grew 24% organically despite sustained challenges from semiconductor supply chain constraints. Organic growth was led by our auto OEM business, up 76% year-on-year compared to a 49% increase in global car and light truck builds. This outperformance was due to several factors. First, the regional mix of year-on-year growth in car and light truck builds were in regions where we have high dollar content per vehicle. Second, a year-on-year increase in sell-in of 3M products versus the change in build rate. Lastly, we continue to apply 3M innovation to vehicles, gaining penetration onto new platforms.  
Our electronics-related business was up double digits organically, with continued strength in semiconductor, factory automation and data centers, along with consumer electronic devices, namely tablets and TVs. Looking ahead, we continue to monitor the global semiconductor supply chain and its potential impact on the electronics and automotive industries.  
Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced materials, commercial solutions and transportation safety each grew double digits year-on-year. Second quarter operating income was $546 million, up over 50% year-on-year. Operating margins were 22%, up 340 basis points year-on-year driven by strong leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by increases in raw materials and logistic costs.  
Turning to our Health Care business, which delivered second quarter organic sales growth of 23%. Organic growth was driven by continued year-on-year and sequential improvements in health care electric procedure volumes as COVID-related hospitalizations decline. Our Medical Solutions business grew mid-teens organically or up approximately 20%, excluding the decline in disposable respirator demand. I am pleased with the performance of Acelity, which grew nearly 20% organically in the quarter as it helps us build on our leadership in Advanced Wound Care.  
Sales in our Oral Care business more than doubled from a year ago as patient visits have nearly returned to pre-COVID levels. The separation and purification business increased 10% year-on-year due to ongoing demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccine and therapeutics, along with improving demand for water filtration solutions. Health Information Systems grew high single digits, driven by strong growth in clinician solutions. And finally, food safety increased double digits organically as food safety activity returns, along with continued strong growth from new product introduction.  
Health Care's second quarter operating income was $576 million, up over 90% year-on-year. Operating margins were 25.3%, up 880 basis points. Second quarter margins were driven by leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by increasing raw materials and logistics costs, along with increased investments in growth. Lastly, second quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was 18% year-on-year with strong sell-in and sell-out trends across most retail channels. Our home improvement business continues to perform well, up high teens organically on top of a strong comparison from a year ago. This business continued to experience strong demand in many of our category-leading franchises, particularly Command, Filtrete and Meguiar's. Stationery and office grew strong double digits organically in Q2 as this business laps last year's COVID-related comparisons. We continue to see strength in consumer demand for scotch branded packaging and shipping products, along with improved sell-in trends in Post-it Solutions and Scotch branded home and office tapes as retailers prepare for back-to-school and return to workplace. 
Our Home Care business was up low single digits organically versus last year's strong COVID-driven comparison. And finally, our Consumer health and safety business was up double digits as we lap COVID-related impacts from a year ago, along with improved supply of safety products for our retail customers.  
Consumer's operating income was $311 million, up 12% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21%, down 160 basis points as increased costs for raw materials, logistics and outsourced hard goods manufacturing, along with investments in advertising and merchandising more than offset leverage from sales growth.  
Please turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of our full year 2021 guidance. While uncertainty remains, we expect global economic and end market growth to remain strong, however, continue to be fluid as the world wrestles with ongoing COVID-related impacts that we all see and monitor. Therefore, there are a number of items that will need to be navigated as we go through the second half of the year.  
For example, we anticipate continued sequential improvement in health care elective procedure volumes. Also, we expect ongoing strength in the home improvement market and currently anticipate students returning to classrooms and more people returning to the workplace. 
Next, we remain focused on driving innovation and penetration with our global auto OEM and electronics customers. These 2 end markets continue to converge as highlighted by the well-known constraints in semiconductor chip supply. This limited chip supply is expected to reduce year-on-year automotive and electronics production volumes in the second half. As mentioned earlier, we expect demand for disposable respirators to wane and negatively impact second half revenues by approximately $100 million to $300 million year-on-year.  
Turning to raw materials and logistics. As noted, we anticipate a year-on-year earnings headwind of $0.65 to $0.80 per share for the full year or $0.40 to $0.55 in the second half due to rising cost pressures. We are taking a number of actions, including broad-based selling price increases to help mitigate this headwind.  
And finally, the restructuring program we announced last December remains on track. As part of this program, we expect to incur a pretax charge in the range of $60 million to $110 million in the second half of this year.  
Thus, taking into account our first half performance, along with these factors, we are raising our full year guidance for both organic growth and earnings per share. Organic growth is estimated to be 6% to 9%, up from the previous range of 3% to 6%. We now anticipate earnings of $9.70 to $10.10 per share against a prior range of $9.20 to $9.70.  Also, as you can see, we now expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 90% to 100% versus a prior range of 95% to 105%. This adjustment is primarily due to ongoing challenges in global supply chains, raw materials and logistics, which are expected to persist for some time.  
Turning to the third quarter, let me highlight a few items of note. First, we currently anticipate continued improvement in health care electric procedure volumes across most parts of the world. Global smartphone shipments are expected to be down high single digits year-on-year, while global car and light truck builds, I expect to be down 3% year-on-year. Relative to disposable respirators, we anticipate a year-on-year reduction in sales of $50 million to $100 million due to continued decline in global demand. As mentioned earlier, we are anticipating a third quarter year-on-year operating margin headwind of 50 to 100 basis points from selling prices, net of higher raw materials and logistic costs.  
On the restructuring front, which I previously discussed, we expect a Q3 pretax charge in the range of $50 million to $75 million as a part of this program. And finally, we expect higher investments in growth, productivity and sustainability in the quarter, along with higher legal defense costs as proceedings progress.  
To wrap up, our team has delivered a strong first half performance, including broad-based growth, good operational execution, robust cash flows and an enhanced capital structure. With that being said, there's always more we can do and will do. We continue to prioritize capital to our greatest opportunities for growth, productivity and sustainability, while remaining focused on delivering for our customers, improving operating rigor and enhancing daily management.  
I want to thank our customers and vendors for their ongoing loyalty and partnership and especially our employees for their dedication, perseverance and execution in these uncertain times. 
With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

To answer your question specifically on the second quarter, you hit on one point, which is a comp issue from year-over-year. But the second piece of this was also as the volumes came in pretty strong in the second quarter, we had some rebates that get accounted for with that extra volume, and that drove it.

But overall, we have done our best to keep our customers whole through this process. 
But this is an ongoing piece, Scott, that we'll have to watch how the second half plays itself out. You're seeing not only us but end markets also getting impacted by some of the raw material shortages. And we're just going to keep working this as we go through the second half."

I would just start with the team has done a really nice job of continuing to drive margins up while still investing in the business. The sharp increase on a year-over-year basis is driven by a lot of the volume increase that you saw Q2 of last year versus Q2 of this year. Third, I would say the volume leverage has helped. But we still got hurt by raw materials and logistics costs, and we continue to invest in the business. 
I would -- to answer your specific question on what does it look like going forward, I think it all comes down to ultimately where does volume turn out to be. As I said in my prepared remarks that disposable respirators are starting to slow down. You're seeing a Q3 impact of $50 million to $100 million on a year-over-year basis and $100 million to $300 million for the second half. Some -- many -- most of that should hit the Health Care segment. So we'll see where volume plays itself out. But secondly, I think is how much investments we keep driving as we see hospitalizations increase and elective procedures go up. So I think it's going to be a trade between that. Overall, I would say the team and I, we all believe in continuous improvement. So we're going to keep driving productivity, continuing to reduce cost, investing where we think it's the right place to invest and driving efficiency in SG&A as much as we can."

Right now we are busy integrating Acelity, and the team is doing a nice job integrating that. So we don't see any acquisitions of the size of Acelity in the near future, but we have an active pipeline of a number of things. 
And then our last discretionary use of capital allocation is share buyback. So for the year, year-to-date, we have done $700 million, give or take.

And even as we talk about the decline in respirator -- disposable respirator demand globally, we're seeing areas that we are increasing supply. And so that's going to be one of the things that can impact second half geographically across the world. So we -- while we expect overall pandemic-related respirator demand to decline, we expect some areas we'll see stronger demand and as COVID plays out. So that gives you a little bit of a view of how we look around the world second half."

And that's fairly broad-based. We -- it takes -- as we talked about, takes some time to implement price changes and get ahead of inflation. And it's been -- inflation has been an ongoing challenge as we've gone through the year. So we're expecting to see stronger price broad-based as we get into the second half. And into fourth quarter, we start to see a price raw positive impact. 
And if you look at where our channel inventories today, this is something we're always asking ourselves. It's a dynamic that we are continuously measuring and assessing every region of the world. And I would say, given the dynamics in the marketplace, the snapback in the economy, the fluid and uneven market dynamics, it's difficult to know what the right level is today. We get visibility on where our sell-in and sell-out is. With that snapback in demand, it's hard to get clear visibility on levels -- appropriate levels of inventory. There are some areas, of course, that are very visible, the ongoing semiconductor chip shortages, and they're impacting production volumes, and we are -- we see our inventory in the channel aligning with that. 
We've talked quite a bit about the visibility we're putting on N95 respirators specifically. But beyond that, it's really going to depend on how demand plays out in each market to really get a view as we go through third quarter of where inventory in the channel sits."

I think, Julian, it's a great question on Safety and Industrial. So to answer your specific question first on the impact, could it be negative on a year-over-year basis? As we said, and just a reminder, in 2019, we used to have revenue approximately $600 million of disposable respirators that went up to $1.4 billion in 2020. And as I look at the second half, we told you there could be a risk of $100 million to $300 million, which is the range of where we think disposable respirator volume would come down on a year-over-year basis. And if we go to that higher end of the range, which is $300 million, yes, the answer is you could definitely see negative volumes. 
What we have been doing as a part of this as health care demand has waned due to lower hospitalizations due to COVID and increase in electives is we have been moving production out from the hospital channel to different parts, which is industrial and governments, which we are actively doing. The other piece of Safety and Industrial is, as I mentioned in Q2, we have seen growth in quite a few other segments of Safety and Industrial, whether it's in our respiratory portfolio with our safety portfolio, with head and face masks, whether you've seen us increase in our abrasive business, in our adhesives business, our roofing granules. So all the other segments, automotive aftermarket, have seen increase. And depending on how the economy plays itself out, and as long as industrial activity continues, you should see continued growth in those areas. And our current assumption is that long term, those markets will come back. I think it's going to be a little fluid in the second half, depending on how COVID plays itself out. 
To answer your second question on margin, you're right, as we have seen in 2019 versus '20, we did get benefited a lot by the volume leverage that we got across Safety and Industrial. So ultimately, where volume lands in the second half will have an impact on where margins ultimately go. We are actively working on price increases, broad-based in that segment. It's -- how much of that is offset by price and raws and logistics cost is the second offset. And the third one is the ongoing legal fees or reserves that we have taken, will be the third one. And then the last one, I would say, is what do we invest in growth, productivity and sustainability and especially growth. Because as industrial activity goes up in '22 and '23, we're going to continue to invest in that segment. So put all that together, that's how we see where margins are going to land."

I think you're going to see volatility as we get through the second half with what happens with COVID. So a couple of items to note. We believe that elective procedures will continue to go up quarter-over-quarter. But in some parts of the world, you could see it go down. 
Secondly, I would say auto does show an increase. It's still on a year-over-year headwind, down 3% in the third quarter. And if my memory is right, it's projected to be down 3.7% in the fourth quarter. I think the semiconductor shortages will have an impact on what happens there, and we'll see where that plays itself out. 
Smartphone shipments are supposed to be down on a year-over-year basis. We'll see where it lands sequentially. And then tablets and TVs, which also have benefited tremendously last year are also projected to be down on a year-over-year basis, but hard to quantify what exactly it looks like on a sequential basis. You have seen us -- you have seen a pretty good increase in stationery and office supply in the second quarter. That momentum is there right now, where we are seeing sell-in trends as retailers are planning to have people -- more people return to the workplace, kids in school. But depending on how the pandemic plays out, that could have an impact. 
And then on Safety and Industrial, as I mentioned in the prior question, I think there's an assumption that industrial activity continues. But currently, the supply chain shortages across the world also put a lot of variability onto what that demand looks like. And that's why when we put all that together, we said we are prudent to call the year at 6% to 9% for the year versus the 3% to 6% that we had said earlier. But overall, I would -- go ahead."

For example, I would tell you, when we first gave our guide of $0.30 to $0.50, which has now been guided to $0.65 to $0.80, I would tell you, what we have seen is a broad-based increase in all commodities, whether it is polypropylene, chemical, resins we are seeing in our outsourced manufacturing goods, not just the labor cost but other commodities that go into that also getting passed. And then logistics cost has continued to be a pretty strong headwind. 
Where that will peak, I think, in my view, and I may be wrong here, at some point, demand and supply need to start settling itself out. There's a lot of demand. There's not enough supply based on all the V-shape recovery with the congestion in the ports, et cetera. And until that stabilizes itself out, I think we're going to continue to see inflation. We have seen where crude prices have gone up much heavier than we had thought coming into the year. Polypropylene has remained strong or heavy inflationary. Ocean rates have gone up a lot in the last 3 to 6 months. So it's really hard for us to come back and say when does it peak and when it would start coming down. 
So we've taken what we know. We have put in all the factors that we know. We've had a prediction of where we think these things could go. And we have come up with $0.65 to $0.80, which currently is our best guide of where we think inflation is going to be. But with that said, as I've mentioned, we are taking broad-based price increases everywhere to help offset the mitigation of this. We are also increasing yield. We are working with our suppliers to reduce prices, et cetera. And then in -- so third quarter, we'll see a headwind of 50 to 100 basis points price versus raw. And in the fourth quarter, our anticipation is that we should be able to get it to be flat to positive, which means price will offset the raw material inflation."

And we -- as you know, we built additional capacity as we went through 2020. By the end of the year, we were at a run rate of 2.5 billion N95 respirators on an annual basis. And so that's the capacity we come into the year. Other manufacturers build capacity as well to respond to the pandemic. And I think you see some of them idling some of their capacity as demand comes off the peak. 
And we'll begin that process as well to idle lines to be ready for the next emergency or changes in COVID-19. I mean, we can ramp up quickly. So our strategy is to be in a position to be a leader in personal safety, personal protective equipment in normal times. And that's really serving the broader industrial markets, serving consumer markets, serving health care markets, and that's our strategy for where we manufacture and the volumes. And then we have that idle capacity so we can surge in times of emergency. 
I think we're in a better position than ever before globally to be able to respond to a pandemic. And I would add, it's been good to see governments following through on their commitments to stockpile. That's something that we have a number of efforts underway around the world that we're supporting as we've come through the first half of the year. So that, I think, prepares the world better for the next emergency, the next pandemic. So it's going to -- it will depend. When you look at where are we going to end up with respirator demand, we think we'll end up somewhere above where we were pre-pandemic. As use and protocols are changing around the world, we'll be well aligned to serve that. Our brand will be strong. We've got a leading brand position in PPE and can -- and really take advantage of that position around the world. 
And so I think we've got the model well aligned. I think there's a surge capacity that will be available. How much will depend both on the demand that comes in any kind of future emergency. And I think we're -- like I said, we're ready for our part of that."

We are going after price increases, and our anticipation is that in the fourth quarter, we should be able to offset the price -- the raw and logistics cost impact.

And then finally, our decision on how much we're going to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability, plus a lot of these indirects that start snapping back, as hopefully, people start traveling.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In a dynamic environment, our performance throughout 2021 has shown the skill of our people around the world, the resiliency of our business model and the relevance of our technolog",1207,"Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
In a dynamic environment, our performance throughout 2021 has shown the skill of our people around the world, the resiliency of our business model and the relevance of our technologies. In the third quarter and year-to-date, we have delivered broad-based organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas, along with good margins and strong cash flow. 
Q3 organic growth was over 6% as we drove innovation across our market-leading businesses, with margins of 20% and earnings of $2.45 per share. Geographically, growth in the quarter was led by the Americas, up 7%, with the United States up 6%. Growth in APAC was 6%, with China up 3% and Japan up 6%. While EMEA grew 4%. 
With respect to the macro environment, overall end market demand remains strong, though the semiconductor shortage continues to impact many markets, most visibly in electronics and automotive. As we navigate near-term uncertainty, we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability, which I will discuss shortly. 
We are also actively managing disruptions in the global supply chain with a relentless focus on customer service. Looking at our performance through 9 months, we have executed well and delivered 11% organic growth with all business groups above 10%, along with margins of 22% and earnings of $7.81 per share. Today, we are updating full year expectations for organic growth to a range of 8% to 9% and EPS to a range of $9.70 to $9.90, reflecting our results to date and ongoing supply chain challenges. 
I would like to make a few comments on how 3M is actively managing those challenges. As you know, many companies are facing supply chain disruptions, the result of a convergence of issues, including the Delta variant, strong demand, energy and labor shortages and extreme weather events. For example, ocean freight costs have more than doubled over the last year and the number of containers on the water is up 70% because of port congestion. 
Suppliers are challenged to provide consistent and predictable supply. On any given day, we are working with more than 300 suppliers with critical constraints. With manufacturing sites in 35 countries around the world and as a $5 billion annual exporter out of the United States, we are working tirelessly to serve our customers. The cornerstone of 3M's response is our expertise and deep relationships across the supply chain, along with our local-for-local manufacturing and supply chain strategy, which helps us move with agility and keep our factories running. 
We have daily meetings with suppliers to strengthen our planning and in some instances, are strategically prioritizing geographies, end markets and portfolios. Hard but necessary decisions to ensure we meet the most critical needs of our customers. We are moving product in different ways, such as expanding our use of rail, shipping out of more flexible ports, and increasing our use of charter flights by over 40%, while deploying new capabilities to better track our flow of goods in real time. 
Maintaining talent is also key, and we are using several tactics to attract new workers while protecting the health and safety of all of our employees. Some of our actions have impacted our productivity and gross margins, which Monish will touch on. But we will do what is necessary to take care of customers. 
The combination of strong demand along with supply chain challenges is also contributing to broad-based inflation. We are taking multiple actions to help offset inflationary pressures, including price increases, dual sourcing and improving factory yields with more work to do. 
Ultimately, the duration of these supply chain challenges is difficult to predict. We remain focused on serving customers, managing backlogs and making good on our commitments, delivering the unique high-quality products that are the hallmark of 3M. 
Please turn to Slide 5. While we execute day-to-day, we are investing to drive long-term growth and capitalize on trends in large attractive markets. In home improvement, for example, we have multiple $0.5 billion-plus franchises that keep families healthier and more productive, including our fast-growing Command damage-free hanging solutions and Filtrete home filtration products. These brands leverage 3M's deep expertise in adhesives and nonwoven materials. 
The same technology is helping drive success in our automotive business, which consistently outgrows build rates. Auto electrification sales are up 40% year-to-date on the strength of new innovations including advanced display technologies as automobiles become the next consumer electronic device. 
In health care, the biopharma market is growing more than 10% annually, with our business up more than 30% year-to-date as 3M Science has supported the unprecedented pace of advancement over the past 18 months to develop therapeutics and vaccines and scale manufacturing to help address the pandemic. 
The fundamental strengths of 3M, our unique technology platforms, advanced manufacturing, global capabilities and leading brands position us to win, and we will continue to invest in these areas. In a similar way, we are driving productivity by advancing digital capabilities across our operations, allowing us to expand our use of data and data analytics. 
In sustainability, we have achieved 50% renewable electricity use in our operations, 4 years ahead of our time line, on our way to 100%. We are advancing the environmental goals we announced earlier in the year, making the investments to accelerate our ability to achieve carbon neutrality, reduce water use and improve the quality of water returned to the environment from our industrial processes. 
In addition, we are proactively managing PFAS, making our factories and communities stronger and more sustainable. In Cottage Grove, Minnesota, we recently announced that we are closing our incinerator and partnering with a leading disposal company to more efficiently manage our waste streams. We just broke ground to add new filtration technology in Cordova, Illinois. In Belgium, we are working with government officials to resolve issues related to PFAS and we'll invest up to EUR 125 million over the next 3 years to improve water quality around our factory. These proactive initiatives and others are accelerating 3M's ability to go beyond current regulatory standards and deliver on our commitments. 
With respect to the PFAS strategic road map announced last week, 3M remains committed to working with the Biden administration, EPA and others in taking a science-based approach to managing PFAS. 
Let me also touch on a few litigation updates. Last week, we announced a collaborative agreement to resolve litigation related to PPAS, nera facility indicator, Alabama. The impact is included in our previously disclosed reserves. On combat arms, there have been 4 bellwether trials so far, with 6 additional trials here in the fourth quarter. We are early in this litigation, and we'll continue to actively defend ourselves, including through the appeal process. As always, we encourage you to read our 10-Q for updates on all litigation matters. 
To wrap up, we are driving strong results in a challenging environment, investing in attractive end markets and positioning 3M for continued growth. I am proud of our 3M team, which is united by a common purpose, unlocking the power of people, ideas and science to reimagine what's possible and create what's next. 
Now I will turn it over to Monish who will cover the details of the quarter. Monish?"

Please turn to Slide 6. As I look back on the quarter, the 3M team demonstrated the resilience of our business model and the relevance of our technologies as we executed well in a very challenging",2125,"Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. 
Please turn to Slide 6. As I look back on the quarter, the 3M team demonstrated the resilience of our business model and the relevance of our technologies as we executed well in a very challenging environment, effectively navigating the supply chain disruption while serving and innovating for our customers. Though manufacturing, raw materials and logistics challenges persisted throughout the quarter, we continue to invest in the business while driving operating rigor and managing costs. 
Turning to the third quarter financial results. Sales were $8.9 billion, up 7.1% year-on-year or an increase of 6.3% on an organic basis. Operating income was $1.8 billion, down 6% with operating margins of 20%, coming in at the top end of the range, which we had previously communicated in mid-September. Third quarter earnings per share were $2.45, which was similar to last year. 
On this slide, you can see the components that impacted both operating margins and earnings per share as compared to Q3 last year. Our strong year-on-year organic volume growth was more than offset by the headwinds resulting from the global supply chain challenges, investments in growth and sustainability and litigation-related costs. Combined, these impacts lowered operating margins by 1.4 percentage points and earnings per share by $0.02 year-on-year. 
The restructuring program we announced in Q4 of last year remains on track. As part of this program, we incurred a pretax restructuring charge of $50 million in the third quarter. This charge was offset by the benefits we achieved this quarter. 
Moving to price and raw materials. As expected, increases in selling price gained traction as we went through the quarter, with year-on-year selling prices up 140 basis points in Q3 versus 10 basis points in Q2. However, we continue to experience higher cost for raw materials, logistics and outsourced manufacturing, which outpaced the increase in selling prices. Thus, third quarter net selling price and raw materials performance reduced both operating margins and earnings by 130 basis points and $0.12 per share respectively versus Q3 last year. 
Looking at Q4, we expect our selling price actions to continue to gain traction as we work to mitigate the raw material and logistics inflationary pressures we have experienced throughout the year. 
Next, foreign currency net of hedging impacts, reduced margins 20 basis points and earnings by $0.01 per share. Also, 3 other nonoperating items impacted our year-on-year earnings per share performance. First, lower other expenses resulted in an $0.08 earnings benefit. Consistent with prior quarters, nonoperating pension was a $0.05 benefit, along with a $0.02 benefit from net interest due to a proactive early redemption of debt. 
Secondly, a lower tax rate versus last year provided a $0.09 benefit to earnings per share. The tax rate was lower due to favorable adjustments this year related to impacts of U.S. international tax provisions. Our year-to-date tax rate is 18.8%. Therefore, we now expect our full year tax rate in the range of 18.5% to 19.5% versus 20% to 21% previously. And finally, average diluted shares outstanding increased 1% versus Q3 last year, lowering per share earnings by $0.02. 
Please turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion was down 29% year-on-year, with conversion of 107%. Adjusted free cash flow year-to-date was $4.5 billion, which was similar to last year, with free cash flow conversion of 98%. The decline in our year-on-year free cash flow performance was primarily driven by higher inventory balances due to strong customer demand, along with raw material inflation and more goods in transit as a result of the ongoing global supply chain challenges. 
Third quarter capital expenditures were $343 million and $1 billion year-to-date. For the full year, we now expect CapEx investments in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion versus being at the low end of our prior range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. We continue to step up investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. However, the pace of projects continues to be impacted by supply chain and vendor constraints. 
During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $856 million and share repurchases of $527 million. Year-to-date, we have returned $3.8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
Our net debt position, strong cash flow generation capability and disciplined capital allocation continues to provide us financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. 
Please turn to Slide 8, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q3. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 6.1% year-on-year in the third quarter. 
Organic growth was driven by continued robust industrial manufacturing activity, along with prior year pandemic-related impacts. First, our personal safety business declined 4% organically, up against a 40% pandemic-driven comparison a year ago. Third quarter disposable respirator sales decreased 7% organically year-on-year and 15% sequentially. Looking ahead, we anticipate continued deceleration in disposable respirator demand through the balance of this year and into 2022. 
Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Organic growth was led by double-digit increases in adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets. In addition, closure and masking systems was up high single digits, automotive aftermarket up low single digits, while roofing granules declined against a strong comparison from last year. 
Safety and Industrial's third quarter operating income was $620 million, down 20% versus last year. Operating margins were 19.2%, down 650 basis points year-on-year as leverage on sales growth was more than offset by ongoing increases in raw materials, logistics and litigation-related costs, along with manufacturing productivity impacts. 
Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which grew 5.1% organically despite the continued impact of semiconductor supply chain constraints. Our auto OEM business was flat year-on-year compared to the 20% decline in global car and light truck builds. 
This outperformance was due to a few factors. First, we continue to grow our penetration by driving 3M innovation onto new automotive platforms. Second, we saw a notable increase in channel inventories at tier suppliers given the dramatic reductions in OEM's build forecast through the quarter. Lastly, we benefited from a vehicle model mix standpoint as auto OEMs produce more premium vehicles which tend to have higher 3M contact. 
Our electronics-related business declined low single digits organically, with declines across consumer electronics, particularly smartphones and TVs as OEMs faced production challenges due to ongoing semiconductor constraints and COVID-related impacts. These declines were partially offset by continued strong demand for our products and solutions in semiconductor and factory automation end markets. 
Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced materials and commercial solutions each grew double digits year-on-year, while transportation safety grew low single digits. Third quarter operating income was $465 million, down 9% year-on-year. Operating margins were 19%, down 320 basis points year-on-year driven by strong leverage on sales growth, which was more than offset by increases in raw materials and logistics costs along with manufacturing productivity impacts. 
Turning to our Health Care business, which delivered third quarter organic sales growth of 3.3%. Our Medical Solutions business declined low single digits organically, impacted by the continued decline in demand for disposable respirators along with the pace of hospital elective procedure volumes, which came in at the low end of industry expectations of 90% to 95% for the quarter. Sales in our oral care business grew low double digits year-on-year as dental procedures continue to be near pre-COVID levels. 
The separation and purification business increased high single digits year-on-year due to ongoing demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutics. Health Information Systems grew low double digits driven by strong growth in clinician solutions. And finally, food safety increased double digits as food service activity returns. 
Health Care's third quarter operating income was $529 million, up 7% year-on-year. Operating margins were 23.5%, up 70 basis points. Third quarter margins were driven by leverage on sales growth, which is partially offset by the increasing raw materials and logistics costs, manufacturing productivity impacts, along with increased investments in growth. 
Lastly, third quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was 7.6% year-on-year with continued strong sell-in and sell-out trends across most retail channels. Our home improvement business continues to perform well, up high single digits on top of a strong comparison from a year ago. This business continued to experience strong demand, particularly in our Command and Filtrete category-leading franchises. 
Stationery and office grew double digits organically in Q3 as this business laps last year's COVID-related comparisons. We also had strong back-to-school consumer demand and holiday-related sell-in for Scotch-branded packaging and shipping products, Post-it solutions and Scotch-branded home and office states. Our Home Care business was up low single digits versus last year's strong COVID-driven comparison. 
And finally, our Consumer Health and Safety business was up high single digits as we lap COVID-related impacts from a year ago. Consumer's operating income was $332 million, down 3% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21.7%, down 260 basis points as increased cost for raw materials, logistics and outsourced hard goods manufacturing more than offset leverage from sales growth. 
Please turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of our full year 2021 guidance. As we reflect on the macroeconomic environment, we expect demand to remain strong across most end markets. However, uncertainty persists given the ongoing impacts of the pandemic along with a well-known global supply chain, raw materials and logistics challenges that all companies are working through. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our customers and doing what is necessary to serve them as we continue to navigate the fluid environment. 
Turning to guidance. We are increasing the bottom end of our expectations for organic growth. We now project our full year organic growth to be in the range of 8% to 9% versus a prior range of 6% to 9%. With respect to earnings, we anticipate a range of $9.70 to $9.90 per share as compared to a prior range of $9.70 to $10.10. And finally, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow. Therefore, we are maintaining our free cash flow conversion range of 90% to 100%. 
This updated outlook implies a wider than normal fourth quarter range, accounting for ongoing impacts of COVID and the uncertain supply chain environment. For example, from a growth perspective, the well-known constraints in semiconductor chip supply are impacting more and more end markets, most notably, automotive and consumer electronics as reflected in the lower production forecast for the year. 
We anticipate global elective health care procedure volumes to stabilize with recent trends. Relative to disposable respirators, we expect continued impacts from the decline in health care-related demand, along with elevated inventory levels in the industrial channel. And finally, we expect our pricing actions to continue to gain traction as we work to mitigate raw material and logistics cost pressures. 
Turning to operations. As we have discussed, we are actively managing inefficiencies in global supply chains with a relentless focus on customer service. Therefore, we are adjusting demand plans with greater frequency and as a result, incurring more manufacturing production changeovers along with expediting shipments. All of these actions are impacting both cost and productivity, but we are taking the necessary steps to ensure we meet the most critical need of our customers. 
We continue to make progress relative to December 2020 restructuring announcement. To date, we have incurred over $240 million in pretax restructuring charges and anticipate an additional $25 million to $50 million in Q4. We now expect total pretax restructuring charges of $300 million to $325 million versus our original expectations of $250 million to $300 million. We expect the remaining actions under this program to be initiated by the first quarter of 2022. 
In addition, we expect to incur higher costs related to our ongoing litigation matters, along with increases in our other indirect related costs like travel expense. And finally, we continue to invest in the business for the long term, and therefore, anticipate increased investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. 
To close, I would like to take a moment to thank our customers who have placed their faith in us, our vendors who are tirelessly working with us to ensure continuity of supply, and most importantly, our 90,000-plus 3Mers who continue to deliver for our customers. We have a very steady eye on the long term to deliver growth, margin and cash through strong operating rigor while continuing to navigate the uncertainty in the short run. 
With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

At the same time, there was a lot of uncertainty as regards volumes, as regards supply chain flow. And then third, I've also mentioned that as we were facing all those items, we were also doing our own self-help versus just letting these things go through, whether it was dual-sourcing whether it was controlling some of our expenses, et cetera. And when you put all that together, we came in at the 20%. 
If you look at where we ended up, I would say, inflation came in pretty much where we thought it was going to be. We executed on price. We have moved from 10 basis points of price increase in Q2 to 140 basis points in Q3. So that was pretty much in line, and we were able to execute more volumes. So we -- our vendors with the flow of supply, we were able to get good flow of supply. There's strong demand, as Mike said, and we were able to execute the demand. 
As well as we control our expenses across the corporation to make sure that we were prioritizing on serving our customers and trying to mitigate impact of inflation as much as we could. So put all that in, we came in at the 20% versus the range of 19% to 20% that I mentioned earlier."

I think a couple of things on just the items you talked about, which was price raw. We expect to continue to have continued momentum in price in the fourth quarter. You saw us again go up from 10 to 140 basis points, and we should see that go up as price continues to take hold across the various geographies and product lines, things that we have talked about before. 
I would say we don't see the raw material or the inflation environment slowing down in any way. I think you're going to see that volatility. It's going to depend on what the holiday season does. It depends on what logistics costs are going to be. Our goal is to get to neutral. The question is going to be, how does raw materials at some point play itself out? And do we see a turn in some of the commodities like polypropylene, ethylene, et cetera, where we have seen a lot of inflation. I would say that's number one. 
On your question, I think there was another point on bridge on revenue. I would just say, if you're looking 3 to 4Q, just remember, there are a couple of things that impact 3M. There's 1 less billing day from 3Q to 4Q. And secondly, you have a normal seasonality that you have in 3M as many of the factories with our industrial customers slow down during the holidays, and that's the impact. So I think I've answered your question, but if there's anything else, I'm happy to answer it."

The first, if you look at what we've done year-to-date, it's really been reflective of our innovation, something we've been talking about for some time. We outgrow the build rates. And even in a dynamic like this year where the build rates are swinging down as there were some challenges in the OEM production plans for Q3 and the outlook for Q4 being similar, we're continuing to drive our innovations, win spec-ins and design-in opportunities. 
And then as Monish mentioned, the mix of vehicles in this kind of demand environment is more premium, which we have a higher level of penetration in those vehicles. We also have very good growth in our auto electrification priority growth platform and broadly and getting good traction, 40% year-to-date. So those are all driving that performance as we come through year-to-date. And we expect to be able to continue to outperform build rates as we go forward. 
The channel -- everybody is challenged with matching up to the changes in production plans. And these are -- they're changing quickly, and the dynamic has been challenging for the supply chains, and I would say everyone in the value chain, to keep up with. We -- that said, we see inventory trying to track pretty well with that. We don't see really -- in our results, we're not seeing a year-to-date impact from excess inventory. So it's really about matching up with where the mix is going, where the build rates are going. And again, we see good momentum in our portfolio against those build rates."

And as Mike mentioned and so have I, we'll do whatever it takes to make sure that we keep serving our customers. 
Overall, I would still say this is a short-term phenomenon. Long term, we are seeing good end market trends. And that's why you're seeing us continue to invest. So your point on the next piece, which is CapEx and where we were. I would say the areas that we would -- where we are looking to keep investing where in all the 3 buckets: growth, productivity and sustainability. And the cycle times to get CapEx raw material for these businesses is just taking longer than we had originally thought, and that's why we had to slow it down to 1.5 to 1.6. 
But I would just end by your question by saying, Jeff, we are not done with the quarter. This team knows how to fight. We're going to keep doing whatever it takes to keep serving for our customers as long as the demand is there. And at the same time, the team is furiously working to make sure that we mitigate some of the raw material pressures that we have as well as keep investing for growth, productivity and sustainability.

So it's down about 10% looking forward, that's the expectation as we go forward to Q4. 
So that will be one of the impacts. It's been one of the impacts being hurt most by the supply chain challenges. For us, our focus in China has really been very much in line with what we've been talking about as we came through the pandemic. We see market segments that are high growth, and we've been prioritizing investments there. And we see those growth trends continuing. So we're -- that's where we're focused. We're focused where we have the kind of the winning solutions. And we do see opportunities across each of our businesses.

So I would say depending on how the litigation goes, do you see it bleed into '22? Yes, because the MDLs will all not be done by fourth quarter of 2021. 
On disposable respirators, as we have talked about, depending on seeing how the pandemic has played itself out, we felt Q1 was peak. We had mentioned that even in our last earnings call. We have seen revenue consistently sequentially come down. You have seen we came down nearly 6% in DR in the third quarter. We see that further down between 75 to 125 on a year-over-year basis or 25 to 75 sequentially. And depending on where the pandemic goes, that will have an impact into 2022. 
But again, we are seeing pockets where you are seeing COVID cases go up, where you're seeing demand go up and then in other cases, you're starting to see demand come down. So it's pretty dynamic on the disposable respirator side. But as we have talked before, we've got capacity of 2.5 billion respirators that we can ramp up very quickly. 
The team has done a really nice job of managing this environment. In certain cases, we have shut down manufacturing lines. In certain cases, we are managing our inventory levels as we go through this, but we'll be ready for the next factor event.

In certain cases, we are working with contracts and the constraints in those contracts. And we put a pretty thoughtful approach to how we go after price increases. 
How it goes into 2022, Scott, I think will also depend on where we see inflation going to be in '22 and beyond. Right now, I think we are comfortable with the price increases that we have taken, but we're going to keep doing it as long as we need to. As I mentioned, the goal of the team is to get to neutral.

So we talked about Americas being up 7% in the quarter and low double digits year-to-date. The highest growth as we came through the quarters in Latin America and Canada and up double digits across all business groups. So again, similar to what we talked about in the way we're seeing year-to-date demand across 3M globally, broad-based across business groups in the Americas. And United States still in a strong position of 6% in the quarter and double digits for the year. EMEA, if you look at how we're doing there, we're growing high single digits for the year, 9%, 4% in the quarter. 
We haven't seen a strong rebound in growth as other areas, but we are seeing a recovery now in Health Care and Transportation and Electronics starting to help drive that growth that we are seeing. And in Asia Pacific, growing mid-teens year-to-date, double-digit growth across the business groups, all business groups again. And as I mentioned, we talked about China a bit. I mentioned Japan in prepared remarks. That's been one of the improving areas is Japan now starting to see improving growth as we come through the year. 
So not down -- not near the pre-COVID levels yet, but again, starting to see some improvements. And in that case, also being led by Health Care.

And back to what Monish was talking about, how we're focused on delivering for customers, we're leveraging the strengths of our 3M model. The idea that we talked about in the prepared remarks, local for local, building our capabilities across our value model to the customers close to them regionally around the world. And that has been a strength as we come through COVID. 
And I would say this year, as we deal with the interruption of the supply chain, this regional strategy has allowed us to be more agile in just what Monish was talking about, the changing nature of our production plans and our production wheels and our -- what we're doing in our factory. So we have a lot of flexibility built in. 
I would say we're always evaluating how to better serve customers, how do we look at our lean value streams end to end, how do we take new strategies into that, getting -- based on, I would say, the improving visibility we have, we see opportunities to be more efficient and improve our cycle times and so on. 
So we're always looking at changes. I do think the model that we have has served us well and that it's been a great place to respond to the challenges. And I think that's the foundation as we go ahead. It's how do we make that better, how do we drive better performance improving operational efficiency.

And then the bigger discussion around the industry is what does 2022 and beyond look like. The reason is a lot of these elective procedures that have been slowed down are elective, but they are still time-sensitive at the end of the day. So there's -- so that's what we'll have to see and see what capacity is added in all the countries. We have to see how cases go play out from a COVID perspective. 
But I also think hospitals are far better equipped right now, are more prepared to deal with this. So our hope is that electric procedures come back up to 2019 levels in 2022. When it happens, I think, will depend on different parts of cases in the world, but that's how we see it."

The pandemic has impacted production, semiconductor shortages are impacting end markets for us, in particular. 
And then we were also impacted, as we went through the year with some extreme weather events, which interrupted our raw material supply. Those are getting better. So some of the raw material supply issues that we are facing are getting better as we go. And we do expect supply chains to improve. It's difficult to estimate or predict the duration of each of these factors and how they play with each other and watching the congestion in logistics is one of the things that we are carefully looking for improvements in as well. 
Can we move back to more normal logistics patterns for us as we go forward, that will be a good sign that broadly supply chain disruptions are improving.

So I'll just, again, just -- and my apologies, I am just going to reiterate our capital allocation priorities, just so that everyone's on the same page. Our first priority is always go organic. We just see it's the best use of our capital, best return. As you can see, we are not afraid to deploy capital. We have done that in 2020. We are continuing to do that in '21, which is investing in growth, productivity and sustainability. 
We were going to spend $1.8 billion to $2 billion to this year, but with some of the supply chain constraints, it's down to $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. But we still believe in the long-term growth, and so we're going to keep investing in that. 
As Mike had announced early in the year, we also announced $1 billion to improve for our sustainability efforts. That's going to be spent over the next 20 years, but it's front-end loaded. So that's the second piece on organic investment. Dividend is our second priority, important for our shareholders. So that's a priority that we clearly are focused on. 
Our third priority is M&A. And you're right that we are integrating Acelity and the team is doing a very nice job by integrating Acelity to our business. At the same time, we have tons of ideas and we have a pipeline that we would be -- we'll execute when we see that we get a target that we believe can add value to our shareholders. At the same time, it's things that we believe that we can add value to the target, too, by using some of the strengths that we have, which is our brand, our global capability, our employee base, our material science capability, et cetera. So that's our third, and we always have an active pipeline. 
And then the last one is share buyback. You've seen we have now done $1.3 billion for the year. We did $527 million. That's the last priority for us from a deployment of capital perspective. But depending on the stock price and how much cash we generate, we clearly will look at that, too. 
Overall, I would just say, when I look at net debt-to-EBITDA leverage, which is at approximately 1.3, at that point, it gives me a lot of financial strength and optionality. It gives 3M a lot of financial strength and optionality. So depending on what opportunities we see, we won't hesitate to deploy capital because as Mike mentioned, even some of the platforms that we've talked about, all of them are GDP plus growth platform. So that's an area we would love to keep investing."

We increased margins 70 basis points in the third quarter. I would say it's a performance all around the oral care business and the snapback has definitely helped. It helps us on a volume. It helps us on leverage with the volume in the factories. 
The MSD business, if you exclude the disposable respirator decline, grew very nicely in the second quarter and MSD is where Acelity is in there, too. Acelity was impacted in the third quarter by lower elective procedures, but the integration is going well. We are continuing to find synergies between the cross-selling that we can do with our wound care business and Acelity -- or our existing wound care business and Acelity. So we are very happy with that progress. But in the spirit of continuous improvement, there's always more we can do here to drive growth and margin, and most and team are very focused on continuing to do that."

We would -- we should continue to see progress in the fourth quarter as these price actions that we have taken in the third quarter continue to take hold. 
I think the big issue that we have seen is inflation has come in faster than anybody thought. And so the team has continuously done what it can to drive price increases. To the question that was even asked earlier, our goal is to get to neutral of price and raw, but I think it will all depend on how inflation goes. But the team knows how to drive price. The team drives a lot of innovation that also helps from a price increase perspective. So all that put together, team is working it pretty hard."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In a dynamic environment, our performance throughout 2021 has shown the skill of our people around the world, the resiliency of our business model and the relevance of our technologies. In the third quarter and year-to-date, we have delivered broad-based organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas, along with good margins and strong cash flow.
Q3 organic growth was over 6% as we drove innovation across our market-leading businesses, with margins of 20% and earnings of $2.45 per share. Geographically, growth in the quarter was led by the Americas, up 7%, with the United States up 6%. Growth in APAC was 6%, with China up 3% and Japan up 6%. While EMEA grew 4%.
With respect to the macro environment, overall end market demand remains strong, though the semiconductor shortage continues to impact many markets, most visibly in electronics and automotive. As we navigate near-term uncertainty, we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability, which I will discuss shortly. We are also actively managing disruptions in the global supply chain with a relentless focus on customer service.
Looking at our performance through 9 months, we have executed well and delivered 11% organic growth with all business groups above 10%, along with margins of 22% and earnings of $7.81 per share. Today, we are updating full year expectations for organic growth to a range of 8% to 9% and EPS to a range of $9.70 to $9.90, reflecting our results to date and ongoing supply chain challenges.
I would like to make a few comments on how 3M is actively managing those challenges. As you know, many companies are facing supply chain disruptions. the result of a convergence of issues, including the Delta variant, strong demand, energy and labor shortages and extreme weather events. For example, ocean freight costs have more than doubled over the last year and the number of containers on the water is up 70% because of port congestion.
Suppliers are challenged to provide consistent and predictable supply. On any given day, we are working with more than 300 suppliers with critical constraints. With manufacturing sites in 35 countries around the world and as a $5 billion annual exporter out of the United States, we are working tirelessly to serve our customers. The cornerstone of 3M's response is our expertise and deep relationships across the supply chain, along with our local-for-local manufacturing and supply chain strategy, which helps us move with agility and keep our factories running.
We have daily meetings with suppliers to strengthen our planning and in some instances, are strategically prioritizing geographies, end markets and portfolios. Hard but necessary decisions to ensure we meet the most critical needs of our customers. We are moving product in different ways, such as expanding our use of rail, shipping out of more flexible ports, and increasing our use of charter flights by over 40%, while deploying new capabilities to better track our flow of goods in real time.
Maintaining talent is also key, and we are using several tactics to attract new workers while protecting the health and safety of all of our employees. Some of our actions have impacted our productivity and gross margins, which Monish will touch on. But we will do what is necessary to take care of customers.
The combination of strong demand along with supply chain challenges is also contributing to broad-based inflation. We are taking multiple actions to help offset inflationary pressures, including price increases, dual sourcing and improving factory yields with more work to do.
Ultimately, the duration of these supply chain challenges is difficult to predict. We remain focused on serving customers, managing backlogs and making good on our commitments, delivering the unique high-quality products that are the hallmark of 3M.
Please turn to Slide 5. While we execute day-to-day, we are investing to drive long-term growth and capitalize on trends in large attractive markets. In home improvement, for example, we have multiple $0.5 billion-plus franchises that keep families healthier and more productive, including our fast-growing Command damage-free hanging solutions and Filtrete home filtration products. These brands leverage 3M's deep expertise in adhesives and nonwoven materials.
The same technology is helping drive success in our automotive business, which consistently outgrows build rates. Auto electrification sales are up 40% year-to-date on the strength of new innovations including advanced display technologies as automobiles become the next consumer electronic device.
In health care, the biopharma market is growing more than 10% annually, with our business up more than 30% year-to-date as 3M Science has supported the unprecedented pace of advancement over the past 18 months to develop therapeutics and vaccines and scale manufacturing to help address the pandemic.
The fundamental strengths of 3M, our unique technology platforms, advanced manufacturing, global capabilities and leading brands position us to win, and we will continue to invest in these areas. In a similar way, we are driving productivity by advancing digital capabilities across our operations, allowing us to expand our use of data and data analytics.
In sustainability, we have achieved 50% renewable electricity use in our operations, 4 years ahead of our time line, on our way to 100%. We are advancing the environmental goals we announced earlier in the year, making the investments to accelerate our ability to achieve carbon neutrality, reduce water use and improve the quality of water returned to the environment from our industrial processes.
In addition, we are proactively managing PFAS, making our factories and communities stronger and more sustainable. In Cottage Grove, Minnesota, we recently announced that we are closing our incinerator and partnering with a leading disposal company to more efficiently manage our waste streams.
We just broke ground to add new filtration technology in Cordova, Illinois. In Zwijndrecht, Belgium, we are working with government officials to resolve issues related to PFAS and we'll invest up to EUR 125 million over the next 3 years to improve water quality around our factory.
These proactive initiatives and others are accelerating 3M's ability to go beyond current regulatory standards and deliver on our commitments. With respect to the PFAS strategic road map announced last week, 3M remains committed to working with the Biden Administration, EPA and others in taking a science-based approach to managing PFAS.
Let me also touch on a few litigation updates. Last week, we announced a collaborative agreement to resolve litigation related to PFAS near our facility in Decatur, Alabama. The impact is included in our previously disclosed reserves. On combat arms, there have been 4 bellwether trials so far, with 6 additional trials here in the fourth quarter. We are early in this litigation, and we'll continue to actively defend ourselves, including through the appeal process. As always, we encourage you to read our 10-Q for updates on all litigation matters.
To wrap up, we are driving strong results in a challenging environment, investing in attractive end markets and positioning 3M for continued growth. I am proud of our 3M team, which is united by a common purpose, unlocking the power of people, ideas and science to reimagine what's possible and create what's next.
Now I will turn it over to Monish who will cover the details of the quarter. Monish?"
289194,711761036,2412730,"3M Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","3M Company","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6.

Please turn to Slide 6. As I look back on the quarter, the 3M team demonstrated the resilience of our business model and the relevance of our technologies as we executed well in a very challenging environment, effectively navigating the supply chain disruption while serving and innovating for our customers. Though manufacturing, raw materials and logistics challenges persisted throughout the quarter, we continue to invest in the business while driving operating rigor and managing costs.
Turning to the third quarter financial results. Sales were $8.9 billion, up 7.1% year-on-year or an increase of 6.3% on an organic basis. Operating income was $1.8 billion, down 6%, with operating margins of 20%, coming in at the top end of the range, which we had previously communicated in mid-September. Third quarter earnings per share were $2.45, which was similar to last year.
On this slide, you can see the components that impacted both operating margins and earnings per share as compared to Q3 last year. Our strong year-on-year organic volume growth was more than offset by the headwinds resulting from the global supply chain challenges, investments in growth and sustainability, and litigation-related costs. Combined, these impacts lowered operating margins by 1.4 percentage points and earnings per share by $0.02 year-on-year.
The restructuring program we announced in Q4 of last year remains on track. As part of this program, we incurred a pretax restructuring charge of $50 million in the third quarter. This charge was offset by the benefits we achieved this quarter.
Moving to price and raw materials. As expected, increases in selling price gained traction as we went through the quarter, with year-on-year selling prices up 140 basis points in Q3 versus 10 basis points in Q2. However, we continue to experience higher cost for raw materials, logistics and outsourced manufacturing, which outpaced the increase in selling prices.
Thus, third quarter net selling price and raw materials performance reduced both operating margins and earnings by 130 basis points and $0.12 per share respectively versus Q3 last year. Looking at Q4, we expect our selling price actions to continue to gain traction as we work to mitigate the raw material and logistics inflationary pressures we have experienced throughout the year.
Next, foreign currency net of hedging impacts reduced margins 20 basis points and earnings by $0.01 per share. Also, 3 other nonoperating items impacted our year-on-year earnings per share performance. First, lower other expenses resulted in an $0.08 earnings benefit. Consistent with prior quarters, nonoperating pension was a $0.05 benefit, along with a $0.02 benefit from net interest due to a proactive early redemption of debt.
Secondly, a lower tax rate versus last year provided a $0.09 benefit to earnings per share. The tax rate was lower due to favorable adjustments this year related to impacts of U.S. international tax provisions. Our year-to-date tax rate is 18.8%. Therefore, we now expect our full year tax rate in the range of 18.5% to 19.5% versus 20% to 21% previously. And finally, average diluted shares outstanding increased 1% versus Q3 last year, lowering per share earnings by $0.02.
Please turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion was down 29% year-on-year, with conversion of 107%. Adjusted free cash flow year-to-date was $4.5 billion, which was similar to last year, with free cash flow conversion of 98%. The decline in our year-on-year free cash flow performance was primarily driven by higher inventory balances due to strong customer demand, along with raw material inflation and more goods in transit as a result of the ongoing global supply chain challenges.
Third quarter capital expenditures were $343 million and $1 billion year-to-date. For the full year, we now expect CapEx investments in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion versus being at the low end of our prior range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. We continue to step up investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. However, the pace of projects continues to be impacted by supply chain and vendor constraints.
During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $856 million and share repurchases of $527 million. Year-to-date, we have returned $3.8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
Our net debt position, strong cash flow generation capability and disciplined capital allocation continues to provide us financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure.
Please turn to Slide 8, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q3. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 6.1% year-on-year in the third quarter.
Organic growth was driven by continued robust industrial manufacturing activity, along with prior year pandemic-related impacts. First, our personal safety business declined 4% organically, up against a 40% pandemic-driven comparison a year ago. Third quarter disposable respirator sales decreased 7% organically year-on-year and 15% sequentially. Looking ahead, we anticipate continued deceleration in disposable respirator demand through the balance of this year and into 2022.
Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Organic growth was led by double-digit increases in adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets. In addition, closure and masking systems was up high single digits, automotive aftermarket up low single digits, while roofing granules declined against a strong comparison from last year.
Safety and Industrial's third quarter operating income was $620 million, down 20% versus last year. Operating margins were 19.2%, down 650 basis points year-on-year as leverage on sales growth was more than offset by ongoing increases in raw materials, logistics and litigation-related costs, along with manufacturing productivity impacts.
Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which grew 5.1% organically despite the continued impact of semiconductor supply chain constraints. Our auto OEM business was flat year-on-year compared to the 20% decline in global car and light truck builds. This outperformance was due to a few factors.
First, we continue to grow our penetration by driving 3M innovation onto new automotive platforms. Second, we saw a notable increase in channel inventories at tier suppliers given the dramatic reductions in OEM's build forecast through the quarter. Lastly, we benefited from a vehicle model mix standpoint as auto OEMs produce more premium vehicles which tend to have higher 3M contact.
Our electronics-related business declined low single digits organically, with declines across consumer electronics, particularly smartphones and TVs as OEMs faced production challenges due to ongoing semiconductor constraints and COVID-related impacts. These declines were partially offset by continued strong demand for our products and solutions in semiconductor and factory automation end markets.
Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced materials and commercial solutions each grew double digits year-on-year, while transportation safety grew low single digits. Third quarter operating income was $465 million, down 9% year-on-year. Operating margins were 19%, down 320 basis points year-on-year driven by strong leverage on sales growth, which was more than offset by increases in raw materials and logistics costs along with manufacturing productivity impacts.
Turning to our Health Care business, which delivered third quarter organic sales growth of 3.3%. Our Medical Solutions business declined low single digits organically, impacted by the continued decline in demand for disposable respirators along with the pace of hospital elective procedure volumes, which came in at the low end of industry expectations of 90% to 95% for the quarter. Sales in our oral care business grew low double digits year-on-year as dental procedures continue to be near pre-COVID levels.
The separation and purification business increased high single digits year-on-year due to ongoing demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccines and therapeutics. Health Information Systems grew low double digits driven by strong growth in clinician solutions. And finally, food safety increased double digits as food service activity returns.
Health Care's third quarter operating income was $529 million, up 7% year-on-year. Operating margins were 23.5%, up 70 basis points. Third quarter margins were driven by leverage on sales growth, which is partially offset by the increasing raw materials and logistics costs, manufacturing productivity impacts, along with increased investments in growth.
Lastly, third quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was 7.6% year-on-year with continued strong sell-in and sell-out trends across most retail channels. Our home improvement business continues to perform well, up high single digits on top of a strong comparison from a year ago. This business continued to experience strong demand, particularly in our Command and Filtrete category-leading franchises.
Stationery and office grew double digits organically in Q3 as this business laps last year's COVID-related comparisons. We also had strong back-to-school consumer demand and holiday-related sell-in for Scotch-branded packaging and shipping products, Post-it solutions and Scotch-branded home and office states. Our home care business was up low single digits versus last year's strong COVID-driven comparison.
And finally, our consumer health and safety business was up high single digits as we lap COVID-related impacts from a year ago. Consumer's operating income was $332 million, down 3% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21.7%, down 260 basis points as increased cost for raw materials, logistics and outsourced hard goods manufacturing more than offset leverage from sales growth.
Please turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of our full year 2021 guidance. As we reflect on the macroeconomic environment, we expect demand to remain strong across most end markets. However, uncertainty persists given the ongoing impacts of the pandemic along with a well-known global supply chain, raw materials and logistics challenges that all companies are working through. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our customers and doing what is necessary to serve them as we continue to navigate the fluid environment.
Turning to guidance. We are increasing the bottom end of our expectations for organic growth. We now project our full year organic growth to be in the range of 8% to 9% versus a prior range of 6% to 9%. With respect to earnings, we anticipate a range of $9.70 to $9.90 per share as compared to a prior range of $9.70 to $10.10. And finally, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow. Therefore, we are maintaining our free cash flow conversion range of 90% to 100%.
This updated outlook implies a wider than normal fourth quarter range, accounting for ongoing impacts of COVID and the uncertain supply chain environment. For example, from a growth perspective, the well-known constraints in semiconductor chip supply are impacting more and more end markets, most notably, automotive and consumer electronics as reflected in the lower production forecast for the year.
We anticipate global elective health care procedure volumes to stabilize with recent trends. Relative to disposable respirators, we expect continued impacts from the decline in health care-related demand, along with elevated inventory levels in the industrial channel. And finally, we expect our pricing actions to continue to gain traction as we work to mitigate raw material and logistics cost pressures.
Turning to operations. As we have discussed, we are actively managing inefficiencies in global supply chains with a relentless focus on customer service. Therefore, we are adjusting demand plans with greater frequency and as a result, incurring more manufacturing production changeovers along with expediting shipments. All of these actions are impacting both cost and productivity, but we are taking the necessary steps to ensure we meet the most critical need of our customers.
We continue to make progress relative to December 2020 restructuring announcement. To date, we have incurred over $240 million in pretax restructuring charges and anticipate an additional $25 million to $50 million in Q4. We now expect total pretax restructuring charges of $300 million to $325 million versus our original expectations of $250 million to $300 million. We expect the remaining actions under this program to be initiated by the first quarter of 2022.
In addition, we expect to incur higher costs related to our ongoing litigation matters, along with increases in our other indirect related costs like travel expense. And finally, we continue to invest in the business for the long term, and therefore, anticipate increased investments in growth, productivity and sustainability.
To close, I would like to take a moment to thank our customers who have placed their faith in us, our vendors who are tirelessly working with us to ensure continuity of supply, and most importantly, our 90,000-plus 3Mers who continue to deliver for our customers. We have a very steady eye on the long term to deliver growth, margin and cash through strong operating rigor while continuing to navigate the uncertainty in the short run.
With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

And when you put all that together, we came in at the 20%.
If you look at where we ended up, I would say, inflation came in pretty much where we thought it was going to be. We executed on price. We have moved from 10 basis points of price increase in Q2 to 140 basis points in Q3. So that was pretty much in line, and we were able to execute more volumes. So we -- our vendors with the flow of supply, we were able to get good flow of supply. There's strong demand, as Mike said, and we were able to execute the demand.
As well as we control our expenses across the corporation to make sure that we were prioritizing on serving our customers and trying to mitigate the impact of inflation as much as we could. So put all that in, we came in at the 20% versus the range of 19% to 20% that I mentioned earlier."

If you follow the implied guide that we gave you, it's directionally very close. I think a couple of things on just the items you talked about, which was price raw.
We expect to continue to have continued momentum in price in the fourth quarter. You saw us again go up from 10 to 140 basis points, and we should see that go up as price continues to take hold across the various geographies and product lines, things that we have talked about before.
I would say we don't see the raw material or the inflation environment slowing down in any way. I think you're going to see that volatility. It's going to depend on what the holiday season does. It depends on what logistics costs are going to be. Our goal is to get to neutral. The question is going to be, how does raw materials at some point play itself out? And do we see a turn in some of the commodities like polypropylene, ethylene, et cetera, where we have seen a lot of inflation. I would say that's number one.
On your question, I think there was another point on bridge on revenue. I would just say, if you're looking 3 to 4Q, just remember, there are a couple of things that impact 3M. There's 1 less billing day from 3Q to 4Q. And secondly, you have a normal seasonality that you have in 3M as many of the factories with our industrial customers slow down during the holidays, and that's the impact. So I think I've answered your question, but if there's anything else, I'm happy to answer, Nigel."

The first, if you look at what we've done year-to-date, it's really been reflective of our innovation, something we've been talking about for some time. We outgrow the build rates. And even in a dynamic like this year where the build rates are swinging down as there were some challenges in the OEM production plans for Q3 and the outlook for Q4 being similar, we're continuing to drive our innovations, win spec-ins and design-in opportunities.
And then as Monish mentioned, the mix of vehicles in this kind of demand environment is more premium, which we have a higher level of penetration in those vehicles. We also have very good growth in our auto electrification priority growth platform and broadly and getting good traction, 40% year-to-date. So those are all driving that performance as we come through year-to-date. And we expect to be able to continue to outperform build rates as we go forward.
The channel -- everybody is challenged with matching up to the changes in production plans. And these are -- they're changing quickly, and the dynamic has been challenging for the supply chains, and I would say everyone in the value chain, to keep up with. We -- that said, we see inventory trying to track pretty well with that.
We don't see really -- in our results, we're not seeing a year-to-date impact from excess inventory. So it's really about matching up with where the mix is going, where the build rates are going. And again, we see good momentum in our portfolio against those build rates."

Overall, I would still say this is a short-term phenomenon. Long term, we are seeing good end market trends. And that's why you're seeing us continue to invest. So your point on the next piece, which is CapEx and where we were. I would say the areas that we would -- where we are looking to keep investing where in all the 3 buckets: growth, productivity and sustainability. And the cycle times to get CapEx raw material for these businesses is just taking longer than we had originally thought, and that's why we had to slow it down to 1.5 to 1.6.
But I would just end by -- your question by saying, Jeff, we are not done with the quarter. This team knows how to fight. We're going to keep doing whatever it takes to keep serving for our customers as long as the demand is there. And at the same time, the team is furiously working to make sure that we mitigate some of the raw material pressures that we have as well as keep investing for growth, productivity and sustainability.

And we sell to customers, about 50% of them exposed to exports, about 50% to the domestic market. And the exports are probably one of the areas that's hardest hit. So it's down about 10%. And looking forward, that's the expectation as we go forward to Q4.
So that will be one of the impacts. It's been one of the impacts being hurt most by the supply chain challenges. For us, our focus in China has really been very much in line with what we've been talking about as we came through the pandemic. We see market segments that are high growth, and we've been prioritizing investments there. And we see those growth trends continuing.

So I would say depending on how the litigation goes, do you see it bleed into '22? Yes, because the MDLs will all not be done by fourth quarter of 2021.
On disposable respirators, as we have talked about, depending on seeing how the pandemic has played itself out, we felt Q1 was peak. We had mentioned that even in our last earnings call. We have seen revenue consistently sequentially come down. You have seen we came down nearly 6% in DR in the third quarter. We see that further down between 75 to 125 on a year-over-year basis or 25 to 75 sequentially. And depending on where the pandemic goes, that will have an impact into 2022.
But again, we are seeing pockets where you are seeing COVID cases go up, where you're seeing demand go up and then in other cases, you're starting to see demand come down. So it's pretty dynamic on the disposable respirator side. But as we have talked before, we've got capacity of 2.5 billion respirators that we can ramp up very quickly.
The team has done a really nice job of managing this environment. In certain cases, we have shut down manufacturing lines.

In certain cases, we are working with contracts and the constraints in those contracts. And we put a pretty thoughtful approach to how we go after price increases.
How it goes into 2022, Scott, I think will also depend on where we see inflation going to be in '22 and beyond.

The highest growth as we came through the quarters in Latin America and Canada and up double digits across all business groups.
So again, similar to what we talked about in the way we're seeing year-to-date demand across 3M globally, broad-based across business groups in the Americas. And United States still in a strong position of 6% in the quarter and double digits for the year. EMEA, if you look at how we're doing there, we're growing high single digits for the year, 9%. 4% in the quarter.
We haven't seen a strong rebound in growth as other areas, but we are seeing a recovery now in Health Care, and Transportation and Electronics starting to help drive that growth that we are seeing. And in Asia Pacific, growing mid-teens year-to-date, double-digit growth across the business groups, all business groups again. And as I mentioned, we talked about China a bit. I mentioned Japan in prepared remarks. That's been one of the improving areas is Japan now starting to see improving growth as we come through the year.
So not down -- not near the pre-COVID levels yet, but again, starting to see some improvements. And in that case, also being led by Health Care. So we're seeing some -- I would say, the recovery of the elective procedures around the world being one of the dynamics that's helping to start driving improving growth."

And back to what Monish was talking about, how we're focused on delivering for customers, we're leveraging the strengths of our 3M model. The idea that we talked about in the prepared remarks, local for local, building our capabilities across our value model to the customers close to them regionally around the world. And that has been a strength as we come through COVID.
And I would say this year, as we deal with the interruption of the supply chain, this regional strategy has allowed us to be more agile in just what Monish was talking about, the changing nature of our production plans and our production wheels and our -- what we're doing in our factory. So we have a lot of flexibility built in.
I would say we're always evaluating how to better serve customers, how do we look at our lean value streams end to end, how do we take new strategies into that, getting -- based on, I would say, the improving visibility we have, we see opportunities to be more efficient and improve our cycle times and so on.
So we're always looking at changes. I do think the model that we have has served us well and that it's been a great place to respond to the challenges. And I think that's the foundation as we go ahead. It's how do we make that better, how do we drive better performance improving operational efficiency.

And then the bigger discussion around the industry is what does 2022 and beyond look like. The reason is a lot of these elective procedures that have been slowed down are elective, but they are still time-sensitive at the end of the day. So there's -- so that's what we'll have to see and see what capacity is added in all the countries. We have to see how cases go play out from a COVID perspective.
But I also think hospitals are far better equipped right now, are more prepared to deal with this. So our hope is that electric procedures come back up to 2019 levels in 2022. When it happens, I think, will depend on different parts of cases in the world, but that's how we see it."

The pandemic has impacted production, semiconductor shortages are impacting end markets for us, in particular.
And then we were also impacted, as we went through the year with some extreme weather events, which interrupted our raw material supply. Those are getting better. So some of the raw material supply issues that we are facing are getting better as we go. And we do expect supply chains to improve. It's difficult to estimate or predict the duration of each of these factors and how they play with each other and watching the congestion in logistics is one of the things that we are carefully looking for improvements in as well.
Can we move back to more normal logistics patterns for us as we go forward, that will be a good sign that broadly supply chain disruptions are improving.

So I'll just, again, just -- and my apologies, Andy, I am just going to reiterate our capital allocation priorities, just so that everyone's on the same page. Our first priority is always go organic. We just see it's the best use of our capital, best return. As you can see, we are not afraid to deploy capital. We have done that in 2020. We are continuing to do that in '21, which is investing in growth, productivity and sustainability.
We were going to spend $1.8 billion to $2 billion to this year, but with some of the supply chain constraints, it's down to $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. But we still believe in the long-term growth, and so we're going to keep investing in that.
As Mike had announced early in the year, we also announced $1 billion to improve for our sustainability efforts. That's going to be spent over the next 20 years, but it's front-end loaded. So that's the second piece on organic investment. Dividend is our second priority, important for our shareholders. So that's a priority that we clearly are focused on.
Our third priority is M&A. And you're right that we are integrating Acelity and the team is doing a very nice job by integrating Acelity into our business. At the same time, we have tons of ideas and we have a pipeline that we would be -- we'll execute when we see that we get a target that we believe can add value to our shareholders.
At the same time, it's things that we believe that we can add value to the target, too, by using some of the strengths that we have, which is our brand, our global capability, our employee base, our material science capability, et cetera. So that's our third, and we always have an active pipeline.
And then the last one is share buyback. You've seen we have now done $1.3 billion for the year. We did $527 million. That's the last priority for us from a deployment of capital perspective. But depending on the stock price and how much cash we generate, we clearly will look at that, too.
Overall, I would just say, when I look at net debt-to-EBITDA leverage, which is at approximately 1.3, at that point, it gives me a lot of financial strength and optionality. It gives 3M a lot of financial strength and optionality. So depending on what opportunities we see, we won't hesitate to deploy capital because as Mike mentioned, even some of the platforms that we've talked about, all of them are GDP plus growth platform. So that's an area we would love to keep investing."

I think year-to-date, we are approximately 31% on an EBITDA basis. The team -- Mojdeh and team have done a really nice job of continuing to drive margin. We increased margins 70 basis points in the third quarter. I would say it's a performance all around the oral care business and the snapback has definitely helped. It helps us on a volume. It helps us on leverage with the volume in the factories.
The MSD business, if you exclude the disposable respirator decline, grew very nicely in the second quarter and MSD is where Acelity is in there, too. Acelity was impacted in the third quarter by low elective procedures, but the integration is going well.
We are continuing to find synergies between the cross-selling that we can do with our wound care business and Acelity -- or our existing wound care business and Acelity. So we are very happy with that progress. But in the spirit of continuous improvement, there's always more we can do here to drive growth and margin, and Mojdeh and team are very focused on continuing to do that."

I think the big issue that we have seen is inflation has come in faster than anybody thought. And so the team has continuously done what it can to drive price increases. To the question that was even asked earlier, our goal is to get to neutral of price and raw, but I think it will all depend on how inflation goes. But the team knows how to drive price. The team drives a lot of innovation that also helps from a price increase perspective. So all that put together, team is working it pretty hard."

Our team executed well and delivered increased earnings, expanded margins and robust cash flow. From a macro perspective, the global economy continues to improve, though uncertainty remains due to COVID-19 and heightened concern over the increase in Delta variant cases. We saw ongoing strength in many end markets, including home improvement, oral care and general industrial, along with a pickup in health care elective procedures. We continue to work to mitigate ongoing inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges as well as end market dynamics such as the semiconductor shortage impacting automotive build rates and electronics. We are also beginning to see a decline in pandemic-related demand for disposable respirators, which I will discuss on the next slide. 
Looking forward, we will stay focused on investing in emerging growth opportunities, improving productivity and advancing sustainability. We are confident in our ability to continue executing well in the face of COVID-19 uncertainties and are raising our full year guidance for organic growth to 6% to 9%, and earnings per share to $9.70 to $10.10. 
Please turn to Slide 5. In the second quarter, we delivered total sales of $8.9 billion. We posted organic growth of 21% versus a 13% decline in last year's second quarter, along with earnings of $2.59 per share. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins to over 27% and increased adjusted free cash flow to $1.6 billion with a conversion rate of 103%. Strong cash flow allowed us to further strengthen our balance sheet while returning $1.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
I am proud of our team's execution in a dynamic environment. We are finding new ways to innovate for customers and improve our operational performance. In addition to our strong day-to-day execution, we are investing to capitalize on favorable market trends and serve emerging customer needs. I want to share a few impactful examples. 
In health care, our innovative PREVENA Therapy incision management system is the first and only medical device indicated by the U.S. FDA to help reduce surgical site infections in high-risk patients, helping lower the costly financial burden of complications, delivering on both improved clinical outcomes and cost savings for the health care system. 
In automotive electrification, we are building on 3M's long history in consumer electronics and now expanding our solutions for the future of transportation, including new display technologies for both electric and internal combustion engines, helping us drive above-market growth in our automotive business. 
In home improvement, we are building out a suite of innovations to help consumers personalize their homes, including our fast-growing line of command damage-free hanging solutions, $500 million franchise that leverages our world-class adhesive platform with even greater opportunities ahead. We have increased opportunities across our businesses to apply 3M science and drive long-term growth, and we will continue to invest and win in those areas. 
As you all have seen, the ongoing impact of COVID-19 is highly variable across geographies. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have increased our annual respirator production fourfold to 2.5 billion by activating idle surge capacity and building additional lines, while shifting 90% of distribution into health care to protect nurses, doctors and first responders. 
One of our strengths is to quickly adapt to changing marketplace needs. Global demand reached its peak in Q1 of this year, which included stockpiling from governments and hospitals. We are now seeing a deceleration in overall health care demand and are adjusting production, increasing supply to industrial and consumer channels while continuing to prioritize health care workers in the geographies seeing increased COVID-19 cases and elevated hospitalization rates. As we do this, we are reducing overall output to meet end-market trends. Like we have in the past, we are prepared to rapidly increase production in response to COVID-19-related needs or future emergencies when needed. 
As I reflect on the first half, I am pleased with our performance. We delivered strong sales and margin growth, along with good cash flow while building for the future and advancing sustainability with significant new carbon, water and plastic commitments. 
In the second half, in addition to investing in growth, productivity and sustainability, we also must navigate ongoing COVID-19 impacts and continue taking actions to address inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. We will do this by driving an unrelenting focus on operational performance, which includes improving service, quality, operating costs and cash generation. 
I would like to thank 3Mers for your commitment and resilience as we bring together people, ideas and science to help transform businesses, solve customer challenges and improve lives around the world. That wraps up my opening comments. 
And I'll turn it over to Monish to cover more details on the quarter and our updated guidance. Monish?"

Company-wide, second quarter sales were $8.9 billion, up 25% year-on-year or an increase of 21% on an organic basis. Sales growth, combined with operating rigor and disciplined cost management, drove adjusted operating income of $2 billion, up 40%, with adjusted operating margins of 22%, up 240 basis points year-on-year. 
Second quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings per share were $2.59, up 44% compared to last year's adjusted results. On this slide, you can see the components that impacted both operating margins and earnings per share as compared to Q2 last year. Our strong year-on-year organic volume growth, along with ongoing productivity, restructuring efforts and other items added 4.1 percentage points to operating margins and $0.89 to earnings per share year-on-year. 
Included in this margin and earnings benefit were a few items of note. First, during the quarter, the Brazilian Supreme Court issued a ruling that clarified the calculation of Brazil's federal sales-based social tax, essentially lowering the social tax that 3M should have paid in prior years. This favorable ruling added $91 million to operating income or 1 percentage points to operating margins and $0.12 to earnings per share. 
Next, as you will see later today in our 10-Q, we increased our other environmental liability by nearly $60 million and our respirator liabilities by approximately $20 million as part of our regular review. In addition, we also incurred a year-on-year increase in ongoing legal defense costs. We are currently scheduled to begin a PFAS-related trial in Michigan in October, along with the next step in the combat arms earplug multi-district litigation, with one trial in September and one in October. And finally, during the second quarter, we incurred a pretax restructuring charge of approximately $40 million as part of the program we announced in Q4 of last year. 
Second quarter net selling price and raw materials performance reduced both operating margins and earnings per share by 140 basis points and $0.17, respectively. This headwind was larger than forecasted as we experienced broad-based cost increases for chemicals, resins, outsourced manufacturing and logistics as the quarter progressed. As a result of these increasing cost trends, we now forecast a full year raw materials and logistics cost headwind in the range of $0.65 to $0.80 per share versus a prior expectation of $0.30 to $0.50. 
As we have discussed, we have been and are taking multiple actions including increasing selling prices to address these cost headwinds. As a result, we expect continued improvement in our selling price performance in the second half of the year. However, given the pace of cost increases, we currently expect a third quarter net selling price and raw materials headwind to margins in the range of 50 to 100 basis points, which we anticipate will turn to a net benefit in the fourth quarter as our selling price and other actions start catching up to the increased costs. 
Moving to divestiture impacts. The lost income from the sale of drug delivery in May of last year was a headwind of 10 basis points to operating margins and $0.02 to earnings per share. Foreign currency, net of hedging impacts, reduced margins 20 basis points while benefiting earnings by $0.08 per share. Finally, 3 nonoperating items combined had a net neutral impact to earnings per share year-on-year. This result included a $0.06 earnings benefit from lower other expenses that was offset by higher tax rate and diluted share count, which were each a headwind of $0.03 per share versus last year. 
Please turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. We delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with second quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.6 billion, up 2% year-on-year, along with conversion of 103%. Our year-on-year free cash flow performance was driven by strong double-digit growth in sales and income, which was mostly offset by timing of an income tax payment of approximately $400 million in last year's Q3, which is traditionally paid in Q2. 
Through the first half of the year, we increased adjusted free cash flow to $3 billion versus $2.5 billion last year. Second quarter capital expenditures were $394 million and approximately $700 million year-to-date. For the full year, we are currently tracking to the low end of our expected CapEx range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, given vendor constraints and the pace of capital projects. 
During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $858 million and share repurchases of $503 million. Year-to-date, we have returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our strong cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to strengthen our capital structure. 
We ended the quarter with $12.7 billion in net debt, a reduction of $3.5 billion since the end of Q2 last year. As a result, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has declined from 1.9 a year ago to 1.3 at the end of Q2. Our net debt position, along with our strong cash flow generation capability, continues to provide us financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. 
Please turn to Slide 8, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q2. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 18% year-on-year in the second quarter driven by improving industrial manufacturing activity and prior year pandemic impacts. 
First, starting with our personal safety business, we posted double-digit organic growth in our head, face, hearing and fall protection solutions as demand in general industrial and construction end markets remained strong. However, this growth was more than offset by a decline in our overall respiratory portfolio due to last year's strong COVID-related demand resulting in an organic sales decline of low single digits for our personal safety business. 
Within our respiratory portfolio, second quarter disposable respirator sales increased 3% year-on-year but declined 11% sequentially as COVID-related hospitalizations declined. Looking ahead, we anticipate continued deceleration in disposable respirator demand through the balance of this year and into 2022. 
Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Organic growth was broad-based, led by double-digit increases in automotive aftermarket, roofing granules, abrasives, adhesives and tapes and electrical markets. Safety and Industrial's second quarter operating income was $718 million, up 15% versus last year. Operating margins were 22.1%, down 130 basis points year-on-year as leverage on sales growth was more than offset by increases in raw materials, logistics and ongoing legal costs.
Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which grew 24% organically despite sustained challenges from semiconductor supply chain constraints. Organic growth was led by our auto OEM business, up 76% year-on-year compared to a 49% increase in global car and light truck builds. This outperformance was due to several factors. First, the regional mix of year-on-year growth in car and light truck builds were in regions where we have high dollar content per vehicle. Second, a year-on-year increase in sell-in of 3M product versus the change in build rate. Lastly, we continue to apply 3M innovation to vehicles, gaining penetration onto new platforms. 
Our electronics-related business was up double digits organically, with continued strength in semiconductor, factory automation and data centers, along with consumer electronic devices, namely tablets and TVs. Looking ahead, we continue to monitor the global semiconductor supply chain and its potential impact on the electronics and automotive industries. 
Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced materials, commercial solutions and transportation safety each grew double digits year-on-year. Second quarter operating income was $546 million, up over 50% year-on-year. Operating margins were 22%, up 340 basis points year-on-year driven by strong leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by increases in raw materials and logistic costs. 
Turning to our Health Care business, which delivered second quarter organic sales growth of 23%. Organic growth was driven by continued year-on-year and sequential improvements in health care elective procedure volumes as COVID-related hospitalizations decline. Our Medical Solutions business grew mid-teens organically or up approximately 20%, excluding the decline in disposable respirator demand. I am pleased with the performance of Acelity, which grew nearly 20% organically in the quarter as it helps us build on our leadership in advanced wound care. 
Sales in our Oral Care business more than doubled from a year ago as patient visits have nearly returned to pre-COVID levels. The separation and purification business increased 10% year-on-year due to ongoing demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccine and therapeutics, along with improving demand for water filtration solutions. Health information systems grew high single digits, driven by strong growth in clinician solutions. And finally, food safety increased double digits organically as food safety (sic) [ services ] activity returns, along with continued strong growth from new product introduction. 
Health care's second quarter operating income was $576 million, up over 90% year-on-year. Operating margins were 25.3%, up 880 basis points. Second quarter margins were driven by leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by increasing raw materials and logistics costs, along with increased investments in growth. Lastly, second quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was 18% year-on-year with strong sell-in and sell-out trends across most retail channels. Our home improvement business continues to perform well, up high teens organically on top of a strong comparison from a year ago. This business continued to experience strong demand in many of our category-leading franchises, particularly Command, Filtrete and Meguiar's. Stationery and office grew strong double digits organically in Q2 as this business laps last year's COVID-related comparisons. We continue to see strength in consumer demand for Scotch branded packaging and shipping products, along with improved sell-in trends in Post-it Solutions and Scotch branded home and office tapes as retailers prepare for back-to-school and return to workplace. 
Our Home Care business was up low single digits organically versus last year's strong COVID-driven comparison. And finally, our Consumer health and safety business was up double digits as we lap COVID-related impacts from a year ago, along with improved supply of safety products for our retail customers. 
Consumer's operating income was $311 million, up 12% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21%, down 160 basis points as increased costs for raw materials, logistics and outsourced hardgoods manufacturing, along with investments in advertising and merchandising more than offset leverage from sales growth. 
Please turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of our full year 2021 guidance. While uncertainty remains, we expect global economic and end market growth to remain strong, however, continue to be fluid as the world wrestles with ongoing COVID-related impacts that we all see and monitor. Therefore, there are a number of items that will need to be navigated as we go through the second half of the year. For example, we anticipate continued sequential improvement in health care elective procedure volumes. Also, we expect ongoing strength in the home improvement market and currently anticipate students returning to classrooms and more people returning to the workplace. 
Next, we remain focused on driving innovation and penetration with our global auto OEM and electronics customers. These 2 end markets continue to converge as highlighted by the well-known constraints in semiconductor chip supply. This limited chip supply is expected to reduce year-on-year automotive and electronics production volumes in the second half. As mentioned earlier, we expect demand for disposable respirators to wane and negatively impact second half revenues by approximately $100 million to $300 million year-on-year. 
Turning to raw materials and logistics. As noted, we anticipate a year-on-year earnings headwind of $0.65 to $0.80 per share for the full year or $0.40 to $0.55 in the second half due to rising cost pressures. We are taking a number of actions, including broad-based selling price increases to help mitigate this headwind. And finally, the restructuring program we announced last December remains on track. As part of this program, we expect to incur a pretax charge in the range of $60 million to $110 million in the second half of this year. 
Thus, taking into account our first half performance, along with these factors, we are raising our full year guidance for both organic growth and earnings per share. Organic growth is estimated to be 6% to 9%, up from the previous range of 3% to 6%. We now anticipate earnings of $9.70 to $10.10 per share against a prior range of $9.20 to $9.70. Also, as you can see, we now expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 90% to 100% versus our prior range of 95% to 105%. This adjustment is primarily due to ongoing challenges in global supply chains, raw materials and logistics, which are expected to persist for some time. 
Turning to the third quarter. Let me highlight a few items of note. First, we currently anticipate continued improvement in health care elective procedure volumes across most parts of the world. Global smartphone shipments are expected to be down high single digits year-on-year, while global car and light truck builds are expect to be down 3% year-on-year. Relative to disposable respirators, we anticipate a year-on-year reduction in sales of $50 million to $100 million due to continued decline in global demand. 
As mentioned earlier, we are anticipating a third quarter year-on-year operating margin headwind of 50 to 100 basis points from selling prices, net of higher raw materials and logistic costs. On the restructuring front, which I previously discussed, we expect a Q3 pretax charge in the range of $50 million to $75 million as a part of this program. And finally, we expect higher investments in growth, productivity and sustainability in the quarter, along with higher legal defense costs as proceedings progress. 
To wrap up, our team has delivered a strong first half performance, including broad-based growth, good operational execution, robust cash flows and an enhanced capital structure. With that being said, there's always more we can do and will do. We continue to prioritize capital to our greatest opportunities for growth, productivity and sustainability, while remaining focused on delivering for our customers, improving operating rigor and enhancing daily management. 
I want to thank our customers and vendors for their ongoing loyalty and partnership and especially our employees for their dedication, perseverance and execution in these uncertain times. 
With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

You've seen what we have said we'll do in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. To answer your question specifically on the second quarter, you hit on one point, which is a comp issue from year-over-year. But the second piece of this was also as the volumes came in pretty strong in the second quarter, we had some rebates that get accounted for with that extra volume, and that drove it. But when you reflect on the guide that we gave you, price pretty much came in where we had thought. It's just slightly lower than that. So we were expecting this."

I would just start with the team has done a really nice job of continuing to drive margins up while still investing in the business. The sharp increase on a year-over-year basis is driven by a lot of the volume increase that you saw Q2 of last year versus Q2 of this year. Third, I would say the volume leverage has helped. But we still got hurt by raw materials and logistics costs, and we continue to invest in the business. 
I would -- to answer your specific question on what does it look like going forward, I think it all comes down to ultimately where does volume turn out to be. As I said in my prepared remarks that disposable respirators are starting to slow down. You're seeing a Q3 impact of $50 million to $100 million on a year-over-year basis and $100 million to $300 million for the second half. Some -- many -- most of that should hit the Health Care segment. So we'll see where volume plays itself out. 
But secondly, I think is how much investments we keep driving as we see hospitalizations increase and elective procedures go up. So I think it's going to be a trade between that. Overall, I would say the team and I, we all believe in continuous improvement. So we're going to keep driving productivity, continuing to reduce cost, investing where we think it's the right place to invest and driving efficiency in SG&A as much as we can."

Industrial, more broadly, generally improving as we go in the second half. We talked about it in the first half, we saw broad-based growth across geographies, and we expect this to continue it. The uncertainty there is COVID and the impact on any increases in cases and hospitalizations. There are certainly some areas around the world where we're seeing that.

Now if you look at where our channel inventories today, this is something we're always asking ourselves. It's a dynamic that we are continuously measuring and assessing every region of the world. And I would say, given the dynamics in the marketplace, the snapback in the economy, the fluid and uneven market dynamics, it's difficult to know what the right level is today. We get visibility on where our sell-in and sell-out is. With that snapback in demand, it's hard to get clear visibility on levels -- appropriate levels of inventory. There are some areas, of course, that are very visible, the ongoing semiconductor chip shortages, and they're impacting production volumes, and we are -- we see our inventory in the channel aligning with that. 
We've talked quite a bit about the visibility we're putting on N95 respirators specifically. But beyond that, it's really going to depend on how demand plays out in each market to really get a view as we go through third quarter of where inventory in the channel sits."

I think, Julian, it's a great question on Safety and Industrial. So to answer your specific question first on the impact, could it be negative on a year-over-year basis? As we said, and just a reminder, in 2019, we used to have revenue approximately $600 million of disposable respirators that went up to $1.4 billion in 2020. And as I look at the second half, we told you there could be a risk of $100 million to $300 million, which is the range of where we think disposable respirator volume would come down on a year-over-year basis. And if we go to that higher end of the range, which is $300 million, yes, the answer is you could definitely see negative volumes. 
What we have been doing as a part of this as health care demand has waned due to lower hospitalizations due to COVID and increase in electives is we have been moving production out from the hospital channel to different parts, which is industrial and governments, which we are actively doing. The other piece of safety and Industrial is, as I mentioned in Q2, we have seen growth in quite a few other segments of Safety and Industrial, whether it's in our respiratory portfolio with our safety portfolio, with head and face masks, whether you've seen us increase in our abrasive business, in our adhesives business, our roofing granules. So all the other segments, automotive aftermarket, have seen increase. And depending on how the economy plays itself out, and as long as industrial activity continues, you should see continued growth in those areas. And our current assumption is that long term, those markets will come back. I think it's going to be a little fluid in the second half, depending on how COVID plays itself out. 
To answer your second question on margin, you're right, as we have seen in 2019 versus '20, we did get benefited a lot by the volume leverage that we got across Safety and Industrial. So ultimately, where volume lands in the second half will have an impact on where margins ultimately go. We are actively working on price increases, broad-based in that segment. It's -- how much of that is offset by price and -- raws and logistics cost is the second offset. And the third one is the ongoing legal fees or reserves that we have taken, will be the third one. And then the last one, I would say, is what do we invest in growth, productivity and sustainability and especially growth. Because as industrial activity goes up in '22 and '23, we're going to continue to invest in that segment. So put all that together, that's how we see where margins are going to land."

I think you're going to see volatility as we get through the second half with what happens with COVID. So a couple of items to note. We believe that elective procedures will continue to go up quarter-over-quarter. But in some parts of the world, you could see it go down. 
Secondly, I would say auto does show an increase. It's still on a year-over-year headwind, down 3% in the third quarter. And if my memory is right, it's projected to be down 3.7% in the fourth quarter. I think the semiconductor shortages will have an impact on what happens there, and we'll see where that plays itself out. 
Smartphone shipments are supposed to be down on a year-over-year basis. We'll see where it land sequentially. And then tablets and TVs, which also benefited tremendously last year are also projected to be down on a year-over-year basis, but hard to quantify what exactly it looks like on a sequential basis. You have seen us -- you have seen a pretty good increase in stationery and office supply in the second quarter. That momentum is there right now, where we are seeing sell-in trends as retailers are planning to have people -- more people return to the workplace, kids in school. But depending on how the pandemic plays out, that could have an impact. 
And then on Safety and Industrial, as I mentioned in the prior question, I think there's an assumption that industrial activity continues. But currently, the supply chain shortages across the world also put a lot of variability onto what that demand looks like. And that's why when we put all that together, we said we are prudent to call the year at 6% to 9% for the year versus the 3% to 6% that we had said earlier. But overall, I would -- go ahead."

For example, I would tell you, when we first gave our guide of $0.30 to $0.50, which has now been guided to $0.65 to $0.80, I would tell you, what we have seen is a broad-based increase in all commodities, whether it is polypropylene, chemical, resins. We are seeing in our outsourced manufacturing goods, not just the labor costs, but other commodities that go into that also getting passed. And then logistics costs has continued to be a pretty strong headwind. 
Where that will peak, I think, in my view, and I may be wrong here, at some point, demand and supply need to start settling itself out. There's a lot of demand. There's not enough supply based on all the V-shape recovery with the congestion in the ports, et cetera. And until that stabilizes itself out, I think we're going to continue to see inflation. We have seen where crude prices have gone up much heavier than we had thought coming into the year. Polypropylene has remained strong or heavy inflationary. Ocean rates have gone up a lot in the last 3 to 6 months. So it's really hard for us to come back and say when does it peak and when it would start coming down. 
So we have taken what we know. We have put in all the factors that we know. We've had a prediction of where we think these things could go. And we have come up with $0.65 to $0.80, which currently is our best guide of where we think inflation is going to be. But with that said, as I've mentioned, we are taking broad-based price increases everywhere to help offset the mitigation of this. We are also increasing yield. We are working with our suppliers to reduce prices, et cetera. And then in -- so third quarter, we'll see a headwind of 50 to 100 basis points price versus raw.

And we -- as you know, we built additional capacity as we went through 2020. By the end of the year, we were at a run rate of 2.5 billion N95 respirators on an annual basis. And so that's the capacity we come into the year. Other manufacturers build capacity as well to respond to the pandemic. And I think you see some of them idling some of their capacity as demand comes off the peak. 
And we'll begin that process as well to idle lines to be ready for the next emergency or changes in COVID-19. I mean we can ramp up quickly. So our strategy is to be in a position to be a leader in personal safety -- personal protective equipment in normal times. And that's really serving the broader industrial markets, serving consumer markets, serving health care markets, and that's our strategy for where we manufacture and the volumes. And then we have that idle capacity so we can surge in times of emergency. 
I think we're in a better position than ever before globally to be able to respond to a pandemic. And I would add, it's been good to see governments following through on their commitments to stockpile. That's something that we have a number of efforts underway around the world that we're supporting as we've come through the first half of the year. So that, I think, prepares the world better for the next emergency, the next pandemic. So it's going to -- it will depend. When you look at where are we going to end up with respirator demand, we think we'll end up somewhere above where we were prepandemic. As use and protocols are changing around the world, we'll be well aligned to serve that. Our brand will be strong. We've got a leading brand position in PPE and can -- and really take advantage of that position around the world. 
And so I think we've got the model well aligned. I think there's a surge capacity that will be available. How much will depend both on the demand that comes in any kind of future emergency. And I think we're -- like I said, we're ready for our part of that."

I -- like I highlighted for the broader business, we saw broad-based growth, double-digit growth in our Transportation and Electronics, our Safety and Industrial and our Health Care businesses. Consumer was up mid-single digits as we came through the quarter. And our growth was led by general industrial, some of the segments that are growing there, including our abrasives portfolio, auto, OEM had strong growth and electronics. It's an important market for us. It's 10% of our total revenue. It grew over 20% in the first half. Last year, second quarter, we saw 3% growth. So China recovered, if you remember, ahead of other regions around the world. 
And when you look at the second half, comparisons start to get a little more challenging. And so we're expecting just year-over-year comps, I would say, we expect to see a little more challenge there. We still see opportunities for growth across our businesses in some of the same areas that we've highlighted on a global basis. Automotive will continue to be a focus, penetrating with the OEMs there. And we see -- even though it's our smallest business, we see significant opportunities to serve Chinese consumers through our Consumer business, especially in areas like air and water quality. So it's -- we see opportunities, maybe a more challenging year-over-year comp, but still opportunities for growth."

The question is where does second half volumes land as well as we've given you the range on disposable respirators are going to be down $100 million to $300 million on a year-over-year basis. The team continues to drive operating rigor, so driving productivity and efficiency across the supply chain. We are going after price increases, and our anticipation is that in the fourth quarter, we should be able to offset the price -- the raw and logistics cost impact. 
So I would boil it down to saying what margin will come down to in the second half and what incrementals are will depend on the volume, will depend on our ability to offset the price -- the raw and logistics pressure through price increase, continued productivity and good execution by the 3M team. 
And then finally, our decision on how much we're going to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability, plus a lot of these indirects that start snapping back, as hopefully, people start traveling. You've seen we've been very disciplined in the first half of making sure that we didn't spend ahead of what volumes come back. But as we see volumes coming back in, you're going to see those indirect start snapping back up. And then the last one is the legal fees and continuing to do what we think is right to protect ourselves as these cases go through. So that's all the factors that will ultimately impact what the incrementals are going to be."

Our team executed well and delivered increased earnings, expanded margins and robust cash flow. From a macro perspective, the global economy continues to improve, though uncertainty remains due to COVID-19 and heightened concern over the increase in Delta variant cases. We saw ongoing strength in many end markets, including home improvement, oral care and general industrial, along with a pickup in health care elective procedures. We continue to work to mitigate ongoing inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges as well as end market dynamics such as the semiconductor shortage impacting automotive build rates and electronics. We are also beginning to see a decline in pandemic-related demand for disposable respirators, which I will discuss on the next slide. 
Looking forward, we will stay focused on investing in emerging growth opportunities, improving productivity and advancing sustainability. We are confident in our ability to continue executing well in the face of COVID-19 uncertainties and are raising our full year guidance for organic growth to 6% to 9%, and earnings per share to $9.70 to $10.10. 
Please turn to Slide 5. In the second quarter, we delivered total sales of $8.9 billion. We posted organic growth of 21% versus a 13% decline in last year's second quarter, along with earnings of $2.59 per share. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins to over 27% and increased adjusted free cash flow to $1.6 billion with a conversion rate of 103%. Strong cash flow allowed us to further strengthen our balance sheet while returning $1.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
I am proud of our team's execution in a dynamic environment. We are finding new ways to innovate for customers and improve our operational performance. In addition to our strong day-to-day execution, we are investing to capitalize on favorable market trends and serve emerging customer needs. I want to share a few impactful examples. 
In health care, our innovative PREVENA Therapy incision management system is the first and only medical device indicated by the U.S. FDA to help reduce surgical site infections in high-risk patients, helping lower the costly financial burden of complications, delivering on both improved clinical outcomes and cost savings for the health care system. 
In automotive electrification, we are building on 3M's long history in consumer electronics and now expanding our solutions for the future of transportation, including new display technologies for both electric and internal combustion engines, helping us drive above-market growth in our automotive business. 
In home improvement, we are building out a suite of innovations to help consumers personalize their homes, including our fast-growing line of command damage-free hanging solutions, $500 million franchise that leverages our world-class adhesive platform with even greater opportunities ahead. We have increased opportunities across our businesses to apply 3M science and drive long-term growth, and we will continue to invest and win in those areas. 
As you all have seen, the ongoing impact of COVID-19 is highly variable across geographies. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have increased our annual respirator production fourfold to 2.5 billion by activating idle surge capacity and building additional lines, while shifting 90% of distribution into health care to protect nurses, doctors and first responders. 
One of our strengths is to quickly adapt to changing marketplace needs. Global demand reached its peak in Q1 of this year, which included stockpiling from governments and hospitals. We are now seeing a deceleration in overall health care demand and are adjusting production, increasing supply to industrial and consumer channels while continuing to prioritize health care workers in the geographies seeing increased COVID-19 cases and elevated hospitalization rates. As we do this, we are reducing overall output to meet end-market trends. Like we have in the past, we are prepared to rapidly increase production in response to COVID-19-related needs or future emergencies when needed. 
As I reflect on the first half, I am pleased with our performance. We delivered strong sales and margin growth, along with good cash flow while building for the future and advancing sustainability with significant new carbon, water and plastic commitments. 
In the second half, in addition to investing in growth, productivity and sustainability, we also must navigate ongoing COVID-19 impacts and continue taking actions to address inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. We will do this by driving an unrelenting focus on operational performance, which includes improving service, quality, operating costs and cash generation. 
I would like to thank 3Mers for your commitment and resilience as we bring together people, ideas and science to help transform businesses, solve customer challenges and improve lives around the world. That wraps up my opening comments. 
And I'll turn it over to Monish to cover more details on the quarter and our updated guidance. Monish?"

Company-wide, second quarter sales were $8.9 billion, up 25% year-on-year or an increase of 21% on an organic basis. Sales growth, combined with operating rigor and disciplined cost management, drove adjusted operating income of $2 billion, up 40%, with adjusted operating margins of 22%, up 240 basis points year-on-year. 
Second quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings per share were $2.59, up 44% compared to last year's adjusted results. On this slide, you can see the components that impacted both operating margins and earnings per share as compared to Q2 last year. Our strong year-on-year organic volume growth, along with ongoing productivity, restructuring efforts and other items added 4.1 percentage points to operating margins and $0.89 to earnings per share year-on-year. 
Included in this margin and earnings benefit were a few items of note. First, during the quarter, the Brazilian Supreme Court issued a ruling that clarified the calculation of Brazil's federal sales-based social tax, essentially lowering the social tax that 3M should have paid in prior years. This favorable ruling added $91 million to operating income or 1 percentage points to operating margins and $0.12 to earnings per share. 
Next, as you will see later today in our 10-Q, we increased our other environmental liability by nearly $60 million and our respirator liabilities by approximately $20 million as part of our regular review. In addition, we also incurred a year-on-year increase in ongoing legal defense costs. We are currently scheduled to begin a PFAS-related trial in Michigan in October, along with the next step in the combat arms earplug multi-district litigation, with one trial in September and one in October. And finally, during the second quarter, we incurred a pretax restructuring charge of approximately $40 million as part of the program we announced in Q4 of last year. 
Second quarter net selling price and raw materials performance reduced both operating margins and earnings per share by 140 basis points and $0.17, respectively. This headwind was larger than forecasted as we experienced broad-based cost increases for chemicals, resins, outsourced manufacturing and logistics as the quarter progressed. As a result of these increasing cost trends, we now forecast a full year raw materials and logistics cost headwind in the range of $0.65 to $0.80 per share versus a prior expectation of $0.30 to $0.50. 
As we have discussed, we have been and are taking multiple actions including increasing selling prices to address these cost headwinds. As a result, we expect continued improvement in our selling price performance in the second half of the year. However, given the pace of cost increases, we currently expect a third quarter net selling price and raw materials headwind to margins in the range of 50 to 100 basis points, which we anticipate will turn to a net benefit in the fourth quarter as our selling price and other actions start catching up to the increased costs. 
Moving to divestiture impacts. The lost income from the sale of drug delivery in May of last year was a headwind of 10 basis points to operating margins and $0.02 to earnings per share. Foreign currency, net of hedging impacts, reduced margins 20 basis points while benefiting earnings by $0.08 per share. Finally, 3 nonoperating items combined had a net neutral impact to earnings per share year-on-year. This result included a $0.06 earnings benefit from lower other expenses that was offset by higher tax rate and diluted share count, which were each a headwind of $0.03 per share versus last year. 
Please turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. We delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with second quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.6 billion, up 2% year-on-year, along with conversion of 103%. Our year-on-year free cash flow performance was driven by strong double-digit growth in sales and income, which was mostly offset by timing of an income tax payment of approximately $400 million in last year's Q3, which is traditionally paid in Q2. 
Through the first half of the year, we increased adjusted free cash flow to $3 billion versus $2.5 billion last year. Second quarter capital expenditures were $394 million and approximately $700 million year-to-date. For the full year, we are currently tracking to the low end of our expected CapEx range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, given vendor constraints and the pace of capital projects. 
During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $858 million and share repurchases of $503 million. Year-to-date, we have returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our strong cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to strengthen our capital structure. 
We ended the quarter with $12.7 billion in net debt, a reduction of $3.5 billion since the end of Q2 last year. As a result, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has declined from 1.9 a year ago to 1.3 at the end of Q2. Our net debt position, along with our strong cash flow generation capability, continues to provide us financial flexibility to invest in our business, pursue strategic opportunities and return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. 
Please turn to Slide 8, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q2. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted organic growth of 18% year-on-year in the second quarter driven by improving industrial manufacturing activity and prior year pandemic impacts. 
First, starting with our personal safety business, we posted double-digit organic growth in our head, face, hearing and fall protection solutions as demand in general industrial and construction end markets remained strong. However, this growth was more than offset by a decline in our overall respiratory portfolio due to last year's strong COVID-related demand resulting in an organic sales decline of low single digits for our personal safety business. 
Within our respiratory portfolio, second quarter disposable respirator sales increased 3% year-on-year but declined 11% sequentially as COVID-related hospitalizations declined. Looking ahead, we anticipate continued deceleration in disposable respirator demand through the balance of this year and into 2022. 
Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Organic growth was broad-based, led by double-digit increases in automotive aftermarket, roofing granules, abrasives, adhesives and tapes and electrical markets. Safety and Industrial's second quarter operating income was $718 million, up 15% versus last year. Operating margins were 22.1%, down 130 basis points year-on-year as leverage on sales growth was more than offset by increases in raw materials, logistics and ongoing legal costs.
Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which grew 24% organically despite sustained challenges from semiconductor supply chain constraints. Organic growth was led by our auto OEM business, up 76% year-on-year compared to a 49% increase in global car and light truck builds. This outperformance was due to several factors. First, the regional mix of year-on-year growth in car and light truck builds were in regions where we have high dollar content per vehicle. Second, a year-on-year increase in sell-in of 3M product versus the change in build rate. Lastly, we continue to apply 3M innovation to vehicles, gaining penetration onto new platforms. 
Our electronics-related business was up double digits organically, with continued strength in semiconductor, factory automation and data centers, along with consumer electronic devices, namely tablets and TVs. Looking ahead, we continue to monitor the global semiconductor supply chain and its potential impact on the electronics and automotive industries. 
Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced materials, commercial solutions and transportation safety each grew double digits year-on-year. Second quarter operating income was $546 million, up over 50% year-on-year. Operating margins were 22%, up 340 basis points year-on-year driven by strong leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by increases in raw materials and logistic costs. 
Turning to our Health Care business, which delivered second quarter organic sales growth of 23%. Organic growth was driven by continued year-on-year and sequential improvements in health care elective procedure volumes as COVID-related hospitalizations decline. Our Medical Solutions business grew mid-teens organically or up approximately 20%, excluding the decline in disposable respirator demand. I am pleased with the performance of Acelity, which grew nearly 20% organically in the quarter as it helps us build on our leadership in advanced wound care. 
Sales in our Oral Care business more than doubled from a year ago as patient visits have nearly returned to pre-COVID levels. The separation and purification business increased 10% year-on-year due to ongoing demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccine and therapeutics, along with improving demand for water filtration solutions. Health information systems grew high single digits, driven by strong growth in clinician solutions. And finally, food safety increased double digits organically as food safety (sic) [ services ] activity returns, along with continued strong growth from new product introduction. 
Health care's second quarter operating income was $576 million, up over 90% year-on-year. Operating margins were 25.3%, up 880 basis points. Second quarter margins were driven by leverage on sales growth, which was partially offset by increasing raw materials and logistics costs, along with increased investments in growth. Lastly, second quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was 18% year-on-year with strong sell-in and sell-out trends across most retail channels. Our home improvement business continues to perform well, up high teens organically on top of a strong comparison from a year ago. This business continued to experience strong demand in many of our category-leading franchises, particularly Command, Filtrete and Meguiar's. Stationery and office grew strong double digits organically in Q2 as this business laps last year's COVID-related comparisons. We continue to see strength in consumer demand for Scotch branded packaging and shipping products, along with improved sell-in trends in Post-it Solutions and Scotch branded home and office tapes as retailers prepare for back-to-school and return to workplace. 
Our Home Care business was up low single digits organically versus last year's strong COVID-driven comparison. And finally, our Consumer health and safety business was up double digits as we lap COVID-related impacts from a year ago, along with improved supply of safety products for our retail customers. 
Consumer's operating income was $311 million, up 12% year-on-year. Operating margins were 21%, down 160 basis points as increased costs for raw materials, logistics and outsourced hardgoods manufacturing, along with investments in advertising and merchandising more than offset leverage from sales growth. 
Please turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of our full year 2021 guidance. While uncertainty remains, we expect global economic and end market growth to remain strong, however, continue to be fluid as the world wrestles with ongoing COVID-related impacts that we all see and monitor. Therefore, there are a number of items that will need to be navigated as we go through the second half of the year. For example, we anticipate continued sequential improvement in health care elective procedure volumes. Also, we expect ongoing strength in the home improvement market and currently anticipate students returning to classrooms and more people returning to the workplace. 
Next, we remain focused on driving innovation and penetration with our global auto OEM and electronics customers. These 2 end markets continue to converge as highlighted by the well-known constraints in semiconductor chip supply. This limited chip supply is expected to reduce year-on-year automotive and electronics production volumes in the second half. As mentioned earlier, we expect demand for disposable respirators to wane and negatively impact second half revenues by approximately $100 million to $300 million year-on-year. 
Turning to raw materials and logistics. As noted, we anticipate a year-on-year earnings headwind of $0.65 to $0.80 per share for the full year or $0.40 to $0.55 in the second half due to rising cost pressures. We are taking a number of actions, including broad-based selling price increases to help mitigate this headwind. And finally, the restructuring program we announced last December remains on track. As part of this program, we expect to incur a pretax charge in the range of $60 million to $110 million in the second half of this year. 
Thus, taking into account our first half performance, along with these factors, we are raising our full year guidance for both organic growth and earnings per share. Organic growth is estimated to be 6% to 9%, up from the previous range of 3% to 6%. We now anticipate earnings of $9.70 to $10.10 per share against a prior range of $9.20 to $9.70. Also, as you can see, we now expect free cash flow conversion in the range of 90% to 100% versus our prior range of 95% to 105%. This adjustment is primarily due to ongoing challenges in global supply chains, raw materials and logistics, which are expected to persist for some time. 
Turning to the third quarter. Let me highlight a few items of note. First, we currently anticipate continued improvement in health care elective procedure volumes across most parts of the world. Global smartphone shipments are expected to be down high single digits year-on-year, while global car and light truck builds are expect to be down 3% year-on-year. Relative to disposable respirators, we anticipate a year-on-year reduction in sales of $50 million to $100 million due to continued decline in global demand. 
As mentioned earlier, we are anticipating a third quarter year-on-year operating margin headwind of 50 to 100 basis points from selling prices, net of higher raw materials and logistic costs. On the restructuring front, which I previously discussed, we expect a Q3 pretax charge in the range of $50 million to $75 million as a part of this program. And finally, we expect higher investments in growth, productivity and sustainability in the quarter, along with higher legal defense costs as proceedings progress. 
To wrap up, our team has delivered a strong first half performance, including broad-based growth, good operational execution, robust cash flows and an enhanced capital structure. With that being said, there's always more we can do and will do. We continue to prioritize capital to our greatest opportunities for growth, productivity and sustainability, while remaining focused on delivering for our customers, improving operating rigor and enhancing daily management. 
I want to thank our customers and vendors for their ongoing loyalty and partnership and especially our employees for their dedication, perseverance and execution in these uncertain times. 
With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions."

I would just start with the team has done a really nice job of continuing to drive margins up while still investing in the business. The sharp increase on a year-over-year basis is driven by a lot of the volume increase that you saw Q2 of last year versus Q2 of this year. Third, I would say the volume leverage has helped. But we still got hurt by raw materials and logistics costs, and we continue to invest in the business. 
I would -- to answer your specific question on what does it look like going forward, I think it all comes down to ultimately where does volume turn out to be. As I said in my prepared remarks that disposable respirators are starting to slow down. You're seeing a Q3 impact of $50 million to $100 million on a year-over-year basis and $100 million to $300 million for the second half. Some -- many -- most of that should hit the Health Care segment. So we'll see where volume plays itself out. 
But secondly, I think is how much investments we keep driving as we see hospitalizations increase and elective procedures go up. So I think it's going to be a trade between that. Overall, I would say the team and I, we all believe in continuous improvement. So we're going to keep driving productivity, continuing to reduce cost, investing where we think it's the right place to invest and driving efficiency in SG&A as much as we can."

So we don't see any acquisitions of the size of Acelity in the near future, but we have an active pipeline of a number of things.

We expect and are seeing continued increase in elective procedures in health care, home improvement expected to remain strong. 
Industrial, more broadly, generally improving as we go in the second half. We talked about it in the first half, we saw broad-based growth across geographies, and we expect this to continue it. The uncertainty there is COVID and the impact on any increases in cases and hospitalizations. There are certainly some areas around the world where we're seeing that. And even as we talk about the decline in respirator -- disposable respirator demand globally, we're seeing areas that we are increasing supply. And so that's going to be one of the things that can impact second half geographically across the world.

Now if you look at where our channel inventories today, this is something we're always asking ourselves. It's a dynamic that we are continuously measuring and assessing every region of the world. And I would say, given the dynamics in the marketplace, the snapback in the economy, the fluid and uneven market dynamics, it's difficult to know what the right level is today. We get visibility on where our sell-in and sell-out is. With that snapback in demand, it's hard to get clear visibility on levels -- appropriate levels of inventory. There are some areas, of course, that are very visible, the ongoing semiconductor chip shortages, and they're impacting production volumes, and we are -- we see our inventory in the channel aligning with that. 
We've talked quite a bit about the visibility we're putting on N95 respirators specifically. But beyond that, it's really going to depend on how demand plays out in each market to really get a view as we go through third quarter of where inventory in the channel sits."

I think, Julian, it's a great question on Safety and Industrial. So to answer your specific question first on the impact, could it be negative on a year-over-year basis? As we said, and just a reminder, in 2019, we used to have revenue approximately $600 million of disposable respirators that went up to $1.4 billion in 2020. And as I look at the second half, we told you there could be a risk of $100 million to $300 million, which is the range of where we think disposable respirator volume would come down on a year-over-year basis. And if we go to that higher end of the range, which is $300 million, yes, the answer is you could definitely see negative volumes. 
What we have been doing as a part of this as health care demand has waned due to lower hospitalizations due to COVID and increase in electives is we have been moving production out from the hospital channel to different parts, which is industrial and governments, which we are actively doing. The other piece of safety and Industrial is, as I mentioned in Q2, we have seen growth in quite a few other segments of Safety and Industrial, whether it's in our respiratory portfolio with our safety portfolio, with head and face masks, whether you've seen us increase in our abrasive business, in our adhesives business, our roofing granules. So all the other segments, automotive aftermarket, have seen increase. And depending on how the economy plays itself out, and as long as industrial activity continues, you should see continued growth in those areas. And our current assumption is that long term, those markets will come back. I think it's going to be a little fluid in the second half, depending on how COVID plays itself out. 
To answer your second question on margin, you're right, as we have seen in 2019 versus '20, we did get benefited a lot by the volume leverage that we got across Safety and Industrial. So ultimately, where volume lands in the second half will have an impact on where margins ultimately go. We are actively working on price increases, broad-based in that segment. It's -- how much of that is offset by price and -- raws and logistics cost is the second offset. And the third one is the ongoing legal fees or reserves that we have taken, will be the third one. And then the last one, I would say, is what do we invest in growth, productivity and sustainability and especially growth. Because as industrial activity goes up in '22 and '23, we're going to continue to invest in that segment. So put all that together, that's how we see where margins are going to land."

I think you're going to see volatility as we get through the second half with what happens with COVID. So a couple of items to note. We believe that elective procedures will continue to go up quarter-over-quarter. But in some parts of the world, you could see it go down. 
Secondly, I would say auto does show an increase. It's still on a year-over-year headwind, down 3% in the third quarter. And if my memory is right, it's projected to be down 3.7% in the fourth quarter. I think the semiconductor shortages will have an impact on what happens there, and we'll see where that plays itself out. 
Smartphone shipments are supposed to be down on a year-over-year basis. We'll see where it land sequentially. And then tablets and TVs, which also benefited tremendously last year are also projected to be down on a year-over-year basis, but hard to quantify what exactly it looks like on a sequential basis. You have seen us -- you have seen a pretty good increase in stationery and office supply in the second quarter. That momentum is there right now, where we are seeing sell-in trends as retailers are planning to have people -- more people return to the workplace, kids in school. But depending on how the pandemic plays out, that could have an impact. 
And then on Safety and Industrial, as I mentioned in the prior question, I think there's an assumption that industrial activity continues. But currently, the supply chain shortages across the world also put a lot of variability onto what that demand looks like. And that's why when we put all that together, we said we are prudent to call the year at 6% to 9% for the year versus the 3% to 6% that we had said earlier. But overall, I would -- go ahead."

For example, I would tell you, when we first gave our guide of $0.30 to $0.50, which has now been guided to $0.65 to $0.80, I would tell you, what we have seen is a broad-based increase in all commodities, whether it is polypropylene, chemical, resins. We are seeing in our outsourced manufacturing goods, not just the labor costs, but other commodities that go into that also getting passed. And then logistics costs has continued to be a pretty strong headwind. 
Where that will peak, I think, in my view, and I may be wrong here, at some point, demand and supply need to start settling itself out. There's a lot of demand. There's not enough supply based on all the V-shape recovery with the congestion in the ports, et cetera. And until that stabilizes itself out, I think we're going to continue to see inflation. We have seen where crude prices have gone up much heavier than we had thought coming into the year. Polypropylene has remained strong or heavy inflationary. Ocean rates have gone up a lot in the last 3 to 6 months. So it's really hard for us to come back and say when does it peak and when it would start coming down. 
So we have taken what we know. We have put in all the factors that we know. We've had a prediction of where we think these things could go. And we have come up with $0.65 to $0.80, which currently is our best guide of where we think inflation is going to be. But with that said, as I've mentioned, we are taking broad-based price increases everywhere to help offset the mitigation of this. We are also increasing yield. We are working with our suppliers to reduce prices, et cetera. And then in -- so third quarter, we'll see a headwind of 50 to 100 basis points price versus raw. And in the fourth quarter, our anticipation is that we should be able to get it to be flat to positive, which means price will offset the raw material inflation."

And we -- as you know, we built additional capacity as we went through 2020. By the end of the year, we were at a run rate of 2.5 billion N95 respirators on an annual basis. And so that's the capacity we come into the year. Other manufacturers build capacity as well to respond to the pandemic. And I think you see some of them idling some of their capacity as demand comes off the peak. 
And we'll begin that process as well to idle lines to be ready for the next emergency or changes in COVID-19. I mean we can ramp up quickly. So our strategy is to be in a position to be a leader in personal safety -- personal protective equipment in normal times. And that's really serving the broader industrial markets, serving consumer markets, serving health care markets, and that's our strategy for where we manufacture and the volumes. And then we have that idle capacity so we can surge in times of emergency. 
I think we're in a better position than ever before globally to be able to respond to a pandemic. And I would add, it's been good to see governments following through on their commitments to stockpile. That's something that we have a number of efforts underway around the world that we're supporting as we've come through the first half of the year. So that, I think, prepares the world better for the next emergency, the next pandemic. So it's going to -- it will depend. When you look at where are we going to end up with respirator demand, we think we'll end up somewhere above where we were prepandemic. As use and protocols are changing around the world, we'll be well aligned to serve that. Our brand will be strong. We've got a leading brand position in PPE and can -- and really take advantage of that position around the world. 
And so I think we've got the model well aligned. I think there's a surge capacity that will be available. How much will depend both on the demand that comes in any kind of future emergency. And I think we're -- like I said, we're ready for our part of that."

It's an important market for us. It's 10% of our total revenue. It grew over 20% in the first half. Last year, second quarter, we saw 3% growth. So China recovered, if you remember, ahead of other regions around the world. 
And when you look at the second half, comparisons start to get a little more challenging. And so we're expecting just year-over-year comps, I would say, we expect to see a little more challenge there. We still see opportunities for growth across our businesses in some of the same areas that we've highlighted on a global basis. Automotive will continue to be a focus, penetrating with the OEMs there.

The team continues to drive operating rigor, so driving productivity and efficiency across the supply chain. We are going after price increases, and our anticipation is that in the fourth quarter, we should be able to offset the price -- the raw and logistics cost impact. 
So I would boil it down to saying what margin will come down to in the second half and what incrementals are will depend on the volume, will depend on our ability to offset the price -- the raw and logistics pressure through price increase, continued productivity and good execution by the 3M team. 
And then finally, our decision on how much we're going to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability, plus a lot of these indirects that start snapping back, as hopefully, people start traveling. You've seen we've been very disciplined in the first half of making sure that we didn't spend ahead of what volumes come back. But as we see volumes coming back in, you're going to see those indirect start snapping back up. And then the last one is the legal fees and continuing to do what we think is right to protect ourselves as these cases go through.
