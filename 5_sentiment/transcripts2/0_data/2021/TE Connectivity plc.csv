Before I get into the slides, I would like to share some perspective on our fir",2173,"Thanks, Sujal, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today to cover our results for our first fiscal quarter and also our expectations for our second fiscal quarter of 2021. Before I get into the slides, I would like to share some perspective on our first quarter. As you will see in the results, we are benefiting from our diverse portfolio and are continuing to execute on our margin expansion plans. While markets have been very dynamic over the past year, we are seeing improving conditions across the majority of them. Against this backdrop, we are demonstrating not only the resiliency of our operations, but also the ability to drive organic content growth ahead of our markets, while expanding operating margins and demonstrating strong free cash flow generation, that is in line with our business model. 
We are positioned to continue to benefit from secular trends in growing markets while driving the margin expansion plans that we've highlighted to you, and you'll see the benefit of these efforts in our first quarter results as well as our guidance for the second quarter. With that as a quick backdrop, let me now frame out some of the key messages of today's call. First, I am very pleased with our execution in the first quarter, and I believe our teams delivered strong results. We delivered sales growth of 11% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 21% year-over-year, demonstrating the strength and diversity of the portfolio and the benefits from our operational improvements. 
Our sales were ahead of our expectations in each segment, but with the greatest outperformance in transportation, where we continue to generate strong content growth from electrification of the powertrain as well as increased data in the vehicle. Our adjusted operating margins expanded 190 basis points year-over-year to 17.7% and with margin growth in both transportation and our Communications segment and a slight decline in our Industrial segment, where we maintain mid-teens margin performance despite a sales decline. 
We continue to demonstrate our strong cash generation model with our quarter 1 free cash flow being at a first quarter record of approximately $530 million. We continue to expect approximately 100% free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income for this fiscal year. And as we look to our second quarter, we are expecting our strong performance to continue. We expect sales and adjusted earnings per share, similar to the first quarter at approximately $3.5 billion of revenue and $1.47 in earnings per share. And like in the first quarter, we again expect double-digit sales and adjusted earnings per share growth year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss our performance relative to where our markets were in the pre-COVID time frame of our fiscal 2019, and we do hope this will provide a baseline for evaluating our performance and progress this year. At the overall company level, our revenue is approximately back to pre-COVID levels despite the majority of our markets being below 2019 levels. And I'd like to give you some color by the 3 different segments. In our Communications segment, we have seen strong improvement in our end markets, and this has helped enable sales to recover above pre-COVID levels. And for example, in data and devices as well as in appliances were benefiting from continued data center build-outs and home investments, respectively. In our Industrial segment, it is a very different environment. We have markets that continue to remain weak as a result of COVID impacts, commercial layer and medical markets and our sales are still well below pre-COVID levels. However, what we are seeing is that those look like order patterns are indicating that we could be touching along the bottom in both of these businesses, and we could see some improvements later in the year. 
And in our Transportation segment, our auto and commercial transportation businesses are now generating revenue above the levels we saw prior to COVID, even though global auto and truck production is still forecasted to be below fiscal 2019 levels. Content growth and share gains have driven the outperformance, reflecting our leadership position in these markets. TE products and technology are designed in the next-generation of sustainable vehicles at every leading OEM worldwide. The real proof of the traction is our content per vehicle progression. In fiscal 2019, our content per vehicle in auto was in the low 60s, and it's now trending into the low 70 range. 
As consumer adoption increases for hybrid and electric vehicles, and we continue to bring more innovation to our customers, we expect our content per vehicle to expand into the 80s over time. What's nice is that consumer preference continues to drive the features and the technology, and we will continue to benefit as vehicles become more safe, green and connected, driving more content for connector and Sensing solutions. While I am pleased with our results and the progress that we've made operationally, I'm even more excited about the sales growth and margin expansion opportunities that we still have ahead of us. We continue to execute on our margin expansion plans in transportation and industrial that we started prior to COVID and accelerated during the pandemic. 
I'm also very proud of the margin progression in communications, which has offset the volume-related pressure that we're seeing in industrial as a result of the market impacts due to COVID. 
So now if we could turn to the slides, and I'd ask you to turn to Slide 3 to provide some additional details for the first quarter and our expectations for the second quarter. Quarter 1 sales of $3.5 billion were better than our expectations, up 11% on a reported basis and 6% organically year-over-year. We had 12% organic growth in both transportation and in communications, with growth across all businesses in those 2 segments. Industrial segment sales were down 8% organically due to the COVID-related impacts I already talked about. 
During the quarter, we saw orders of $4 billion, and this was up 25% year-over-year, reflecting an improvement in the majority of the end markets we serve, and I'll come back to orders in a couple of slides. From an earnings per share perspective, our adjusted earnings per share was $1.47 and this was up 21% year-over-year due to the strong operational performance, where we showed adjusted operating income being up approximately 25% year-over-year. As we look forward, we expect our strong performance to continue into our second quarter, with sales and adjusted earnings per share being similar to first quarter levels despite lower sequential auto production. 
For the second quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $3.5 billion, and this is up approximately 10% year-over-year on a reported basis and mid-single digits organically. Similar to our first quarter, year-over-year growth will be driven by transportation and communications, partially offset by an organic decline in industrial. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.47 in the second quarter, and this will be up 14% year-over-year with adjusted operating margin expansion included in our earnings performance. 
So if you could, let me turn to Slide 4, and I'll get into our order trends that we're seeing. For the first quarter, our orders were approximately $4 billion with a book-to-bill of [ 1.15 ] I would like to highlight that this level of orders reflects improvements in a number of our end markets as well as some supply chain replenishment. As we see markets improving, it is not surprising that our orders reflect the impact of supply chains being replenished after the shutdowns that occurred in the U.S. and Europe in the third quarter of last year. We are also seeing customers placing advanced orders in some cases due to product constraints and the broader electronic component categories like semiconductors and certain passive components. And the guidance that we give, those factor in the impact of these supply chain dynamics. And looking at orders by segment, on a year-over-year basis, transportation and communication orders both grew 36% with broad-based growth across all businesses. 
Industrial orders declined slightly year-over-year. But on a sequential basis, we did see orders growth in all businesses in each segment. So let me also add some color on what we're seeing in orders from a geographic perspective, and I'll provide this on an organic basis. In China, our orders were up 33% in the first quarter with growth driven by transportation and communications. We are benefiting from our strong position in auto, commercial transportation and appliances and continue to see strong improvement across those markets in China. We also saw 26% year-over-year growth in Europe with growth in all segments. This represents a second consecutive quarter of orders growth in Europe with some markets improving following the large drops from COVID back in the middle of last year. 
And in North America, our orders were flat, with growth in transportation and communications being offset by declines in industrial. Now what I'd like to do is touch upon our segment results briefly, and I'll cover those on Slide 5 through 7 of the slides we issued. Starting with transportation. Our sales were up 12% organically year-over-year with growth in each 1 of our businesses. In auto, sales were up 11% organically versus global auto production growth in the low single digits. The outperformance is driven by continued strong content growth and some benefits from the supply chain replenishing. We are seeing gains from our leadership position in next-generation products and technology and the value that we bring to our customers. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing strong content growth from the move to an electric powertrain and increased data connectivity as well as the continued electronification of the vehicle. In our commercial transportation business, we saw 25% organic growth driven by electronification trends, which are helping content outperformance as well as ongoing share gains. We are also benefiting from higher emission standards and new increased operator adoption of Euro 5 and 6 in China and new emission standards in India. We saw growth in all regions as well as all market verticals that we serve in our commercial transportation business and continue to benefit from our strong position in China. We are also seeing increased program wins in the electric powertrain and commercial transportation that will provide future content growth. 
In sensors, we saw 29% growth on a reported basis, which included the revenue contribution from the first sensor acquisition. On an organic basis, sales increased 3%, driven by growth in auto applications. And we continue to expand our design win pipeline in auto sensing and expect growth at these platforms continue to increase in volume. From an operating margin perspective, the segment expanded margins by 200 basis points to 19.4%, driven by strong operational performance. 
Now let me move over to the Industrial segment, where, as I mentioned, our sales declined 8% organically year-over-year, and our adjusted operating margins were down slightly to 13.5% despite the 8% organic sales decline. I am very proud we were able to maintain our mid-teens adjusted operating margins due to the cost actions that we initiated over the past couple of years. During the quarter, the segment continued to be impacted by the decline in the commercial aerospace market, with our AD&M business declining 22% organically. As I mentioned earlier, we do believe we're touching along the bottom in this business and could see improvement in comm air later in this year. 
Our industrial equipment business was up 8% organically with growth in all regions and strength in factory automation applications. And we continue to see weakness in our medical business with ongoing delays in interventional elective procedures that have been caused by COVID. We anticipate this to be a short-term dynamic in medical that is consistent with what our customers are seeing and expect this market to return to growth as these procedures start to increase later in the year. And lastly, in our energy business, we saw a 4% organic decline driven by COVID impact on utility spending, but we did see growth in renewable energy applications in the wind and solar applications. 
Now let me turn to the Communications segment, where our sales grew 12% organically year-over-year with growth in both data and devices as well as appliances. We do continue to benefit from the recovery in China and Asia more broadly, which represents over half of our sales in this segment. In data and devices, our sales grew 5% organically year-over-year due to the strong position we built in high-speed solution for cloud applications. And in appliances, we grew 21% organically year-over-year with growth across all regions and benefits from home investments in an improved housing market. I would have to say our communication team continues to perform very well, delivering 17.6% adjusted operating margins, which is up 550 basis points versus the prior year. 
Now with that segment overview, let me turn it over to Heath, who will get into more details on the financials and our expectations going forward."

Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q1 financials. Adjusted operating income was $624 million, up approximately 25% year-over-year with an adjusted operating margin of 17.7%. GAAP operating income was $448 million and included $167 million of restructuring and other charges and $9 million of acquisition-related charges. We plan for the restructuring to be front-end loaded this year and continue to expect total restructuring charges in the ballpark of $200 million for fiscal '21, as we continue to optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve the fixed cost structure of the organization. Adjusted EPS was $1.47, and GAAP EPS was $1.13 for the quarter and included a tax-related benefit of $0.09. 
We also had restructuring, acquisition and other charges of $0.43, the reconciliation is provided. The adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was approximately 20%. For the second quarter, we expect our tax rate to be in the high teens and continue to expect an effective tax rate of around 19% for fiscal '21. Importantly, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our reported ETR for the full year. So if you'll turn to Slide 9. Sales of $3.5 billion were 11% -- were up 11% on a reported basis and up 6% on an organic basis year-over-year. Currency exchange rates positively impacted sales by $106 million versus the prior year. We are demonstrating our business model execution with adjusted EPS of $1.47, up 21% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margins were 17.7%, as I mentioned earlier, and that is an expansion of 190 basis points versus prior year. I am pleased with the progress we are making in driving improvements to our cost structure and our strong operational performance, and we continue to execute on our footprint consolidation and cost reduction plans in both transportation and industrial, and we are now benefiting from the heavy lifting that we've already completed in our Communications segment. 
Transportation adjusted operating margin was 19.4%, which is nearing our business model target of 20%. And Industrial adjusted operating margins remained in the mid-teens despite significant volume drops, which demonstrates the benefits of our cost actions. We have been discussing with you over the past few years. I'm also very pleased with the 17.6% adjusted operating margin and communication, which reflects our strong operational execution that I mentioned earlier. 
In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $640 million, and we had very strong cash flow for the quarter of approximately $530 million, which represents a first quarter record, as Terrence mentioned, and we returned $286 million to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Our strong cash flow performance last year and into the first quarter of this year demonstrates the strength of our cash generation model, and we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to approximate 100% for the full year. We remain committed to our disciplined use of cash and over time, we expect 2/3 of our free cash flow to be returned to shareholders and about 1/3 to be used for acquisitions. 
Now before we go into questions, I want to reiterate that we remain excited about how we've positioned our portfolio. With leadership positions in the markets we serve, along with organic growth and margin expansion opportunities ahead of us. To summarize, we have discussed the benefits of secular trends across our portfolio. You are seeing content growth enabling sales performance above our markets in auto and commercial transportation, benefits from some market recovery in data and devices and appliances and some markets that have been impacted by COVID in the industrial segment that are now showing signs of stabilization. We initiated cost actions well ahead of the COVID downturn, and we're seeing strong margin expansion as a result of our efforts. 
We expect to continue to generate strong cash flow, maintain a disciplined and balanced capital strategy and drive to business model performance and our focus on value creation for our stakeholders going forward. So now let's open this up for questions, Sujal?"

And I would say, first off, I think, like many things COVID, the recovery is very uneven, and it's impacting different businesses differently.

And I would say, first off, I think, like many things COVID, the recovery is very uneven, and it's impacting different businesses differently. So the comments I made were very much around transportation. In markets that are soft, like industrial, I would tell you, we still have in places like medical and aerospace, inventory is still being burned. So I do think the factors I'm talking about in the supply chain are very similar to how we painted the overall picture of the 3 segments. 
I think when you look at the supply chain and you go to transportation, though, I think we have to keep in perspective where auto production went to and that automotive is a just-in-time supply chain. So back in the third quarter, 12 million units were made that we made 22 million units on the planet, I think was quicker than we all would have thought the recovery was. And there will be some areas where there will be bottlenecks as everybody recovers, and you heard that. And certainly, our customers have adjusted some of their production due to that, and that's reflected in our guidance. 
But what's nice is, on top of that, even though we're talking about supply chain is where consumer inventory levels are or very healthy. So when I think about what we try to track for long-term or how many class are being bought on the planet, it's nice to see inventory levels on the lots when you look at North America and China, probably being more towards middle to low-end of normal ranges, Europe is probably right around the middle. And it's not surprising. That's the supply chain being stressed a little bit due to the improving markets we're seeing. And some of our customers have adjusted their production, and that's in our guidance."

I guess the question I would have is, when I look at the December quarter print and the March quarter guide, especially transportation up really strong and better than end unit production. I think the fewer folks will have is that a strong first half, fiscal first half for you folks could be over shipping versus end demand and OEMs are just building a lot more inventory than they need. And the risk would eventually be that in the back half of the year, your fiscal year back half, ends up being a lot softer as OEMs start to normalize inventory. 
Can you just perhaps talk about what are you seeing from your OEM level that gives you confidence that this isn't or building up inventory and there's a correction in the back half that we have to worry about?"

Supply chain does need to get to a normalized level where production is. I think when you look at auto production going from quarter 1 to quarter 2, we do expect it to be down to about 20 million units in our second quarter versus 22 in the first quarter. So that should also allow the supply chain to help normalize since there will be a little bit less production and when we look at it is, what's really nice is our growth is due more to content and production than it is due to the supply chain replenishment. 
As we've always told you in an individual quarter, you can get supply chain movements 1 way or the other. But when I think about content per vehicle, as I said on the call, and really think about the $10 or so that our contents increased over the past couple of years, really about half of that is driven due to traditional electronification of the car being more electronics in it. The other half is being driven by the benefit of the wins we have in HEMs as well as -- I'm sorry, electric mobility as well as what we've guided in content on the car having more data. So when we look at that, that's real content growth. Certainly, inter quarter, there may be a little bit of movement as supply chain goes, but the bigger driver of our growth is content. And it's what's really allowed our transportation segment to get back to pre-COVID levels on what we all know will be production this year based upon the external estimates, that will be less than pre-COVID."

This year, we believe electric vehicles on the planet are going to be up about 50% versus last year, continued strong adoption in Europe. Certainly, the adoption that Asia has already had and it's going to break through 10% of global production. 
So content will continue to be benefited by our position in electric vehicle. But we also have to realize there's still content opportunity in traditional architecture, too and those products also go into electric vehicles. So what's nice about what we talked about going to 60 to 70, it's going to be a similar picture as we go forward because where we play in the architectures on every vehicle. It's not just electric, it's also our legacy position and how globally strong we are with that position. So as we look forward, all components, whether it be electric vehicle powertrain movement, whether it be features and electronification of any vehicle as well as you get more data and all of those are drivers to our content. And just in the past 2 years, you can see the reality of it. And that's what we get excited about, and I think it's what we get excited about as we look to forward growth."

And when you think about distribution, distribution touches both our CS and IS segments, Industrial and Communications segments, more than Transportation. Our sales into the channel in the quarter, we're on par with our total company sales growth. So that 6%, pretty much how our sales to our channel partners were sell-out is their sell-out accelerated with some of these supply chain dynamics. They have a role to play. That's why they hold inventory. We have seen some of their orders increase, but I would say we're not over shipping into our distributors. Actually, their inventory levels on sort of a turn are actually lower than normal. So that's some of the balancing that will be occurring here as the world normalizes, hopefully. 
And net-net in industrial, what I would tell you, while we may have some areas like in our industrial equipment, that showed shrink, I'll go back to our medical customers are still burning some inventory, and so is aerospace and defense. So net-net, I would not say there is supply chain replenishment and industrial that we're benefiting from."

I think the first differentiator we have is our global position and where do we bring the innovation. And it starts with those design centers that are everywhere where current vehicles are designed in next-generation vehicles and that's pretty special. And that's where we've leveraged our traditional position there. The other thing is when you get into the architecture of a card, our knowledge is there are parts of traditional architecture that do go over into an electric vehicle. So certainly, there's a lot of discussion around the powertrain, how does that involve the batteries, but also realize that architecture does come together as you bring low voltage and high-voltage together and certainly come into the infotainment and data element of it that could go into autonomy. 
So we play across all those elements. I think it's a very unique position that TE has that also comes into the content opportunity. The other thing that is and these are investments that we started to make 10 years ago is when we look at electric vehicle, like I said earlier, we think there's going to be about $9 million made this year, $5 million of those will be in Asia. Europe continues to accelerate and one of the things we probably get more excited about is not only the vehicle technology but where do you see support coming to make sure that electric vehicle penetration gets stronger. There's 2 big factors that come in, not only just -- not only consumer adoption, but you come into the 2 big things outside the car that relate to infrastructure as well as battery technology. And you continue to see developments in that space that with where EVs are going, we think will create continued momentum on EV adoption as well as support of the infrastructure and certainly, the battery technologies that are so important to it and that's happening globally. 
So early on, we were very much bullish on Asia. Certainly, Europe with some of their regulations and certainly, you continue to see at a lesser pace momentum here. But where TE comes in on that architecture, where how that architecture comes together, the electric, the data, the signal, that is our specialty, and it's really great how these trends were going to benefit from and you sold in our content numbers."

I do actually think this",528,"Yes. So thanks for that question, and I do appreciate it, Mark. I think when you think about -- when we look forward, I think there's 1 that I'll talk about short term, and then there's ones that I think are important longer term. I do actually think this period over the past year and the dynamics and the challenge that we've all gone through we're getting to show our portfolio, the diversity of it and why we like our portfolio. And a lot of people had questions of how this portfolio would act because it wasn't the same portfolio. And we do like our portfolio and you see that here. 
I think the other thing when we look forward is the content elements we've talked to you about and you think about transportation. The content opportunities we are talking about are still in early stages and electric vehicle is early stage, autonomy is early stage, and that, in many ways, more content kickers we've been talking about, and you're starting to see it in the numbers, and they're going to be around for a while. But I would say it's not just limited to auto and transportation, you've seen how our communications segment has changed, certainly around our cloud investments and how we've gained share in cloud that has made that segment a performer. 
And when you think about industrial, medical will come back, comm air will come back and our positions are very strong. So there are things that certainly -- they're hurting us now, but I think will be things that drive content longer in the future. And those are the things where data and power are going, whether it's around sustainability or things being more connected, where things get more productive like factory automation, we still have content opportunity to drive growth that's going to be above market. 
The other thing I would just say, while I'm pleased with the execution, our margin improvement story is not over. Our transportation and our industrial segments. We've been doing some heavy lifting to get to where we believe these businesses are entitled. It's nice to see our transportation segment on lower volume than peak being back close to the margin, we think it should be at, but our industrial segment has room to go. And lastly, I think it goes to the point that you sort of alluded to in your question is we like our cash gendered business model. It provides choices, whether to return capital or to do the bolt-ons like Scott's question, the Heath around first sensor. And what's nice is we do have organic secular trends that we can do bolt-ons into. And we're going to maintain discipline as we go through it. 
So as we look forward, it's nice to see some improvement. We're always going to have a market that's probably cycling 1 way or the other with the diversity, but I do think what the portfolio has shown up, we're pretty proud of, and we think there's more room to run on the growth on the margin side, which turns into earnings power and cash generation for value creation."

How much of that spread is like actually more physical volumes on the cars? And how much is because the price of these products is significantly higher because the volumes are significantly lower. And like how does that change over time? Does the price go down substantially, but the volume scale. So gross dollars, it's very very positive, but the spread between ICE and EV kind of compresses.

We also have to make sure we bring our technology and our scale to make sure these vehicles are affordable. And so that's always been included. You will still have increased content.

Now acquisitions are always going to feather in to a point where you have to overcome some of that dilutive impact initially and then you build upon that moving forward. But I still feel very good about it. I think you got to kind of break it down into the segments as well. The segments we've kind of targeted and talked about automotive being roughly a 20% operating income business, which is above -- vails a good return from our overall investment as well as provides opportunity to enable reinvestment in the business for future growth, and that's a good return model. 
Industrial, which is in the low teens as we sit here today, but coming off of a pretty significant downturn, particularly in the commercial aerospace side as well as in the medical side, is still holding its head. But we would expect that over time, again, to be up in the high teens. So there's a fair amount of leverage there. And then in communications, we're in a pretty good place. We've done a lot of heavy lifting there, going back several years. And you're seeing the results there now when we get the types of volume reduction or I'm sorry, the types of volume increases that we've seen, both in appliances and data and devices, you can see what the flow-through is in our factory environment with an optimized footprint that we enjoy today within communications. 
So there is still leverage in both transportation and in industrial. And in addition to that, we are still tackling some of the costs in the operating expense line that you would expect us to. And that's been coming down ratably, particularly as a percentage of sales, and that will continue to be the case. So feel good about our ability to continue to expand margins for some time now."

So global water production in the quarter was a little north of 22 million units. If you think about where we were in 2018 and '19, we're still trending pretty -- still below those quarterly numbers. 
So yes, what it shows you is what we can do on lower auto production relative to some of those prior hurdles because we have tackle the fixed costs. But at the same time, we are going after we've been pretty public with you about some of the restructuring that we're doing and particularly in some of the -- what had been announced, and we're working through some European footprint moves. Our transportation segment. And those are underway. In some cases, they're being pressured because we need some volume out of those facilities. But we'll see more benefit from those restructuring plans as we get through 2021 and into '22. 
The other thing I would say is when you see the types of recovery and Terrence mentioned going from 12 million units in the June quarter to 22 million units in the December quarter, that is a very steep ramp in terms of our ability to ramp up.

First off, when we look at pricing right now, we sort of view it as stable. Certainly, we don't make semiconductors. So some of the shortages that are happening in that space, we do. When you look longer term, and that assumes supply chain normalizes, we do expect our electric vehicle product portfolio to have a higher price curve just due to the volume. And that's something we've always said that's included in our 4% to 6% and so depending upon how those volumes go, and that's typically the arrangements that we have with our customers that are typically volume and we sit down and have those discussions with our customer. 
I would also tell you that when we think about content, we do expect content to be about 2x with EVs. And also the margin targets we give you also include that pricing that he's talked about a few minutes ago. So net-net, it will be a little bit higher as it scales in those product sets. But overall, as part of our margin model and content model, we've always reviewed with you."

So I think there's a big thing here. And the trend of how do you bring feature integration into an ECU and certainly, the car has a lot of ECUs, but how the -- instead of adding a box to a car when you want to add to the architecture, you're adding a feature into an ECU which does help make sure the architecture doesn't get out of control. So this is not a new trend. It's always been a trend. Certainly, some people will go out and say, will there be only 1 mega ECU or 2. I think that's not a new idea, but I think that's going to be much further out. Net-net, what happens is the amount of interconnects that are in those ECUs become more complicated, which help us. And then certainly, the interface is around where do you need to sense what's going on in the car also creates more connections. And no different than the content picture, I hope I painted earlier around where is content coming from, that $10, half of it is due to electric content, electric powertrain content, some data but the other half is due to the low voltage architecture, that continues to get more connections in it as the car has more features to it. And you still need to have a connection to wherever the feature is back to a box. 
So certainly, ECU, no different than what semiconductors do all the time, which is it integrates more into a chip. You're going to see that in the car that creates more complex connecting solutions as that box test to connect into other applications in the car, and that's actually good for us. We think it adds more connections, and it actually creates complexity, which our customers need us more from an innovation perspective. So I hope that frames it a little bit and helps you with that question."

That's why we like being a Tier 2. And when we sit there and we look at what our teams are working on, we're seeing an acceleration. So certainly, when we look at commercial transportation, the breadth of vehicles that are in there, whether it's mining, whether it's Class A trucks and so forth, it's pretty broad.

Before I get into the slides, I would like to share some perspective on our fir",2169,"Thanks, Sujal, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today to cover our results for our first fiscal quarter and also our expectations for our second fiscal quarter of 2021. Before I get into the slides, I would like to share some perspective on our first quarter. As you will see in the results, we are benefiting from our diverse portfolio and are continuing to execute on our margin expansion plans. While markets have been very dynamic over the past year, we are seeing improving conditions across the majority of them. Against this backdrop, we are demonstrating not only the resiliency of our operations, but also the ability to drive organic content growth ahead of our markets, while expanding operating margins and demonstrating strong free cash flow generation that is in line with our business model. 
We are positioned to continue to benefit from secular trends in growing markets while driving the margin expansion plans that we've highlighted to you, and you'll see the benefit of these efforts in our first quarter results as well as our guidance for the second quarter. With that as a quick backdrop, let me now frame out some of the key messages of today's call. First, I am very pleased with our execution in the first quarter, and I believe our teams delivered strong results. We delivered sales growth of 11% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 21% year-over-year, demonstrating the strength and diversity of the portfolio and the benefits from our operational improvements. 
Our sales were ahead of our expectations in each segment, but with the greatest outperformance in transportation, where we continue to generate strong content growth from electrification of the powertrain as well as increased data in the vehicle. Our adjusted operating margins expanded 190 basis points year-over-year to 17.7% with margin growth in both transportation and our communications segment and a slight decline in our industrial segment, where we maintained mid-teens margin performance despite a sales decline. 
We continue to demonstrate our strong cash generation model with our quarter 1 free cash flow being at a first quarter record of approximately $530 million. We continue to expect approximately 100% free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income for this fiscal year. And as we look to our second quarter, we are expecting our strong performance to continue. We expect sales and adjusted earnings per share, similar to the first quarter at approximately $3.5 billion of revenue and $1.47 in earnings per share. And like in the first quarter, we again expect double-digit sales and adjusted earnings per share growth year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss our performance relative to where our markets were in the pre-COVID time frame of our fiscal 2019, and we do hope this will provide a baseline for evaluating our performance and progress this year. At the overall company level, our revenue is approximately back to pre-COVID levels despite the majority of our markets being below 2019 levels. And I'd like to give you some color by the 3 different segments. In our communications segment, we have seen strong improvement in our end markets, and this has helped enable sales to recover above pre-COVID levels. And for example, in data and devices as well as in appliances, we're benefiting from continued data center build-outs and home investments, respectively. In our industrial segment, it is a very different environment. We have markets that continue to remain weak as a result of COVID impacts, commercial layer and medical markets and our sales are still well below pre-COVID levels. However, what we are seeing is it does look like order patterns are indicating that we could be touching along the bottom in both of these businesses, and we could see some improvements later in the year. 
And in our transportation segment, our auto and commercial transportation businesses are now generating revenue above the levels we saw prior to COVID, even though global auto and truck production is still forecasted to be below fiscal 2019 levels. Content growth and share gains have driven the outperformance, reflecting our leadership position in these markets. TE products and technology are designed in the next-generation of sustainable vehicles at every leading OEM worldwide. The real proof of the traction is our content per vehicle progression. In fiscal 2019, our content per vehicle in auto was in the low 60s, and it's now trending into the low 70s range. 
As consumer adoption increases for hybrid and electric vehicles, and we continue to bring more innovation to our customers, we expect our content per vehicle to expand into the 80s over time. What's nice is that consumer preference continues to drive the features and the technology, and we will continue to benefit as vehicles become more safe, green and connected, driving more content for connector and sensing solutions. While I am pleased with our results and the progress that we've made operationally, I'm even more excited about the sales growth and margin expansion opportunities that we still have ahead of us. We continue to execute on our margin expansion plans in transportation and industrial that we started prior to COVID and accelerated during the pandemic. 
I'm also very proud of the margin progression in communications, which has offset the volume-related pressure that we're seeing in industrial as a result of the market impacts due to COVID. 
So now if we could turn to the slides, and I'd ask you to turn to Slide 3 to provide some additional details for the first quarter and our expectations for the second quarter. Quarter 1 sales of $3.5 billion were better than our expectations, up 11% on a reported basis and 6% organically year-over-year. We had 12% organic growth in both transportation and in communications, with growth across all businesses in those 2 segments. Industrial segment sales were down 8% organically due to the COVID-related impacts I already talked about. 
During the quarter, we saw orders of $4 billion, and this was up 25% year-over-year, reflecting an improvement in the majority of the end markets we serve, and I'll come back to orders in a couple of slides. From an earnings per share perspective, our adjusted earnings per share was $1.47. This was up 21% year-over-year due to the strong operational performance, where we showed adjusted operating income being up approximately 25% year-over-year. As we look forward, we expect our strong performance to continue into our second quarter, with sales and adjusted earnings per share being similar to first quarter levels despite lower sequential auto production. 
For the second quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $3.5 billion, and this is up approximately 10% year-over-year on a reported basis and mid-single digits organically. Similar to our first quarter, year-over-year growth will be driven by transportation and communications, partially offset by an organic decline in industrial. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.47 in the second quarter, and this will be up 14% year-over-year with adjusted operating margin expansion included in our earnings performance. 
So if you could, let me turn to Slide 4, and I'll get into our order trends that we're seeing. For the first quarter, our orders were approximately $4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.15. I would like to highlight that this level of orders reflects improvements in a number of our end markets as well as some supply chain replenishment. As we see markets improving, it is not surprising that our orders reflect the impact of supply chains being replenished after the shutdowns that occurred in the U.S. and Europe in the third quarter of last year. We are also seeing customers placing advanced orders in some cases due to product constraints and the broader electronic component categories like semiconductors and certain passive components. And the guidance that we give, does factor in the impact of these supply chain dynamics. And looking at orders by segment, on a year-over-year basis, transportation and communication orders both grew 36% with broad-based growth across all businesses. 
Industrial orders declined slightly year-over-year. But on a sequential basis, we did see orders growth in all businesses in each segment. So let me also add some color on what we're seeing in orders from a geographic perspective, and I'll provide this on an organic basis. In China, our orders were up 33% in the first quarter with growth driven by transportation and communications. We are benefiting from our strong position in auto, commercial transportation and appliances and continue to see strong improvement across those markets in China. We also saw 26% year-over-year growth in Europe with growth in all segments. This represents a second consecutive quarter of orders growth in Europe with some markets improving following the large drops from COVID back in the middle of last year. 
And in North America, our orders were flat, with growth in transportation and communications being offset by declines in industrial. Now what I'd like to do is touch upon our segment results briefly, and I'll cover those on Slide 5 through 7 of the slides we issued. Starting with transportation. Our sales were up 12% organically year-over-year with growth in each one of our businesses. In auto, sales were up 11% organically versus global auto production growth in the low single digits. The outperformance is driven by continued strong content growth and some benefits from the supply chain replenishing. We are seeing gains from our leadership position in next-generation products and technology and the value that we bring to our customers. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing strong content growth from the move to an electric powertrain and increased data connectivity as well as the continued electronification of the vehicle. In our commercial transportation business, we saw 25% organic growth driven by electronification trends, which are helping content outperformance as well as ongoing share gains. We are also benefiting from higher emission standards and new increased operator adoption of Euro 5 and 6 in China and new emission standards in India. We saw growth in all regions as well as all market verticals that we serve in our commercial transportation business and continue to benefit from our strong position in China. We are also seeing increased program wins in the electric powertrain and commercial transportation that will provide future content growth. 
In sensors, we saw 29% growth on a reported basis, which included the revenue contribution from the First Sensor acquisition. On an organic basis, sales increased 3%, driven by growth in auto applications. And we continue to expand our design win pipeline in auto sensing and expect growth at these platforms continue to increase in volume. From an operating margin perspective, the segment expanded margins by 200 basis points to 19.4%, driven by strong operational performance. 
Now let me move over to the industrial segment, where, as I mentioned, our sales declined 8% organically year-over-year, and our adjusted operating margins were down slightly to 13.5% despite the 8% organic sales decline. I am very proud we were able to maintain our mid-teens adjusted operating margins due to the cost actions that we initiated over the past couple of years. During the quarter, the segment continued to be impacted by the decline in the commercial aerospace market, with our AD&M business declining 22% organically. As I mentioned earlier, we do believe we're touching along the bottom in this business and could see improvement in comm air later in this year. 
Our industrial equipment business was up 8% organically with growth in all regions and strength in factory automation applications. And we continue to see weakness in our medical business with ongoing delays in interventional elective procedures that have been caused by COVID. We anticipate this to be a short-term dynamic in medical that is consistent with what our customers are seeing and expect this market to return to growth as these procedures start to increase later in the year. And lastly, in our energy business, we saw a 4% organic decline driven by COVID impact on utility spending, but we did see growth in renewable energy applications in the wind and solar applications. 
Now let me turn to the communications segment, where our sales grew 12% organically year-over-year with growth in both data and devices as well as appliances. We do continue to benefit from the recovery in China and Asia more broadly, which represents over half of our sales in this segment. In data and devices, our sales grew 5% organically year-over-year due to the strong position we built in high-speed solution for cloud applications. And in appliances, we grew 21% organically year-over-year with growth across all regions and benefits from home investments and an improved housing market. I would have to say our communication team continues to perform very well, delivering 17.6% adjusted operating margins, which is up 550 basis points versus the prior year. 
Now with that segment overview, let me turn it over to Heath, who will get into more details on the financials and our expectations going forward."

Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q1 financials. Adjusted operating income was $624 million, up approximately 25% year-over-year with an adjusted operating margin of 17.7%. GA",677,"Thank you, Terrence, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q1 financials. Adjusted operating income was $624 million, up approximately 25% year-over-year with an adjusted operating margin of 17.7%. GAAP operating income was $448 million and included $167 million of restructuring and other charges and $9 million of acquisition-related charges. We plan for the restructuring to be front-end loaded this year and continue to expect total restructuring charges in the ballpark of $200 million for fiscal '21, as we continue to optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve the fixed cost structure of the organization. Adjusted EPS was $1.47, and GAAP EPS was $1.13 for the quarter and included a tax-related benefit of $0.09. 
We also had restructuring, acquisition and other charges of $0.43, the reconciliation is provided. The adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was approximately 20%. For the second quarter, we expect our tax rate to be in the high teens and continue to expect an effective tax rate of around 19% for fiscal '21. Importantly, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our reported ETR for the full year. 
So if you'll turn to Slide 9. Sales of $3.5 billion were 11% -- were up 11% on a reported basis and up 6% on an organic basis year-over-year. Currency exchange rates positively impacted sales by $106 million versus the prior year. We are demonstrating our business model execution with adjusted EPS of $1.47, up 21% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margins were 17.7%, as I mentioned earlier, and that is an expansion of 190 basis points versus prior year. I am pleased with the progress we are making in driving improvements to our cost structure and our strong operational performance, and we continue to execute on our footprint consolidation and cost reduction plans in both transportation and industrial, and we are now benefiting from the heavy lifting that we've already completed in our communications segment. 
Transportation adjusted operating margin was 19.4%, which is nearing our business model target of 20%. Industrial adjusted operating margins remained in the mid-teens despite significant volume drops, which demonstrates the benefits of our cost actions that we have been discussing with you over the past few years. I'm also very pleased with the 17.6% adjusted operating margin in communication, which reflects our strong operational execution that I mentioned earlier. 
In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $640 million, and we had very strong cash flow for the quarter of approximately $530 million, which represents a first quarter record, as Terrence mentioned, and we returned $286 million to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Our strong cash flow performance last year and into the first quarter of this year demonstrates the strength of our cash generation model, and we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to approximate 100% for the full year. We remain committed to our disciplined use of cash and over time, we expect 2/3 of our free cash flow to be returned to shareholders and about 1/3 to be used for acquisitions. 
Now before we go into questions, I want to reiterate that we remain excited about how we've positioned our portfolio. With leadership positions in the markets we serve, along with organic growth and margin expansion opportunities ahead of us. To summarize, we have discussed the benefits of secular trends across our portfolio. You are seeing content growth enabling sales performance above our markets in auto and commercial transportation, benefits from some market recovery in data and devices and appliances and some markets that have been impacted by COVID in the industrial segment that are now showing signs of stabilization. We initiated cost actions well ahead of the COVID downturn, and we're seeing strong margin expansion as a result of our efforts. 
We expect to continue to generate strong cash flow, maintain a disciplined and balanced capital strategy and drive to business model performance and our focus on value creation for our stakeholders going forward.

And I would say, first off, I think, like many things COVID, the recovery is very uneven, and it's impacting different businesses differently. So the comments I made were very much around transportation. In markets that are soft, like indus",306,"Thanks, Craig. And I would say, first off, I think, like many things COVID, the recovery is very uneven, and it's impacting different businesses differently. So the comments I made were very much around transportation. In markets that are soft, like industrial, I would tell you, we still have in places like medical and aerospace, inventory is still being burned. So I do think the factors I'm talking about the supply chain are very similar to how we painted the overall picture of the 3 segments. 
I think when you look at the supply chain and you go to transportation, though, I think we ought to keep in perspective where auto production went to and that automotive is a just-in-time supply chain. So back in the third quarter, 12 million units were made that we made 22 million units on the planet, I think was quicker than we all would have thought the recovery was. And there will be some areas where there will be bottlenecks as everybody recovers, and you heard that. And certainly, our customers have adjusted some of their production due to that, and that's reflected in our guidance. 
But what's nice is, on top of that, even though we're talking about supply chain is where consumer inventory levels are, are very healthy. So when I think about what we try to track for long-term or how many cars are being bought on the planet, it's nice to see inventory levels on the lots when you look at North America and China, probably being more towards middle-to-low end of normal ranges, Europe is probably right around the middle. And it's not surprising that the supply chain is being stressed a little bit due to the improving markets we're seeing. And some of our customers have adjusted their production, and that's in our guidance."

I guess the question I would have is, when I look at the December quarter print and the March quarter guide, especially transportation up really strong and better than end unit production. I think the fewer folks will have is that a strong first half, fiscal first half for you folks could be over shipping versus end demand and OEMs are just building a lot more inventory than they need. And the risk would eventually be that in the back half of the year, your fiscal year back half, ends up being a lot softer as OEMs start to normalize inventory. 
Can you just perhaps talk about what are you seeing from your OEM level that gives you confidence that this isn't all building up inventory and there's a correction in the back half that we have to worry about?"

I think when you look at auto production going from quarter 1 to quarter",297,"I think the thing that you look at is certainly we have orders that are accelerating to the improving market. Supply chain does need to get to a normalized level where production is. I think when you look at auto production going from quarter 1 to quarter 2, we do expect it to be down to about 20 million units in our second quarter versus 22 in the first quarter. So that should also allow the supply chain to help normalize since there will be a little bit less production. And when we look at it is, what's really nice is our growth is due more to content and production than it is due to the supply chain replenishment. 
As we've always told you in an individual quarter, you can get supply chain movements one way or the other. But when I think about content per vehicle, as I said on the call, and really think about the $10 or so that our content increased over the past couple of years, really about half of that is driven due to traditional electronification of the car being more electronics in it. The other half is being driven by the benefit of the wins we have in HEMs as well as -- I'm sorry, electric mobility as well as what we've guided in content on the car having more data. So when we look at that, that's real content growth. Certainly, inter quarter, there may be a little bit of movement as supply chain goes, but the bigger driver of our growth is content. And it's what's really allowed our transportation segment to get back to pre-COVID levels on what we all know will be production this year based upon the external estimates, that will be less than pre-COVID."

Because I think one of the things that's important is what's nice about what we've seen over the past year is the electric vehicle seems to have stand the test of COVID. We talked about it last year about -- you had electric vehicle growth last year. This year, we believe electric vehicles on the planet are going to be up about 50% versus last year, continued strong adoption in Europe. Certainly, the adoption that Asia has already had and it's going to break through 10% of global production. 
So content will continue to be benefited by our position in electric vehicle. But we also have to realize there's still content opportunity in traditional architecture, too. And those products also go into electric vehicles. So what's nice about what we talked about going to 60 to 70, it's going to be a similar picture as we go forward because where we play in the architecture is on every vehicle. It's not just electric, it's also our legacy position and how globally strong we are with that position. 
So as we look forward, growth components, whether it be electric vehicle powertrain movement, whether it be features and electronification of any vehicle as well as you get more data and all of those are drivers to our content. And just in the past 2 years, you can see the reality of it. And that's what we get excited about, and I think it's what we get excited about as we look to forward growth."

And when you think about distribution, distribution touches both our CS and IS segments, industrial and communications segments, more than transportation. Our sales into the channel in the quarter, we're on par with our total company sales growth. So that 6%, pretty much how our sales to our channel partners were. Sell-out is -- their sell-out accelerated with some of these supply chain dynamics. They have a role to play. That's why they hold inventory. We have seen some of their orders increase, but I would say we're not over shipping into our distributors. Actually, their inventory levels on sort of a churn are actually lower than normal. So that's some of the balancing that will be occurring here as the world normalizes, hopefully. 
And net-net, in industrial, what I would tell you, while we may have some areas like in our industrial equipment, that showed shrink, I'll go back to, our medical customers are still burning some inventory, and so is aerospace and defense.

It's trending right, as we would expect, as we see in other parts of both our sensor and our connector business. 
So everything is on track there. Now it's given us about $50 million or so a quarter or $40 million, $50 million a quarter of revenue. And I would say that some of the work that we needed to do relative to some of the operational synergies, footprint consolidation things, not just on their end, but things that will eventually move into their facilities from our existing sensors business is still ongoing.

I think the first differentiator we have is our global position and where do we bring the innovation. And it starts with those design centers that are everywhere where current vehicles are designed in next-generation vehicles and that's pretty special. And that's where we've leveraged our traditional position there. The other thing is when you get into the architecture of a car, our knowledge is there are parts of traditional architecture that do go over into an electric vehicle. So certainly, there's a lot of discussion around the powertrain, how does that involve the batteries, but also realize that architecture does come together as you bring low voltage and high voltage together and certainly come into the infotainment and data element of it that could go into autonomy. 
So we play across all those elements. I think it's a very unique position that TE has that also comes into the content opportunity. The other thing that is, and these are investments that we started to make 10 years ago, is when we look at electric vehicle, like I said earlier, we think there's going to be about 9 million made this year, 5 million of those will be in Asia. Europe continues to accelerate. And one of the things we probably get more excited about is not only the vehicle technology but where do you see support coming to make sure that electric vehicle penetration gets stronger. 
There's 2 big factors that come in, not only just -- not only consumer adoption, but you come into the 2 big things outside the car that relate to infrastructure as well as battery technology. And you continue to see developments in that space that with where EVs are going, we think will create continued momentum on EV adoption as well as support of the infrastructure and certainly, the battery technologies that are so important to it. And that's happening globally. 
So early on, we were very much bullish on Asia. Certainly, Europe with some of their regulations and certainly, you continue to see, at a lesser pace, momentum here. But where TE comes in on that architecture, where how that architecture comes together, the electric, the data, the signal, that is our specialty. And it's really great how these trends we're going to benefit from and show them in our content numbers."

I do actually think this period over the past year and the dynamics and the challenges we've all gone through, we're getting to show our portfolio, the diversity of it and why we like our portfolio. And a lot of people had questions of how this portfolio would act because it wasn't the same portfolio. And we do like our portfolio and you see that here. 
I think the other thing what we look forward is the content elements we've talked to you about and you think about transportation. The content opportunities we are talking about are still in early stages. And electric vehicle is early stage, autonomy is early stage, and that, in many ways, more content kickers we've been talking about, and you're starting to see it in the numbers, and they're going to be around for a while. But I would say it's not just limited to auto and transportation. You've seen how our communications segment has changed, certainly around our cloud investments and how we've gained share in cloud that has made that segment a good performer. 
And when you think about industrial, medical will come back, comm air will come back and our positions are very strong. So there are things that certainly -- they're hurting us now, but I think will be things that drive content longer in the future. And those are the things where data and power are going, whether it's around sustainability or just being more connected, where things get more productive like factory automation, we still have content opportunity to drive growth that's going to be above market. 
The other thing I would just say, while I'm pleased with the execution, our margin improvement story is not over. Our transportation and our industrial segments, we've been doing some heavy lifting to get to where we believe these businesses are entitled. It's nice to see our transportation segment on lower volume than peak being back close to the margin, we think it should be at, but our industrial segment has room to go. And lastly, I think it goes to the point that you sort of alluded to in your question is we like our cash-generative business model. It provides choices, whether to return capital or to do the bolt-ons like Scott's question to Heath around First Sensor. And what's nice is we do have organic secular trends that we can do bolt-ons into. And we're going to maintain discipline as we go through it. 
So as we look forward, it's nice to see some improvement. We're always going to have a market that's probably cycling one way or the other with the diversity, but I do think what the portfolio has shown up, we're pretty proud of, and we think there's more room to run on the growth on the margin side, which turns into earnings power and cash generation for value creation."

So there is a scale advantage, certainly, our customers expect that. And we do expect there will be price compression in our content as EV scale. We also have to make sure we bring our technology and our scale to make sure these vehicles are affordable. And so that's always been included. You will still have increased content. So I don't think you see it getting to an ICE engine content, but there will be some as you move up the volume curve on platforms and as the industry scales, and we've always said that to you. 
So that's how we've always said it, and then we don't see that changing, and it's something that's very important for the industry to make sure electric vehicles are on par with traditional engines so that consumers can choose what they want."

I understand longer term, there can be more pricing competition as that builds. But I guess over the next 2 years, is there any reason to think that would slow? Obviously, the number is building off a higher base, but EV unit production is inflecting, and it seems like there could also be some sensor tailwinds as well."

The progression over time certainly is still part of our operating model and how we think about to go forward. Certainly, we've had to deal with some things that were unexpected relative to market conditions, no different than any other company out there. But we still feel like we're in a pretty good place. Now acquisitions are always going to feather in to a point where you have to overcome some of that dilutive impact initially and then you build upon that moving forward. But I still feel very good about it. I think you got to kind of break it down into the segments as well. The segments, we've kind of targeted and talked about automotive being roughly a 20% operating income business, which is above -- vails a good return from our overall investment as well as provides opportunity to enable reinvestment in the business for future growth, and that's a good return model. 
Industrial, which is in the low teens as we sit here today, but coming off of a pretty significant downturn, particularly in the commercial aerospace side as well as in the medical side, is still holding its head. But we would expect that over time, again, to be up in the high teens. So there's a fair amount of leverage there. And then in communications, we're in a pretty good place. We've done a lot of heavy lifting there, going back several years. And you're seeing the results there now when we get the types of volume reduction -- I'm sorry, the types of volume increases that we've seen, both in appliances and data and devices, you can see what the flow-through is in our factory environment with an optimized footprint that we enjoy today within communications. 
So there is still leverage in both transportation and in industrial. And in addition to that, we are still tackling some of the costs in the operating expense line that you would expect us to. And that's been coming down ratably, particularly as a percentage of sales, and that will continue to be the case. So feel good about our ability to continue to expand margins for some time now."

I mean, we -- certainly, 19.4% is a solid number at that segment level. But you have to remember that we are still trending well below where we were just a couple of years ago in terms of total global auto production. So we did a little north of 20%. So global water production in the quarter was a little north of 22 million units. If you think about where we were in 2018 and '19, we're still trending pretty -- still below those quarterly numbers. 
So yes, what it shows you is what we can do on lower auto production relative to some of those prior hurdles because we have tackled the fixed costs. But at the same time, we are going after we've been pretty public with you about some of the restructuring that we're doing and particularly in some of the -- what had been announced, and we're working through some European footprint moves within our transportation segment. And those are underway. In some cases, they're being pressured because we need some volume out of those facilities. But we'll see more benefit from those restructuring plans as we get through 2021 and into '22. 
The other thing I would say is when you see the types of recovery and Terrence mentioned going from 12 million units in the June quarter to 22 million units in the December quarter, that is a very steep ramp in terms of our ability to ramp up. And as part of that, you would expect there is some inefficiencies that are embedded in that. And so although we're pleased with the margins, there's still room to go with them."

Is that going to be similar as you look at more, say, battery connected HV cars in the future similar percent or actually better percent declines or worse declines? The reason why I ask is, as you know, there's a lot of shortages in the automotive semiconductor industry, and they're seeing better pricing declines. I know that you have more annual or longer-term contracts. But I was kind of wondering, longer term, for that segment, is the math formula of the 1% to 2% average price decline still intact? Or because these are newer technologies, they should actually decline faster? Or because they're newer technologies that they could actually hold up better?"

First off, when we look at pricing right now, we sort of view it as stable. Certainly, we don't make semiconductors. So some of the shortages that are happening in that space, yes, we do. When you look longer term, and that assumes supply chain normalizes, we do expect our electric vehicle product portfolio to have a higher price curve just due to the volume. And that's something we've always said that's included in our 4% to 6%. And so depending upon how those volumes go, and that's typically the arrangements that we have with our customers that are typically volume and we sit down and have those discussions with our customer. 
I would also tell you that when we think about content, we do expect content to be about 2x with EVs.

So I think there's a big thing here. And the trend of how do you bring feature integration into an ECU and certainly, the car has a lot of ECUs, but how the -- instead of adding a box to a car when you want to add to the architecture, you're adding a feature into an ECU which does help make sure the architecture doesn't get out of control. So this is not a new trend. It's always been a trend. Certainly, some people will go out and say, will there be only 1 mega ECU or 2. I think that's not a new idea, but I think that's going to be much further out. Net-net, what happens is the amount of interconnects that are in those ECUs become more complicated, which help us. And then certainly, the interfaces around where do you need to sense what's going on in the car also creates more connections. And no different than the content picture, I hope I painted earlier around where is content coming from, that $10, half of it is due to electric content, electric powertrain content, some data. But the other half is due to the low voltage architecture, that continues to get more connections in it as the car has more features to it. And you still need to have a connection to wherever the feature is back to a box. 
So certainly, ECU, no different than what semiconductors do all the time, which is it integrates more into a chip. You're going to see that in the car, that creates more complex connecting solutions as that box has to connect into other applications in the car, and that's actually good for us. We think it adds more connections, and it actually creates complexity, which our customers need us more from an innovation perspective. So I hope that frames it a little bit and helps you with that question."

Before I get into the slides, I would like to share some perspective on our first quarter. As you will see in the results, we are benefiting from our diverse portfolio and are continuing to execute on our margin expansion plans. While markets have been very dynamic over the past year, we are seeing improving conditions across the majority of them. Against this backdrop, we are demonstrating not only the resiliency of our operations, but also the ability to drive organic content growth ahead of our markets, while expanding operating margins and demonstrating strong free cash flow generation that is in line with our business model. 
We are positioned to continue to benefit from secular trends in growing markets while driving the margin expansion plans that we've highlighted to you, and you'll see the benefit of these efforts in our first quarter results as well as our guidance for the second quarter. With that as a quick backdrop, let me now frame out some of the key messages of today's call. First, I am very pleased with our execution in the first quarter, and I believe our teams delivered strong results. We delivered sales growth of 11% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 21% year-over-year, demonstrating the strength and diversity of the portfolio and the benefits from our operational improvements. 
Our sales were ahead of our expectations in each segment, but with the greatest outperformance in transportation, where we continue to generate strong content growth from electrification of the powertrain as well as increased data in the vehicle. Our adjusted operating margins expanded 190 basis points year-over-year to 17.7% with margin growth in both transportation and our communications segment and a slight decline in our industrial segment, where we maintained mid-teens margin performance despite a sales decline. 
We continue to demonstrate our strong cash generation model with our quarter 1 free cash flow being at a first quarter record of approximately $530 million. We continue to expect approximately 100% free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income for this fiscal year. And as we look to our second quarter, we are expecting our strong performance to continue. We expect sales and adjusted earnings per share, similar to the first quarter at approximately $3.5 billion of revenue and $1.47 in earnings per share. And like in the first quarter, we again expect double-digit sales and adjusted earnings per share growth year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss our performance relative to where our markets were in the pre-COVID time frame of our fiscal 2019, and we do hope this will provide a baseline for evaluating our performance and progress this year. At the overall company level, our revenue is approximately back to pre-COVID levels despite the majority of our markets being below 2019 levels. And I'd like to give you some color by the 3 different segments. In our communications segment, we have seen strong improvement in our end markets, and this has helped enable sales to recover above pre-COVID levels. And for example, in data and devices as well as in appliances, we're benefiting from continued data center build-outs and home investments, respectively. In our industrial segment, it is a very different environment. We have markets that continue to remain weak as a result of COVID impacts, commercial layer and medical markets and our sales are still well below pre-COVID levels. However, what we are seeing is it does look like order patterns are indicating that we could be touching along the bottom in both of these businesses, and we could see some improvements later in the year. 
And in our transportation segment, our auto and commercial transportation businesses are now generating revenue above the levels we saw prior to COVID, even though global auto and truck production is still forecasted to be below fiscal 2019 levels. Content growth and share gains have driven the outperformance, reflecting our leadership position in these markets. TE products and technology are designed in the next-generation of sustainable vehicles at every leading OEM worldwide. The real proof of the traction is our content per vehicle progression. In fiscal 2019, our content per vehicle in auto was in the low 60s, and it's now trending into the low 70s range. 
As consumer adoption increases for hybrid and electric vehicles, and we continue to bring more innovation to our customers, we expect our content per vehicle to expand into the 80s over time. What's nice is that consumer preference continues to drive the features and the technology, and we will continue to benefit as vehicles become more safe, green and connected, driving more content for connector and sensing solutions. While I am pleased with our results and the progress that we've made operationally, I'm even more excited about the sales growth and margin expansion opportunities that we still have ahead of us. We continue to execute on our margin expansion plans in transportation and industrial that we started prior to COVID and accelerated during the pandemic. 
I'm also very proud of the margin progression in communications, which has offset the volume-related pressure that we're seeing in industrial as a result of the market impacts due to COVID. 
So now if we could turn to the slides, and I'd ask you to turn to Slide 3 to provide some additional details for the first quarter and our expectations for the second quarter. Quarter 1 sales of $3.5 billion were better than our expectations, up 11% on a reported basis and 6% organically year-over-year. We had 12% organic growth in both transportation and in communications, with growth across all businesses in those 2 segments. Industrial segment sales were down 8% organically due to the COVID-related impacts I already talked about. 
During the quarter, we saw orders of $4 billion, and this was up 25% year-over-year, reflecting an improvement in the majority of the end markets we serve, and I'll come back to orders in a couple of slides. From an earnings per share perspective, our adjusted earnings per share was $1.47. This was up 21% year-over-year due to the strong operational performance, where we showed adjusted operating income being up approximately 25% year-over-year. As we look forward, we expect our strong performance to continue into our second quarter, with sales and adjusted earnings per share being similar to first quarter levels despite lower sequential auto production. 
For the second quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $3.5 billion, and this is up approximately 10% year-over-year on a reported basis and mid-single digits organically. Similar to our first quarter, year-over-year growth will be driven by transportation and communications, partially offset by an organic decline in industrial. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.47 in the second quarter, and this will be up 14% year-over-year with adjusted operating margin expansion included in our earnings performance. 
So if you could, let me turn to Slide 4, and I'll get into our order trends that we're seeing. For the first quarter, our orders were approximately $4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.15. I would like to highlight that this level of orders reflects improvements in a number of our end markets as well as some supply chain replenishment. As we see markets improving, it is not surprising that our orders reflect the impact of supply chains being replenished after the shutdowns that occurred in the U.S. and Europe in the third quarter of last year. We are also seeing customers placing advanced orders in some cases due to product constraints and the broader electronic component categories like semiconductors and certain passive components. And the guidance that we give, does factor in the impact of these supply chain dynamics. And looking at orders by segment, on a year-over-year basis, transportation and communication orders both grew 36% with broad-based growth across all businesses. 
Industrial orders declined slightly year-over-year. But on a sequential basis, we did see orders growth in all businesses in each segment. So let me also add some color on what we're seeing in orders from a geographic perspective, and I'll provide this on an organic basis. In China, our orders were up 33% in the first quarter with growth driven by transportation and communications. We are benefiting from our strong position in auto, commercial transportation and appliances and continue to see strong improvement across those markets in China. We also saw 26% year-over-year growth in Europe with growth in all segments. This represents a second consecutive quarter of orders growth in Europe with some markets improving following the large drops from COVID back in the middle of last year. 
And in North America, our orders were flat, with growth in transportation and communications being offset by declines in industrial. Now what I'd like to do is touch upon our segment results briefly, and I'll cover those on Slide 5 through 7 of the slides we issued. Starting with transportation. Our sales were up 12% organically year-over-year with growth in each one of our businesses. In auto, sales were up 11% organically versus global auto production growth in the low single digits. The outperformance is driven by continued strong content growth and some benefits from the supply chain replenishing. We are seeing gains from our leadership position in next-generation products and technology and the value that we bring to our customers. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing strong content growth from the move to an electric powertrain and increased data connectivity as well as the continued electronification of the vehicle. In our commercial transportation business, we saw 25% organic growth driven by electronification trends, which are helping content outperformance as well as ongoing share gains. We are also benefiting from higher emission standards and new increased operator adoption of Euro 5 and 6 in China and new emission standards in India. We saw growth in all regions as well as all market verticals that we serve in our commercial transportation business and continue to benefit from our strong position in China. We are also seeing increased program wins in the electric powertrain and commercial transportation that will provide future content growth. 
In sensors, we saw 29% growth on a reported basis, which included the revenue contribution from the First Sensor acquisition. On an organic basis, sales increased 3%, driven by growth in auto applications. And we continue to expand our design win pipeline in auto sensing and expect growth at these platforms continue to increase in volume. From an operating margin perspective, the segment expanded margins by 200 basis points to 19.4%, driven by strong operational performance. 
Now let me move over to the industrial segment, where, as I mentioned, our sales declined 8% organically year-over-year, and our adjusted operating margins were down slightly to 13.5% despite the 8% organic sales decline. I am very proud we were able to maintain our mid-teens adjusted operating margins due to the cost actions that we initiated over the past couple of years. During the quarter, the segment continued to be impacted by the decline in the commercial aerospace market, with our AD&M business declining 22% organically. As I mentioned earlier, we do believe we're touching along the bottom in this business and could see improvement in comm air later in this year. 
Our industrial equipment business was up 8% organically with growth in all regions and strength in factory automation applications. And we continue to see weakness in our medical business with ongoing delays in interventional elective procedures that have been caused by COVID. We anticipate this to be a short-term dynamic in medical that is consistent with what our customers are seeing and expect this market to return to growth as these procedures start to increase later in the year. And lastly, in our energy business, we saw a 4% organic decline driven by COVID impact on utility spending, but we did see growth in renewable energy applications in the wind and solar applications. 
Now let me turn to the communications segment, where our sales grew 12% organically year-over-year with growth in both data and devices as well as appliances. We do continue to benefit from the recovery in China and Asia more broadly, which represents over half of our sales in this segment. In data and devices, our sales grew 5% organically year-over-year due to the strong position we built in high-speed solution for cloud applications. And in appliances, we grew 21% organically year-over-year with growth across all regions and benefits from home investments and an improved housing market. I would have to say our communication team continues to perform very well, delivering 17.6% adjusted operating margins, which is up 550 basis points versus the prior year. 
Now with that segment overview, let me turn it over to Heath, who will get into more details on the financials and our expectations going forward."

Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q1 financials. Adjusted operating income was $624 million, up approximately 25% year-over-year with an adjusted operating margin of 17.7%. GA",677,"Thank you, Terrence, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q1 financials. Adjusted operating income was $624 million, up approximately 25% year-over-year with an adjusted operating margin of 17.7%. GAAP operating income was $448 million and included $167 million of restructuring and other charges and $9 million of acquisition-related charges. We plan for the restructuring to be front-end loaded this year and continue to expect total restructuring charges in the ballpark of $200 million for fiscal '21, as we continue to optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve the fixed cost structure of the organization. Adjusted EPS was $1.47, and GAAP EPS was $1.13 for the quarter and included a tax-related benefit of $0.09. 
We also had restructuring, acquisition and other charges of $0.43, the reconciliation is provided. The adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was approximately 20%. For the second quarter, we expect our tax rate to be in the high teens and continue to expect an effective tax rate of around 19% for fiscal '21. Importantly, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our reported ETR for the full year. 
So if you'll turn to Slide 9. Sales of $3.5 billion were 11% -- were up 11% on a reported basis and up 6% on an organic basis year-over-year. Currency exchange rates positively impacted sales by $106 million versus the prior year. We are demonstrating our business model execution with adjusted EPS of $1.47, up 21% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margins were 17.7%, as I mentioned earlier, and that is an expansion of 190 basis points versus prior year. I am pleased with the progress we are making in driving improvements to our cost structure and our strong operational performance, and we continue to execute on our footprint consolidation and cost reduction plans in both transportation and industrial, and we are now benefiting from the heavy lifting that we've already completed in our communications segment. 
Transportation adjusted operating margin was 19.4%, which is nearing our business model target of 20%. Industrial adjusted operating margins remained in the mid-teens despite significant volume drops, which demonstrates the benefits of our cost actions that we have been discussing with you over the past few years. I'm also very pleased with the 17.6% adjusted operating margin in communication, which reflects our strong operational execution that I mentioned earlier. 
In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $640 million, and we had very strong cash flow for the quarter of approximately $530 million, which represents a first quarter record, as Terrence mentioned, and we returned $286 million to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Our strong cash flow performance last year and into the first quarter of this year demonstrates the strength of our cash generation model, and we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to approximate 100% for the full year. We remain committed to our disciplined use of cash and over time, we expect 2/3 of our free cash flow to be returned to shareholders and about 1/3 to be used for acquisitions. 
Now before we go into questions, I want to reiterate that we remain excited about how we've positioned our portfolio. With leadership positions in the markets we serve, along with organic growth and margin expansion opportunities ahead of us. To summarize, we have discussed the benefits of secular trends across our portfolio. You are seeing content growth enabling sales performance above our markets in auto and commercial transportation, benefits from some market recovery in data and devices and appliances and some markets that have been impacted by COVID in the industrial segment that are now showing signs of stabilization. We initiated cost actions well ahead of the COVID downturn, and we're seeing strong margin expansion as a result of our efforts. 
We expect to continue to generate strong cash flow, maintain a disciplined and balanced capital strategy and drive to business model performance and our focus on value creation for our stakeholders going forward. 
So now let's open this up for questions, Sujal?"

And I would say, first off, I think, like many things COVID, the recovery is very uneven, and it's impacting different businesses differently.

And I would say, first off, I think, like many things COVID, the recovery is very uneven, and it's impacting different businesses differently. So the comments I made were very much around transportation. In markets that are soft, like industrial, I would tell you, we still have in places like medical and aerospace, inventory is still being burned. So I do think the factors I'm talking about the supply chain are very similar to how we painted the overall picture of the 3 segments. 
I think when you look at the supply chain and you go to transportation, though, I think we ought to keep in perspective where auto production went to and that automotive is a just-in-time supply chain. So back in the third quarter, 12 million units were made that we made 22 million units on the planet, I think was quicker than we all would have thought the recovery was. And there will be some areas where there will be bottlenecks as everybody recovers, and you heard that. And certainly, our customers have adjusted some of their production due to that, and that's reflected in our guidance. 
But what's nice is, on top of that, even though we're talking about supply chain is where consumer inventory levels are, are very healthy. So when I think about what we try to track for long-term or how many cars are being bought on the planet, it's nice to see inventory levels on the lots when you look at North America and China, probably being more towards middle-to-low end of normal ranges, Europe is probably right around the middle. And it's not surprising that the supply chain is being stressed a little bit due to the improving markets we're seeing. And some of our customers have adjusted their production, and that's in our guidance."

I guess the question I would have is, when I look at the December quarter print and the March quarter guide, especially transportation up really strong and better than end unit production. I think the fewer folks will have is that a strong first half, fiscal first half for you folks could be over shipping versus end demand and OEMs are just building a lot more inventory than they need. And the risk would eventually be that in the back half of the year, your fiscal year back half, ends up being a lot softer as OEMs start to normalize inventory. 
Can you just perhaps talk about what are you seeing from your OEM level that gives you confidence that this isn't all building up inventory and there's a correction in the back half that we have to worry about?"

I think when you look at auto production going from quarter 1 to quarter",297,"I think the thing that you look at is certainly we have orders that are accelerating to the improving market. Supply chain does need to get to a normalized level where production is. I think when you look at auto production going from quarter 1 to quarter 2, we do expect it to be down to about 20 million units in our second quarter versus 22 in the first quarter. So that should also allow the supply chain to help normalize since there will be a little bit less production. And when we look at it is, what's really nice is our growth is due more to content and production than it is due to the supply chain replenishment. 
As we've always told you in an individual quarter, you can get supply chain movements one way or the other. But when I think about content per vehicle, as I said on the call, and really think about the $10 or so that our content increased over the past couple of years, really about half of that is driven due to traditional electronification of the car being more electronics in it. The other half is being driven by the benefit of the wins we have in HEMs as well as -- I'm sorry, electric mobility as well as what we've guided in content on the car having more data. So when we look at that, that's real content growth. Certainly, inter quarter, there may be a little bit of movement as supply chain goes, but the bigger driver of our growth is content. And it's what's really allowed our transportation segment to get back to pre-COVID levels on what we all know will be production this year based upon the external estimates, that will be less than pre-COVID."

Because I think one of the things that's important is what's nice about what we've seen over the past year is the electric vehicle seems to have stand the test of COVID. We talked about it last year about -- you had electric vehicle growth last year. This year, we believe electric vehicles on the planet are going to be up about 50% versus last year, continued strong adoption in Europe. Certainly, the adoption that Asia has already had and it's going to break through 10% of global production. 
So content will continue to be benefited by our position in electric vehicle. But we also have to realize there's still content opportunity in traditional architecture, too. And those products also go into electric vehicles. So what's nice about what we talked about going to 60 to 70, it's going to be a similar picture as we go forward because where we play in the architecture is on every vehicle. It's not just electric, it's also our legacy position and how globally strong we are with that position. 
So as we look forward, growth components, whether it be electric vehicle powertrain movement, whether it be features and electronification of any vehicle as well as you get more data and all of those are drivers to our content. And just in the past 2 years, you can see the reality of it. And that's what we get excited about, and I think it's what we get excited about as we look to forward growth."

And when you think about distribution, distribution touches both our CS and IS segments, industrial and communications segments, more than transportation. Our sales into the channel in the quarter, we're on par with our total company sales growth. So that 6%, pretty much how our sales to our channel partners were. Sell-out is -- their sell-out accelerated with some of these supply chain dynamics. They have a role to play. That's why they hold inventory. We have seen some of their orders increase, but I would say we're not over shipping into our distributors. Actually, their inventory levels on sort of a churn are actually lower than normal. So that's some of the balancing that will be occurring here as the world normalizes, hopefully. 
And net-net, in industrial, what I would tell you, while we may have some areas like in our industrial equipment, that showed shrink, I'll go back to, our medical customers are still burning some inventory, and so is aerospace and defense. So net-net, I would not say there is supply chain replenishment in industrial that we're benefiting from."

It's trending right, as we would expect, as we see in other parts of both our sensor and our connector business. 
So everything is on track there. Now it's given us about $50 million or so a quarter or $40 million, $50 million a quarter of revenue. And I would say that some of the work that we needed to do relative to some of the operational synergies, footprint consolidation things, not just on their end, but things that will eventually move into their facilities from our existing sensors business is still ongoing. So we're not expecting a lot of bottom line support this particular year, but trajectory still looks good as we move forward."

I think the first differentiator we have is our global position and where do we bring the innovation. And it starts with those design centers that are everywhere where current vehicles are designed in next-generation vehicles and that's pretty special. And that's where we've leveraged our traditional position there. The other thing is when you get into the architecture of a car, our knowledge is there are parts of traditional architecture that do go over into an electric vehicle. So certainly, there's a lot of discussion around the powertrain, how does that involve the batteries, but also realize that architecture does come together as you bring low voltage and high voltage together and certainly come into the infotainment and data element of it that could go into autonomy. 
So we play across all those elements. I think it's a very unique position that TE has that also comes into the content opportunity. The other thing that is, and these are investments that we started to make 10 years ago, is when we look at electric vehicle, like I said earlier, we think there's going to be about 9 million made this year, 5 million of those will be in Asia. Europe continues to accelerate. And one of the things we probably get more excited about is not only the vehicle technology but where do you see support coming to make sure that electric vehicle penetration gets stronger. 
There's 2 big factors that come in, not only just -- not only consumer adoption, but you come into the 2 big things outside the car that relate to infrastructure as well as battery technology. And you continue to see developments in that space that with where EVs are going, we think will create continued momentum on EV adoption as well as support of the infrastructure and certainly, the battery technologies that are so important to it. And that's happening globally. 
So early on, we were very much bullish on Asia. Certainly, Europe with some of their regulations and certainly, you continue to see, at a lesser pace, momentum here. But where TE comes in on that architecture, where how that architecture comes together, the electric, the data, the signal, that is our specialty. And it's really great how these trends we're going to benefit from and show them in our content numbers."

So thanks for that question, and I do appreciate it, Mark.

I do actually think th",527,"Yes. So thanks for that question, and I do appreciate it, Mark. I think when you think about -- when we look forward, I think there's one that I'll talk about short term, and then there's ones that I think are important longer term. I do actually think this period over the past year and the dynamics and the challenges we've all gone through, we're getting to show our portfolio, the diversity of it and why we like our portfolio. And a lot of people had questions of how this portfolio would act because it wasn't the same portfolio. And we do like our portfolio and you see that here. 
I think the other thing what we look forward is the content elements we've talked to you about and you think about transportation. The content opportunities we are talking about are still in early stages. And electric vehicle is early stage, autonomy is early stage, and that, in many ways, more content kickers we've been talking about, and you're starting to see it in the numbers, and they're going to be around for a while. But I would say it's not just limited to auto and transportation. You've seen how our communications segment has changed, certainly around our cloud investments and how we've gained share in cloud that has made that segment a good performer. 
And when you think about industrial, medical will come back, comm air will come back and our positions are very strong. So there are things that certainly -- they're hurting us now, but I think will be things that drive content longer in the future. And those are the things where data and power are going, whether it's around sustainability or just being more connected, where things get more productive like factory automation, we still have content opportunity to drive growth that's going to be above market. 
The other thing I would just say, while I'm pleased with the execution, our margin improvement story is not over. Our transportation and our industrial segments, we've been doing some heavy lifting to get to where we believe these businesses are entitled. It's nice to see our transportation segment on lower volume than peak being back close to the margin, we think it should be at, but our industrial segment has room to go. And lastly, I think it goes to the point that you sort of alluded to in your question is we like our cash-generative business model. It provides choices, whether to return capital or to do the bolt-ons like Scott's question to Heath around First Sensor. And what's nice is we do have organic secular trends that we can do bolt-ons into. And we're going to maintain discipline as we go through it. 
So as we look forward, it's nice to see some improvement. We're always going to have a market that's probably cycling one way or the other with the diversity, but I do think what the portfolio has shown up, we're pretty proud of, and we think there's more room to run on the growth on the margin side, which turns into earnings power and cash generation for value creation."

How much of that spread is like actually more physical volumes on the cars? And how much is because the price of these products is significantly higher because the volumes are significantly lower.

Certainly, we've had to deal with some things that were unexpected relative to market conditions, no different than any other company out there. But we still feel like we're in a pretty good place. Now acquisitions are always going to feather in to a point where you have to overcome some of that dilutive impact initially and then you build upon that moving forward. But I still feel very good about it. I think you got to kind of break it down into the segments as well. The segments, we've kind of targeted and talked about automotive being roughly a 20% operating income business, which is above -- vails a good return from our overall investment as well as provides opportunity to enable reinvestment in the business for future growth, and that's a good return model. 
Industrial, which is in the low teens as we sit here today, but coming off of a pretty significant downturn, particularly in the commercial aerospace side as well as in the medical side, is still holding its head. But we would expect that over time, again, to be up in the high teens. So there's a fair amount of leverage there. And then in communications, we're in a pretty good place. We've done a lot of heavy lifting there, going back several years. And you're seeing the results there now when we get the types of volume reduction -- I'm sorry, the types of volume increases that we've seen, both in appliances and data and devices, you can see what the flow-through is in our factory environment with an optimized footprint that we enjoy today within communications. 
So there is still leverage in both transportation and in industrial. And in addition to that, we are still tackling some of the costs in the operating expense line that you would expect us to. And that's been coming down ratably, particularly as a percentage of sales, and that will continue to be the case. So feel good about our ability to continue to expand margins for some time now."

So global water production in the quarter was a little north of 22 million units. If you think about where we were in 2018 and '19, we're still trending pretty -- still below those quarterly numbers. 
So yes, what it shows you is what we can do on lower auto production relative to some of those prior hurdles because we have tackled the fixed costs. But at the same time, we are going after we've been pretty public with you about some of the restructuring that we're doing and particularly in some of the -- what had been announced, and we're working through some European footprint moves within our transportation segment. And those are underway. In some cases, they're being pressured because we need some volume out of those facilities. But we'll see more benefit from those restructuring plans as we get through 2021 and into '22. 
The other thing I would say is when you see the types of recovery and Terrence mentioned going from 12 million units in the June quarter to 22 million units in the December quarter, that is a very steep ramp in terms of our ability to ramp up. And as part of that, you would expect there is some inefficiencies that are embedded in that. And so although we're pleased with the margins, there's still room to go with them."

I know that you have more annual or longer-term contracts. But I was kind of wondering, longer term, for that segment, is the math formula of the 1% to 2% average price decline still intact?

So I think there's a big thing here. And the trend of how do you bring feature integration into an ECU and certainly, the car has a lot of ECUs, but how the -- instead of adding a box to a car when you want to add to the architecture, you're adding a feature into an ECU which does help make sure the architecture doesn't get out of control. So this is not a new trend. It's always been a trend. Certainly, some people will go out and say, will there be only 1 mega ECU or 2. I think that's not a new idea, but I think that's going to be much further out. Net-net, what happens is the amount of interconnects that are in those ECUs become more complicated, which help us. And then certainly, the interfaces around where do you need to sense what's going on in the car also creates more connections. And no different than the content picture, I hope I painted earlier around where is content coming from, that $10, half of it is due to electric content, electric powertrain content, some data. But the other half is due to the low voltage architecture, that continues to get more connections in it as the car has more features to it. And you still need to have a connection to wherever the feature is back to a box. 
So certainly, ECU, no different than what semiconductors do all the time, which is it integrates more into a chip. You're going to see that in the car, that creates more complex connecting solutions as that box has to connect into other applications in the car, and that's actually good for us. We think it adds more connections, and it actually creates complexity, which our customers need us more from an innovation perspective.

And what we're also very pleased with is our share gain and position that we've earned across all the cloud providers and not only on the margin side, the team should be congratulated also what they've done and how do we bring the innovation to those cloud providers."

And we have -- we've talked to you before about electric vehicles and trucks. And a lot of things happening around the last mile fleet. What I've said is, over this past year, we've seen a very significant increase in more platform work by the major commercial truck OEMs. And when you look at that increased activity, it seems to be more serious activity than dabbling products and projects. And what is really nice is when you think about our position in commercial transportation, it's in many ways, very similar to our automotive position. It's global, it's agnostic to the architecture. That's why we like being a Tier 2. And when we sit there and we look at what our teams are working on, we're seeing an acceleration. So certainly, when we look at commercial transportation, the breadth of vehicles that are in there, whether it's mining, whether it's Class A trucks and so forth, it's pretty broad. But we do get excited about the content opportunity there as well. And it does feel where we are today from a program activity is probably where we were 3 to 4 years ago in automotive, just giving you a gut feel on that of where this momentum is starting to accelerate. And it's really nice that we're going to leverage our position like we did in automotive, and that can be a content lever in ICT."

Before I get into the slides, I would like to share some perspective on our fir",2169,"Thanks, Sujal, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today to cover our results for our first fiscal quarter and also our expectations for our second fiscal quarter of 2021. Before I get into the slides, I would like to share some perspective on our first quarter. As you will see in the results, we are benefiting from our diverse portfolio and are continuing to execute on our margin expansion plans. While markets have been very dynamic over the past year, we are seeing improving conditions across the majority of them. Against this backdrop, we are demonstrating not only the resiliency of our operations, but also the ability to drive organic content growth ahead of our markets, while expanding operating margins and demonstrating strong free cash flow generation that is in line with our business model. 
We are positioned to continue to benefit from secular trends in growing markets while driving the margin expansion plans that we've highlighted to you, and you'll see the benefit of these efforts in our first quarter results as well as our guidance for the second quarter. With that as a quick backdrop, let me now frame out some of the key messages of today's call. First, I am very pleased with our execution in the first quarter, and I believe our teams delivered strong results. We delivered sales growth of 11% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 21% year-over-year, demonstrating the strength and diversity of the portfolio and the benefits from our operational improvements. 
Our sales were ahead of our expectations in each segment, but with the greatest outperformance in transportation, where we continue to generate strong content growth from electrification of the powertrain as well as increased data in the vehicle. Our adjusted operating margins expanded 190 basis points year-over-year to 17.7% with margin growth in both transportation and our communications segment and a slight decline in our industrial segment, where we maintained mid-teens margin performance despite a sales decline. 
We continue to demonstrate our strong cash generation model with our quarter 1 free cash flow being at a first quarter record of approximately $530 million. We continue to expect approximately 100% free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income for this fiscal year. And as we look to our second quarter, we are expecting our strong performance to continue. We expect sales and adjusted earnings per share, similar to the first quarter at approximately $3.5 billion of revenue and $1.47 in earnings per share. And like in the first quarter, we again expect double-digit sales and adjusted earnings per share growth year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss our performance relative to where our markets were in the pre-COVID time frame of our fiscal 2019, and we do hope this will provide a baseline for evaluating our performance and progress this year. At the overall company level, our revenue is approximately back to pre-COVID levels despite the majority of our markets being below 2019 levels. And I'd like to give you some color by the 3 different segments. In our communications segment, we have seen strong improvement in our end markets, and this has helped enable sales to recover above pre-COVID levels. And for example, in data and devices as well as in appliances, we're benefiting from continued data center build-outs and home investments, respectively. In our industrial segment, it is a very different environment. We have markets that continue to remain weak as a result of COVID impacts, commercial layer and medical markets and our sales are still well below pre-COVID levels. However, what we are seeing is it does look like order patterns are indicating that we could be touching along the bottom in both of these businesses, and we could see some improvements later in the year. 
And in our transportation segment, our auto and commercial transportation businesses are now generating revenue above the levels we saw prior to COVID, even though global auto and truck production is still forecasted to be below fiscal 2019 levels. Content growth and share gains have driven the outperformance, reflecting our leadership position in these markets. TE products and technology are designed in the next-generation of sustainable vehicles at every leading OEM worldwide. The real proof of the traction is our content per vehicle progression. In fiscal 2019, our content per vehicle in auto was in the low 60s, and it's now trending into the low 70s range. 
As consumer adoption increases for hybrid and electric vehicles, and we continue to bring more innovation to our customers, we expect our content per vehicle to expand into the 80s over time. What's nice is that consumer preference continues to drive the features and the technology, and we will continue to benefit as vehicles become more safe, green and connected, driving more content for connector and sensing solutions. While I am pleased with our results and the progress that we've made operationally, I'm even more excited about the sales growth and margin expansion opportunities that we still have ahead of us. We continue to execute on our margin expansion plans in transportation and industrial that we started prior to COVID and accelerated during the pandemic. 
I'm also very proud of the margin progression in communications, which has offset the volume-related pressure that we're seeing in industrial as a result of the market impacts due to COVID. 
So now if we could turn to the slides, and I'd ask you to turn to Slide 3 to provide some additional details for the first quarter and our expectations for the second quarter. Quarter 1 sales of $3.5 billion were better than our expectations, up 11% on a reported basis and 6% organically year-over-year. We had 12% organic growth in both transportation and in communications, with growth across all businesses in those 2 segments. Industrial segment sales were down 8% organically due to the COVID-related impacts I already talked about. 
During the quarter, we saw orders of $4 billion, and this was up 25% year-over-year, reflecting an improvement in the majority of the end markets we serve, and I'll come back to orders in a couple of slides. From an earnings per share perspective, our adjusted earnings per share was $1.47. This was up 21% year-over-year due to the strong operational performance, where we showed adjusted operating income being up approximately 25% year-over-year. As we look forward, we expect our strong performance to continue into our second quarter, with sales and adjusted earnings per share being similar to first quarter levels despite lower sequential auto production. 
For the second quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $3.5 billion, and this is up approximately 10% year-over-year on a reported basis and mid-single digits organically. Similar to our first quarter, year-over-year growth will be driven by transportation and communications, partially offset by an organic decline in industrial. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.47 in the second quarter, and this will be up 14% year-over-year with adjusted operating margin expansion included in our earnings performance. 
So if you could, let me turn to Slide 4, and I'll get into our order trends that we're seeing. For the first quarter, our orders were approximately $4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.15. I would like to highlight that this level of orders reflects improvements in a number of our end markets as well as some supply chain replenishment. As we see markets improving, it is not surprising that our orders reflect the impact of supply chains being replenished after the shutdowns that occurred in the U.S. and Europe in the third quarter of last year. We are also seeing customers placing advanced orders in some cases due to product constraints and the broader electronic component categories like semiconductors and certain passive components. And the guidance that we give, does factor in the impact of these supply chain dynamics. And looking at orders by segment, on a year-over-year basis, transportation and communication orders both grew 36% with broad-based growth across all businesses. 
Industrial orders declined slightly year-over-year. But on a sequential basis, we did see orders growth in all businesses in each segment. So let me also add some color on what we're seeing in orders from a geographic perspective, and I'll provide this on an organic basis. In China, our orders were up 33% in the first quarter with growth driven by transportation and communications. We are benefiting from our strong position in auto, commercial transportation and appliances and continue to see strong improvement across those markets in China. We also saw 26% year-over-year growth in Europe with growth in all segments. This represents a second consecutive quarter of orders growth in Europe with some markets improving following the large drops from COVID back in the middle of last year. 
And in North America, our orders were flat, with growth in transportation and communications being offset by declines in industrial. Now what I'd like to do is touch upon our segment results briefly, and I'll cover those on Slide 5 through 7 of the slides we issued. Starting with transportation. Our sales were up 12% organically year-over-year with growth in each one of our businesses. In auto, sales were up 11% organically versus global auto production growth in the low single digits. The outperformance is driven by continued strong content growth and some benefits from the supply chain replenishing. We are seeing gains from our leadership position in next-generation products and technology and the value that we bring to our customers. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing strong content growth from the move to an electric powertrain and increased data connectivity as well as the continued electronification of the vehicle. In our commercial transportation business, we saw 25% organic growth driven by electronification trends, which are helping content outperformance as well as ongoing share gains. We are also benefiting from higher emission standards and new increased operator adoption of Euro 5 and 6 in China and new emission standards in India. We saw growth in all regions as well as all market verticals that we serve in our commercial transportation business and continue to benefit from our strong position in China. We are also seeing increased program wins in the electric powertrain and commercial transportation that will provide future content growth. 
In sensors, we saw 29% growth on a reported basis, which included the revenue contribution from the First Sensor acquisition. On an organic basis, sales increased 3%, driven by growth in auto applications. And we continue to expand our design win pipeline in auto sensing and expect growth at these platforms continue to increase in volume. From an operating margin perspective, the segment expanded margins by 200 basis points to 19.4%, driven by strong operational performance. 
Now let me move over to the industrial segment, where, as I mentioned, our sales declined 8% organically year-over-year, and our adjusted operating margins were down slightly to 13.5% despite the 8% organic sales decline. I am very proud we were able to maintain our mid-teens adjusted operating margins due to the cost actions that we initiated over the past couple of years. During the quarter, the segment continued to be impacted by the decline in the commercial aerospace market, with our AD&M business declining 22% organically. As I mentioned earlier, we do believe we're touching along the bottom in this business and could see improvement in comm air later in this year. 
Our industrial equipment business was up 8% organically with growth in all regions and strength in factory automation applications. And we continue to see weakness in our medical business with ongoing delays in interventional elective procedures that have been caused by COVID. We anticipate this to be a short-term dynamic in medical that is consistent with what our customers are seeing and expect this market to return to growth as these procedures start to increase later in the year. And lastly, in our energy business, we saw a 4% organic decline driven by COVID impact on utility spending, but we did see growth in renewable energy applications in the wind and solar applications. 
Now let me turn to the communications segment, where our sales grew 12% organically year-over-year with growth in both data and devices as well as appliances. We do continue to benefit from the recovery in China and Asia more broadly, which represents over half of our sales in this segment. In data and devices, our sales grew 5% organically year-over-year due to the strong position we built in high-speed solution for cloud applications. And in appliances, we grew 21% organically year-over-year with growth across all regions and benefits from home investments and an improved housing market. I would have to say our communication team continues to perform very well, delivering 17.6% adjusted operating margins, which is up 550 basis points versus the prior year. 
Now with that segment overview, let me turn it over to Heath, who will get into more details on the financials and our expectations going forward."

Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q1 financials. Adjusted operating income was $624 million, up approximately 25% year-over-year with an adjusted operating margin of 17.7%. GAAP operating income was $448 million and included $167 million of restructuring and other charges and $9 million of acquisition-related charges. We plan for the restructuring to be front-end loaded this year and continue to expect total restructuring charges in the ballpark of $200 million for fiscal '21, as we continue to optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve the fixed cost structure of the organization. Adjusted EPS was $1.47, and GAAP EPS was $1.13 for the quarter and included a tax-related benefit of $0.09. 
We also had restructuring, acquisition and other charges of $0.43, the reconciliation is provided. The adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was approximately 20%. For the second quarter, we expect our tax rate to be in the high teens and continue to expect an effective tax rate of around 19% for fiscal '21. Importantly, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our reported ETR for the full year. 
So if you'll turn to Slide 9. Sales of $3.5 billion were 11% -- were up 11% on a reported basis and up 6% on an organic basis year-over-year. Currency exchange rates positively impacted sales by $106 million versus the prior year. We are demonstrating our business model execution with adjusted EPS of $1.47, up 21% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margins were 17.7%, as I mentioned earlier, and that is an expansion of 190 basis points versus prior year. I am pleased with the progress we are making in driving improvements to our cost structure and our strong operational performance, and we continue to execute on our footprint consolidation and cost reduction plans in both transportation and industrial, and we are now benefiting from the heavy lifting that we've already completed in our communications segment. 
Transportation adjusted operating margin was 19.4%, which is nearing our business model target of 20%. Industrial adjusted operating margins remained in the mid-teens despite significant volume drops, which demonstrates the benefits of our cost actions that we have been discussing with you over the past few years. I'm also very pleased with the 17.6% adjusted operating margin in communication, which reflects our strong operational execution that I mentioned earlier. 
In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $640 million, and we had very strong cash flow for the quarter of approximately $530 million, which represents a first quarter record, as Terrence mentioned, and we returned $286 million to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Our strong cash flow performance last year and into the first quarter of this year demonstrates the strength of our cash generation model, and we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to approximate 100% for the full year. We remain committed to our disciplined use of cash and over time, we expect 2/3 of our free cash flow to be returned to shareholders and about 1/3 to be used for acquisitions. 
Now before we go into questions, I want to reiterate that we remain excited about how we've positioned our portfolio. With leadership positions in the markets we serve, along with organic growth and margin expansion opportunities ahead of us. To summarize, we have discussed the benefits of secular trends across our portfolio. You are seeing content growth enabling sales performance above our markets in auto and commercial transportation, benefits from some market recovery in data and devices and appliances and some markets that have been impacted by COVID in the industrial segment that are now showing signs of stabilization. We initiated cost actions well ahead of the COVID downturn, and we're seeing strong margin expansion as a result of our efforts. 
We expect to continue to generate strong cash flow, maintain a disciplined and balanced capital strategy and drive to business model performance and our focus on value creation for our stakeholders going forward.

And I would say, first off, I think, like many things COVID, the recovery is very uneven, and it's impacting different businesses differently. So the comments I made were very much around transportation. In markets that are soft, like indus",306,"Thanks, Craig. And I would say, first off, I think, like many things COVID, the recovery is very uneven, and it's impacting different businesses differently. So the comments I made were very much around transportation. In markets that are soft, like industrial, I would tell you, we still have in places like medical and aerospace, inventory is still being burned. So I do think the factors I'm talking about the supply chain are very similar to how we painted the overall picture of the 3 segments. 
I think when you look at the supply chain and you go to transportation, though, I think we ought to keep in perspective where auto production went to and that automotive is a just-in-time supply chain. So back in the third quarter, 12 million units were made that we made 22 million units on the planet, I think was quicker than we all would have thought the recovery was. And there will be some areas where there will be bottlenecks as everybody recovers, and you heard that. And certainly, our customers have adjusted some of their production due to that, and that's reflected in our guidance. 
But what's nice is, on top of that, even though we're talking about supply chain is where consumer inventory levels are, are very healthy. So when I think about what we try to track for long-term or how many cars are being bought on the planet, it's nice to see inventory levels on the lots when you look at North America and China, probably being more towards middle-to-low end of normal ranges, Europe is probably right around the middle. And it's not surprising that the supply chain is being stressed a little bit due to the improving markets we're seeing. And some of our customers have adjusted their production, and that's in our guidance."

I guess the question I would have is, when I look at the December quarter print and the March quarter guide, especially transportation up really strong and better than end unit production. I think the fewer folks will have is that a strong first half, fiscal first half for you folks could be over shipping versus end demand and OEMs are just building a lot more inventory than they need. And the risk would eventually be that in the back half of the year, your fiscal year back half, ends up being a lot softer as OEMs start to normalize inventory. 
Can you just perhaps talk about what are you seeing from your OEM level that gives you confidence that this isn't all building up inventory and there's a correction in the back half that we have to worry about?"

Supply chain does need to get to a normalized level where production is. I think when you look at auto production going from quarter 1 to quarter 2, we do expect it to be down to about 20 million units in our second quarter versus 22 in the first quarter. So that should also allow the supply chain to help normalize since there will be a little bit less production. And when we look at it is, what's really nice is our growth is due more to content and production than it is due to the supply chain replenishment. 
As we've always told you in an individual quarter, you can get supply chain movements one way or the other. But when I think about content per vehicle, as I said on the call, and really think about the $10 or so that our content increased over the past couple of years, really about half of that is driven due to traditional electronification of the car being more electronics in it. The other half is being driven by the benefit of the wins we have in HEMs as well as -- I'm sorry, electric mobility as well as what we've guided in content on the car having more data. So when we look at that, that's real content growth. Certainly, inter quarter, there may be a little bit of movement as supply chain goes, but the bigger driver of our growth is content. And it's what's really allowed our transportation segment to get back to pre-COVID levels on what we all know will be production this year based upon the external estimates, that will be less than pre-COVID."

Because I think one of the things that's important is what's nice about what we've seen over the past year is the electric vehicle seems to have stand the test of COVID. We talked about it last year about -- you had electric vehicle growth last year. This year, we believe electric vehicles on the planet are going to be up about 50% versus last year, continued strong adoption in Europe. Certainly, the adoption that Asia has already had and it's going to break through 10% of global production. 
So content will continue to be benefited by our position in electric vehicle. But we also have to realize there's still content opportunity in traditional architecture, too. And those products also go into electric vehicles. So what's nice about what we talked about going to 60 to 70, it's going to be a similar picture as we go forward because where we play in the architecture is on every vehicle. It's not just electric, it's also our legacy position and how globally strong we are with that position. 
So as we look forward, growth components, whether it be electric vehicle powertrain movement, whether it be features and electronification of any vehicle as well as you get more data and all of those are drivers to our content. And just in the past 2 years, you can see the reality of it. And that's what we get excited about, and I think it's what we get excited about as we look to forward growth."

And when you think about distribution, distribution touches both our CS and IS segments, industrial and communications segments, more than transportation. Our sales into the channel in the quarter, we're on par with our total company sales growth. So that 6%, pretty much how our sales to our channel partners were. Sell-out is -- their sell-out accelerated with some of these supply chain dynamics. They have a role to play. That's why they hold inventory. We have seen some of their orders increase, but I would say we're not over shipping into our distributors. Actually, their inventory levels on sort of a churn are actually lower than normal. So that's some of the balancing that will be occurring here as the world normalizes, hopefully. 
And net-net, in industrial, what I would tell you, while we may have some areas like in our industrial equipment, that showed shrink, I'll go back to, our medical customers are still burning some inventory, and so is aerospace and defense. So net-net, I would not say there is supply chain replenishment in industrial that we're benefiting from."

There's a -- given the German public company takeover dynamics, there's still a bit of a tail in terms of us acquiring the remaining 25 to 30 percentage points of the business with owners. But within that, First Sensor is behaving as we would expect it to, where we have market overlap, which is pretty considerable, whether that's in auto, general industrial, medical applications. It's trending right, as we would expect, as we see in other parts of both our sensor and our connector business. 
So everything is on track there. Now it's given us about $50 million or so a quarter or $40 million, $50 million a quarter of revenue. And I would say that some of the work that we needed to do relative to some of the operational synergies, footprint consolidation things, not just on their end, but things that will eventually move into their facilities from our existing sensors business is still ongoing.

I think the first differentiator we have is our global position and where do we bring the innovation. And it starts with those design centers that are everywhere where current vehicles are designed in next-generation vehicles and that's pretty special. And that's where we've leveraged our traditional position there. The other thing is when you get into the architecture of a car, our knowledge is there are parts of traditional architecture that do go over into an electric vehicle. So certainly, there's a lot of discussion around the powertrain, how does that involve the batteries, but also realize that architecture does come together as you bring low voltage and high voltage together and certainly come into the infotainment and data element of it that could go into autonomy. 
So we play across all those elements. I think it's a very unique position that TE has that also comes into the content opportunity. The other thing that is, and these are investments that we started to make 10 years ago, is when we look at electric vehicle, like I said earlier, we think there's going to be about 9 million made this year, 5 million of those will be in Asia. Europe continues to accelerate. And one of the things we probably get more excited about is not only the vehicle technology but where do you see support coming to make sure that electric vehicle penetration gets stronger. 
There's 2 big factors that come in, not only just -- not only consumer adoption, but you come into the 2 big things outside the car that relate to infrastructure as well as battery technology. And you continue to see developments in that space that with where EVs are going, we think will create continued momentum on EV adoption as well as support of the infrastructure and certainly, the battery technologies that are so important to it. And that's happening globally. 
So early on, we were very much bullish on Asia. Certainly, Europe with some of their regulations and certainly, you continue to see, at a lesser pace, momentum here. But where TE comes in on that architecture, where how that architecture comes together, the electric, the data, the signal, that is our specialty. And it's really great how these trends we're going to benefit from and show them in our content numbers."

I think when you think about -- when we look forward, I think there's one that I'll talk about short term, and then there's ones that I think are important longer term. I do actually think this period over the past year and the dynamics and the challenges we've all gone through, we're getting to show our portfolio, the diversity of it and why we like our portfolio. And a lot of people had questions of how this portfolio would act because it wasn't the same portfolio. And we do like our portfolio and you see that here. 
I think the other thing what we look forward is the content elements we've talked to you about and you think about transportation. The content opportunities we are talking about are still in early stages. And electric vehicle is early stage, autonomy is early stage, and that, in many ways, more content kickers we've been talking about, and you're starting to see it in the numbers, and they're going to be around for a while. But I would say it's not just limited to auto and transportation. You've seen how our communications segment has changed, certainly around our cloud investments and how we've gained share in cloud that has made that segment a good performer. 
And when you think about industrial, medical will come back, comm air will come back and our positions are very strong. So there are things that certainly -- they're hurting us now, but I think will be things that drive content longer in the future. And those are the things where data and power are going, whether it's around sustainability or just being more connected, where things get more productive like factory automation, we still have content opportunity to drive growth that's going to be above market. 
The other thing I would just say, while I'm pleased with the execution, our margin improvement story is not over. Our transportation and our industrial segments, we've been doing some heavy lifting to get to where we believe these businesses are entitled. It's nice to see our transportation segment on lower volume than peak being back close to the margin, we think it should be at, but our industrial segment has room to go. And lastly, I think it goes to the point that you sort of alluded to in your question is we like our cash-generative business model. It provides choices, whether to return capital or to do the bolt-ons like Scott's question to Heath around First Sensor. And what's nice is we do have organic secular trends that we can do bolt-ons into. And we're going to maintain discipline as we go through it. 
So as we look forward, it's nice to see some improvement. We're always going to have a market that's probably cycling one way or the other with the diversity, but I do think what the portfolio has shown up, we're pretty proud of, and we think there's more room to run on the growth on the margin side, which turns into earnings power and cash generation for value creation."

Certainly, we've had to deal with some things that were unexpected relative to market conditions, no different than any other company out there. But we still feel like we're in a pretty good place. Now acquisitions are always going to feather in to a point where you have to overcome some of that dilutive impact initially and then you build upon that moving forward. But I still feel very good about it. I think you got to kind of break it down into the segments as well. The segments, we've kind of targeted and talked about automotive being roughly a 20% operating income business, which is above -- vails a good return from our overall investment as well as provides opportunity to enable reinvestment in the business for future growth, and that's a good return model. 
Industrial, which is in the low teens as we sit here today, but coming off of a pretty significant downturn, particularly in the commercial aerospace side as well as in the medical side, is still holding its head. But we would expect that over time, again, to be up in the high teens. So there's a fair amount of leverage there. And then in communications, we're in a pretty good place. We've done a lot of heavy lifting there, going back several years. And you're seeing the results there now when we get the types of volume reduction -- I'm sorry, the types of volume increases that we've seen, both in appliances and data and devices, you can see what the flow-through is in our factory environment with an optimized footprint that we enjoy today within communications. 
So there is still leverage in both transportation and in industrial. And in addition to that, we are still tackling some of the costs in the operating expense line that you would expect us to. And that's been coming down ratably, particularly as a percentage of sales, and that will continue to be the case. So feel good about our ability to continue to expand margins for some time now."

I mean, we -- certainly, 19.4% is a solid number at that segment level. But you have to remember that we are still trending well below where we were just a couple of years ago in terms of total global auto production. So we did a little north of 20%. So global water production in the quarter was a little north of 22 million units. If you think about where we were in 2018 and '19, we're still trending pretty -- still below those quarterly numbers. 
So yes, what it shows you is what we can do on lower auto production relative to some of those prior hurdles because we have tackled the fixed costs. But at the same time, we are going after we've been pretty public with you about some of the restructuring that we're doing and particularly in some of the -- what had been announced, and we're working through some European footprint moves within our transportation segment. And those are underway. In some cases, they're being pressured because we need some volume out of those facilities. But we'll see more benefit from those restructuring plans as we get through 2021 and into '22. 
The other thing I would say is when you see the types of recovery and Terrence mentioned going from 12 million units in the June quarter to 22 million units in the December quarter, that is a very steep ramp in terms of our ability to ramp up. And as part of that, you would expect there is some inefficiencies that are embedded in that. And so although we're pleased with the margins, there's still room to go with them."

In the past, I believe, under conventional cars and autos, the price declines are kind of like 1% to 2%. Is that going to be similar as you look at more, say, battery connected HV cars in the future similar percent or actually better percent declines or worse declines? The reason why I ask is, as you know, there's a lot of shortages in the automotive semiconductor industry, and they're seeing better pricing declines. I know that you have more annual or longer-term contracts. But I was kind of wondering, longer term, for that segment, is the math formula of the 1% to 2% average price decline still intact? Or because these are newer technologies, they should actually decline faster? Or because they're newer technologies that they could actually hold up better?"

First off, when we look at pricing right now, we sort of view it as stable. Certainly, we don't make semiconductors. So some of the shortages that are happening in that space, yes, we do. When you look longer term, and that assumes supply chain normalizes, we do expect our electric vehicle product portfolio to have a higher price curve just due to the volume. And that's something we've always said that's included in our 4% to 6%. And so depending upon how those volumes go, and that's typically the arrangements that we have with our customers that are typically volume and we sit down and have those discussions with our customer. 
I would also tell you that when we think about content, we do expect content to be about 2x with EVs. And also the margin targets we give you also include that pricing that Heath has talked about a few minutes ago. So net-net, it will be a little bit higher as it scales in those product sets.

So I think there's a big thing here. And the trend of how do you bring feature integration into an ECU and certainly, the car has a lot of ECUs, but how the -- instead of adding a box to a car when you want to add to the architecture, you're adding a feature into an ECU which does help make sure the architecture doesn't get out of control. So this is not a new trend. It's always been a trend. Certainly, some people will go out and say, will there be only 1 mega ECU or 2. I think that's not a new idea, but I think that's going to be much further out. Net-net, what happens is the amount of interconnects that are in those ECUs become more complicated, which help us. And then certainly, the interfaces around where do you need to sense what's going on in the car also creates more connections. And no different than the content picture, I hope I painted earlier around where is content coming from, that $10, half of it is due to electric content, electric powertrain content, some data. But the other half is due to the low voltage architecture, that continues to get more connections in it as the car has more features to it. And you still need to have a connection to wherever the feature is back to a box. 
So certainly, ECU, no different than what semiconductors do all the time, which is it integrates more into a chip. You're going to see that in the car, that creates more complex connecting solutions as that box has to connect into other applications in the car, and that's actually good for us. We think it adds more connections, and it actually creates complexity, which our customers need us more from an innovation perspective. So I hope that frames it a little bit and helps you with that question."

Before I get into slides, let me give you some perspective on our second quarter. And I think as you'll see in our results, we are continuing to demonstrate the strength of our diverse portfolio and the benefit of content growth across our businesses. We are delivering organic growth ahead of our markets as well as strong operational performance and free cash flow generation. I would say this performance is in a world with an improving economic backdrop that is dealing with global supply chains that are trying to keep up with the broader macro recovery. We are continuing to execute to our business model, and you can see this in our second quarter results as well as the guidance that we provide for the third quarter and I'll talk about a little bit more today. 
So let me also provide some key messages about today's call. First off, I am very pleased with our execution in the second quarter. We delivered sales growth of 17% and generated record quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $1.57, and this EPS represents growth of 22% year-over-year. Our sales were ahead of our expectations, and it was broad across each segment driven by the continued recovery in most end markets we serve, our broad leadership positions and the benefits of the secular trends that we've strategically positioned TE to capitalize on. 
Also, our adjusted operating margins expanded 80 basis points year-over-year to 17%, and this was driven by margin expansion in both our transportation and communications segments. I also believe that you're going to continue to see us demonstrate our strong cash generation and truly evident of that is our year-to-date free cash flow, which was approximately $1 billion, which is also a company record for the first half of the fiscal year. And as we look into our third quarter, we are expecting our strong performance to continue with sales and adjusted earnings per share at similar levels to what we just delivered in the second quarter. 
With that as a little bit of a backdrop, I do want to take a moment to frame out the current market environment and our business relative to where we were just 90 days ago when we last spoke. In our transportation segment, consumer demand in autos continues to remain strong, and auto production is remaining stable in the range of 19 million to 20 million units per quarter globally even with the well-documented semi shortages, and we've also seen further strength in [ the sale in ] our commercial transportation end markets. The trends around content growth remains strong as we continue to benefit from increased electronification of vehicles and higher production of electric vehicles, which will enable us to continue to outperform auto production going forward. 
In our industrial segment, we see increased momentum in the recovery of industrial equipment markets due to factory automation and increasing manufacturing capital expenditure trends. Also in our industrial segment, the commercial aerospace and medical businesses are still being impacted by COVID, and this is similar to what we mentioned last quarter, but we do continue to see indicators of stability in our orders in both of these businesses. 
In our communications segment, the market trend we mentioned last quarter are continuing. Consumer demand is getting stronger, and globally, we've seen an increase in appliance demand. We continue to see strong ongoing capital expenditure trends in the cloud applications as well as acceleration of demand around the data center. 
And when you think about these trends I just covered in our segments as a backdrop, the faster-than-expected recovery in the markets that I mentioned has resulted in some challenges as the industries we serve replenish their supply chain and look to further secure supply. While this dynamic has benefited our orders, which remains strong, it has caused broader supply chain pressure. And the pressure we're experiencing is factored into our expectations for the third quarter guidance, and Heath will provide more color on this in his session. 
And the last thing I want to highlight is let's all remember that we are still in a world that's still on COVID. We continue to see countries going to lockdown again, and this is impacting some of our customers and their supply chains. And certainly, while vaccines are getting rolled out in certain parts of the world, the pace of the deployment and availability of the vaccines varies greatly by country, so some uncertainty remains. Our focus has been, and will continue to be, on keeping our employees safe while also helping our customers capitalize on the improving economic conditions. 
So with that as a backdrop, let me get into the slides, and I'd appreciate if you could turn to Slide 3 to provide some additional details for our second quarter and our expectations for the third quarter. Second quarter sales of $3.7 billion were better than our expectations in each of our segments. They were up 17% on a reported basis and 11% organically year-over-year. We had 15% organic growth in our transportation segment with double-digit growth across all businesses. We also had very strong performance in our communications segment with organic growth of 29%, which was strong double-digit growth in both of the businesses in that segment. And in our industrial segment, sales were down 4% organically due to the ongoing weakness in the commercial aerospace market. 
From an orders perspective, second quarter orders were $4.6 billion, and this was up 36% year-over-year. It reflects both the improvement in the markets that I mentioned, along with inventory replenishment in the supply chain by our customers. 
Our earnings per share was a record at $1.57 in the quarter, and this was up 22% year-over-year and was driven entirely by our operating performance, resulting in adjusted operating margins being up 80 basis points year-over-year. I am pleased that we were able to manage the broader supply chain pressures, which all companies are dealing with and had margin expansion. 
From a free cash flow perspective, in the second quarter, free cash flow was $477 million with approximately $340 million being returned to shareholders. As we look forward, we expect our strong performance to continue into the third quarter with sales and adjusted earnings per share being similar to our second quarter levels. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $3.7 billion and this is up significantly year-over-year on both a reported and an organic basis. And we expect adjusted earnings per share to be $1.57, which is in line with the levels we just saw in the quarter we just closed. 
So let's turn to Slide 4, and I'll cover the order trends that we're seeing. As I already stated in the quarter, our orders were very strong at approximately $4.6 billion, and we had a book-to-bill of 1.22. Orders in transportation and communications were up 50% and 45%, respectively. And this increase reflects both market recovery and supply chain replenishment in both of those segments. In these segments, customers are not only placing orders to meet current production needs but also replenishing the supply chains that were depleted during fiscal 2020. I would also highlight that with some of the shortages in semiconductors and certain passive components, we are seeing some areas where customers are placing orders to secure supply beyond our lead times. 
In our industrial segment, it is a different picture than what we're seeing in transportation and communications. But what is nice is that despite the year-over-year sales decline we had in this segment, we have seen orders growth of 7%, and that's driven by the continued recovery in the industrial equipment market partially offset by the weakness in commercial aerospace that I mentioned. 
Let me also, in orders, add some color on what we're seeing organically on a geographic basis, and I'm going to do this on a sequential basis to show where order momentum is. In China, our orders were up 3% from a strong base from fiscal quarter 1. And that growth was really driven by our industrial and communications segments. Orders on a sequential basis in Europe were up 14%, and North America sequential orders were up 22%, and that was broad-based growth across all our segments in those 2 regions. 
So let me get into our year-over-year segment results, and they're on Slides 5 through 7. I'm going to touch upon each segment briefly before I turn it over to Heath. Transportation sales were up 15% organically year-over-year with growth in each of the businesses. In auto, our sales were up 14% organically, and year-to-date, we are generating content outperformance over production in our expected 4% to 6% range. We continue to benefit from our leading global position and increased production of electric vehicles. And as you've probably seen, the number of EV launches are increasing by our customers around the world. 
In commercial transportation, similar to our first quarter, we saw 25% organic growth driven by ongoing emission trends, content outperformance and ongoing share gains. We are continuing to benefit from stricter emission standards and the increased operator adoption of Euro 5 and 6 in China, which reinforces our strong position in that country. We saw growth in all regions in our commercial transportation business, along with double-digit growth in all market verticals that we serve in this business. The other nice thing that we continue to see is we see increased wins on electric powertrain platforms and trucks, which give us confidence about the future content potential in this market in out years. 
In our sensors business, we saw 13% organic growth with growth in all markets and double-digit growth in auto applications. We do continue to expand our design win pipeline in auto sensing and expect growth as these platforms continue to increase in volume. From a margin perspective, Adjusted operating margins for the segment expanded 80 basis points to 18.1% driven by higher volumes versus the prior year and despite the supply chain pressures. 
So if we now turn to the industrial segment. As I said earlier, our sales declined 4% organically year-over-year. During the quarter, the segment continued to be impacted by the decline in the commercial aerospace market with our aerospace, defense and marine business declining 21% organically year-over-year. As I covered already, based upon the order patterns, we do believe this business is showing signs of stabilization at the current order levels. 
When you think about our industrial equipment market, It was very strong and up 16% organically, with growth in all regions and increasing strength in factory automation applications. where we're benefiting from accelerating capital expenditures in areas like semiconductor equipment as well as along the auto manufacturing supply chain. We continue to see weakness in our medical business in our industrial segment, and it was down 13% organically year-over-year, and this is being driven by ongoing delays in interventional elective procedures caused by COVID. And the dynamics we're experiencing in medical are consistent with what our customers are seeing, and we expect this market to return to growth as these procedures start to increase later in the year. 
And lastly, in the industrial segment, our Energy business, we saw 4% organic growth, and this was driven by increase in penetration of renewables especially benefiting from solar applications around the world. From a margin perspective in Industrial Solutions, our margins declined year-over-year to 12.5%, and that was really driven by the significant drop in commercial aerospace volumes. 
So let me cover the communications segment. And in this segment, we continue to benefit from both the market recovery and share gains while delivering very strong operational performance. Sales in the segment grew 29% organically year-over-year with strong growth in both data and devices and appliances. In data and devices, our sales grew 24% organically year-over-year due to the strong position we have built in high-speed solutions for cloud applications. Favorable secular trends in cloud services are leading to increased capital expenditures by our customers, and our content and share gains are enabling us to grow on cloud-related sales at double the market rate. 
Just to give you an example, at one of the major cloud providers, we are now providing 6x the content on the next-generation server applications versus the prior generation. In our appliances business, we are also seeing strong growth trends. Sales grew 35% organically year-over-year driven by our leading global market position, share gains and ongoing market improvement across all regions. 
From a margin perspective, our communications segment and team delivered very strong execution in the quarter, and it delivered 21% adjusted operating margins, and these were up 720 basis points versus the prior year. I am pleased with the way our team has worked through the supply chain pressures to deliver these strong operating margin expansion in this environment, and our communication teams are capitalizing on growth trends in their end markets, while delivering strong operational execution, and you see this reflected in our results. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Heath to get into more details on the financials and our expectations going forward."

Adjusted operating income was $637 million, up approximately 23% year-over-year with an adjusted operating margin of 17%",678,"Well, thank you, Terrence, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q2 financials. Adjusted operating income was $637 million, up approximately 23% year-over-year with an adjusted operating margin of 17%. The GAAP operating income was $612 million and included $17 million of restructuring and other charges and $8 million of acquisition-related charges. We continue to optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve the cost structure of the organization and continue to expect total restructuring charges in the ballpark of $200 million for fiscal '21. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.57 and GAAP EPS was $1.51 for the quarter and included restructuring, acquisition and other charges of $0.06. The adjusted effective tax rate in Q2 was approximately 17%. For the third quarter, we expect our tax rate to be up slightly sequentially and continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate around 19% from fiscal '21. Importantly, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our reported ETR for the full year. 
Now turning to Slide 9. Sales of $3.7 billion were up 17% versus the prior year and 6% sequentially, demonstrating the strength of our portfolio. Currency exchange rates positively impacted sales by $150 million versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS of $1.57 was up 22% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, reflecting our strong operational performance. Adjusted operating margins were 17% and expanded 80 basis points versus the prior year. While we would have expected higher fall-through on this level of sales growth, we saw impacts of higher freight charges and other supply chain pressures in the quarter, and these will continue into the third quarter. And as you are aware, these supply chain issues are having a broader impact on our customers and suppliers as well. As Terrence mentioned, the supply chain is catching up to the increased level of demand we are seeing in many of our end markets. And given these dynamics, I'm pleased with the results we delivered in the quarter and of our momentum going forward, as shown in our third quarter guidance. 
In the quarter, cash from operating activities was $580 million. We had very strong free cash flow for the quarter of $477 million, and the year-to-date free cash flow was approximately $1 billion, which is a record for the first half of the fiscal year. We returned approximately $340 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. Our strong free cash flow performance demonstrates the strength of our cash generation model, and we expect to -- and we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to approximate 100% for the full year. We remain committed to our disciplined use of cash, and over time, we expect 2/3 of our free cash flow to be returned to shareholders and 1/3 to be used for acquisitions. 
Before we go to questions, I want to reiterate that we remain excited about how we have positioned our portfolio with leadership positions in the markets we serve, along with organic growth and margin expansion opportunities ahead of us. To summarize, the outlook for many of the markets we serve is consistent with what we are seeing 90 days ago, along with an acceleration of growth in the commercial transportation, industrial equipment and communications markets. We are continuing to see the benefits of secular trends across our portfolio and are capitalizing on these opportunities. The economic recovery has been faster than expected, and we are seeing the corresponding near-term pressures in the broader supply chain as a result. These impacts will be resolved, and nothing has changed with respect to our growth and margin expansion expectations. We're executing -- we are seeing well on the things we can control, and our outlook in Q3 continues to reflect the strength of our portfolio. We expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow, maintain a disciplined and balanced capital strategy and drive to our business model performance. And we remain focused on value creation for our stakeholders going forward. Now let's open it up for questions."

And I think one of the things is we're all dealing with a recovery across those markets that are seeing that improved recovery at a faster rate than we all expected, and inventory levels are low. When we see the orders that we see, we do see people trying not only make -- get the products in for what they want to make but also to get the supply chains up that ensure that there are on some of the stresses that we hear about in other components. So when you look at that, I think we're all in the middle of that [ real-time ]. These are stresses that you get when you have a recovery. That's [ in motion ]. I do think we need a couple of quarters for that to play out, because it is pretty broad-based, and stocks were taken very low. And even when you think about our channel partners, our channel partners are holding churn levels that are lower than normal, and they're trying to catch up. So it is very broad across those markets that you see the strength in, and it will take a couple of quarters to get truly everything probably replenished."

In communications, I think one of the things that we have to keep in front of us is it was our segment that was least impacted last year. And so I think that even makes when you look at the results that segment have -- are more impressive because they didn't have the dip that our transportation segment had when the Western world shut down auto production. And so the growth that you see, first off, is in D&D, it is primarily driven by cloud applications. And I think it's both the acceleration of cloud CapEx in addition to where we position ourselves from a market share perspective, and we continue to do a nice job in that team continuing to build more momentum from a share perspective, and that's really driving that growth. 
The other thing that you have in that segment is our appliance business has a great global position. And we're also benefiting from as certainly appliances have accelerated globally around the world. You're seeing the benefit of that business. And you're also seeing how globally the businesses are. So certainly, I talked about it in orders, but these businesses are very globally. And you're seeing the growth. So I feel good about the positioning we've done on the top line. I would also say with the volumes that we're at, we would expect that this segment would be higher margin than what we told you historically. So we always said this is probably middle teen. At these types of levels, you'd probably be in the middle higher teens over time. And it just shows that the work that we've done to improve the portfolio here, the trends we've put it around as well as the operational execution the team has done. So thanks, Wamsi, for the question."

Yes, when you look at it, the trends where you're seeing the acceleration in, also with some of the supply chain stresses, you do see orders in the channel were probably a couple of hundred million higher than what we built. And our channel sales grew similar to what the total company grew. So you do see our -- the channel partners trying -- their inventories are low. They're trying to catch up. But I would say it's different than what we're seeing direct. It is about how do we make sure the supply chain levels to support this fast recovery get into place. When you look at our book-to-bill at 1.22, as you all know, this is not a business that's typically a backlog business. And what we're seeing because things were so depleted, you have customers that are sitting out there not only getting orders for production but also trying to replenish, and there's pain points the world. So there are certain product sets that we have some constraints on. There's pain points on some of our input materials, and Heath talked about some of the pressure on the inflation side. So I think what you have is the orders are a lot higher than our guidance, and our guidance is really the things that we see we're going to schedule out and deliver. And it will normalize over time that there'll be more in check, but right now, you have a supply chain replenishment going on after COVID in 2020 took a lot of supply chains to a full stop."

I would say it's in line with our leading share across automotive and transportation. What is nice, and you talked about it, is where do you see the momentum around EV. And just if we went back a few years, it was 5 million electric vehicles if you take through electric and hybrid. This year, we think it's going to be closer to 10 million vehicles. And you see Europe continuing with the emission programs there. Certainly, Asia has always been strong in there, and these are both regions that we have very strong presence. So when we think about content, what's nice is EV, you continue to see the adoption. You see the new models coming out. The models are much more attractive, and then the consumer acceptance of those is strong. And it pulls in line with our overall content growth in the CPV. We do expect to be that 2x on those high voltages because of what happens with the powertrain. So it is one of the things that, with an improving recovery, the secular trends of where we position TE, whether it's the electric vehicle in the car, and as I talked about in my script was We also are seeing innovation along the heavy truck fleet. That is becoming more platform-driven. They are going to have more model launches probably out in the 25, 26, and that's going to be a content driver, and we have wins on those.

That is very well documented. That impacted production a little bit less than 1 million units in quarter 2. I think it's going to be a similar number in quarter 3, but global auto production, same in that 19 million to 20 million unit range. And what's nice is probably this year all the production will be back to 2019 levels, and that's a little bit quicker than we would have said 6 months ago.

That capacity that we have put in place is certainly we are benefiting from that now. And particularly as we move forward, I think that number of 5%, maybe 10% under that this year, is helpful in terms of how that converts cash flow. The other thing that we obviously benefit from is the way we manage our tax structure and our ability to pay our cash tax rate being much lower than well below our ETR. And so there's a few of those types of things. But working capital this year has been a good story for us. And our ability to maintain receivable days and payable days, improving year-on-year despite this volatile environment has been good. So nothing unusual in our FY '21 numbers or outlook from a cash flow perspective. I continue to -- we continue to monitor it, and we're not starving the businesses for investments. The organic revenue growth gets first priority, as you can imagine. So we feel good about how we position that.

And that's something that is, if you look at what's driven that versus the lower to mid-60s a few years ago, half of that is due to our positioning around electric vehicle and certainly data as autonomy infrastructure gets put in the car.

You're seeing the investments around the auto supply chain. You see a lot of those are in the electric vehicle at the battery side of it. Certainly warehousing is no surprise either. So what we have seen pretty consistently globally is an acceleration that, last quarter, we told you we saw some emerging signs of hope we really saw an acceleration quarter in it. And I do think just with the backdrop we're in, I do think you're going to have a positive cycle here around automation investment as people see an economic recovery that continues And let's face it, the 2 markets where we haven't seen it are in comm aero and medical, which are both impacted by COVID, where we play in medical.

And what's nice is the growth that we've seen in our Energy business, that has been pretty consistent over the past year, is really due to our repositioning around renewables. Historically, this would have been a very slow growth business. We have seen it. You saw that 4% this quarter. And that exposure to those renewables is really driving the growth there.

Certainly, where we're feeling the biggest inflation right now is on the freight side. The freight inflation has been significant as we battle through there, and there's a variety of reasons for that, including higher air freight and so forth in terms of that, and that's not unique to TE. Certainly, I think that's been as well publicized across the overall supply chain. We are -- as we move towards the second half of our year, we are seeing a little bit of higher input costs, particularly with resins, and some of that's pretty directly attributable to the weather issues that were in Texas here earlier this past quarter. And then copper prices, as we continue to monitor those, we've seen those creep up. Now in some cases, we have hedges in place in terms of how we hedge our metals cost. So you don't see -- you see that kind of layer in a little bit slower in and out of the P&L as we hedge about 50% of our exposure out about 18 months for metals. So as we get through there, labor cost is not a major issue on  the inflation side, but labor availability in certain places that are still being more impacted by COVID continues to drive some inefficiencies, and there's no doubt whether that's in Mexico or in Central Europe. And otherwise, we still are battling through where -- COVID where we have significant operations and that's more around availability than inflation. 
In terms of the callback, I think Terrence outlined it a couple of questions ago. In some cases, we have contractual ability to do that in terms of passing through riders as we see inflation come in more aggressively. In some cases, it's a broader pricing discussion with a customer and then within channel. Certainly, we'll utilize our ability to take prices up tied with inflation for that piece of the business. And then depending upon the business, there's surcharges and different types of mechanisms that are put in place. But I'd say the timing issue is a portion of it. There's no way I'm going to sit here and say we're going to call back 100% of what we're pounding through right now. But we also put productivity engines in place to help offset some of these things. So more to come."

So there is a broader breadth than you have on a traditional ICE whereas traditional ICE really comes down the feature set. But what's nice is the number of EVs that you see are accelerating. And when at TE, what we get really excited about is as this continues to need to scale to make sure these vehicles are affordable for all consumers not just on the higher end. That's where we continue to provide scale. And we've always said that as we think through price as it scales, some of these very high CPV elements we talked about will come down a little bit because they have to for the affordability of the cars, and that's assumed in all our content assumptions. So I feel very good about the adoption that it is as global as it is. I think it really stood the test of COVID.

And any other infrastructure, I think that the other benefit should be is, and we've been very clear on it, we always view acceleration of electric vehicles in Asia and Europe are going to happen quicker than the United States because there has not been as much government support around getting those vehicles adopted. So that could also benefit our auto business. So they're just some of the bigger elements, and then you get in your traditional infrastructure where you would have our very strong position in commercial transportation depending upon what happens with roads and if that creates a machinery cycle. We would participate very well on increases around and, certainly, the heavy equipment side due to our industrial transportation, but there are some of the positives that could occur. Certainly, we have to see the bills and the plan shake out. I'll let Heath handle pack, and I'll hand off to him for that piece of it."

Before I get into slides, let me give you some perspective on our second quarter. And I think as you'll see in our results, we are continuing to demonstrate the strength of our diverse portfolio and the benefit of content growth across our businesses. We are delivering organic growth ahead of our markets as well as strong operational performance and free cash flow generation. 
I would say this performance is in a world with an improving economic backdrop that is dealing with global supply chains that are trying to keep up with the broader macro recovery. We are continuing to execute to our business model, and you can see this in our second quarter results as well as the guidance that we provide for the third quarter that I'll talk about a little bit more today. 
So let me also provide some key messages about today's call. First off, I am very pleased with our execution in the second quarter. We delivered sales growth of 17% and generated record quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $1.57, and this EPS represents growth of 22% year-over-year. Our sales were ahead of our expectations, and it was broad across each segment, driven by the continued recovery in most end markets we serve, our broad leadership positions and the benefits of the secular trends that we've strategically positioned TE to capitalize on. 
Also, our adjusted operating margins expanded 80 basis points year-over-year to 17%, and this was driven by margin expansion in both our transportation and communications segments. I also believe that you're going to continue to see us demonstrate our strong cash generation and truly evident of that is our year-to-date free cash flow, which was approximately $1 billion, which is also a company record for the first half of the fiscal year. And as we look into our third quarter, we are expecting our strong performance to continue, with sales and adjusted earnings per share at similar levels to what we just delivered in the second quarter. 
With that as a little bit of a backdrop, I do want to take a moment to frame out the current market environment and our business relative to where we were just 90 days ago when we last spoke. In our transportation segment, consumer demand in autos continues to remain strong, and auto production is remaining stable in the range of 19 million to 20 million units per quarter globally even with the well-documented semi shortages. And we've also seen further strength, [ as I said, in ] our commercial transportation end markets. The trends around content growth remains strong as we continue to benefit from increased electronification of vehicles and higher production of electric vehicles, which will enable us to continue to outperform auto production going forward. 
In our industrial segment, we see increased momentum in the recovery of industrial equipment markets due to factory automation and increasing manufacturing capital expenditure trends. Also in our industrial segment, the commercial aerospace and medical businesses are still being impacted by COVID, and this is similar to what we mentioned last quarter, but we do continue to see indicators of stability in our orders in both of these businesses. 
In our communications segment, the market trend we mentioned last quarter are continuing. Consumer demand is getting stronger, and globally, we've seen an increase in appliance demand. We continue to see strong ongoing capital expenditure trends in the cloud applications as well as acceleration of demand around the data center.
And when you think about these trends I just covered in our segments as a backdrop, the faster-than-expected recovery in the markets that I mentioned has resulted in some challenges as the industries we serve replenish their supply chain and look to further secure supply. While this dynamic has benefited our orders, which remains strong, it has caused broader supply chain pressure. And the pressure we're experiencing is factored into our expectations for the third quarter guidance, and Heath will provide more color on this in his session. 
And the last thing I want to highlight is let's all remember that we are still in a world that's feeling COVID. We continue to see countries go into lockdown again, and this is impacting some of our customers and their supply chains. And certainly, while vaccines are getting rolled out in certain parts of the world, the pace of the deployment and availability of the vaccines varies greatly by country, so some uncertainty remains. Our focus has been, and will continue to be on keeping our employees safe while also helping our customers capitalize on the improving economic conditions. 
So with that as a backdrop, let me get into the slides, and I'd appreciate if you could turn to Slide 3 to provide some additional details for our second quarter and our expectations for the third quarter. Second quarter sales of $3.7 billion were better than our expectations in each of our segments. They were up 17% on a reported basis and 11% organically year-over-year. We had 15% organic growth in our transportation segment with double-digit growth across all businesses. We also had very strong performance in our communications segment with organic growth of 29%, which was strong double-digit growth in both of the businesses in that segment. And in our industrial segment, sales were down 4% organically due to the ongoing weakness in the commercial aerospace market. 
From an orders perspective, second quarter orders were $4.6 billion, and this was up 36% year-over-year. It reflects both the improvement in the markets that I mentioned, along with inventory replenishment in the supply chain by our customers. 
Our earnings per share was a record at $1.57 in the quarter, and this was up 22% year-over-year and was driven entirely by our operating performance, resulting in adjusted operating margins being up 80 basis points year-over-year. I am pleased that we were able to manage the broader supply chain pressures, which all companies are dealing with and had margin expansion. 
From a free cash flow perspective, in the second quarter, free cash flow was $477 million with approximately $340 million being returned to shareholders. As we look forward, we expect our strong performance to continue into the third quarter with sales and adjusted earnings per share being similar to our second quarter levels. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $3.7 billion and this is up significantly year-over-year on both a reported and an organic basis. And we expect adjusted earnings per share to be $1.57, which is in line with the levels we just saw in the quarter we just closed. 
So let's turn to Slide 4, and I'll cover the order trends that we're seeing. As I already stated in the quarter, our orders were very strong at approximately $4.6 billion, and we had a book-to-bill of 1.22. Orders in transportation and communications were up 50% and 45%, respectively. And this increase reflects both market recovery and supply chain replenishment in both of those segments. 
In these segments, customers are not only placing orders to meet current production needs but also replenishing the supply chains that were depleted during fiscal 2020. I would also highlight that with some of the shortages in semiconductors and certain passive components, we are seeing some areas where customers are placing orders to secure supply beyond our lead times. 
In our industrial segment, it is a different picture than what we're seeing in transportation and communications. But what is nice is that despite the year-over-year sales decline we had in this segment, we have seen orders growth of 7%, and that's driven by the continued recovery in the industrial equipment market, partially offset by the weakness in commercial aerospace that I mentioned. 
Let me also, on orders, add some color on what we're seeing organically on a geographic basis, and I'm going to do this on a sequential basis to show where order momentum is. In China, our orders were up 3% from a strong base from fiscal quarter 1. And that growth was really driven by our industrial and communications segments. Orders on a sequential basis in Europe were up 14% and North America sequential orders were up 22%, and that was broad-based growth across all our segments in those 2 regions. 
So let me get into our year-over-year segment results, and they're on Slides 5 through 7. I'm going to touch upon each segment briefly before I turn it over to Heath. Transportation sales were up 15% organically year-over-year with growth in each of the businesses. In auto, our sales were up 14% organically, and year-to-date, we are generating content outperformance over production in our expected 4% to 6% range. We continue to benefit from our leading global position and increased production of electric vehicles. And as you've probably seen, the number of EV launches are increasing by our customers around the world. 
In commercial transportation, similar to our first quarter, we saw 25% organic growth driven by ongoing emission trends, content outperformance and ongoing share gains. We are continuing to benefit from stricter emission standards and the increased operator adoption of Euro 5 and 6 in China, which reinforces our strong position in that country. We saw growth in all regions in our commercial transportation business, along with double-digit growth in all market verticals that we serve in this business. The other nice thing that we continue to see is we see increased wins on electric powertrain platforms and trucks, which give us confidence about the future content potential in this market, in out years. 
In our sensors business, we saw 13% organic growth with growth in all markets and double-digit growth in auto applications. We do continue to expand our design win pipeline in auto sensing and expect growth as these platforms continue to increase in volume. From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margins for the segment expanded 80 basis points to 18.1% driven by higher volumes versus the prior year and despite the supply chain pressures. 
So if we now turn to the industrial segment. As I said earlier, our sales declined 4% organically year-over-year. During the quarter, the segment continued to be impacted by the decline in the commercial aerospace market with our aerospace, defense and marine business declining 21% organically year-over-year. As I covered already, based upon the order patterns, we do believe this business is showing signs of stabilization at the current order levels. 
And when you think about our industrial equipment market, it was very strong and up 16% organically, with growth in all regions and increasing strength in factory automation applications, where we're benefiting from accelerating capital expenditures in areas like semiconductor equipment as well as along the auto manufacturing supply chain. We continue to see weakness in our medical business in our industrial segment, and it was down 13% organically year-over-year. And this is being driven by ongoing delays in interventional elective procedures caused by COVID. And the dynamics we're experiencing in medical are consistent with what our customers are seeing, and we expect this market to return to growth as these procedures start to increase later in the year. 
And lastly, in the industrial segment, our Energy business, we saw 4% organic growth, and this was driven by increase in penetration of renewables, especially benefiting from solar applications around the world. From a margin perspective in Industrial Solutions, our margins declined year-over-year to 12.5%, and that was really driven by the significant drop in commercial aerospace volumes. 
So let me cover the communications segment. And in this segment, we continue to benefit from both the market recovery and share gains while delivering very strong operational performance. Sales in the segment grew 29% organically year-over-year with strong growth in both data and devices and appliances. 
In data and devices, our sales grew 24% organically year-over-year due to the strong position we have built in high-speed solutions for cloud applications. Favorable secular trends in cloud services are leading to increased capital expenditures by our customers, and our content and share gains are enabling us to grow on cloud-related sales at double the market rate.
Just to give you an example, at one of the major cloud providers, we are now providing 6x the content on the next-generation server applications versus the prior generation. In our appliances business, we are also seeing strong growth trends. Sales grew 35% organically year-over-year, driven by our leading global market position, share gains and ongoing market improvement across all regions. 
From a margin perspective, our communications segment and team delivered very strong execution in the quarter, and it delivered 21% adjusted operating margins, and these were up 720 basis points versus the prior year. I am pleased with the way our team has worked through the supply chain pressures to deliver these strong operating margin expansion in this environment, and our communication teams are capitalizing on growth trends in their end markets, while delivering strong operational execution, and you see this reflected in our results. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Heath to get into more details on the financials and our expectations going forward."

Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q2 financials.

Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q2 financials. Adjusted operating income was $637 million, up approximately 23% year-over-year with an adjusted operating margin of 17%. The GAAP operating income was $612 million and included $17 million of restructuring and other charges and $8 million of acquisition-related charges. We continue to optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve the cost structure of the organization and continue to expect total restructuring charges in the ballpark of $200 million for fiscal '21. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.57 and GAAP EPS was $1.51 for the quarter and included restructuring, acquisition and other charges of $0.06. The adjusted effective tax rate in Q2 was approximately 17%. For the third quarter, we expect our tax rate to be up slightly sequentially and continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate around 19% from fiscal '21. Importantly, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our reported ETR for the full year. 
Now turning to Slide 9. Sales of $3.7 billion were up 17% versus the prior year and 6% sequentially, demonstrating the strength of our portfolio. Currency exchange rates positively impacted sales by $150 million versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS of $1.57 was up 22% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, reflecting our strong operational performance. 
Adjusted operating margins were 17% and expanded 80 basis points versus the prior year. While we would have expected higher fall-through on this level of sales growth, we saw impacts of higher freight charges and other supply chain pressures in the quarter, and these will continue into the third quarter. 
And as you are aware, these supply chain issues are having a broader impact on our customers and suppliers as well. As Terrence mentioned, the supply chain is catching up to the increased level of demand we are seeing in many of our end markets. And given these dynamics, I'm pleased with the results we delivered in the quarter and of our momentum going forward, as shown in our third quarter guidance. 
In the quarter, cash from operating activities was $580 million. We had very strong free cash flow for the quarter of $477 million, and the year-to-date free cash flow was approximately $1 billion, which is a record for the first half of the fiscal year. We returned approximately $340 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. 
Our strong free cash flow performance demonstrates the strength of our cash generation model, and we expect to -- and we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to approximate 100% for the full year. We remain committed to our disciplined use of cash, and over time, we expect 2/3 of our free cash flow to be returned to shareholders and 1/3 to be used for acquisitions. 
Before we go to questions, I want to reiterate that we remain excited about how we have positioned our portfolio with leadership positions in the markets we serve, along with organic growth and margin expansion opportunities ahead of us. To summarize, the outlook for many of the markets we serve is consistent with what we are seeing 90 days ago, along with some acceleration of growth in the commercial transportation, industrial equipment and communications markets. 
We are continuing to see the benefits of secular trends across our portfolio and are capitalizing on these opportunities. The economic recovery has been faster than expected, and we are seeing the corresponding near-term pressures in the broader supply chain as a result. These impacts will be resolved, and nothing has changed with respect to our growth and margin expansion expectations. 
We are executing well on the things we can control, and our outlook in Q3 continues to reflect the strength of our portfolio. We expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow, maintain a disciplined and balanced capital strategy and drive to our business model performance. And we remain focused on value creation for our stakeholders going forward. Now let's open it up for questions."

When we see the orders perhaps that we see, we do see people trying not only to make -- get the products in for what they want to make but also to get the supply chains up that ensure that there are on some of the stresses that we hear about in other components. 
So when you look at that, I think we're all in the middle of that, real time. These are stresses that you get when you have a recovery that's in motion. I do think we need a couple of quarters for that to play out, because it is pretty broad-based, and stocks were taken very low. And even when you think about our channel partners, our channel partners are holding churn levels that are lower than normal, and they're trying to catch up. So it is very broad across those markets that you see the strength in, and it will take a couple of quarters to get truly everything probably replenished."

In communications, I think one of the things that we have to keep in front of us is it was our segment that was least impacted last year. And so I think that even makes when you look at the results that segment have -- or more impressive because they didn't have the dip that our transportation segment had when the Western world shut down auto production. 
And so the growth that you see, first off, is in D&D, it is primarily driven by cloud applications. And I think it's both the acceleration of cloud CapEx in addition to where we position ourselves from a market share perspective, and we continue to do a nice job in that team, continuing to build more momentum from a share perspective, and that's really driving that growth.
The other thing that you have in that segment is our appliance business has a great global position. And we're also benefiting from as certainly appliances have accelerated globally around the world. You're seeing the benefit of that business. And you're also seeing how globally the businesses are. So certainly, I talked about it in orders, but these businesses are very globally balanced. And you're seeing the growth. 
So I feel good about the positioning we've done on the top line. I would also say with the volumes that we're at, we would expect that this segment would be higher margin than what we told you historically. So we always said this is probably middle teen. At these types of levels, you'd probably be in the middle higher teens over time.

Yes, when you look at it, the trends where you're seeing the acceleration in, also with some of the supply chain stresses, you do see orders in the channel were probably a couple of hundred million higher than what we built. And our channel sales grew similar to what the total company grew. 
So you do see our -- the channel partners trying -- their inventories are low, they're trying to catch up. But I would say it's different than what we're seeing direct. It is about how do we make sure the supply chain levels to support this fast recovery get into place. When you look at our book-to-bill of 1.22, as you all know, this is not a business that's typically a backlog business. And what we're seeing because things were so depleted, you have customers that are sitting out there not only getting orders for production but also trying to replenish, and there's pain points in the world. So there are certain product sets that we have some constraints on. There's pain points on some of our input materials, and Heath talked about some of the pressure on the inflation side. 
So I think what you have is the orders are a lot higher than our guidance, and our guidance is really the things that we see we're going to schedule out and deliver. And it will normalize over time that there'll be more in check, but right now, you have a supply chain replenishment going on after COVID in 2020 took a lot of supply chains to a full stop."

And so the delta from where -- on a year-over-year basis to where we came in probably puts you into that type of number, in terms of the flow-through and then the impact that it had on margins. 
As we work our way through the year, there's certain things that will continue, that we will continue to expect to feel the pressure on, whether that's freight charges, freight inflation or inflation on input materials, otherwise, what the team is hammering through those. We have different levers that we can pull pass some of those things along as well as where we deal with the timing issues on some of that. But I would expect our margins to modestly improve as we work our way forward here into the third and fourth quarter based on some of the actions that are underway and our ability to combat some of the inflationary pressures out there."

Let's remember that our share is very -- a leading position in what we do already. So I wouldn't say share is higher. I would say it's in line with our leading share across automotive and transportation. 
What is nice, and you talked about it, is where do you see the momentum around EV. And just if we went back a few years, it was 5 million electric vehicles if you take through electric and hybrid. This year, we think it's going to be closer to 10 million vehicles. And you see Europe continuing with the emission programs there. Certainly, Asia has always been strong in there, and these are both regions that we have very strong presence. 
So when we think about content, what's nice is EV, you continue to see the adoption. You see the new models coming out. The models are much more attractive, and the consumer acceptance of those is strong. And it pulls in line with our overall content growth in the CPV. We do expect to be that 2x on those high voltages because of what happens with the powertrain. 
So it is one of the things that, with an improving recovery, the secular trends of where we position TE, whether it's the electric vehicle in the car, and as I talked about in my script was we also are seeing innovation along the heavy truck fleet. That is becoming more platform-driven. They are going to have more model launches probably out in the 25, 26, and that's going to be a content driver, and we have wins on those. So those secular trends and the backdrop of improving economy just creates more growth opportunity for us."

And our OEMs are trying to work through the supply chain pressures at a bigger extent than even we're dealing with. 
So what was nice, certainly, semiconductors are the big news out there. That is very well documented. Now that impacted production a little bit less than 1 million units in quarter 2. I think it's going to be a similar number in quarter 3, but global auto production, same in that 19 million to 20 million unit range. And what's nice is probably this year all the production will be back to 2019 levels, and that's a little bit quicker than we would have said 6 months ago. 
So the OEMs are very much working hard to get the cars out to the consumers. We're all working very much together knowing that right now as it's ramping back up to a very high level. And we're all trying to make sure how do we keep the OEMs going. And so the discussions today are very much around how do we work together to make sure our OEM customers get to capitalize on this opportunity. And there is a lot of volatility right now due to the supply chain. And I think we're going to have to continue to work through that through the rest of our fiscal year."

That capacity that we have put in place is certainly -- we are benefiting from that now. And particularly as we move forward, I think that number of 5%, maybe 10%, under that this year, is helpful in terms of how that converts cash flow. 
The other thing that we obviously benefit from is the way we manage our tax structure and our ability to pay our cash tax rate being much lower than well below our ETR. And so there's a few of those types of things. 
But working capital this year has been a good story for us. And our ability to maintain receivable days and payable days, improving year-on-year despite this volatile environment has been good. So nothing unusual in our FY '21 numbers or outlook from a cash flow perspective. I continue to -- we continue to monitor it, and we're not starving the businesses for investments. The organic revenue growth gets first priority, as you can imagine. So we feel good about how we position that. And going forward now, if there's a year coming forward that we have a more significant step-up in terms of an investment or restructuring or something, we'll highlight that.

As we said on last quarter, and when we sort of look at mix of vehicles this year, we sort of view -- we should be in the mid-70s without supply chain effects this year. And that's something that is, if you look at what's driven that versus the lower to mid-60s a few years ago, half of that is due to our positioning around electric vehicle and certainly data as autonomy infrastructure gets put in the car. And then the other half is just electronification as our core product set continues to be sourced in as the car gets more features on it. 
So I still think this year, without supply chain, we are in that same figure we told you last quarter. I think when you get into where supply chains are trying to move it, it is difficult to get it into one number in a quarter."

But also where we pivoted our portfolio and our team has done a nice job has been how do we get our share when you deal with wind applications, where you have high -- very high-voltage connections that need to come back and hook into the grid as well as the solar applications, which are not in panel connections but really taking the energy that comes off the solar grid into the core grid. 
And what's nice is the growth that we've seen in our Energy business, that has been pretty consistent over the past year, is really due to our repositioning around renewables. Historically, this would have been a very slow growth business. We have seen it. You saw the 4% this quarter. And that exposure to those renewables is really driving the growth there.

And, in some cases, just realize we don't have some of the production lead time that a semiconductor company would have from when they think about their fabs. 
So what we do is different. But certainly, there's stress and strain in the system. And some of the Tier 1s that are also in that equation play a pretty big role, not just the OEMs. And they took inventory levels down very low, and that's what we're all trying to catch up on."

Certainly, where we're feeling the biggest inflation right now is on the freight side. The freight inflation has been significant as we battle through there, and there's a variety of reasons for that, including higher air freight and so forth in terms of that, and that's not unique to TE. Certainly, I think that's been as well publicized across the overall supply chain. 
We are -- as we move towards the second half of our year, we are seeing a little bit of higher input costs, particularly with resins, and some of that's pretty directly attributable to the weather issues that were in Texas here earlier this past quarter. And then copper prices, as we've continue to monitor those, we've seen those creep up. Now in some cases, we have hedges in place, in terms of how we hedge our metals cost. So you don't see -- you see that kind of layer in a little bit slower in and out of the P&L as we hedge about 50% of our exposure out about 18 months for metals. 
So as we get through there, labor cost is not a major issue on the inflation side, but labor availability in certain places that are still being more impacted by COVID continues to drive some inefficiencies, and there's no doubt whether that's in Mexico or in Central Europe. And otherwise, we still are battling through where -- COVID where we have significant operations and that's more around availability than inflation. 
In terms of the callback, I think Terrence outlined it a couple of questions ago. In some cases, we have contractual ability to do that in terms of passing through riders as we've seen inflation come in more aggressively. In some cases, it's a broader pricing discussion with a customer and then within channel. Certainly, we'll utilize our ability to take prices up tied with inflation for that piece of the business. And then depending upon the business, there's surcharges and different types of mechanisms that are put in place. But I'd say the timing issue is a portion of it. There's no way I'm going to sit here and say we're going to call back 100% of what we're pounding through right now. But we also put productivity initiatives in place to help offset some of these things. So more to come."

Certainly, within the quarter, we were impacted by a very -- by the mix of businesses where the growth or lack of growth is coming from. Commercial aerospace is a very profitable piece of the segment. And as that's down year-over-year, that has a pinch point in terms of the margins. 
However, there's other things that factor into this as well in terms of how we think about the restructuring that's going on, in some cases, when we're -- we do have costs ahead of some of the savings as we're moving factories into new locations. In addition, the segment was not immune from some of the supply chain challenges.

And there are some the electric vehicles, it's the traditional 2x and there's some that are much higher, where our customers have asked us to do more. 
So there is a broader breadth than you have on a traditional ICE, whereas traditional ICE, it really comes down the feature set. But what's nice is the number of BEVs that you see are accelerating. And when -- at TE, what we get really excited about is as this continues to need to scale to make sure these vehicles are affordable for all consumers, not just on the higher end, that's where we continue to provide scale. And we've always said that as we think through price as it scales, some of these very high CPV elements we talked about will come down a little bit because they have to for the affordability of the cars. And that's assumed in all our content assumptions. 
So feel very good about the adoption that it is as global as it is. I think it really stood the test of COVID, but also is when you look at how the architecture in the car needs to continue to scale. That's what we get excited about because automotive is still a scale business. And I think we've proved that with our leading position and what we've done in the ICE, what's nice is our ICE products carry over because they're mainly in the electrical architecture that carries over into the EV. So there isn't real cannibalization because the powertrain is not as big from an electrical side, from an ICE. It just goes way up when you get to a BEV or hybrid."

Certainly, there's investments that have to happen there that would benefit our Energy business.

And any other infrastructure, I think that the other benefit should be -- and we've been very clear on it, we always view acceleration of electric vehicles in Asia and Europe are going to happen quicker than the United States because there has not been as much government support around getting those vehicles adopted. So that could also benefit our auto business.
So there's just some of the bigger elements. And then you would get in your traditional infrastructure where you would have our very strong position in commercial transportation, depending upon what happens with roads and if that creates a machinery cycle, we would participate very well on increases around and certainly, the heavy equipment side due to our industrial transportation.

Before Heath and I get into the slides and the details of the quarter, I want to frame our view of the environment that we're operating in as well as our performance. 
We are in an economy that is showing strong GDP growth globally, driven by the recovery from last year's COVID shutdowns with consumer spending that is robust as well as corporations around the world increasing investment to capitalize on this recovery. In addition to the recovery, it's also important to note that we've strategically focused TE around select secular trends, and these trends are accelerating in the key markets that we serve. 
You'll see this in our transportation segment with electric vehicle adoption accelerating, in our communications segment around cloud investment, and in our industrial segment with capital spending accelerating globally around factory automation as well as digitization. While we have a recovery that is happening faster and is more robust than we all thought, the reality is that the world is dealing with supply chains trying to catch up to this faster recovery. This is causing volatility for our customers as well as everyone that's in our customer supply chains. 
In this backdrop, we are performing well in this environment, and our strong results for the quarter and our performance so far this year demonstrates the strength and diversity of our portfolio. You'll see this with contributions from each of our 3 segments. We are generating sales, adjusted operating margins and adjusted earnings per share that are above pre-COVID levels, and we remain excited about the additional growth and margin opportunities that we'll be on this year. 
With this backdrop, let me provide some key messages from today's call about our performance. First, I am pleased with our execution in the third quarter and the quarterly records that we achieved. These records include sales of over $3.8 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $1.79 and adjusted operating margins of over 19%. Our results were ahead of our expectations, driven by the continued recovery in most end markets that we serve, our broad leadership positions and strong operational performance by our teams. 
It's also important to note that while we are in a recovery, our growth also continues to be driven by the secular trends across our markets that are driving our market outperformance this year and will continue to drive the outperformance going forward. Another key factor that you see is that we are continuing to demonstrate our strong free cash generation model and continue to expect free cash flow conversion to approximately 100% for this full fiscal year. And as we look forward, you'll see and we'll talk about our orders in quarter 3 remain consistent with our second quarter, and we expect our quarter 4 sales to be roughly flat to our quarter 3 sales. And we expect that these revenue levers will translate into strong performance with $1.65 in adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter. 
As I mentioned, our results are demonstrating the strength and diversity of our portfolio with growth and margin contributions from each segment. In communications, you see the growth opportunities in the cloud and the ongoing increase in capital expenditure trends by the cloud providers. In our industrial segment, you see increased investments in capacity and higher levels of factory automation. And in transportation, you see content growth trends for electrification as well as further electronification of both autos and trucks. 
And in each of our segments, we are delivering strong operational performance, which are evident in the margins. And when we look back to our discussion we had in October, we did indicate that our first quarter would be the peak of global quarterly auto production for our fiscal year, but not the peak of our earnings. This is playing out as we anticipated because of our diverse portfolio. For this fiscal year, we are expecting over 20% growth in sales, approximately 400 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and over 50% growth in adjusted earnings per share. I am very pleased with this level of progress towards our business model and our team's ability to execute, especially with some of the markets continuing to recover and the broader challenges we've faced in the supply chain. 
So now let me turn -- and I want to take a moment to frame the current market environment and our business relative to where we were just 90 days ago when we last spoke. So starting with transportation. Consumer demand for autos remains robust, but ongoing challenges with semiconductor supply continue to impact our customers' ability to produce. Global auto production came in slightly lower than expected in the third quarter, and we're expecting auto production to be approximately 19 million units in our fourth quarter. 
The trends around our content growth remain strong in the transportation segment. Our content per vehicle has accelerated from the low $60 range a few years ago into the $70 range this year. We continue to benefit from increased electronification and higher production of electric vehicles, which will enable us to continue to outperform auto production going forward as content continues to grow. 
In our industrial segment, we continue to see an industrial backdrop that is improving, which is benefiting our industrial equipment as well as our energy businesses. Also in our quarter, our orders in medical have begun to recover, and we returned to growth as interventional procedures have started to increase again. And the one area where we are not seeing acceleration is in our AD&M business, but I will highlight the business does feel stable at current revenue levels. 
From 90 days ago, let me talk about communications. The end market trends that we mentioned last quarter are continuing. Consumer demand continues to be robust in appliances, and capital expenditure trends remain strong in cloud applications. And while that to look at where we were versus 90 days ago by our segments, I do want us all to remember that we are in a world that's still dealing with COVID and the uncertainties around variants. While all our global factories are operational, we continue to watch developments in each of the regions we operate and our focus has been and will continue to be on keeping our employees safe while also helping our customers capitalize on the improving economic conditions. 
So now let me get into the slides, and please turn to Slide 3 so I can get into some additional details for the third quarter as well as our expectations for the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, sales of $3.8 billion were better than our expectations and were up over 50% year-over-year, demonstrating strong performance through the economic recovery with growth in all segments. Also on a sequential basis, sales were up 3%, our earnings per share was up 14% with sequential margin expansion in each segment. 
Compared to last quarter, industrial segment sales were up 5% driven by ongoing strength in industrial equipment and increases in energy and medical. And in the communications segment, sales were up 16% with double-digit growth in both data and devices and appliances on a sequential basis. And in our transportation segment, our sales were in line with our expectations. 
When you look at orders in the quarter, they remained strong at $4.5 billion, consistent with the levels we had in the second quarter. And this reflects market improvement, along with ongoing inventory replenishment by our customers. 
If you think about the balance sheet, we continue to maintain the capital strategy between making sure we're returning capital to shareholders as well as M&A. Earlier this month, we entered into an agreement to acquire ERNI, a European connector manufacturer that has a complementary product line and serving the industrial market. This acquisition has a purchase price of approximately $300 million and is consistent with the bolt-on strategy around acquisitions that we talked to you about. 
As we look forward, we expect our strong performance to continue into our fourth quarter. We expect sales to be up in the high teens over the year to approximately $3.8 billion. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.65, and this will be up 40% year-over-year. And as you can see on the slide, we've included our full year numbers and our performance relative to both fiscal 2020 and 2019, which I highlighted earlier. 
So let's turn to Slide 4, and I'll get into orders a little bit more. For the third quarter, our orders remained strong at approximately $4.5 billion, consistent with the second quarter levels that I mentioned earlier. Order levels continue to reflect economic recovery and replenishment across a number of our end markets. Year-over-year, we saw orders growth in all businesses and in all regions. Transportation orders remained elevated due to the market recovery as well as the auto industry supply dynamics. In our industrial segment, orders grew 8% sequentially and with growth in industrial equipment, energy and medical and flat orders in AD&M, which indicates the stabilization that I mentioned earlier. In communications, sequential order growth was driven by strength in data and devices. 
So let me also add some color on orders and what we're seeing from a geographic perspective on a sequential basis. We continue to see growth in Asia, where our China orders were up 6% sequentially. In Europe, our orders were down 7% sequentially, and in North America, our orders were essentially flat versus last quarter. 
So with that as a backdrop around orders, let me get into our segment results that you'll see on Slides 5 through 7, and I'll cover this briefly. Starting with transportation, our sales were up approximately 70% organically year-over-year with growth in each of our businesses. Our auto business grew 90% organically, and we are benefiting from the market recovery and are demonstrating continued content outperformance due to our leading global position. We continue to benefit from increased production of electric vehicles as TE's technology and products are enabling high-voltage architectures and applications with every leading OEM on the planet. 
In commercial transportation, we saw 56% organic growth, driven by the market recovery, ongoing emission trends as well as content outperformance. We are continuing to benefit from stricter emission standards around the world and increased operator adoption of Euro 6, which reinforces our solid position in China. 
The other key point is that we continue to gain momentum with wins on electric powertrain platforms and trucks, which while this doesn't give revenue or orders today, it will provide future content growth for our leading position in commercial transportation. In sensors, we saw 20% organic growth driven primarily by auto applications, and we also saw growth in the commercial transportation and industrial applications as well. For the segment, adjusted operating margins expanded sequentially to 19.4% on essentially flat sales. 
So let me turn to the industrial segment. And in this segment, sales increased 13% organically year-over-year. In our industrial equipment business, sales were up 36% organically with growth in all regions and benefiting from the momentum in factory automation applications, where we continue to benefit from accelerating capital expenditures in areas like semiconductor and automotive manufacturing. 
Our AD&M business, sales declined 7% organically, driven by the continued weakness in the commercial aerospace market. In our energy business, we saw 9% organic growth driven by increases in renewables, especially global solar applications. And lastly, in our medical business, as I mentioned earlier, a return to growth in the quarter and was up 10% organically year-over-year with the recovery in interventional procedures around the world. 
From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded year-over-year by nearly 300 basis points to 15.8% despite the volume declines in our AD&M business. And this was driven by solid operational performance by the teams. 
Now let me turn to the communications segment. And our team continues to demonstrate strong operational execution, while capitalizing on the growth trends in the markets that we serve. Sales grew 31% in the segment organically year-over-year, with robust growth in both data and devices and appliances. In data and devices, we grew 16% organically year-over-year due to the solid position we built in high-speed solutions for cloud applications. We continue to see capital expenditures increasing by our customers, and our content growth is enabling us to grow cloud-related sales at double the market rate this year. 
In appliances, sales grew 57% organically versus the prior year, with growth in all regions driven by market improvement, our leading global market position and ongoing share gains. I do want to say that our communications team continues to deliver outstanding performance to complement the higher sales levels that they're executing to. And you see this with our adjusted operating margin in the segment of 23.5%, which is up 760 basis points versus the prior year. Overall, across our segments, our teams are capitalizing on growth trends in their end markets, demonstrating the diversity of our portfolio while delivering strong operational execution. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Heath, who will get into more details on the financials and our expectations going forward."

The GA",593,"Thank you, Terrence, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q3 financials. Adjusted operating income was $734 million, up significantly year-over-year with an adjusted operating margin of 19.1%. The GAAP operating income was $714 million and included $11 million of restructuring and other charges and $9 million of acquisition-related charges. We still expect total restructuring charges to approximate $200 million for fiscal '21 as we continue to optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve the cost structure of the organization. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.79, and GAAP EPS was $1.74 for the quarter, which included restructuring acquisition and other charges of approximately $0.05. The adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 came in as we expected at approximately 18% with our fourth quarter tax rate expected to be around 20%. We expect to continue our -- we continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year to be around 19%. Importantly, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our reported ETR for the full year. 
Now if we turn to Slide 9. Our results and progress you see on the slide reflects the strength and diversity of our portfolio and business model execution. As Terrence mentioned, we delivered record performance in Q3 on sales, adjusted operating margins and adjusted EPS. We are not only showing progress versus the prior year, but we are also delivering higher sales margins and adjusted EPS versus fiscal '19, which represents a pre-COVID baseline. 
Sales of $3.8 billion were up over 50% versus the prior year and up 3% sequentially with solid performance in each of our segments. Currency exchange rates positively impacted sales by $138 million versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS of $1.79 was up significantly year-over-year and up 14% sequentially, reflecting our strong operational performance. Adjusted operating margins were 19.1%, also up significantly versus the prior year. Year-to-date, our adjusted operating margins are running at around 18%, and our fourth quarter is expected to be a continuation of this strong performance. 
Turning to cash flow. In the quarter, cash from operating activities was $682 million. We had very strong free cash flow for the quarter of $539 million, and year-to-date free cash flow is approximately $1.5 billion. In Q3, we returned approximately $445 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our cash flow performance demonstrates the strength of our cash generation model and we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to approximate 100% for the full year. We remain committed to our disciplined use of capital. And over time, we continue to expect 2/3 of our free cash flow to be returned to shareholders and 1/3 to be used for acquisitions. 
As Terrence noted, we entered into an agreement to acquire ERNI earlier this month, and we expect to close by the end of this quarter. ERNI has revenues of approximately $200 million annually and will be reported as part of our industrial equipment business. 
Before we go to questions, I want to reiterate that we are performing well in this environment despite challenges in the broader supply chain. Our results for the quarter and our performance so far this year demonstrate the strength and diversity of our portfolio, with contributions from each of our 3 segments. We delivered record performance in Q3. Our fourth quarter guidance represents a continuation of our strong performance, and we are excited about growth and margin opportunities beyond this fiscal year in line with our business model.

And I think when you sit there, you see the performance we put up, which we're very proud of. But in many ways, a lot of where the recovery is across our business is still pretty early.

But in many ways, a lot of where the recovery is across our business is still pretty early. And I think the first thing framed to your question is probably around where can we meet demand a little bit. And I would still tell you one of the things is with this quarter with some of the supply chain elements that happened within TE, there is about $100 million of revenue we estimate across our segments that, due to our supply chain, we couldn't get out to customers. So we are still trying to get up to the level of demand that's out there. And certainly with the supply chain issues, we estimate it's about in quarter 3, $100 million. We think it will be a similar amount in quarter 4. 
But -- and that's really where materials impact us around metals and resins. And we think that will be with us a little bit. But when you think through the markets and you think about where auto production is at right now, auto production this year with the $19 million we expect in the fourth quarter, is still significantly below 2019 levels. That 81 million units this year will still be down from $88 million in '19. And certainly, are being troubled a little bit by some of the semiconductor supply chain. 
So we think as you think through the cycle, auto production can go up as we do look forward. Certainly, content is going to help us. 
We also have in industrial, as I mentioned in my comments, it really feels like it's just getting started. Our medical business is picking up, our energy business that was pretty resilient, continues to be strong. And you're seeing what we started a couple of quarters ago around industrial equipment. We continue to see that picking up as you have CapEx. 
And then in communications, cloud CapEx was up 20% this year. It's expected to be up 10% next year. So we still see there are big drivers for us that will help us. And on the margin side, we still have margin improvement that we need to deliver in 2 or 3 segments, and they are our largest segments. So certainly, we're working through the supply chain elements that I think everybody in the plant is working through. And we still see margin improvement back up to where we told you on our business model going forward. 
So the cycle is a recovery. And one of the things we feel very good about is the consumer is showing up, whether it be to buy cars, whether it be to buy appliances. And companies now are showing up. So it'll probably be lumpy, but I would tell you, it feels very good from the drivers that we positioned TE around."

Listen, I mean, first of all, I think what we effectively had commented in my prepared statement was we're running at around 18% year-to-date in terms of margins. And we see that more or less continuing as we work our way into the fourth quarter. 
If you pick a particular quarter, you're going to have timing issues given the -- how diverse we are, how we're set up globally. You're going to have timing issues in any one particular quarter. So I think you've got to be careful about just picking out a quarter and trying to compare it forward or backwards. 
Within our world, there is price-cost differences between the different businesses. In some cases, we're able to pass along that price more quickly, particularly if it runs through our channel partners where we have distribution in some of our businesses. Some are heavier dependent upon that. And in places where we don't have that distribution partner and that mechanism to pass along price that quickly, it takes a little bit longer. So the realization of that is very mixed within our portfolio. 
The other thing to consider is we're still, as we've talked about in the past, we're still on this restructuring journey with some of our footprint optimization. And as part of that, you're going to have timing issues of when you start to realize some of those savings versus the cost of getting some of those things done and you spend a little bit ahead of before you take things offline. So there's all kinds of different moving parts in a portfolio like ours. 
From an EPS perspective, sequentially, we will have from a third quarter to fourth quarter, we will have a tax headwind. Our tax rate is going to step up a couple of hundred basis points, and that's fairly normal in terms of timing for the fourth quarter. So some of the EPS drop sequentially is tied to that tax rate."

Let me -- supply chain, I guess, we're all using more than we would like to use on coal. So let me make sure what it means to TE. First of all, let's -- it all starts with end demand in our customers. So let me spend a little bit on what we're feeling from customers. 
Certainly, customers are trying to make sure they recover. And in some cases, when you think about what we go into -- and you can take a car. A car has 30,000 parts. If 1 or 2 or 3 parts, they can't procure, they struggle making a car. And so what you have right now, because of the recovery being faster, you have everybody's scrambling. And also, you have a lot of the data signals that are coming down from our customers are changing a lot as they're trying to make sure they meet customer demand. 
So the first thing I would say from a supply chain is pretty severe volatility coming from our customers as they're trying to make sure they get up and running. And unfortunately, in some cases, you've seen customers having to stop production because of things like semiconductors. So that creates volatility. 
Now when you look in our world, it is important that when you think about TE, we are a manufacturer. We start from very base materials with what we innovate, we make. And so from that viewpoint, biggest things that we use are things that are plastic, certainly resins from commodity, all the way up to very highly engineered things that help with flame retardancy and temperature as well as metals that are used for conductivity. 
So when you sit there in those 2 key areas, we did have some areas where resin supply was impacted, and certainly, metal supply has been impacted. And what that has created for us is not only is supply impacted, we've had to do some things that aren't as natural for TE. Which is we might have supply due to our global supply chain in certain parts of the world, and we may be shipping things around the world. So not only the availability, it's also created some of those pressures, as you said it in your question, that we're managing. Because guess what, we're trying to really make sure we ramp, we help our customers. 
And the reality of it is this is going to be with us. We've been dealing with it in the recovery. I wouldn't say it's getting better. But I would say we're going to continue to be dealing with it through our fiscal year and into early next year as we're trying to pick up to a world that's recovering. And this type of recovery, whether you see it in our orders or in the supply chain, means there's a fast recovery that's happening out there as people are trying to catch up to. 
So hopefully, that gives some flavor. And I think our teams have actually been managing it through the volume, the price and the productivity as you've seen our results."

And there's really 2 factors. We benefit from our global position. We also benefit from the technology that we bring as you move to high-voltage architecture, whether that being connecting, it being to sensors that are resolvers and current sensors, when you get into electric motors. 
And when you look at it, to conceptualize a little bit, I'll go back to what I talked a little bit about last call or the call before, which is what it means to our content. A few years back, we were in the low $60s before in content. We're in the 70s now. And when you think about that $10 increase in content, approximately half of that is due to high voltage. So that's about $5 of content at the total TE level across all production that has translated into revenue. And that's a key driver, as we say, for our content can grow above $80. 
So realize there's only 9 million electric vehicles made this year. What's great is that, that adoption continues to accelerate. It didn't stop during COVID. And certainly, as that accelerates, that's going to continue to drive content outperformance for us. And it actually just continues to accelerate all around the world, and it's nice to see the traction in places even like the United States, which has always been a slower adopter of the technology, actually pick up as well as the models that are coming out from all our global customers are showing how this trend is picking up."

I wouldn't say it does, but I think it shows how fast the technology is moving as well as when you look at the architecture evolution, the pace of which it's coming at. When you think about combustion engines and how long they took to develop as well as everybody getting their models out, you will have situations where there will be events, that there will be learnings of what -- how do you need to harden the electrical architecture. I don't think that will create incremental content opportunity. 
But what I would tell you for TE is, when those issues occur, we're the type of company that they look to. Because we're working on up to 1,000 volts. We play not only from the charger inlet, we play into where the motors go, the high-voltage there. You also play on what's happening on the cell-to-cell or module-to-module connections as well as the sensing that occurs. 
So certainly, GM will really work hard to make sure those types of events won't occur in the future. But actually, it also creates a bigger opportunity for stickiness for us. And certainly, on the new truck platforms at GM, we have very strong content that's in line with that too, much content we've talked to you about."

Because you're not putting in your low voltage applications onto the battery and the motors. So our low voltage carries over. And where we really get into -- and I mentioned it to Scott's question, it starts at the charging inlet. It goes into how does you get the connections and the sensing occur, around the high-voltage connection that you need around the motors. It gets into the battery solutions. It gets into the contactors that we provide to switch the power over as you go from DC to AC and back as well as the position in the current sensors. So it's completely across. 
And I think the other thing that's unique for us versus some others that might be a Tier 1 -- now we're Tier 2. Our customers really like that we're agnostic. We are there to solve their challenges that they're trying to get to. How are they trying to solve fast charging? What type of cells are they using in their battery pack? And that agnostic element is what they really like about our global position as they come into and we focus on the connection systems. We don't get complicated about harnesses and other things. That's what the Tier 1s do. But it's really about the connection technology that we invest in as they think about the platforms and how they have to evolve these platforms. 
And that's where you get the content increase that we mentioned and we shared examples. But it gives us a real content opportunity to double our content in electric vehicles. And like I said earlier, the content growth you're seeing in TE, about half of it over the past couple of years is due to high voltage wins."

And I guess I have to give you the caveat that we only guide for the fourth quarter, and we'll talk to you in 90 days about what we see going into 2022. 
But I just do want to reflect on what we say our business model is, maybe, before I talk to markets. It is about the content we've talked about even to your questions. It is about where our underlying production go in the various markets that we serve. And it is about also continuing to capitalize on some of the execution things that Heath talked about on restructuring. We're still not at the target margin in 2 of our 3 segments, and it's how do we use that capital to return it to you. 
So I do think it's important -- that's the way we think about TE, and it's important that we keep it in front of us. And some of this, I talked about. In transportation, we do still see a runway around production. Semiconductors had been a little bit of a governor this year. That probably will get fixed, I think, people say in 2022 at some point. But also that the consumer demand and inventory being depleted on car lots really are something that you could see auto production going up. Certainly, our content will continue. 
In industrial, manufacturing CapEx is accelerating. I mentioned, we're seeing it in semiconductor, we're benefiting from that. We're seeing it in the automation. We're benefiting from that. And what we're seeing in medical as well as energy looks like very nice legs to it. The one spot that we don't sort of see any signs of acceleration is around aerospace and defense. And that's just something -- there's good consumer trends. We aren't seeing it yet in that supply chain. 
And then in communications, I would just say, cloud, we expect to be strong when it comes to appliances. The consumers are showing up strong. That probably will normalize at some point. I don't know if that will be in '22 or later. But certainly, we're benefiting from a very strong appliance cycle here around the consumer. So really like how the end markets could be teeing up for '22, and we'll share more with you in 90 days."

And we've had $4.5 billion of orders last quarter and this quarter. And if you take this quarter, we built $3.8 billion. I think when you look at that gap, that gap is certainly larger than normal. There is about $100 million of that gap that is real demand that due to our supply chain, we could not fulfill. 
When you look at that remaining gap, I sort of think about it in a couple of buckets. And certainly, we look at it a lot. We study it by our different end markets. There is probably about half of that element, which relates to our distribution partners. That is where people may not be able to get goods from us, they're looking to our channel partners to procure. And from that viewpoint, we have seen an increase -- a very strong increase over the past 2 quarters in our channel partner orders. But what I would tell you, our channel partner inventory is at the same levels as last year. So their turn is up very big. They're placing orders. Certainly, we're not able to meet them to the levels that they're ordering. 
The other portion would be from our direct OEM customers, and it will be that they're trying to make sure TE parts are not that 1, 2 or 3 parts that they can't make something. So we have seen people go out an extra quarter in some of their ordering patterns due to the current environment. And I think as the supply chain continues to get better, what you would see in places like transportation -- and transportation book-to-bill is typically around 1. It's not typically 1.1, 1.2. And I think as the supply chain catches up, you will see things get more normal, and get closer to where they should be as they normalize and the whole supply chain gets better. So I would expect at some time orders will get closer to billings, clearly, as the supply chain continues to improve and things become better."

We're picking this trend up pretty clearly from multiple sources that we're seeing, decontenting going on in order to get around the shortages. 
I'm wondering if TE is seeing this. If so, to what degree?

The auto manufacturers are being creative because there's consumer demand. And let's face it, they want to get the vehicles out.

I would tell you on our revenue, while we do see that around certain OEMs, that is not having a meaningful effect. Where we play in the core architecture and the electrical network as well as in the backbone in an EV, you may lose a couple of interconnects, but that is not that much from a big-picture content. And even if you look at our content growth this year over production, it's not evident in any way. So I would also say in this type of environment, while you have some of that decontenting, they are also being able to add options to it, which we also benefit from. But that isn't meaningful and a big number either. 
So it would probably impact others more than us. But with our breadth that we have across where we play in the architecture, while they're doing it, it's not having a meaningful impact on TE."

Let me talk about the cloud element and then I'll talk about segment margins. On the cloud element, what's really been nice is -- and those of you that follow us, we very much -- our D&D business years ago, we basically made the strategic decision to get at consumer so we could focus on just high speed. And I remember when we had less than $100 million with our cloud customers. It's well over $300 million today. And our market share at one point in time was with one of the cloud providers. Our market share is pretty even across all the cloud providers and not only the U.S. cloud provider, but also globally. 
So the breadth and the strengthening of it as well as the share gain, it's both the growth of the CapEx and their investment but also how our teams executed on share gain as well and bringing important technology to it. And it has been a strong cloud environment. I think I mentioned already, close to 20% CapEx growth in cloud. What's nice is next year, we still see double digit again. And as you not only get that underlying growth -- it goes back to the secular trend around content is, content to next generation as new chips come out on those servers, we also benefit from our next-generation products from what the content is. 
So we feel very good with where we're positioned there. When you look at the segment margin, performance by the team has been very strong. It's benefited not only by what we've done in cloud. I would also say our appliance business and that global leading position, that growth there in that business has also very much contributed to the margin in that segment. So we still think that's a high-teens business through cycle. So with having both segments being very strong, it's benefiting the margin there. And it's something that as probably appliance normalizes, we could have some pressure. But net-net, that, that segment is above target margins is something we're proud of."

In many cases,",428,"Sure. Steve, this is Heath. I'll take that. Our biggest input pressures that we have when we talk about things that are impacting our P&L would be around resins and being around certain specialty metals, right, that we use in our products. In many cases, for the metals, we do have a hedging program. That generally hedges out about 18 months of our anticipated usage or purchase and subsequent usage. So when we see inflation or deflation relative to the metals, that tends to kind of layer in more quietly into our results, both directions. So that is unchanged, and we'll continue to do that. 
The bigger issue that we are seeing when we are looking at some of these -- and we throw them into the broader supply chain bucket, is we do have local sourcing, which is really good. It enables a lot of nimbleness and agility for our businesses, whether that's in Asia, Europe or in the Americas, to be able to procure product locally versus shipping things around the world. It also has the challenges that when we do have supply chain disruption in a particular location or in a particular region, whether that's driven by natural causes, like floods or otherwise, the situation down in Texas earlier this year, where a lot of the chemical companies came offline and put a lot of pressure through the resins and so forth in the Americas. Those types of things, when they happen -- or floods in Germany. 
So when those things happen, we still have to be responsive to our customers. So sometimes that means we are then moving some of our supply around the world, and that can get very expensive. So the freight costs, it's a long-winded way of saying some of the freight costs layer into some of the supply chain pressures as well from us because of some of our structure. 
For us, we're going to continue to take advantage of those local supply chains, and we just need to make sure that we have that flexibility going forward. In terms of our ability to manage it and when do we foresee it being part of the new norm, I don't know. I mean the semicon doesn't impact us directly, but impacts our customers. So you're probably better equipped to come up with answers to when semicon shortages dissipate. In terms of some of the other things relative directly to us, I would say we're working through those and feel pretty good about how we're ready to jump into FY '22."

Well, I mean, first of all, thanks for the questions. We've been pretty public with the journey that we're on within the industrial segment margins, right? And we started this in the low teens and with the multiyear trajectory, through a lot of roof",359,"Sure. Well, I mean, first of all, thanks for the questions. We've been pretty public with the journey that we're on within the industrial segment margins, right? And we started this in the low teens and with the multiyear trajectory, through a lot of rooftop consolidations of getting this business into the high teens. We're kind of -- we're in that journey. We made a lot of improvements here in the quarter. 
Certainly, a couple of the things that industrial benefits from. One, the restructuring activity that has been underway continues. That comes in chunks of time as operations get taken offline. And so you might have some costs in one quarter before something comes offline. And that tends to create quarter-to-quarter lumpiness, but we smooth it out over a year or longer. You can kind of see that result. 
The other thing is, and Terrence just hit on this, the industrial segment does benefit from the opportunity on the price side because more of the industrial business goes through distribution. And so fairly large chunks of our industrial segments did have the opportunity to not only do price increases back at the beginning of the calendar year, but in July, implemented additional price increases. And that does have more of a near-term benefit for the segment versus some of the other segments where it's more of a direct to OEM relationship, and it takes a little bit longer to work that way through. 
So those are a couple of the pieces. As we look forward in the -- into the fourth quarter, listen, timing on things, you're always going to have that with the business as big and complex as we are. Our Industrial segment, being a $4 billion segment, has a lot of moving pieces. But I feel very good about the trajectory as we move from the first half to second half or third quarter to fourth quarter. But I think even more importantly, as we work our way into 2022 and beyond, there is still margin upside for the segment, and the team is hyper-focused on that. So more to come. Thanks for the question."

So -- and that's, I think, not only is in transportation is everywhere, but it's also how it goes through their supply chain. And also some of the benefits we get in our industrial business over people's investments, including our own around how their factories have to be more flexible and digitized. 
When it comes to the question about supply chain design, clearly, customers will reflect going through this period of what needs to be different. And the more JIT you are, they'll probably pick some spots of what do they have to do differently. I would say we're not seeing anything near term. We don't see people thinking about vertically integrating interconnects versus maybe some other areas, especially in the transition to EV. But what's good is we're very close to our customers. And hopefully, we can take advantage of it for opportunity for TE versus risk as they work through it. Because once again, being with every OEM, we have a pretty good purview especially in automotive as we go forward."

This is Heath. I'll take the question. I think in the quarter, and Terrence mentioned this earlier, that we quantify the supply chain impact to us and define it more or less as our availability to -- or in some cases, inability to get the input materials that we need. But that impact to us was about $100 million, and I would say that probably 2/3 of that would have been in transportation. So our inability to ship was about $100 million that I would quantify on the top line for the supply chain impact. And obviously, the teams are scrambling day by day to recover that and keep customers happy. 
In terms of the flow-through, listen, the year-over-year flow-through, I would -- we're proud of it. We're proud of it when we look at it and not just in the third quarter and anticipated flow-through in the fourth quarter, but also on a year-to-date and full year basis. And we are proud of it. I think, yes, I would caution you last -- our compares last year were so far off relative to the severe downtick, and that had a disproportionate impact to our margins as well last year. So when we look at that, on the downtick versus the recovery a year later, you're going to see some -- in a quarter, in a given quarter, you're going to see some outsized numbers. 
I don't -- I would not want to guide you to reset your expectation that 40% is the new norm for our flow-through. We are still confident in that 30% to 35% number, which was up -- which we took up earlier this year due to some of the restructuring activities that have been underway, and I think it normalizes into that range. But you're going to have a quarter noise from time to time, particularly in a year-over-year basis, like we had in the third quarter."

Before Heath and I get into the slides and the details of the quarter, I want to frame",2222,"Thank you, Sujal, and I also appreciate everyone joining us today to cover our results for the third quarter as well as our expectations for our fourth fiscal quarter. Before Heath and I get into the slides and the details of the quarter, I want to frame our view of the environment that we're operating in as well as our performance. 
We are in an economy that is showing strong GDP growth globally, driven by the recovery from last year's COVID shutdowns with consumer spending that is robust as well as corporations around the world increasing investment to capitalize on this recovery. In addition to the recovery, it's also important to note that we've strategically focused TE around select secular trends, and these trends are accelerating in the key markets that we serve. 
You'll see this in our transportation segment with electric vehicle adoption accelerating, in our communications segment around cloud investment, and in our industrial segment with capital spending accelerating globally around factory automation as well as digitization. While we have a recovery that is happening faster and is more robust than we all thought, the reality is that the world is dealing with supply chains trying to catch up to this faster recovery. This is causing volatility for our customers as well as everyone that's in our customer supply chains. 
In this backdrop, we are performing well in this environment, and our strong results for the quarter and our performance so far this year demonstrates the strength and diversity of our portfolio. You'll see this with contributions from each of our 3 segments. We are generating sales, adjusted operating margins and adjusted earnings per share that are above pre-COVID levels, and we remain excited about the additional growth and margin opportunities that we'll be on this year. 
With this backdrop, let me provide some key messages from today's call about our performance. First, I am pleased with our execution in the third quarter and the quarterly records that we achieved. These records include sales of over $3.8 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $1.79 and adjusted operating margins of over 19%. Our results were ahead of our expectations, driven by the continued recovery in most end markets that we serve, our broad leadership positions and strong operational performance by our teams. 
It's also important to note that while we are in a recovery, our growth also continues to be driven by the secular trends across our markets that are driving our market outperformance this year and will continue to drive the outperformance going forward. Another key factor that you see is that we are continuing to demonstrate our strong free cash generation model and continue to expect free cash flow conversion to approximately 100% for this full fiscal year. And as we look forward, you'll see and we'll talk about our orders in quarter 3 remain consistent with our second quarter, and we expect our quarter 4 sales to be roughly flat to our quarter 3 sales. And we expect that these revenue levers will translate into strong performance with $1.65 in adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter. 
As I mentioned, our results are demonstrating the strength and diversity of our portfolio with growth and margin contributions from each segment. In communications, you see the growth opportunities in the cloud and the ongoing increase in capital expenditure trends by the cloud providers. In our industrial segment, you see increased investments in capacity and higher levels of factory automation. And in transportation, you see content growth trends for electrification as well as further electronification of both autos and trucks. 
And in each of our segments, we are delivering strong operational performance, which are evident in the margins. And when we look back to our discussion we had in October, we did indicate that our first quarter would be the peak of global quarterly auto production for our fiscal year, but not the peak of our earnings. This is playing out as we anticipated because of our diverse portfolio. For this fiscal year, we are expecting over 20% growth in sales, approximately 400 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and over 50% growth in adjusted earnings per share. I am very pleased with this level of progress towards our business model and our team's ability to execute, especially with some of the markets continuing to recover and the broader challenges we've faced in the supply chain. 
So now let me turn -- and I want to take a moment to frame the current market environment and our business relative to where we were just 90 days ago when we last spoke. So starting with transportation. Consumer demand for autos remains robust, but ongoing challenges with semiconductor supply continue to impact our customers' ability to produce. Global auto production came in slightly lower than expected in the third quarter, and we're expecting auto production to be approximately 19 million units in our fourth quarter. 
The trends around our content growth remain strong in the transportation segment. Our content per vehicle has accelerated from the low $60 range a few years ago into the $70 range this year. We continue to benefit from increased electronification and higher production of electric vehicles, which will enable us to continue to outperform auto production going forward as content continues to grow. 
In our industrial segment, we continue to see an industrial backdrop that is improving, which is benefiting our industrial equipment as well as our energy businesses. Also in our quarter, our orders in medical have begun to recover, and we returned to growth as interventional procedures have started to increase again. And the one area where we are not seeing acceleration is in our AD&M business, but I will highlight the business does feel stable at current revenue levels. 
From 90 days ago, let me talk about communications. The end market trends that we mentioned last quarter are continuing. Consumer demand continues to be robust in appliances, and capital expenditure trends remain strong in cloud applications. And while that's a look at where we were versus 90 days ago by our segments, I do want us all to remember that we are in a world that's still dealing with COVID and the uncertainties around variants. While all our global factories are operational, we continue to watch developments in each of the regions we operate and our focus has been and will continue to be on keeping our employees safe while also helping our customers capitalize on the improving economic conditions. 
So now let me get into the slides, and please turn to Slide 3 so I can get into some additional details for the third quarter as well as our expectations for the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, sales of $3.8 billion were better than our expectations and were up over 50% year-over-year, demonstrating strong performance through the economic recovery with growth in all segments. Also on a sequential basis, sales were up 3%, and our earnings per share was up 14% with sequential margin expansion in each segment. 
Compared to last quarter, industrial segment sales were up 5% driven by ongoing strength in industrial equipment and increases in energy and medical. And in the communications segment, sales were up 16% with double-digit growth in both data and devices and appliances on a sequential basis. And in our transportation segment, our sales were in line with our expectations. 
When you look at orders in the quarter, they remained strong at $4.5 billion, consistent with the levels we had in the second quarter. And this reflects market improvement, along with ongoing inventory replenishment by our customers. 
If you think about the balance sheet, we continue to maintain the capital strategy between making sure we're returning capital to shareholders as well as M&A. Earlier this month, we entered into an agreement to acquire ERNI, a European connector manufacturer that has a complementary product line in serving the industrial market. This acquisition has a purchase price of approximately $300 million and is consistent with the bolt-on strategy around acquisitions that we talked to you about. 
As we look forward, we expect our strong performance to continue into our fourth quarter. We expect sales to be up in the high teens over the year to approximately $3.8 billion. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.65, and this will be up 40% year-over-year. And as you can see on the slide, we've included our full year numbers and our performance relative to both fiscal 2020 and 2019, which I highlighted earlier. 
So let's turn to Slide 4, and I'll get into orders a little bit more. For the third quarter, our orders remained strong at approximately $4.5 billion, consistent with the second quarter levels that I mentioned earlier. Order levels continue to reflect economic recovery and replenishment across a number of our end markets. Year-over-year, we saw orders growth in all businesses and in all regions. Transportation orders remained elevated due to the market recovery as well as the auto industry supply dynamics. In our industrial segment, orders grew 8% sequentially, with growth in industrial equipment, energy and medical and flat orders in AD&M, which indicates the stabilization that I mentioned earlier. In communications, sequential order growth was driven by strength in data and devices. 
So let me also add some color on orders and what we're seeing from a geographic perspective on a sequential basis. We continue to see growth in Asia, where our China orders were up 6% sequentially. In Europe, our orders were down 7% sequentially, and in North America, our orders were essentially flat versus last quarter. 
So with that as a backdrop around orders, let me get into our segment results that you'll see on Slides 5 through 7, and I'll cover this briefly. Starting with transportation, our sales were up approximately 70% organically year-over-year with growth in each of our businesses. Our auto business grew 90% organically, and we are benefiting from the market recovery and are demonstrating continued content outperformance due to our leading global position. We continue to benefit from increased production of electric vehicles as TE's technology and products are enabling high-voltage architectures and applications with every leading OEM on the planet. 
In commercial transportation, we saw 56% organic growth, driven by the market recovery, ongoing emission trends as well as content outperformance. We are continuing to benefit from stricter emission standards around the world and increased operator adoption of Euro 6, which reinforces our solid position in China. The other key point is that we continue to gain momentum with wins on electric powertrain platforms and trucks, which while this doesn't give revenue or orders today, it will provide future content growth for our leading position in commercial transportation. 
In sensors, we saw 20% organic growth driven primarily by auto applications, and we also saw growth in the commercial transportation and industrial applications as well. For the segment, adjusted operating margins expanded sequentially to 19.4% on essentially flat sales. 
So let me turn to the industrial segment. And in this segment, sales increased 13% organically year-over-year. In our industrial equipment business, sales were up 36% organically with growth in all regions and benefiting from the momentum in factory automation applications, where we continue to benefit from accelerating capital expenditures in areas like semiconductor and automotive manufacturing. 
Our AD&M business, sales declined 7% organically, driven by the continued weakness in the commercial aerospace market. In our energy business, we saw 9% organic growth driven by increases in renewables, especially global solar applications. And lastly, in our medical business, as I mentioned earlier, a return to growth in the quarter and was up 10% organically year-over-year with the recovery in interventional procedures around the world. 
From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margin for this segment expanded year-over-year by nearly 300 basis points to 15.8% despite the volume declines in our AD&M business. And this was driven by solid operational performance by the teams. 
Now let me turn to the communications segment. And our team continues to demonstrate strong operational execution, while capitalizing on the growth trends in the markets that we serve. Sales grew 31% in this segment organically year-over-year, with robust growth in both data and devices and appliances. In data and devices, we grew 16% organically year-over-year due to the solid position we built in high-speed solutions for cloud applications. We continue to see capital expenditures increasing by our customers, and our content growth is enabling us to grow cloud-related sales at double the market rate this year. 
In appliances, sales grew 57% organically versus the prior year, with growth in all regions driven by market improvement, our leading global market position and ongoing share gains. I do want to say that our communications team continues to deliver outstanding performance to complement the higher sales levels that they're executing to. And you see this with our adjusted operating margin in the segment of 23.5%, which is up 760 basis points versus the prior year. 
Overall, across our segments, our teams are capitalizing on growth trends in their end markets, demonstrating the diversity of our portfolio while delivering strong operational execution. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Heath, who will get into more details on the financials and our expectations going forward."

Adjusted operating income was $734 million, up significantly year-over-year with an adjusted operating margin of 19.1%. The GAAP operating income was $714 million and included $11 million of restructuring and other charges and $9 million of acquisition-related charges. We still expect total restructuring charges to approximate $200 million for fiscal '21 as we continue to optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve the cost structure of the organization. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.79, and GAAP EPS was $1.74 for the quarter, which included restructuring, acquisition and other charges of approximately $0.05. The adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 came in as we expected at approximately 18% with our fourth quarter tax rate expected to be around 20%. We expect to continue our -- we continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year to be around 19%. Importantly, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our reported ETR for the full year. 
Now if we turn to Slide 9. Our results and progress you see on the slide reflects the strength and diversity of our portfolio and business model execution. As Terrence mentioned, we delivered record performance in Q3 on sales, adjusted operating margins and adjusted EPS. We are not only showing progress versus the prior year, but we are also delivering higher sales margins and adjusted EPS versus fiscal '19, which represents a pre-COVID baseline. 
Sales of $3.8 billion were up over 50% versus the prior year and up 3% sequentially with solid performance in each of our segments. Currency exchange rates positively impacted sales by $138 million versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS of $1.79 was up significantly year-over-year and up 14% sequentially, reflecting our strong operational performance. Adjusted operating margins were 19.1%, also up significantly versus the prior year. Year-to-date, our adjusted operating margins are running at around 18%, and our fourth quarter is expected to be a continuation of this strong performance. 
Turning to cash flow. In the quarter, cash from operating activities was $682 million. We had very strong free cash flow for the quarter of $539 million, and year-to-date free cash flow is approximately $1.5 billion. In Q3, we returned approximately $445 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our cash flow performance demonstrates the strength of our cash generation model and we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to approximate 100% for the full year. We remain committed to our disciplined use of capital. And over time, we continue to expect 2/3 of our free cash flow to be returned to shareholders and 1/3 to be used for acquisitions. 
As Terrence noted, we entered into an agreement to acquire ERNI earlier this month, and we expect to close by the end of this quarter. ERNI has revenues of approximately $200 million annually and will be reported as part of our industrial equipment business. 
Before we go to questions, I want to reiterate that we are performing well in this environment despite challenges in the broader supply chain. Our results for the quarter and our performance so far this year demonstrate the strength and diversity of our portfolio, with contributions from each of our 3 segments. We delivered record performance in Q3. Our fourth quarter guidance represents a continuation of our strong performance, and we are excited about growth and margin opportunities beyond this fiscal year in line with our business model.

But in many ways, a lot of where the recovery is across our business is still pretty early. And I think the first thing framed to your question is probably around where can we meet demand a little bit. And I would still tell you one of the things is with this quarter with some of the supply chain elements that happened within TE, there is about $100 million of revenue we estimate across our segments that, due to our supply chain, we couldn't get out to customers. So we are still trying to get up to the level of demand that's out there. And certainly with the supply chain issues, we estimate it's about in quarter 3, $100 million. We think it will be a similar amount in quarter 4. 
But -- and that's really where materials impact us around metals and resins. And we think that will be with us a little bit. But when you think through the markets and you think about where auto production is at right now, auto production this year with the 19 million we expect in the fourth quarter, is still significantly below 2019 levels. That 81 million units this year will still be down from 88 million to 19 million. And certainly, we are being troubled a little bit by some of the semiconductor supply chain. So we think as you think through the cycle, auto production can go up as we do look forward. Certainly, content is going to help us. 
We also have in the industrial, as I mentioned in my comments, it really feels like it's just getting started. Our medical business is picking up, our energy business that was pretty resilient, continues to be strong. And you're seeing what we started a couple of quarters ago around industrial equipment. We continue to see that picking up as you have CapEx. 
And then in communications, cloud CapEx was up 20% this year. It's expected to be up 10% next year. So we still see there are big drivers for us that will help us. And on the margin side, we still have margin improvement that we need to deliver in 2 or 3 segments, and they are our largest segments. So certainly, we're working through the supply chain elements that I think everybody in the plant is working through. And we still see margin improvement back up to what we told you on our business model going forward. 
So the cycle is a recovery. And one of the things we feel very good about is the consumer is showing up, whether it be to buy cars, whether it be to buy appliances. And companies now are showing up. So it'll probably be lumpy, but I would tell you, it feels very good from the drivers that we positioned TE around."

Listen, I mean, first of all, I think what we effectively had commented in my prepared statement was we're running at around 18% year-to-date in terms of margins. And we see that more or less continuing as we work our way into the fourth quarter. 
If you pick a particular quarter, you're going to have timing issues given the -- how diverse we are, how we're set up globally. You're going to have timing issues in any one particular quarter. So I think you've got to be careful about just picking out a quarter and trying to compare it forward or backwards. 
Within our world, there is price-cost differences between the different businesses. In some cases, we're able to pass along that price more quickly, particularly if it runs through our channel partners where we have distribution in some of our businesses. Some are heavier dependent upon that. And in places where we don't have that distribution partner and that mechanism to pass along price that quickly, it takes a little bit longer. So the realization of that is very mixed within our portfolio. 
The other thing to consider is we're still, as we've talked about in the past, we're still on this restructuring journey with some of our footprint optimization. And as part of that, you're going to have timing issues of when you start to realize some of those savings versus the cost of getting some of those things done and you spend a little bit ahead of before you take things offline. So there's all kinds of different moving parts in a portfolio like ours. 
From an EPS perspective, sequentially, we will have from a third quarter to fourth quarter, we will have a tax headwind. Our tax rate is going to step up a couple of hundred basis points, and that's fairly normal in terms of timing for the fourth quarter. So some of the EPS drop sequentially is tied to that tax rate."

Let me -- supply chain, I guess, we're all using more than we would like to use on [ coal ]. So let me make sure what it means to TE. First of all, let's -- it all starts with end demand in our customers. So let me spend a little bit on what we're feeling from customers. 
Certainly, customers are trying to make sure they recover. And in some cases, when you think about what we go into -- and you can take a car. A car has 30,000 parts. If 1 or 2 or 3 parts, they can't procure, they struggle making a car. And so what you have right now, because of the recovery being faster, you have everybody scrambling. And also, you have a lot of the data signals that are coming down from our customers are changing a lot as they're trying to make sure they meet customer demand. 
So the first thing I would say from a supply chain is pretty severe volatility coming from our customers as they're trying to make sure they get up and running. And unfortunately, in some cases, you've seen customers having to stop production because of things like semiconductors. So that creates volatility. 
Now when you look in our world, it is important that when you think about TE, we are a manufacturer. We start from very base materials with what we innovate, we make. And so from that viewpoint, the biggest things that we use are things that are plastic, certainly resins from commodity, all the way up to very highly engineered things that help with flame retardancy and temperature as well as metals that are used for conductivity. 
So when you sit there in those 2 key areas, we did have some areas where resin supply was impacted, and certainly, metal supply has been impacted. And what that has created for us is not only our supply impacted, we've had to do some things that aren't as natural for TE. Which is we might have supply due to our global supply chain in certain parts of the world, and we may be shipping things around the world. So not only the availability, it's also created some of those pressures, as you said it in your question, that we're managing. Because guess what, we're trying to really make sure we ramp, we help our customers. 
And the reality of it is this is going to be with us. We've been dealing with it in the recovery. I wouldn't say it's getting better. But I would say we're going to continue to be dealing with it through our fiscal year and into early next year as we're trying to pick up to a world that's recovering. And this type of recovery, whether you see it in our orders or in the supply chain, means there's a fast recovery that's happening out there as people are trying to catch up to. 
So hopefully, that gives some flavor. And I think our teams have actually been managing it through the volume, the price and the productivity as you've seen our results."

And there's really 2 factors. We benefit from our global position. We also benefit from the technology that we bring as you move to high-voltage architecture, whether that being connecting, it being to sensors that are resolvers and current sensors, when you get into electric motors. 
And when you look at it, to conceptualize a little bit, I'll go back to what I talked a little bit about last call or the call before, which is what it means to our content. A few years back, we were in the low $60s [ per foreign ] content. We're in the 70s now. And when you think about that $10 increase in content, approximately half of that is due to high voltage. So that's about $5 of content at the total TE level across all production that has translated into revenue. And that's a key driver, as we say, for our content can grow above $80. 
So realize there's only 9 million electric vehicles made this year. What's great is that, that adoption continues to accelerate. It didn't stop during COVID. And certainly, as that accelerates, that's going to continue to drive content outperformance for us. And it actually just continues to accelerate all around the world, and it's nice to see the traction in places even like the United States, which has always been a slower adopter of the technology, actually pick up as well as the models that are coming out from all our global customers are showing how this trend is picking up."

I think the thing that you look at, I wouldn't say -- when you think about does that learning out of that recall provide extra content? I wouldn't say it does, but I think it shows how fast the technology is moving as well as when you look at the architecture evolution, the pace of which it's coming at. When you think about combustion engines and how long they took to develop as well as everybody getting their models out, you will have situations where there will be events, that there will be learnings of what -- how do you need to harden the electrical architecture. I don't think that will create incremental content opportunity. 
But what I would tell you for TE is, when those issues occur, we're the type of company that they look to. Because we're working on up to 1,000 volts. We play not only from the charger inlet, we play into where the motors go, the high-voltage there. You also play on what's happening on the cell-to-cell or module-to-module connections as well as the sensing that occurs. 
So certainly, GM will really work hard to make sure those types of events won't occur in the future. But actually, it also creates a bigger opportunity for stickiness for us. And certainly, the new truck platforms at GM, we have very strong content that's in line with that too, much content we've talked to you about."

The company has invested significantly in both -- in developing but also scaling these solutions globally in recent years. And is this leading to high-voltage share gains relative to low voltage? 
It also seems like the OEMs would lean more heavily on top suppliers just given how important these initial EV rollouts are. And then particularly within high voltage, as it's a new but also extremely critical component for them."

So Chris, when we look at it, I think -- let me take a step back just for a second. With what we do around our interconnect and sensing portfolio, anywhere you have data, you have power, you have sensing. And guess what, getting into smaller packages",414,"Yes. So Chris, when we look at it, I think -- let me take a step back just for a second. With what we do around our interconnect and sensing portfolio, anywhere you have data, you have power, you have sensing. And guess what, getting into smaller packages and then higher power and higher data, that's what our engineers do. And so when you deal with high-voltage architecture in a car, certainly, our customers, that's why they like the position we have, and it's a global position, as I said, where we design all around the world with all the OEMs. 
So when you think about it, it is -- one point I want to highlight is the low voltage architecture carries over for us. Because you're not putting in your low voltage applications onto the battery and the motors. So our low voltage carries over. And where we really get into -- and I mentioned it to Scott's question, it starts at the charging inlet. It goes into how does you get the connections and the sensing occur, around the high-voltage connection that you need around the motors. It gets into the battery solutions. It gets into the contactors that we provide to switch the power over as you go from DC to AC and back as well as the position in the current sensors. So it's completely across. 
And I think the other thing that's unique for us versus some others that might be a Tier 1. Now we're Tier 2. Our customers really like that we're agnostic. We are there to solve their challenges that they're trying to get to. How are they trying to solve fast charging? What type of cells are they using in their battery pack? And that agnostic element is what they really like about our global position as they come into and we focus on the connection systems. We don't get complicated about harnesses and other things. That's what the Tier 1s do. But it's really about the connection technology that we invest in as they think about the platforms and how they have to evolve these platforms. 
And that's where you get the content increase that we mentioned and we shared examples. But it gives us a real content opportunity to double our content in electric vehicles. And like I said earlier, the content growth you're seeing in TE, about half of it over the past couple of years is due to high voltage wins."

But I just do want to reflect on what we say our business model is, maybe, before I talk to markets. It is about the content we've talked about even to your questions. It is about where our underlying production go in the various markets that we serve. And it is about also continuing to capitalize on some of the execution things that Heath talked about on restructuring. We're still not at the entitled margin in 2 of our 3 segments, and it's how do we use that capital to return it to you. 
So I do think it's important -- that's the way we think about TE, and it's important that we keep it in front of us. And some of this, I talked about. In transportation, we do still see a runway around production. Semiconductors had been a little bit of a governor this year. That probably will get fixed, I think, people say in 2022 at some point. But also that the consumer demand and inventory being depleted on car lots really are something that you could see auto production going up. Certainly, our content will continue. 
In industrial, manufacturing CapEx is accelerating. I mentioned, we're seeing it in semiconductor, we're benefiting from that. We're seeing it in the automation. We're benefiting from that. And what we're seeing in medical as well as energy looks like very nice legs to it. The one spot that we don't sort of see any signs of acceleration is around aerospace and defense. And that's just something -- there's good consumer trends. We aren't seeing it yet in that supply chain. 
And then in communications, I would just say, cloud, we expect to be strong when it comes to appliances. The consumers are showing up strong. That probably will normalize at some point. I don't know if that will be in '22 or later. But certainly, we're benefiting from a very strong appliance cycle here around the consumer. So really like how the end markets could be teeing up for '22, and we'll share more with you in 90 days."

And we've had $4.5 billion of orders last quarter and this quarter. And if you take this quarter, we built $3.8 billion. I think when you look at that gap, that gap is certainly larger than normal. There is about $100 million of that gap that is real demand that due to our supply chain, we could not fulfill. 
When you look at that remaining gap, I sort of think about it in a couple of buckets. And certainly, we look at it a lot. We study it by our different end markets. There is probably about half of that element, which relates to our distribution partners. That is where people may not be able to get goods from us, they're looking to our channel partners to procure. And from that viewpoint, we have seen an increase -- a very strong increase over the past 2 quarters in our channel partner orders. But what I would tell you, our channel partner inventory is at the same levels as last year. So their turn is up very big. They're placing orders. Certainly, we're not able to meet them to the levels that they're ordering. 
The other portion would be from our direct OEM customers, and it will be that they're trying to make sure TE parts are not that 1, 2 or 3 parts that they can't make something. So we have seen people go out an extra quarter in some of their ordering patterns due to the current environment. And I think as the supply chain continues to get better, what you would see in places like transportation -- and transportation book-to-bill is typically around 1. It's not typically 1.1, 1.2. And I think as the supply chain catches up, you will see things get more normal, and get closer to where they should be as they normalize and the whole supply chain gets better. So I would expect at some time orders will get closer to billings, clearly, as the supply chain continues to improve and things become better."

In autos, though, I'm sure you'd acknowledge that there are cases where these companies can decide, well, there's a feature or 2 that we can isolate and perhaps decontent it and get a car shipped. We're picking this trend up pretty clearly from multiple sources that we're seeing, decontenting going on in order to get around the shortages. 
I'm wondering if TE is seeing this. If so, to what degree? And in particular, does it take away from your growth in sort of the next couple of quarters in any way, where perhaps a more content-rich car would have provided a better opportunity. But what the company is shipping is something of a smaller content opportunity or vice versa."

The auto manufacturers are being creative because there's consumer demand. And let's face it, they want to get the vehicles out. And if there's a feature where they can't get a component, they certainly are taking some of those features out near term. 
I would tell you on our revenue, while we do see that around certain OEMs, that is not having a meaningful effect. Where we play in the core architecture and the electrical network as well as in the backbone in an EV, you may lose a couple of interconnects, but that is not that much from a big-picture content. And even if you look at our content growth this year over production, it's not evident in any way. So I would also say in this type of environment, while you have some of that decontenting, they are also being able to add options to it, which we also benefit from. But that isn't meaningful and a big number either. 
So it would probably impact others more than us. But with our breadth that we have across where we play in the architecture, while they're doing it, it's not having a meaningful impact on TE."

Let me talk about the cloud element and then I'll talk about segment margins. On the cloud element, what's really been nice is -- and those of you that follow us, we very much -- our D&D business years ago, we basically made the strategic decision to get at consumer so we could focus on just high speed. And I remember when we had less than $100 million with our cloud customers. It's well over $300 million today. And our market share at one point in time was with one of the cloud providers. Our market share is pretty even across all the cloud providers and not only the U.S. cloud provider, but also globally. 
So the breadth and the strengthening of it as well as the share gain, it's both the growth of the CapEx and their investment but also how our teams executed on share gain as well in bringing important technology to it. And it has been a strong cloud environment. I think I mentioned already, close to 20% CapEx growth in cloud. What's nice is next year, we still see double digit again. And as you not only get that underlying growth, it goes back to the secular trend around content is content to next generation as new chips come out on those servers, we also benefit from our next-generation products from what the content is. 
So we feel very good with where we're positioned there. When you look at the segment margin, performance by the team has been very strong. It's benefited not only by what we've done in cloud. I would also say our appliance business and that global leading position, that growth there in that business has also very much contributed to the margin in that segment. So we still think that's a high-teens business through cycle. So with having both segments being very strong, it's benefiting the margin there. And it's something that as probably appliance normalizes, we could have some pressure. But net-net, that, that segment is above target margins is something we're proud of."

Our biggest input pressures that we have when we talk about things that are impacting our P&L would be around resins and being around certain specialty metals, right, that we use in our products. In many cases,",429,"Sure. Steve, this is Heath. I'll take that. Our biggest input pressures that we have when we talk about things that are impacting our P&L would be around resins and being around certain specialty metals, right, that we use in our products. In many cases, for the metals, we do have a hedging program. That generally hedges out about 18 months of our anticipated usage or purchase and then subsequent usage. So when we see inflation or deflation relative to the metals, that tends to kind of layer in more quietly into our results, both directions. So that is unchanged, and we'll continue to do that. 
The bigger issue that we are seeing when we are looking at some of these -- and we throw them into the broader supply chain bucket, is we do have local sourcing, which is really good. It enables a lot of nimbleness and agility for our businesses, whether that's in Asia, Europe or in the Americas to be able to procure product locally versus shipping things around the world. It also has the challenges that when we do have supply chain disruption in a particular location or in a particular region, whether that's driven by natural causes, like floods or otherwise, the situation down in Texas earlier this year, where a lot of the chemical companies came offline and put a lot of pressure through the resins and so forth in the Americas. Those types of things, when they happen -- or floods in Germany. 
So when those things happen, we still have to be responsive to our customers. So sometimes that means we are then moving some of our supply around the world, and that can get very expensive. So the freight costs, it's a long-winded way of saying some of the freight costs layer into some of the supply chain pressures as well from us because of some of our structure. 
For us, we're going to continue to take advantage of those local supply chains, and we just need to make sure that we have that flexibility going forward. In terms of our ability to manage it and when do we foresee it being part of the new norm, I don't know. I mean the semicon doesn't impact us directly, but impacts our customers. So you're probably better equipped to come up with answers to when semicon shortages dissipate. In terms of some of the other things relative directly to us, I would say we're working through those and feel pretty good about how we're ready to jump into FY '22."

We've been pretty public with the journey that we're on within the industrial segment margins, right? And we started this in the low teens and with the multiyear trajectory, through a lot of rooftop consolidations of getting this business into the high teens. We're kind of -- we're in that journey. We made a lot of improvements here in the quarter. 
Certainly, a couple of the things that industrial benefits from. One, the restructuring activity that has been underway continues. That comes in chunks of time as operations get taken offline. And so you might have some costs in one quarter before something comes offline. And that tends to create quarter-to-quarter lumpiness, but we smooth it out over a year or longer. You can kind of see that result. 
The other thing is, and Terrence just hit on this, the industrial segment does benefit from the opportunity on the price side because more of the industrial business goes through distribution. And so fairly large chunks of our industrial segments did have the opportunity to not only do price increases back at the beginning of the calendar year, but in July, implemented additional price increases. And that does have more of a near-term benefit for the segment versus some of the other segments where it's more of a direct to OEM relationship, and it takes a little bit longer to work that way through. 
So those are a couple of the pieces. As we look forward in the -- into the fourth quarter, listen, timing on things, you're always going to have that with the business as big and complex as we are. Our Industrial segment, being a $4 billion segment, has a lot of moving pieces. But I feel very good about the trajectory as we move from the first half to second half or third quarter to fourth quarter. But I think even more importantly, as we work our way into 2022 and beyond, there is still margin upside for the segment, and the team is hyper-focused on that. So more to come. Thanks for the question."

What typically happens with customers, I think, with all of us, is just seeing the pace continues to accelerate because the consumer expects it. So -- and that's, I think, not only is in transportation everywhere, but it's also how it goes through their supply chain. And also some of the benefits we get in our industrial business over people's investments, including our own around how their factories have to be more flexible and digitized. 
When it comes to the question about supply chain design, clearly, customers will reflect going through this period of what needs to be different. And the more JIT you are, they'll probably pick some spots of what do they have to do differently. I would say we're not seeing anything near term. We don't see people thinking about vertically integrating interconnects versus maybe some other areas, especially in the transition to EV. But what's good is we're very close to our customers.

This is Heath. I'll take the question. I think in the quarter, and Terrence mentioned this earlier, that we quantify the supply chain impact to us and define it more or less as our availability to -- or in some cases, inability to get the input materials that we need. But that impact to us was about $100 million, and I would say that probably 2/3 of that would have been in transportation. So our inability to ship was about $100 million that I would quantify on the top line for the supply chain impact. And obviously, the teams are scrambling day by day to recover that and keep customers happy. 
In terms of the flow-through, listen, the year-over-year flow-through, I would -- we're proud of it. We're proud of it when we look at it and not just in the third quarter and anticipated flow-through in the fourth quarter, but also on a year-to-date and full year basis. And we are proud of it. I think, yes, I would caution you last -- our compares last year were so far off relative to the severe downtick, and that had a disproportionate impact to our margins as well last year. So when we look at that, on the downtick versus the recovery a year later, you're going to see some -- in a quarter, in a given quarter, you're going to see some outsized numbers. 
I don't -- I would not want to guide you to reset your expectation that 40% is the new norm for our flow-through. We are still confident in that 30% to 35% number, which was up -- which we took up earlier this year due to some of the restructuring activities that have been underway, and I think it normalizes into that range. But you're going to have a quarter noise from time to time, particularly in a year-over-year basis, like we had in the third quarter."

And I'll start at the beginning in my comments just to make sure -- we don't know where we broke off. But I want to talk about our results for the fourth quarter as well as fiscal 2021 as well as the outlook for the fiscal 2020 first quarter. So before Heath and I get into the slides, let me frame out the performance relative to the broader market environment that we're operating in. 
I am pleased with our results in the fourth quarter as well as the strong performance that we delivered for the full year. We continue to experience global GDP growth with strong end market demand across most end markets that we've strategically positioned TE to focus on, and this broad growth that we're seeing is both in the consumer and capital spending areas. And let me bring some color to that, how that relates to TE. 
On the consumer side, demand for autos and appliances remain strong. and we continue to see increases in medical procedures that benefit medical device sales. On the capital spending side, we see increased investments that relate to cloud and data centers, factory automation, semiconductor capacity as well as the need for more renewable energy sources. And when you look at the results we're going to talk about today, you're going to see this broad strength reflected in our orders and our backlog that will benefit us as we go into 2022 as well as our results in 2021. 
While certainly, this demand environment is a positive, the balance of this is that the reality is we're still in a world that's dealing with COVID, and global supply chains that have not been able to keep up with the strong demand trends. Within this backdrop, we are continuing to capitalize on growth opportunities across our served markets. In the fourth quarter, we delivered 16% organic growth despite auto production declines caused by our auto customer supply chain. This performance demonstrates the strength as well as the diversity of our portfolio. We have strategically positioned TE around certain secular trends, and you're seeing the market outperformance in each of our segments as a result of this positioning. 
In transportation, our leadership position is enabling us to deliver content growth from both electrification of the core as well as increased adoption of electric vehicles globally. In industrial, we're benefiting from accelerated global capital spending around factories and in communications, we're driving content and share gain in cloud applications. In addition to the strong top line growth outperformance versus our markets this year, we have executed well to deliver margin expansion in each of our 3 segments. 
The last proof point that I think is important is -- then shows the strength of the portfolio is how our full year results compared to pre-pandemic levels of 2019. Both our sales and adjusted earnings per share in fiscal '21 were up double digits versus 2019, and we expanded adjusted operating margins by over 100 basis points by continuing the margin journey that we're on. More importantly, we also remain excited about the additional growth and margin opportunities that we still have ahead of us. 
Now with that as a backdrop, let me get into the slides, and I'll discuss the highlights that we have listed on Slide 3.  Our teams had strong execution results in the fourth quarter despite reductions in auto production and ongoing challenges in the broader global supply chain. We generated sales of $3.8 billion with 16% organic growth and adjusted earnings per share ahead of guidance at $1.69, which was up 46% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margins were 18.5% as a result of the increases across all 3 segments, and I'll share more details about segment results a little bit later. 
When you look at the full year, year-over-year sales were up 23%, adjusted operating margins expanded approximately 400 basis points and adjusted earnings per share was up over 50% to $6.51. Also, as important of earnings is where we generated in free cash flow. Our free cash flow was above $2 billion with approximately 100% conversion to adjusted net income for the year, demonstrating our strong cash generation model. We also continue to remain balanced in our capital deployment with about 3/4 of our free cash flow return to owners this past year and the remainder used for M&A including the earning acquisition in the industrial segment that we mentioned last quarter. 
When you look at our orders in the fourth quarter, they remained strong at $4.1 billion, with strength in each segment, and our book-to-bill was 1.08. With these orders and where we position TE, we do expect a strong performance of our portfolio to continue into the first quarter with approximately $3.7 billion in sales, which will be up mid-single digits organically year-over-year despite a roughly 20% expected decline in year-over-year auto production. We expect strong double-digit growth in both our industrial and communications segments, and I think this is another point that reinforces diversity of the markets that we serve. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.60 in the first quarter, and this will be up 9% year-over-year. 
Now let me talk about the market, and frame it to where we were just 90 days ago when we last spoke. In transportation, consumer demand for autos remained robust, but clearly, ongoing challenges with semiconductors and the broader supply chain continue to impact our auto OEM customers' ability to produce. Global auto production came in lower than we expected just 90 days ago as our customers reduced production to enable the supply chain to catch up. Auto production was approximately 2 million units lower than we anticipated in the fourth quarter. And we're expecting auto production to be in the 18 million unit range in our first quarter. This first quarter production will be well below the nearly 23 million units made in the first quarter of 2021. 
The key for us is that the trends around content growth for TE remains strong, and we expect content growth to be at the high end of the 4- to 6-point range in fiscal '22 as we continue to benefit from increased electronification and higher production of electric vehicles. Now [ versus ] 90 days ago in our industrial segment, the key is that we continue to see an improving backdrop, which is benefiting our industrial equipment and energy businesses, and our medical business is growing year-over-year as interventional procedures increase. The 1 area that we've not seen improved is the commercial aerospace business. It's sort of staying stable, and we've not seen an inflection point in that business yet, to hire or lower growth. 
In communications versus 90 days ago, we continue to see favorable end market trends with global growth in cloud capital expenditures and strength in residential demand benefiting our appliances business. Now while that's a view of what we've seen versus 90 days ago from a market perspective, I also believe in this environment, so it's important to tell you what we're seeing in our supply chain. While challenges remain in the broader supply chain, we have seen some improvement in our availability of certain raw materials in our own supply chain versus 90 days ago. 90 days ago, we thought we were impacted by about $100 million of revenue due to us not having availability of supply. This quarter end, we're only -- that's down to about $50 million. And with this improvement, this will enable us to increase production and inventory levels accordingly to ensure we can meet demand as our customers resolve their supply issues. 
Now before I move into orders, I will start on Slide 4. I do want to take a moment to mention a few key highlights on the progress we made this year on our ESG initiatives. Earlier this year, we issued our 11th corporate responsibility report, which discusses our One Connected World strategy, which really encapsulates our ESG strategy. And we hope that you read this report, which highlights the efforts that we're driving internally related to order impact on the planet as well as the innovation our engineers bring to our customers to make sure we're enabling sustainable applications. 
Some of the key highlights I want to mention is that on the environmental side, we set up a new goal to decrease Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by over 40% on an absolute basis by 2030. And this new goal is above and beyond the 35% reduction we've already made in absolute greenhouse gas emission reductions over the past decade. We also continue to make progress on sourcing renewable electricity. And today, I'm happy to say over 20% of TE's production currently uses carbon-free electricity. And also, this past year, we began to report Scope 3 emissions back in July. 
If you look at social initiatives, we set a goal to increase women in leadership position by over 26% by 2025. And I'm happy to say we continue to focus on employee safety and engagement throughout the pandemic. We've gotten good feedback from our employees on how we've been there for during this typical time. So clearly, I'm pleased with the continued progress that we're making towards what our purpose is as a company, which is to create a safer, sustainable, productive and connected future. 
So now let me please get into the orders on Slide 4, and we'll go through it by the segments in both -- and also on a geographic basis. For the fourth quarter, our orders were over $4 billion, with year-over-year order growth in all regions. Our order trends and backlog remains strong in each segment, and the order patterns we're seeing are as we expected. As we've been mentioning through the year, and as you've seen in our book-to-bill ratios, order levels have been elevated with customers placing orders for delivery beyond the current quarter due to the broader supply chain situation. As a result, we're coming into fiscal '22 with a strong backlog position that is higher than we typically see for our business. 
When we look at the order patterns at a segment level, industrial and communication orders are trending as expected, with continued momentum in areas like factory automation and cloud applications. I also want to highlight and remind you that in the industrial and communications segment, we have a relatively large portion of our business that goes through our channel partners. And we're seeing our booking patterns begin to align more closely to our settlement, which is a good sign. The other key thing to highlight around our channel partners is that in 2021, we did not see inventory levels increase with them, even though they had a much higher level business levels that really they had a much higher churn in their inventories this year. 
Looking at transportation. We are seeing order levels match the production dynamics that are aligned with our guidance. When you look beyond the near-term noise of auto supply chain pressure, it is important to remember that consumer demand for autos remain strong and dealer inventories remain extremely low. So we believe this is a very favorable setup for medium- and longer-term auto production growth. 
Now let me add some color on what we're seeing organically from a geographic perspective on a year-over-year basis. We continue to see growth in Asia, where China orders were up 17%, and growth across all 3 segments. In Europe, orders were up 21% and North America orders were up 26%. On a sequential basis, we saw orders decline in each region that reflect the order patterns I just talked about in our segments. But the 1 key difference is we did see growth in our transportation segment orders in China sequentially where our auto orders were up 9%. 
So with that, with an order backdrop, let's get into the segment year-over-year results, and they'll be on your slides 5 through 7. So starting with transportation. Segment sales were up 16% organically year-over-year with growth in each of our businesses. Our auto business grew 12% organically despite the declines in auto production that I mentioned. We continue to benefit from increased production of electric vehicles as our technology and products are enabling high-voltage architectures and applications with every leading customer on the planet. Hybrid and electric vehicle production grew 50% year-over-year increasing from roughly 6 million units produced in 2020 to roughly 9 million units produced globally in 2021. We also continue to benefit from content growth in nonelectric vehicles driven by ongoing safety, certainly data connectivity, comfort and autonomy features. 
As a result of these content drivers, our content per vehicle has accelerated over the past couple of years from the -- in the low 60s per vehicle into the mid-70s this year. And we expect to continue to outperform auto production going forward as the content that we've set up, and the wins we have continues to grow. 
Turning to our commercial transportation business. We saw 38% organic growth with increases across all submarket verticals. We are continuing to benefit from stricter emission standards and the increased operator adoption of Euro VI, which reinforces our strong position in China. Also -- we're also pleased to announce that 2 leading heavy truck OEMs have awarded us the high-voltage connectivity wins on their new electric vehicle platforms that they're rolling out. This will provide future content growth and reinforce our market leadership position in the commercial transportation market. 
In our sensors business in the segment, we saw 15% organic growth driven by transportation applications with the new program ramps that we've talked to you about in the past few years. And for this segment, adjusted operating margins expanded nearly 500 basis points to 18% driven by higher volume and strong operational performance by our team. 
Now turning to the industrial segment. Our sales increased 6% organically year-over-year. Industrial equipment was up 32% organically with double-digit growth in all regions driven by momentum in factory automation applications where we continue to see the benefit from accelerated capital expenditures in areas like semiconductor manufacturing as well as in the automotive space. Our AD&M business declined 18% organically year-over-year driven by the continued market weakness I talked about earlier. And in our energy business, we saw 8% organic growth driven by increases in renewables, especially global solar applications. And it was nice that our medical business grew 5% year-over-year, and it's growing in line with the recovery that we're seeing in the interventional procedures. At a margin level, the segment expanded margin year-over-year by 200 basis points to 15.9% driven by strong operational performance. 
Now let me turn to communications. And clearly, our teams continue to demonstrate strong operational execution, while capitalizing on the growth trends in the markets that we serve in this segment. Sales grew 36% organically year-over-year for the segment, and in both businesses. In data and devices, performance continues to be driven by the position we built in high-speed solutions for cloud applications. We continue to see capital expenditures increasing by our cloud customers, and our content growth enabled us to grow cloud-related sales at double the market rate this year. 
In our appliance business, we saw double-digit growth in all regions driven by both consumer demand as well as continued share gains. It's clear that our communications team continues to deliver an outstanding performance with record adjusted operating margins of 24.7%, and this is up 300 basis points versus a strong quarter in the prior year. Overall, our segment teams are capitalizing on the growth trends in their end markets. That's demonstrating the diversity of our portfolio while delivering on strong operational execution in a challenging supply chain environment. You're seeing this reflected in our results, both for our fourth quarter as well as our full year, and we expect this to continue into 2022. 
So with that as a segment and a market overview, let me turn on to Heath, who will get into more details on the financials as well as our expectations going forward."

Currency exchange rates posi",783,"Thank you, Terrence, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q4 financials. Sales of $3.8 billion were up 17% on a reported basis and 16% on an organic basis year-over-year. Currency exchange rates positively impacted sales by $51 million versus the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $706 million with an adjusted operating margin of 18.4 -- I'm sorry, 18.5%, with strong year-over-year fall-throughs. GAAP operating income was $660 million and included $38 million of restructuring and other charges and $8 million of acquisition-related charges. .
For the full year, restructuring charges were $208 million, in line with expectations, and I expect restructuring charges to decline in fiscal '22 to approximately $150 million. Adjusted EPS was $1.69 and GAAP EPS was $2.40 for the quarter and included a tax-related benefit of $0.92, primarily related to decreases and our valuation allowances associated with tax planning. We also had a charge of $0.07 related to the annuitization of the proportion of our U.S. pension liabilities. Additionally, we had restructuring, acquisition and other charges of $0.14. Free cash flow was approximately $535 million for the quarter. And during the quarter, we utilized approximately $300 million for acquisitions, including [indiscernible] in our industrial segment, which Terrence mentioned earlier. 
The adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 was 20% and approximately 19% for the full year. For 2022, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of around 19%, but continue to expect our cash tax rate to be in the mid-teens. 
So turning to Slide 9. This slide puts some perspective on our performance this year and shows how we performed from fiscal '19 to '21. Over this time period, we had to overcome a challenging operating environment, and our performance is demonstrating the strength and diversity of our portfolio and the strong execution of our teams. We are back above the 2019 pre-COVID levels on every financial metric, with sales up 11%, adjusted operating margins expanding over 100 basis points, adjusted earnings per share increasing by 17% and free cash flow up 29%. I am pleased with how our teams performed to deliver the strong results through the cycle. 
To provide some segment-level examples, our transportation sales are up approximately 15% versus fiscal '19 and despite auto production declining over 11% during that same time frame. Similarly, in our communications segment, sales are up approximately 25% over this time period, significantly outperforming our end markets. This also demonstrates some of the content benefits we are seeing across the portfolio. 
Turning to year-over-year comparisons. Fiscal '21 sales of $14.9 billion were up 23% on a reported basis and 18% organically year-over-year. Currency exchange rates positively impacted sales by $444 million versus the prior year. We would expect currency exchange rates to be a year-over-year headwind on in our first quarter, and could remain a headwind for fiscal '22 if the dollar remains at the current levels relative to other currencies. Adjusted operating margins of 18.1%, and expanded by nearly 400 basis points year-over-year with expansion in every segment. Our adjusted earnings per share expanded 53% year-over-year to $6.51. 
I'm pleased with our performance given the inflationary pressures we are experiencing. We have -- as we have discussed in prior quarters, we have implemented price increases across our business in fiscal '21, and we expect further increases in fiscal '22. 
Turning to cash flow. We generated approximately 100% of conversion to adjusted net income with record free cash flow of approximately $2.1 billion for the year. As we go forward, we are confident that end demand will be robust for our products. And given our strong balance sheet, we are in a position to do strategic inventory builds to meet anticipated customer demand given the broader supply chain uncertainty. 
In FY '21, we continue to maintain our balanced capital strategy, returning capital to shareholders and remaining active in M&A. During the year, we returned over $1.5 billion to shareholders and utilized over $400 million for acquisitions. Going forward, we remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy and expect to return 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders while supporting our inorganic growth initiatives through bolt-on acquisitions. 
Before we go to questions, I want to reiterate that we are performing well in this environment despite challenges in the broader supply chain. Our results for the quarter and for the year demonstrate the strength and diversity of our portfolio, with contributions from each of our 3 segments. Our first quarter guidance represents a continuation of our strong performance, and we are excited about the growth and margin expansion opportunities as we move forward. Now let's open it up for questions."

And the first thing is you're right. Just to confirm what you heard. When we're looking at the programs that we've won and looking at into 2022, we do see something at the high end of the content outperformance range we've given you at 6%. And we do think that will include any noise around supply chain. It was included in that content outperformance. Because like we always say, be careful looking at CPV on a quarter basis or content growth on a quarter, their supply chain dynamics. And I think what's important to us is, 2 years ago, we were in the low 60s of content per vehicle. We talked to you about the trends around electrification of the car, powertrain getting, turning electric as well as autonomy in the car. And what's nice is we sort of view this year we're in the mid-70s of content. And we continue to feel very confident around getting up into that mid-80s range. And we are benefiting from the electric vehicle ramp that's happening around the world. That's grown 50% this year, like I said. Right now, people are saying even in what's IHS is on our basis to be a flat production environment, electric vehicles are going to grow another 50% next year. And I feel we're going to capitalize on it with the program wins we have. And this year, about 20% of our automotive revenue is driven by electric vehicles, even though it's not 20% of the total cars made on the planet. So it just reinforces again the content that we've been driving, where we positioned TE around. And certainly, their supply chain that will make production a little lumpy. But when we look at 2022 and beyond, we think there's a pretty good setup where demand is, where inventory levels are for production as well that at some point will also be a catalyst on top of the content that we TE up on. So hopefully, I touched upon all your questions, Chris. ."

Yes, I think we have to go back the past couple quarters, we told you there was a lot of orders coming in as people are working with their supply chains. But what we started to see is that in this quarter, the scheduling out continues, which is a good sign. I think people are accepting the lead times they have throughout the components in their supply chain. Last time I read, I think semiconductors were about half a year lead time. So we see customers looking at scheduling out. So while our backlog is stronger, clearly in dollars, it's also scheduled out longer, and we're seeing customers adapting to that. 
The other thing is the end dynamics are very strong. So when you think about car demand, you also see our auto customers are also keeping them scheduled out. So net-net, we actually think this trend is a positive sign. And we always said we thought our orders would get closer to billings than our billings getting closer to the orders we've had over the past couple of quarters. And actually, that they're starting to get scheduled out more is a good sign. I would say the only area that we see any end market softness right now is around auto production, but that's supply chain driven. And what we saw, how those orders moved out, aligning to how our customers want to produce the order trends sort of mirrored exactly what's going on. So I think it's getting a little bit more predictable even though it's scheduled out a lot longer."

Certainly, as we progressed over the past 90 days since the last time we spoke, we have started to see, from an availability standpoint, things to improve. Things have gotten a little bit better with some of our inputs, particularly with the resin side of things. Now we are still seeing inflationary pressures, particularly on metals, resins, and probably most pronounced on freight costs. And we do expect those inflationary pressures to continue into '22. .
Now on the flip side of that, as you're acutely aware, normally, we would see price pressures of somewhere 1% to 2% of erosion each year. In FY '21, that was largely neutral. We did not see those price pressures. We were more back at par, and we actually expect in '22 as we move forward to see some price increases as we battle through some of these inflationary pressures. So a lot of moving parts there. Again, I think from an availability, things are improving, and we're working through using price as one of the levers that we have to combat the inflationary pressures."

And the only place t",702,"Yes. So let me get into the market there, Wamsi. And when we sit there, I do want to go back to what I said in the script that we do have a constructive demand environment across when you get out to the end applications that we're in. And the only place that we haven't seen a constructive market is certainly around the aerospace side. And that will come at some point. I'm not sure that will be in 2022 for us, but that will come at some point. Just to break it down by the segments a little bit, in transportation -- and like you said, Wamsi, we didn't guide that up. I'll give you how we sort of see the external data points around markets. .
In automotive right now, people in IHS is saying it's going to be around 77 million cars made next year globally. That's pretty flat. That has supply chain constraints in it, and the semi side continuing. Could there be upside to that, the supply chain gets work at potentially. But I would also say the content that we talked about as being at the high end of the [ 4 to 6 ], inclusive of any supply chain noise, we feel pretty good about. In the commercial transportation space, this year was a great year by our team. We grew 2x the market. It demonstrates our leading position, also the content that we're getting around emissions that are all over heavy trucks as well as the data connectivity on heavy trucks. 
Next year, we're going to have a slowdown in China in the market. And I think that's very well known. But on a flattish environment to slightly down environment and commercial -- or commercial vehicles, we think content will create growth there. And I talked about the new EV wins that we have on the heavy truck that won't benefit '22 be further out. In the industrial space, the recovery feels like it's just getting started. And we're starting to see improvements in medical. Our industrial and factory automation side is very strong. Energy has stayed strong throughout the entire [ '19 ] forward. We see that continuing, especially with the benefits from renewable sources that we're in the mid-teens of our revenue. We think that can move up in our energy business around solar and certainly wind. 
And then the communications segment, what I would tell you as we look forward is you have cloud CapEx is going to increase another 10% next year. And when you think about we grown 2x the market here over the past 3 years, our cloud revenue has doubled since 2019, and we're going to have growth on top of that with that cloud CapEx picture. And then on appliances, the consumer is strong. Certainly, we have to watch that. The consumer slows down a lot, but there could be a little bit of a headwind. But right now, we're sort of assuming that's a flattish market globally. So we believe it's a pretty constructive set up. Certainly, supply chain billing is a big piece of it. We hope our supply chain continues to improve, like we saw over the past 90 days, and we'll take advantage of that as we build a little bit of inventory early in the year to make sure we capitalize on the setup. 
On the pieces around the second part of your question, when you look at this year, other than the market, the bigger piece of our growth is really around content. So any way you want to parcel it, I think Heath framed the price side. Normally, we have 1% to 2% negative price last year. We're basically flat. That shows the pricing that we've been pushing through that we started in January in the distribution area. And we're in the middle of automotive contractual negotiations as we speak. So I think there's more to come there. But clearly, the bigger piece last year has to do marketing content. And that's what we get excited about as we go forward. And I gave you that -- a couple of examples there between auto and also in the cloud."

When we talk EV, we do include hybrids. We include both elements of them. So when you take that -- and even the numbers I quote about the 9 million units made globally that are electric. That includes hybrids and plug-in hybrids. So that's totally the area we get the bigger content as you bring in the electric powertrain in both areas. 
So if you take our automotive revenue this year, with what you would have in an electric vehicle, both on the high-voltage content and low voltage together. That's a little bit above 20%. And the content is sort of hung in the 2x. It's right on top of it. And like we've always said, when you think about TE, there is some things that get cannibalized on our product. The low-voltage things come over. When you start putting that electric powertrain, you have charger inlet, you actually have to get the power into the battery. We play along those connectivities, certainly, how it comes into the sell side, and also some of the things we do from a switching of power as you bring the power back and forth. And that creates the content above the low voltage position. So it is important there. 
The other thing I would just don't want to lose sight on, and I said in my script was, as you get into the heavy truck. I know we've given examples, but I did mention in the prepared remarks. We won 2 programs with 2 of the top 5 truck manufacturers in the world. And these are turning from prototypes into real platforms. And when you look at that, in our commercial transportation business that I talked about a little bit earlier, the content on those high-voltage architectures can be over $1,000 per vehicle. And that's just on the high-voltage architecture. That doesn't even include some of the other elements that we would have on data. And I'm really excited about those wins because they also truly show our leadership position there in commercial transportation. 
When it comes to connectivity, we have a leading share by quite some distance, and our global customers are looking about how when they get more electrified powertrains across their fleets and their offerings. They come to us. And let's face it. You're dealing with voltages that are at 1000 versus what you would have in a car. You're dealing with vibration and certain durability, which we've talked about in harsh environments. That's what we love. Our engineers like to tackle those challenges and that we want to with the top 5 on their initial platforms. I see that continuing just to go across the other players and reinforcing our great commercial transportation business."

As I mentioned earlier, resins particularly are improving. And metals, we're working our way through. So as we look forward, and we continue to anticipate resolution of some of those input challenges that we have, it does give us the ability to start having a little bit more foresight into what we want to do strategic build-aheads for, right? 
I mean if you think about where we're sitting here, right? We're not going to sit here and predict when some of the semicon challenges for our auto customers specifically get resolved. You should ask them or the semicon companies, right? But what we do know is that there's really, really strong demand out there for automobiles. And that's not just a U.S. comment, that's really globally. And the shortage of those vehicles on dealer lots give us a lot of ability to play offense here in terms of being bullish about when that demand comes back. We want to make sure that we are ready for our customers, and not going to be holding up any kind of ramp that they may have. Now when that ramp happens, is still TBD. But -- and I'm not going to signal that this number of inventory build is going to be massive, but we are going to take advantage of a little bit of a slowdown in the auto production world and get ahead of it so we're ready."

Terrence mentioned that we're anticipating a flatter appliance market as we work our way through the year, I'm not suggesting that's all going to happen here in the first quarter, but we're probably taking an approach there where we see a little bit of contraction in the margins albeit more to come as we're able to see what volume we end up looking like. So in terms of the decrementals on that, I think you could roll it through roughly the same kind of math. But we target about 30% flow-through on the organic side.

In regard to pricing, pricing is very different by our end markets. When you say receptivity, I wouldn't say anybody likes pricing. So I wouldn't say people are saying, I'm happy about it. But I would say we're pulling to different levers, as he said. Some we can pull quicker in places where like we go through our channel partners, smaller customers in places like auto, it's more contractual agreements, and that's -- we're in the middle of those, and that will continue to be a recovery point throughout this year.

And we aren't waited to one of the cloud providers globally versus another, but we are benefiting from their capital spending trends. And that capital spending trend is -- they're very much focused not only on speed. They're also focusing on how they continue to implement AI to make sure we're that how do they get more specific compute and scaling computing power that also helps them get to their cost of total ownership, including their impact on energy usage down. 
And what we continue to see as they're making their investments, which are aligned with what you said, we're seeing them wanting to spend another 10% around the cloud and data center going into next year.

And from your own perspective, Heath, you talked about building inventory as you get into fiscal '22. Can you tell us how that impacts your free cash flow and the conversion rate, which is typically around 100%?"

So Matt, let me take the part around what we see out in inventory in the world, and then we'll get to -- Heath will talk about our inventory. First off, in the channel partners, I would tell you our channel partner orders have accelerated over the past 3 quarters, but they have leveled out now. So similar to the other order comments I've made, we have seen leveling. We've been able to service more to them as our supply has improved. But we have not seen their inventory increase on our product set. So their turn levels have accelerated here, and they're touching product more to get it out because how quick they're turning it. So inventory levels in '21 have remained relatively flat, while they've had significant growth as they're trying to help the customers and their supply chain solutions to those. 
When it comes to our customers, we do see customers holding more inventory. Some customers have scheduled out further. But we also have customers that some areas are still very low in certain inventory pockets. So certainly, the supply chain is trying to get to a normalized, I would say, on both sides of the equation. You see it. And it's also what's happening in auto land. You need about 30,000 parts to make a car. If one of them isn't there in 1 plant, the car is not being made. So when we look at it, we're always going to have supply chain delays, whether it's building or coming down a little bit, but we do view that as noise. And it's back to the comments we said about content. We feel good about the 6% content growth over production next year, including any supply chain goes."

I think it gets down to the timing. The way we're looking at it now is it's probably more of a first half issue where some inventory builds. And then as we can bleed that off, we're taking -- basically taking advantage of some slower auto production here in the early part of the year. So as part of that, I think that just gets into the timing it could put a little bit of pressure on that 100%, but we're -- we have other levers as well that we're looking at, and we'll continue to assess that. And I think we'll be able to give you a better update on that answer here a quarter or 2 from now."

Listen, I mean, you've been covering for a long time, you're well aware of the restructuring endeavors that we've undertaken, and we've been very focused in on particular areas around industrial. This past year round so things that we did on a footprint-basis in Europe that we're continuing to execute on within transportation, and then we're benefiting greatly from communications side with a lot of the heavy lifting done several years ago on the footprint side. 
So as we work forward, there's no doubt that as we think about that ability to grow over 100 basis points from '19 to '20, restructuring played a meaningful part of that. But I would also tell you that some of the things that we were able to do around holding off in 2021, the price erosion through some of the actions that we undertook as well as the ability to offset some of the inflationary pressures with productivity were a meaningful part. And then volume goes a long way. As you know, this is a scale business and having volume means a lot. So I don't know if we've ever actually broke down externally what percentage of that increase is in certain buckets. But you can imagine there was contributions across the board on that side of things. 
In terms of -- like, as I mentioned earlier. Listen, as we sat here and although we're not guiding for the full year, we feel good about our ability to hold to our business model of margin expansion through -- even if its modest this year, through the flow-through of 30%."

I know you and I have had a lot of discussions about this over the last few years. I appreciate the question. Honestly, as I sit there and look at where the buckets are, the bigger item -- the bigger projects that we have underway in terms of rightsizing the footprint. Some of the things that we've talked historically about getting size in industrial and getting to the right places of manufacturing for automotive, particularly in Europe. A lot of those things are underway. Those charges have been taken, and we're working through those. We're seeing more of now, Jim, is the impact of some of the more recent acquisitions. And when acquisitions come into our portfolio, inevitably, they come in at multiple sites. And in some cases, we do need to go and collapse those into our existing footprint or in some cases, they avail opportunities to take legacy TE locations and move into the acquired sites. So some of the things that we're now seeing, whether that's with Ernie or with some of the sensors activities that we acquired here in the last few years, is driving some of those restructuring efforts and plays into the overall return and valuation considerations for the acquisitions that we do in terms of the return and value creation opportunities. So we're starting to make that move. We're not quite there in terms of cleaning up some of the legacy locations, but we're getting closer."

Medical, we haven't talked about for the past couple of years due to the impact that we did have on procedures. But when you look at how procedures are increasing. The innovation that we've been doing with our customers has not slowed down during this time, but certainly, the levels of procedures went way down due to the COVID dynamics. 
So I do think you'll see us talking more about medical again from a growth perspective, more like we've had historically than you've experienced in the past couple of years. In comm air, it's a little bit different. I think medical had a temporary pause due to procedures. Comm air is one that has been hit hard. It's been hit hard. Certainly, you're starting to see some discussion around single-aisle aircraft. You get into dual-aisle aircraft. Dual-aisle aircraft is probably further away. And in those cases, I'm not sure you're going to have as much new innovation happening, even though we do have wins on what's happening in space, certainly lower satellites as well as we're also working with some of the newer EV OTL providers depending upon what ramp that does. So I think net-net, certainly a much more bullish tone around medical, I think comm air because that's how it really got hit as the overall market and our customers also got disorientated that they had to reposition really is one that's going to be a little bit longer out. Actually, we have a very good position there, certainly a leading position, but I'm not sure we're going to need a little bit of time for that to work out on what the growth trajectory is longer term, based upon what our customers do."

And I'll start at the beginning in my comments just to make sure we know where we broke off. But I want to talk about our results for the fourth quarter as well as fiscal 2021 as well as the outlook for the fiscal 2020 first quarter. So before Heath and I get into the slides, let me frame out the performance relative to the broader market environment that we're operating in.  
I am pleased with our results in the fourth quarter as well as the strong performance that we delivered for the full year. We continue to experience global GDP growth with strong end market demand across most end markets that we've strategically positioned TE to focus on, and this broad growth that we're seeing is both in the consumer and capital spending areas. And let me bring some color to that, how that relates to TE.  
On the consumer side, demand for autos and appliances remain strong, and we continue to see increases in medical procedures that benefit medical device sales. On the capital spending side, we see increased investments that relate to cloud and data centers, factory automation, semiconductor capacity as well as the need for more renewable energy sources. And when you look at the results we're going to talk about today, you're going to see this broad strength reflected in our orders in our backlog and that will benefit us as we go into 2022 as well as our results in 2021.  
While certainly, this demand environment is a positive, the balance of this is that the reality is we're still in a world that's dealing with COVID, and global supply chains that have not been able to keep up with the strong demand trends. Within this backdrop, we are continuing to capitalize on growth opportunities across our served markets. In the fourth quarter, we delivered 16% organic growth despite auto production declines caused by our auto customer supply chain. This performance demonstrates the strength as well as the diversity of our portfolio. We have strategically positioned TE around certain secular trends, and you're seeing the market outperformance in each of our segments as a result of this positioning.  
In transportation, our leadership position is enabling us to deliver content growth from both electrification of the core as well as increased adoption of electric vehicles globally. In industrial, we're benefiting from accelerated global capital spending around factories and in communications, we're driving content and share gain in cloud applications. In addition to the strong top line growth outperformance versus our markets this year, we have executed well to deliver margin expansion in each of our 3 segments.  
The last proof point that I think is important is -- and shows the strength of the portfolio is how our full year results compared to pre-pandemic levels of 2019. Both our sales and adjusted earnings per share in fiscal '21 were up double digits versus 2019, and we expanded adjusted operating margins by over 100 basis points by continuing the margin journey that we're on. More importantly, we also remain excited about the additional growth and margin opportunities that we still have ahead of us.  
Now with that as a backdrop, let me get into the slides, and I'll discuss the highlights that we have listed on Slide 3. Our teams had strong execution results in the fourth quarter despite reductions in auto production and ongoing challenges in the broader global supply chain. We generated sales of $3.8 billion with 16% organic growth and adjusted earnings per share ahead of guidance at $1.69, which was up 46% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margins were 18.5% as a result of the increases across all 3 segments, and I'll share more details about segment results a little bit later.  
When you look at the full year, year-over-year sales were up 23%, adjusted operating margins expanded approximately 400 basis points and adjusted earnings per share was up over 50% to $6.51. Also, as important of earnings is where we generated in free cash flow. Our free cash flow was above $2 billion with approximately 100% conversion to adjusted net income for the year, demonstrating our strong cash generation model. We also continue to remain balanced in our capital deployment with about 3/4 of our free cash flow return to owners this past year and the remainder used for M&A including the earning acquisition in the industrial segment that we mentioned last quarter.  
When you look at our orders in the fourth quarter, they remained strong at $4.1 billion, with strength in each segment, and our book-to-bill was 1.08. With these orders and where we position TE, we do expect a strong performance of our portfolio to continue into the first quarter with approximately $3.7 billion in sales, which will be up mid-single digits organically year-over-year despite a roughly 20% expected decline in year-over-year auto production. We expect strong double-digit growth in both our industrial and communications segments, and I think this is another point that reinforces diversity of the markets that we serve. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.60 in the first quarter, and this will be up 9% year-over-year.  
Now let me talk about the market, and frame it to where we were just 90 days ago when we last spoke. In transportation, consumer demand for autos remained robust, but clearly, ongoing challenges with semiconductors and the broader supply chain continue to impact our auto OEM customers' ability to produce. Global auto production came in lower than we expected just 90 days ago as our customers reduced production to enable the supply chain to catch up. Auto production was approximately 2 million units lower than we anticipated in the fourth quarter. And we're expecting auto production to be in the 18 million unit range in our first quarter. This first quarter production will be well below the nearly 23 million units made in the first quarter of 2021.  
The key for us is that the trends around content growth for TE remains strong, and we expect content growth to be at the high end of the 4- to 6-point range in fiscal '22 as we continue to benefit from increased electronification and higher production of electric vehicles. Now versus 90 days ago in our industrial segment, the key is that we continue to see an improving backdrop, which is benefiting our industrial equipment and energy businesses, and our medical business is growing year-over-year as interventional procedures increase. The 1 area that we've not seen improved is the commercial aerospace business. It's sort of staying stable, and we've not seen an inflection point in that business yet, to hire or lower growth. In communications versus 90 days ago, we continue to see favorable end market trends with global growth in cloud capital expenditures and strength in residential demand benefiting our appliances business. Now while that's a view of what we've seen versus 90 days ago from a market perspective, I also believe in this environment, so it's important to tell you what we're seeing in our supply chain. While challenges remain in the broader supply chain, we have seen some improvement in our availability of certain raw materials in our own supply chain versus 90 days ago. 90 days ago, we thought we were impacted by about $100 million of revenue due to us not having availability of supply. This quarter end, we're only -- that's down to about $50 million. And with this improvement, this will enable us to increase production and inventory levels accordingly to ensure we can meet demand as our customers resolve their supply issues.  
Now before I move into orders, I will start on Slide 4. I do want to take a moment to mention a few key highlights on the progress we made this year on our ESG initiatives. Earlier this year, we issued our 11th corporate responsibility report, which discusses our One Connected World strategy, which really encapsulates our ESG strategy. And we hope that you read this report, which highlights the efforts that we're driving internally related to our impact on the planet as well as the innovation our engineers bring to our customers to make sure we're enabling sustainable applications.  
Some of the key highlights I want to mention is that on the environmental side, we set up a new goal to decrease Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by over 40% on an absolute basis by 2030. And this new goal is above and beyond the 35% reduction we've already made in absolute greenhouse gas emission reductions over the past decade. We also continue to make progress on sourcing renewable electricity. And today, I'm happy to say over 20% of TE's production currently uses carbon-free electricity. And also, this past year, we began to report Scope 3 emissions back in July.  
If you look at social initiatives, we set a goal to increase women in leadership position by over 26% by 2025. And I'm happy to say we continue to focus on employee safety and engagement throughout the pandemic. We've gotten good feedback from our employees on how we've been there for them during this typical time. So clearly, I'm pleased with the continued progress that we're making towards what our purpose is as a company, which is to create a safer, sustainable, productive and connected future.  
So now let me please get into the orders on Slide 4, and we'll go through it by the segments in both -- and also, on a geographic basis. For the fourth quarter, our orders were over $4 billion, with year-over-year order growth in all regions. Our order trends and backlog remains strong in each segment, and the order patterns we're seeing are as we expected. As we've been mentioning through the year, and as you've seen in our book-to-bill ratios, order levels have been elevated with customers placing orders for delivery beyond the current quarter due to the broader supply chain situation. As a result, we're coming into fiscal '22 with a strong backlog position that is higher than we typically see for our business. When we look at the order patterns at a segment level, industrial and communication orders are trending as expected, with continued momentum in areas like factory automation and cloud applications. I also want to highlight and remind you that in the industrial and communications segment, we have a relatively large portion of our business that goes through our channel partners. And we're seeing our booking patterns begin to align more closely to our settlement, which is a good sign. The other key thing to highlight around our channel partners is that in 2021, we did not see inventory levels increase with them, even though they had a much higher level -- business levels that really they had a much higher churn in their inventories this year.  
Looking at transportation. We are seeing order levels match the production dynamics that are aligned with our guidance. When you look beyond the near-term noise of auto supply chain pressure, it is important to remember that consumer demand for autos remain strong and dealer inventories remain extremely low. So we believe this is a very favorable setup for medium- and longer-term auto production growth.  
Now let me add some color on what we're seeing organically from a geographic perspective on a year-over-year basis. We continue to see growth in Asia, where China orders were up 17%, and growth across all 3 segments. In Europe, orders were up 21% and North America orders were up 26%. On a sequential basis, we saw orders decline in each region that reflect the order patterns I just talked about in our segments. But the 1 key difference is we did see growth in our transportation segment orders in China sequentially where our auto orders were up 9%.  
So with that, with an order backdrop, let's get into the segment year-over-year results, and they'll be on your slides 5 through 7. So starting with transportation. Segment sales were up 16% organically year-over-year with growth in each of our businesses. Our auto business grew 12% organically despite the declines in auto production that I mentioned. We continue to benefit from increased production of electric vehicles as our technology and products are enabling high-voltage architectures and applications with every leading customer on the planet. Hybrid and electric vehicle production grew 50% year-over-year increasing from roughly 6 million units produced in 2020 to roughly 9 million units produced globally in 2021. We also continue to benefit from content growth in nonelectric vehicles driven by ongoing safety, certainly data connectivity, comfort and autonomy features.  
As a result of these content drivers, our content per vehicle has accelerated over the past couple of years from the -- in the low 60s per vehicle into the mid-70s this year. And we expect to continue to outperform auto production going forward as the content that we've set up and the wins we have continues to grow.  
Turning to our commercial transportation business. We saw 38% organic growth with increases across all submarket verticals. We are continuing to benefit from stricter emission standards and the increased operator adoption of Euro VI, which reinforces our strong position in China. Also -- we're also pleased to announce that 2 leading heavy truck OEMs have awarded us the high-voltage connectivity wins on their new electric vehicle platforms that they're rolling out. This will provide future content growth and reinforce our market leadership position in the commercial transportation market.  
In our sensors business in the segment, we saw 15% organic growth driven by transportation applications with the new program ramps that we've talked to you about in the past few years. And for this segment, adjusted operating margins expanded nearly 500 basis points to 18% driven by higher volume and strong operational performance by our team.  
Now turning to the industrial segment. Our sales increased 6% organically year-over-year. Industrial equipment was up 32% organically with double-digit growth in all regions driven by momentum in factory automation applications where we continue to see the benefit from accelerated capital expenditures in areas like semiconductor manufacturing as well as in the automotive space. Our AD&M business declined 18% organically year-over-year driven by the continued market weakness I talked about earlier. And in our energy business, we saw 8% organic growth driven by increases in renewables, especially global solar applications. And it was nice that our medical business grew 5% year-over-year, and it's growing in line with the recovery that we're seeing in the interventional procedures.  
At a margin level, the segment expanded margin year-over-year by 200 basis points to 15.9% driven by strong operational performance.  
Now let me turn to communications. And clearly, our teams continue to demonstrate strong operational execution, while capitalizing on the growth trends in the markets that we serve in this segment. Sales grew 36% organically year-over-year for the segment, and in both businesses. In data and devices, performance continues to be driven by the position we built in high-speed solutions for cloud applications. We continue to see capital expenditures increasing by our cloud customers, and our content growth enabled us to grow cloud-related sales at double the market rate this year.  
In our appliance business, we saw double-digit growth in all regions driven by both consumer demand as well as continued share gains. It's clear that our communications team continues to deliver an outstanding performance with record adjusted operating margins of 24.7%, and this is up 300 basis points versus a strong quarter in the prior year. Overall, our segment teams are capitalizing on the growth trends in their end markets. That's demonstrating the diversity of our portfolio while delivering on strong operational execution in a challenging supply chain environment. You're seeing this reflected in our results, both for our fourth quarter as well as our full year, and we expect this to continue into 2022.  
So with that as a segment and a market overview, let me turn on to Heath, who will get into more details on the financials as well as our expectations going forward."

Currency exchange rates posi",780,"Thank you, Terrence, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q4 financials. Sales of $3.8 billion were up 17% on a reported basis and 16% on an organic basis year-over-year. Currency exchange rates positively impacted sales by $51 million versus the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $706 million with an adjusted operating margin of 18.4 -- I'm sorry, 18.5%, with strong year-over-year fall-throughs. GAAP operating income was $660 million and included $38 million of restructuring and other charges and $8 million of acquisition-related charges. 
For the full year, restructuring charges were $208 million, in line with expectations, and I expect restructuring charges to decline in fiscal '22 to approximately $150 million. Adjusted EPS was $1.69 and GAAP EPS was $2.40 for the quarter and included a tax-related benefit of $0.92, primarily related to decreases and our valuation allowances associated with tax planning. We also had a charge of $0.07 related to the annuitization of the proportion of our U.S. pension liabilities. 
Additionally, we have restructuring, acquisition and other charges of $0.14. Free cash flow was approximately $535 million for the quarter. And during the quarter, we utilized approximately $300 million for acquisitions, including earnings in our industrial segment, which Terrence mentioned earlier.  
The adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 was 20% and approximately 19% for the full year. For 2022, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of around 19% but continue to expect our cash tax rate to be in the mid-teens. 
So turning to Slide 9. This slide puts some perspective on our performance this year and shows how we performed from fiscal '19 to '21. Over this time period, we had to overcome a challenging operating environment, and our performance is demonstrating the strength and diversity of our portfolio and the strong execution of our teams. We are back above the 2019 pre-COVID levels on every financial metric, with sales up 11%, adjusted operating margins expanding over 100 basis points, adjusted earnings per share increasing by 17% and free cash flow up 29%. I am pleased with how our teams performed to deliver the strong results through this cycle.  
To provide some segment-level examples, our transportation sales are up approximately 15% versus fiscal '19, despite auto production declining over 11% during that same time frame. Similarly, in our communications segment, sales are up approximately 25% over this time period, significantly outperforming our end markets. This also demonstrates some of the content benefits we are seeing across the portfolio.  
Turning to year-over-year comparisons. Fiscal '21 sales of $14.9 billion were up 23% on a reported basis and 18% organically year-over-year. Currency exchange rates positively impacted sales by $444 million versus the prior year. We would expect currency exchange rates to be a year-over-year headwind on in our first quarter and could remain a headwind for fiscal '22 if the dollar remains at the current levels relative to other currencies. Adjusted operating margins of 18.1% and expanded by nearly 400 basis points year-over-year with expansion in every segment. Our adjusted earnings per share expanded 53% year-over-year to $6.51.  
I'm pleased with our performance given the inflationary pressures we are experiencing. We have -- as we have discussed in prior quarters, we have implemented price increases across our business in fiscal '21, and we expect further increases in fiscal '22.  
Turning to cash flow. We generated approximately 100% conversion to adjusted net income with record free cash flow of approximately $2.1 billion for the year. As we go forward, we are confident that end demand will be robust for our products. And given our strong balance sheet, we are in a position to do strategic inventory builds to meet anticipated customer demand given the broader supply chain uncertainty.  
In FY '21, we continue to maintain our balanced capital strategy, returning capital to shareholders and remaining active in M&A. During the year, we returned over $1.5 billion to shareholders and utilized over $400 million for acquisitions. Going forward, we remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy and expect to return 2/3 of our free cash flow to shareholders while supporting our inorganic growth initiatives through bolt-on acquisitions.  
Before we go to questions, I want to reiterate that we are performing well in this environment despite challenges in the broader supply chain. Our results for the quarter and for the year demonstrate the strength and diversity of our portfolio, with contributions from each of our 3 segments. Our first quarter guidance represents a continuation of our strong performance, and we are excited about the growth and margin expansion opportunities as we move forward. Now let's open it up for questions."

And the first thing is you're right. Just to confirm what you heard. When we're looking at the programs that we've won and looking at into 2022, we do see something at the high end of the content outperformance range we've given you at that 6%. And we do think that will include any noise around supply chain. It was included in that content outperformance. Because like we always say, be careful looking at CPV on a quarter basis or content growth on a quarter, their supply chain dynamics. And I think what's important to us is, 2 years ago, we were in the low 60s of content per vehicle. We talked to you about the trends around electrification of the car, powertrain getting, turning electric as well as autonomy in the car. And what's nice is we sort of view this year we're in the mid-70s of content. And we continue to feel very confident around getting up into that mid-80s range. And we are benefiting from the electric vehicle ramp that's happening around the world. That's grown 50% this year, like I said. Right now, people are saying even in what's IHS views on our basis to be a flat production environment, electric vehicles are going to grow another 50% next year. And I feel we're going to capitalize on it with the program wins we have. And this year, about 20% of our automotive revenue is driven by electric vehicles, even though it's not 20% of the total cars made on the planet. So it just reinforces again the content that we've been driving, where we positioned TE around. And certainly, their supply chain that will make production a little lumpy. But when we look at 2022 and beyond, we think there's a pretty good setup where demand is, where inventory levels are for production as well that at some point will also be a catalyst on top of the content that we, TE up on. So hopefully, I touched upon all your questions, Chris. ."

Yes, I think we have to go back the past couple quarters, we told you there was a lot of orders coming in as people are working with their supply chains. But what we started to see is that in this quarter, the scheduling out continues, which is a good sign. I think people are accepting the lead times they have throughout the components in their supply chain. Last time I read, I think semiconductors were about half a year lead time. So we see customers looking at scheduling out. So while our backlog is stronger, clearly in dollars, it's also scheduled out longer, and we're seeing customers adapting to that. 
The other thing is the end dynamics are very strong. So when you think about car demand, you also see our auto customers are also keeping them scheduled out. So net-net, we actually think this trend is a positive sign. And we always said we thought our orders would get closer to billings than our billings getting closer to the orders we've had over the past couple of quarters. And actually, that they're starting to get scheduled out more is a good sign. I would say the only area that we see any end market softness right now is around auto production, but that's supply chain driven. And what we saw, how those orders moved out, aligning to how our customers want to produce the order trends sort of mirrored exactly what's going on. So I think it's getting a little bit more predictable even though it's scheduled out a lot longer."

Certainly, as we progressed over the past 90 days since the last time we spoke, we have started to see, from an availability standpoint, things to improve. Things have gotten a little bit better with some of our inputs, particularly with the resins side of things. Now we are still seeing inflationary pressures, particularly on metals, resins, and probably most pronounced on freight costs. And we do expect those inflationary pressures to continue into '22. 
Now on the flip side of that, as you're acutely aware, normally, we would see price pressures of somewhere 1% to 2% of erosion each year. In FY '21, that was largely neutral. We did not see those price pressures. We were more back at par, and we actually expect in '22 as we move forward to see some price increases as we battle through some of these inflationary pressures. So a lot of moving parts there. Again, I think from an availability standpoint, things are improving, and we're working through using price as one of the levers that we have to combat the inflationary pressures."

That alone brings our flow-through in the first quarter down to the level that you're referring to. If you were to back that out, you'd be up in the 30% range again.

And the only place t",700,"Yes. So let me get into the market there, Wamsi. And when we sit there, I do want to go back to what I said in the script that we do have a constructive demand environment across when you get out to the end applications that we're in. And the only place that we haven't seen a constructive market is certainly around the aerospace side. And that will come at some point. I'm not sure that will be in 2022 for us, but that will come at some point. Just to break it down by the segments a little bit, in transportation -- and like you said, Wamsi, we didn't guide that up. I'll give you how we sort of see the external data points around markets. .
In automotive right now, people in IHS are saying it's going to be around 77 million cars made next year globally. That's pretty flat. That has supply chain constraints in it, and the semi side continuing. Could there be upside to that, the supply chain gets work out potentially. But I would also say the content that we talked about as the -- being at the high end of the 4% to 6%, inclusive of any supply chain noise, we feel pretty good about. In the commercial transportation space, this year was a great year by our team. We grew 2x the market. It demonstrates our leading position, also the content that we're getting around emissions that are all over heavy trucks as well as the data connectivity on heavy trucks. 
Next year, we're going to have a slowdown in China in the market. And I think that's very well known. But on a flattish environment to slightly down environment and commercial -- or commercial vehicles, we think content will create growth there. And I talked about the new EV wins that we have on the heavy truck that won't benefit '22 be further out. In the industrial space, the recovery feels like it's just getting started. And we're starting to see improvements in medical. Our industrial and factory automation side is very strong. Energy has stayed strong throughout the entire '19 forward. We see that continuing, especially with the benefits from renewable sources that we're in the mid-teens of our revenue. We think that can move up in our energy business around solar and certainly wind. 
And then the communications segment, what I would tell you as we look forward is you have cloud CapEx is going to increase another 10% next year. And when you think about we grown 2x the market here over the past 3 years, our cloud revenue has doubled since 2019, and we're going to have growth on top of that with that cloud CapEx picture. And then on appliances, the consumer is strong. Certainly, we have to watch that. The consumer slows down a lot, but there could be a little bit of a headwind. But right now, we're sort of assuming that's a flattish market globally. So we believe it's a pretty constructive set up. Certainly, supply chain billing is a big piece of it. We hope our supply chain continues to improve, like we saw over the past 90 days, and we'll take advantage of that as we build a little bit of inventory early in the year to make sure we capitalize on the setup. 
On the pieces around the second part of your question, when you look at this year, other than the market, the bigger piece of our growth is really around content. So any way you want to parcel it, I think Heath framed the price side. Normally, we have 1% to 2% negative price last year. We're basically flat. That shows the pricing that we've been pushing through that we started in January in the distribution area. And we're in the middle of automotive contractual negotiations as we speak. So I think there's more to come there. But clearly, the bigger piece last year has to do marketing content. And that's what we get excited about as we go forward. And I gave you that -- a couple of examples there between auto and also in the cloud."

When we talk EV, we do include hybrids. We include both elements of them. So when you take that -- and even the numbers I quote about the 9 million units made globally that are electric. That includes hybrids and plug-in hybrids. So that's totally the area we get the bigger content as you bring in the electric powertrain in both areas. 
So if you take our automotive revenue this year, with what you would have in an electric vehicle, both on the high-voltage content and low voltage together. That's a little bit above 20%. And the content is sort of hung in the 2x. It's right on top of it. And like we've always said, when you think about TE, there is some things that get cannibalized on our product. The low-voltage things come over. When you start putting that electric powertrain, you have charger inlet, you actually have to get the power into the battery. We play along those connectivity's, certainly, how it comes into the sell side, and also some of the things we do from a switching of power as you bring the power back and forth. And that creates the content above the low voltage position. So it is important there. 
The other thing I would just don't want to lose sight on, and I said in my script was, as you get into the heavy truck. I know we've given examples, but I did mention in the prepared remarks. We won 2 programs with 2 of the top 5 truck manufacturers in the world. And these are turning from prototypes into real platforms. And when you look at that, in our commercial transportation business that I talked about a little bit earlier, the content on those high-voltage architectures can be over $1,000 per vehicle. And that's just on the high-voltage architecture. That doesn't even include some of the other elements that we would have on data. And I'm really excited about those wins because they also truly show our leadership position there in commercial transportation. 
When it comes to connectivity, we have a leading share by quite some distance, and our global customers are looking about how when they get to more electrified powertrains across their fleets and their offerings. They come to us. And let's face it. You're dealing with voltages that are at 1000 versus what you would have in a car. You're dealing with vibration and certain durability, which we've talked about in harsh environments. That's what we love. Our engineers like to tackle those challenges and that we want to with the top 5 on their initial platforms. I see that continuing just to go across the other players and reinforcing our great commercial transportation business."

As I mentioned earlier, resins particularly are improving. And metals, we're working our way through. So as we look forward, and we continue to anticipate resolution of some of those input challenges that we have, it does give us the ability to start having a little bit more foresight into what we want to do strategic build-aheads for, right? 
I mean if you think about where we're sitting here, right? We're not going to sit here and predict when some of the semicon challenges for our auto customers specifically get resolved. You should ask them or the semicon companies, right? But what we do know is that there's really, really strong demand out there for automobiles. And that's not just a U.S. comment, that's really globally. And the shortage of those vehicles on dealer lots give us a lot of ability to play offense here in terms of being bullish about when that demand comes back. We want to make sure that we are ready for our customers, and not going to be holding up any kind of ramp that they may have. Now when that ramp happens, is still TBD. But -- and I'm not going to signal that this number of inventory build is going to be massive, but we are going to take advantage of a little bit of a slowdown in the auto production world and get ahead of it so we're ready."

Terrence mentioned that we're anticipating a flatter appliance market as we work our way through the year, I'm not suggesting that's all going to happen here in the first quarter, but we're probably taking an approach there where we see a little bit of contraction in the margins albeit more to come as we're able to see what volume we end up looking like. So in terms of the decrementals on that, I think you could roll it through roughly the same kind of math. But we target about 30% flow-through on the organic side.

And certainly, we're not guiding for the year, but I believe IHS has out in our fiscal period around 77 million units for the year, which will be flat year-over-year. .
In regard to pricing, pricing is very different by our end markets. When you say receptivity, I wouldn't say anybody likes pricing. So I wouldn't say people are saying, I'm happy about it. But I would say we're pulling to different levers, as he said. Some we can pull quicker in places where like we go through our channel partners, smaller customers in places like auto, it's more contractual agreements, and that's -- we're in the middle of those, and that will continue to be a recovery point throughout this year.

It -- the market and the growth -- we're benefiting overall from high-speed applications. So when you look at D&D overall, it is anywhere where you're having high-speed getting put in, and that can be anywhere in the network. Certainly, the bigger growth lever is with the cloud providers, and our position across those cloud providers, as I think I've mentioned in other calls, has really been pretty even as we gained share. And we aren't waited to one of the cloud providers globally versus another, but we are benefiting from their capital spending trends. And that capital spending trend is -- they're very much focused not only on speed. They're also focusing on how they continue to implement AI to make sure we're that. How do they get more specific compute and scaling computing power that also helps them get to their cost of total ownership, including their impact on energy usage down. 
And what we continue to see as they're making their investments, which are aligned with what you said, we're seeing them wanting to spend another 10% around the cloud and data center going into next year.

So Matt, let me take the part around what we see out in inventory in the world, and then we'll get to -- Heath will talk about our inventory. First off, in the channel partners, I would tell you our channel partner orders have accelerated over the past 3 quarters, but they have leveled out now. So similar to the other order comments I've made, we have seen leveling. We've been able to service more to them as our supply has improved. But we have not seen their inventory increase on our product set. So their turn levels have accelerated here, and they're touching product more to get it out because how quick they're turning it. So inventory levels in '21 have remained relatively flat, while they've had significant growth as they're trying to help the customers and their supply chain solutions to those. 
When it comes to our customers, we do see customers holding more inventory. Some customers have scheduled out further. But we also have customers that some areas are still very low in certain inventory pockets. So certainly, the supply chain is trying to get to a normalized, I would say, on both sides of the equation. You see it. And it's also what's happening in auto land. You need about 30,000 parts to make a car. If one of them isn't there in 1 plant, the car is not being made. So when we look at it, we're always going to have supply chain delays, whether it's building or coming down a little bit, but we do view that as noise. And it's back to the comments we said about content. We feel good about the 6% content growth over production next year, including any supply chain noise."

So as we work forward, there's no doubt that as we think about that ability to grow over 100 basis points from '19 to '20, restructuring played a meaningful part of that. But I would also tell you that some of the things that we were able to do around holding off in 2021, the price erosion through some of the actions that we undertook as well as the ability to offset some of the inflationary pressures with productivity were a meaningful part. And then volume goes a long way. As you know, this is a scale business and having volume means a lot.

A lot of those things are underway. Those charges have been taken, and we're working through those. What we're seeing more of now, Jim, is the impact of some of the more recent acquisitions. And when acquisitions come into our portfolio, inevitably, they come in at multiple sites. And in some cases, we do need to go and collapse those into our existing footprint or in some cases, they avail opportunities to take legacy TE locations and move into the acquired sites. So some of the things that we're now seeing, whether that's with ERNI or with some of the sensors activities that we acquired here in the last few years, is driving some of those restructuring efforts and plays into the overall return and valuation considerations for the acquisitions that we do in terms of the return and value creation opportunities.

So I do think any of us that are larger will benefit during this time. So that is something, I think, is a benefit for the larger companies in our space. When you talk about those 2 areas. Medical and we haven't talked about for the past couple of years due to the impact that we did have on procedures. But when you look at how procedures are increasing. The innovation that we've been doing with our customers has not slowed down during this time, but certainly, the levels of procedures went way down due to the COVID dynamics. 
So I do think you'll see us talking more about medical again from a growth perspective, more like we've had historically than you've experienced in the past couple of years. In comm air, it's a little bit different. I think medical had a temporary pause due to procedures. Comm air is one that has been hit hard. It's been hit hard. Certainly, you're starting to see some discussion around single-aisle aircraft. You get into dual-aisle aircraft. Dual-aisle aircraft is probably further away. And in those cases, I'm not sure you're going to have as much new innovation happening, even though we do have wins on what's happening in space, certainly lower satellites as well as we're also working with some of the newer EV OTL providers depending upon what ramp that does. So I think net-net, certainly a much more bullish tone around medical, I think comm air because that's how it really got hit as the overall market and our customers also got disorientated that they had to reposition really is one that's going to be a little bit longer out. Actually, we have a very good position there, certainly a leading position, but I'm not sure we're going to need a little bit of time for that to work out on what the growth trajectory is longer term, based upon what our customers do."

And if you take the real element, we were double digits of content outperformance. A very strong 50% increase in EV, certainly continued growth and even traditional cars, ice engines. We saw content growth. Price was only a little bit. So net-net, I would just ask you maybe to look at your math, it wasn't 20% by any means. And once again, that content momentum, we're around the mid-70s. We've shared with you our path to get to mid-80s [indiscernible] of having the trends around powertrain, trends around data connectivity, certainly traditional safety features. We feel very good about where we're positioned and also how well we're positioned globally with every OEM.

I just wanted to come back to the question around orders. And specifically, within the automotive segment. And I guess what I'm trying to think through, if I look at 2021, how much of a benefit there was from kind of unusual order activity from OEM customers. Just so that we can think about that going forward. I know you're talking about 6 points of outgrowth, excluding that. But I just wanted if you could size that. And then on the EV side, I know you've talked about $128 of content per vehicle for beds on average. But given the growth that you're seeing, do you see -- and some of the wins that you've had, which I think have exceeded $120 of content. Do you see an opportunity for that to maybe increase faster over time and maybe even be higher than that $120 million?"

When you look at production next year, the 6% that we said is content above production, we said includes any supply chain noise. So you said excluded -- my comments said it include any on that noise that we have on supply chain that we have every year. In regard to content, the comments that I made earlier about the 2x, we are running 2x, that would be both on all-electric vehicles, including hybrids. And I think that penetration is continually going to play out. I think the one thing that's important. Certainly, we share things around vehicle content that are very specific models. But you also have to remember, there's also the models that are more mainline traditional average median-income-type cars that are in that content as well. So net-net, I like where we're gaining our share, continue the traction we have on content. And if electric vehicles go faster, and we win more programs, we can maybe be above that. But right now, we expect next year, we'll be at that 6%, high end of the range."
