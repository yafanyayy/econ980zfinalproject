I would like to open by saying that in this COVID environment, the company continues to conduct business effectively and our operations are running efficiently. 
In the fourth quarter, net income was $204 million or $1.93 per share compared to $187 million or $1.69 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $184 million or $1.74 per share, a per share increase of 2% from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity was 9.5% and book value per share was $83.19. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 13.5%, and book value per share grew 10% to $53.12. 
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 7% to $678 million. As noted before, we have seen improved persistency and premium collections since the onset of the crisis. Life underwriting margin was $164 million, down 8% from a year ago. The decline in margin is due primarily to approximately $27 million of COVID claims. 
In 2021, we expect both live premium revenue and underwriting margins grow 6% to 7%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we anticipate approximately $52 million of COVID claims. 
Health insurance premium grew 5% to $290 million, and health underwriting margin was up 18% to $72 million. The increase in underwriting margin was primarily due to improved persistency and lower acquisition expenses. In 2021, we expect both health premium revenue and underwriting margin to grow around 6%. 
Administrative expenses were $63 million for the quarter, up 3% from a year ago. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.5% compared to 6.7% a year ago. In 2021, we expect administrative expenses to grow 7% to 8% and be around 6.7% of premium, due primarily to higher pension costs, higher IT and information security costs, and a gradual increase in travel and facilities costs. 
I will now turn the call over to Larry for his comments on the fourth quarter marketing operations."

I am optimistic as I look ahead, I believe we will emerge from the pandemic stronger than before as a result of the adjustments we have made during the crisis. We now have more ways to generate sales and recruiting activity. The ability to recruit agents and sell to customers, both virtually and in-person in the future, will enhance our ability to generate sales growth. 
Looking back at fourth quarter, we were pleased with the results as we continue to see strong growth in sales and agent count. I will now discuss trends at each distribution channel. 
At American Income, life premiums were up 10% to $327 million, and life underwriting margin was up 7% to $105 million. Net life sales were $71 million, up 20%. The increase in net life sales is primarily due to increased agent count. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 9,642, up 26% from the year ago quarter and up 4% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the fourth quarter was 9,664. We continue to see significant recruiting opportunity due to current economic conditions and our ability to recruit both virtually and in person. 
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 3% to $74 million, while life underwriting margin was down 26% to $14 million. The lower underwriting margin is primarily due to COVID claims. Net life sales increased 24% to $18 million, while net health sales were $7 million down 1% from the year ago quarter. The increase in net life sales is due to increased agent count, continued adoption of virtual sales methods, and increased ability to conduct worksite sales activities. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 2,705, up 7% from the year ago quarter and up 6% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,770. We are encouraged by Liberty National's continued growth and ability to adapt to the current environment. 
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $82 million, and health underwriting margin increased 17% to $22 million. The increase in underwriting margin is primarily due to improved persistency and lower acquisition expenses. Net health sales were up 17% to $21 million. The increase in net health sales is primarily due to increased agent count. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,452, up 18% from the year ago quarter and up 6% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,463.  Family Heritage continues to generate recruiting and sales momentum. 
In our Direct-to-Consumer Division at Globe Life, life premiums were up 7% to $224 million, while life underwriting margin declined 42% to $23 million. Frank will further discuss the decline in underwriting margin in his comments. Net life sales were $39 million, up 32% from the year ago quarter. We continued to see strong consumer demand in basic life insurance protection across all channels of the direct-to-consumer distribution. 
United American General Agency, health premiums increased 7% to $116 million, and health underwriting margin increased 21% to $19 million. The increase in underwriting margin is primarily due to increased premium and improved persistency. Net health sales were $22 million, down 30% compared to the year ago quarter. It is always difficult to predict United American sales as the Medicare supplement marketplace is highly competitive. 
Although it's difficult to predict sales activity in this environment, I will now provide projections based on knowledge of our business and current trends. 
We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2021 to be in the following ranges. American Income, 3% to 14% growth. Liberty National, 1% to 16% growth. Family heritage, 1% to 9% growth. 
Net life sales trends are expected to be as follows: American Income life for the full year 2021, an increase of 9% to an increase of 13%. Liberty National for the full year 2021, an increase of 7% to an increase of 11%. And Direct-to-Consumer for the full year 2021, a decrease of 5% to an increase of 5%. 
Net held sales trends are expected to be as follows: Liberty National for the full year 2021, an increase of 7% to an increase of 11%. Family Heritage for the full year 2021, an increase of 5% to an increase of 9%. United American Individual Medicare supplement for the full year 2021, a decrease of 3% to an increase of 7%. 
 I will now turn the call back to Gary."

Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income, thus required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $61 million, a 2% decrease over the year ago quarter.

Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income, thus required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $61 million, a 2% decrease over the year ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 2%. For the year, excess investment income in dollars declined 5% and on a per share basis was down 1%. In 2021, we expect excess investment income to be flat, but up 1% to 3% on a per share basis. 
In the fourth quarter, we invested $359 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the municipal and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 3.54%, an average rating of A and an average life of 26 years. While we continue to invest primarily in fixed maturities, 17% of our total investment acquisitions in 2020 were in other long-term investments, primarily limited partnerships investing in credit instruments. These investments are expected to generate incremental additional yield, while still being in line with our conservative investment philosophy. 
For the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.29%, down 12 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019. And as of December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.28%. 
Invested assets were $18.4 billion, including $17.2 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $16.4 billion are investment-grade with an average rating of A minus and below investment-grade bonds are $841 million compared to $840 million at September 30. The percentage of below-investment-grade bonds of fixed maturities is 4.9%. Excluding net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio, the low investment-grade bonds as a percentage of equity is 15%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A minus,  same as a year ago. 
Bonds rated BBB are 55% of the fixed maturity portfolio, the same as at the end of 2019. While this ratio is in line with the overall bond market, it is high relative to our peers. However, we have little or no exposure to higher risk assets such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgages, CLOs and other asset-backed securities. 
Because we invest long, a key criteria utilized in our investment process is that an issuer must have ability to survive multiple cycles. We believe that the BBB securities that we acquire provide the best risk-adjusted and capital-adjusted returns due in large part to our unique ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets. 
Finally, the lower interest rates continue to pressure investment income. For 2021, at the midpoint of our guidance, we assume an average yield rate on new fixed maturity investments of around 3.55%. While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, Globe Life can thrive in a lower for longer interest rate environment. Extended low interest rates will not impact the GAAP our statutory balance sheets under the current accounting rules since we sell non-interested protection products. Fortunately, the impact of lower new money rates on our investment income is somewhat limited as we expect to have an average turnover of less than 2% per year in our investment portfolio over the next 5 years. 
Now I will turn the call over to Frank for his comments on capital and liquidity."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $45 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent company gener",1213,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $45 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent company generated excess cash flows in 2020 of $388 million, compared to $374 million in 2019. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Globe Life shareholders. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we had $433 million of excess cash flow available to the parent during the year. 
In the fourth quarter, the parent -- the company purchased 1.4 million shares of Gold Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $123 million with an average share price of $88.55. For the full year, we spent $380 million of parent company cash to acquire 4.5 million shares at an average share price of $85.24. 
As noted on our last call, the parent ended the third quarter with $435 million in liquid assets. As just noted, the parent used $123 million of cash for share repurchases in the fourth quarter. In addition, the parent reduced its commercial paper holdings by $25 million during the quarter. The parent ended the fourth quarter with liquid assets of approximately $290 million. 
Looking forward, the parent will continue to generate excess cash flow in 2021. While their 2020 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect our excess cash flow in 2021 to be in the range of $330 million to $360 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at January 1, we currently expect to have around $620 million to $650 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent in 2021. As I'll discuss in more detail in just a few moments, this amount is more than necessary to support the targeted capital levels within our insurance operations and maintain the share repurchase program. 
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. We currently believe share repurchases provide the best return to our shareholders versus other available alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of the parent's excess cash flows. It should be noted that the cash received by the parent company from our insurance operations is after they have made substantial investments during the year to issue new insurance policies, to expand our information technology and other operational capabilities as well as to acquire new long-duration assets to fund future cash needs. 
Now capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain our capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. As noted on previous calls, Globe Life has targeted a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320% for 2020. Although we have not finalized our 2020 statutory financial statements, we anticipate that our consolidated RBC ratio for 2020 will be at the midpoint of this range, reflecting additional capital contributions of $20 million to $30 million. For 2021, we intend to maintain the same targeted RBC range. 
As discussed on previous calls, a primary driver of potential future capital needs from the parent is the adverse capital effect during this economic downturn from either downgrades that increase required capital or investment credit losses that reduce statutory income and thus, total capital. To estimate the potential impact on capital due to changes in our investment portfolio, we continue to model several scenarios that take into account consensus views on the economic impact of the recession, the strength and timing of the eventual recovery and a bottoms-up application of such views on the particular holdings in our portfolio as well as other stress tests. We now estimate that our insurance companies will require $35 million to $140 million of additional capital over the course of this credit event to maintain the minimum 300% RBC ratio of our stated target range. This amount is lower than our previous estimate. 
In our base case, we expect less than $20 million in after-tax credit losses and approximately $700 million of additional downgrades over the next 12 to 18 months. In our worst-case scenario, we increased the expected downgrades to approximately $2 billion over that same time period. 
Regardless of whether the need is $35 million or $140 million of capital or something in between, the parent company has ample liquidity to cover the amount required. It is important to note that Globe Life statutory reserves are not negatively impacted by the low interest rates or the equity markets given our basic fixed protection products. Furthermore, the current interest rates do not have any impact on our statutory reserves, given the strong underwriting margin in our products. In the aggregate, our statutory reserves are more than adequate under all cash flow testing scenarios. 
As noted by Gary, total life underwriting margins declined by 8% during the quarter. These lower margins were primarily due to an estimated $27 million of COVID-related policy obligations incurred in the quarter, $11 million more than we had anticipated on our last call due to 65,000 more COVID deaths across the U.S. in the fourth quarter than projected. 
During the quarter, Direct-to-Consumer incurred an additional $13 million in COVID claims and Liberty National incurred an additional $6 million. Absent these additional losses Direct to Consumers' underwriting margin would have been 16% of premium for the quarter. In the Liberty National distribution, absent the estimated policy obligations due to COVID, their underwriting margin would have been 27% of premium for the quarter. 
For the full year 2020, a our total incurred COVID policy obligations across our life operations were approximately $67 million. Absent these additional losses, our total life underwriting margin would have been slightly below 28% of premium comparable to 2019. 
With respect to our health operations, total health claims were approximately $7 million lower than what we expected at the beginning of the year due to COVID. 
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2021. We are projecting net operating income per share will be in the range of $7.16 and to $7.56 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $7.36 midpoint is lower than the midpoint of our previous guidance of $7.55, primarily due to higher anticipated COVID death benefits. On our last call, our midpoint included an estimate of $32 million in COVID Life claims relating to approximately 160,000 U.S. deaths. The midpoint of our guidance now estimates approximately $52 million of COVID life claims on projections of around 270,000 U.S. deaths. The vast majority of which are expected to occur in the first quarter of 2021. 
We continue to estimate that we will incur COVID life claims of roughly $2 million for every 10,000 U.S. deaths. Obviously, the amount of death benefits paid due to COVID-19 in 2021 will depend on many factors, including the effectiveness of the various vaccines and the speed at which the highest risk segments of our population get vaccinated. The larger-than-normal range for our guidance reflects this additional uncertainty. 
Those are my comments. I'll now turn the call back to Larry."

I would like to open by saying that in this COVID environment, the company continues to conduct business effectively and our operations are running efficiently.
In the fourth quarter, net income was $204 million or $1.93 per share compared to $187 million or $1.69 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $184 million or $1.74 per share, a per share increase of 2% from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity was 9.5% and book value per share was $83.19. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 13.5%, and book value per share grew 10% to $53.12. 
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 7% to $678 million. As noted before, we have seen improved persistency and premium collections since the onset of the crisis. Life underwriting margin was $164 million, down 8% from a year ago. The decline in margin is due primarily to approximately $27 million of COVID claims.
In 2021, we expect both life premium revenue and underwriting margin to grow 6% to 7%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we anticipate approximately $52 million of COVID claims. 
Health insurance premium grew 5% to $290 million, and health underwriting margin was up 18% to $72 million. The increase in underwriting margin was primarily due to improved persistency and lower acquisition expenses. In 2021, we expect both health premium revenue and underwriting margin to grow around 6%.
Administrative expenses were $63 million for the quarter, up 3% from a year ago. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.5% compared to 6.7% a year ago. In 2021, we expect administrative expenses to grow 7% to 8% and be around 6.7% of premium, due primarily to higher pension cost, higher IT and information security cost and a gradual increase in travel and facilities cost.

I am optimistic as I look ahead, I believe we will emerge from the pandemic stronger than before as a result of the adjustments we have made during the crisis. We now have more ways to generate sales and recruiting activity, the ability to recruit agents and sell to customers, both virtually and in-person in the future, will enhance our ability to generate sales growth.
Looking back at fourth quarter, we were pleased with the results as we continue to see strong growth in sales and agent count. I will now discuss trends at each distribution channel. 
At American Income, life premiums were up 10% to $327 million, and life underwriting margin was up 7% to $105 million. Net life sales were $71 million, up 20%. The increase in net life sales is primarily due to increased agent count. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 9,642, up 26% from the year ago quarter and up 4% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the fourth quarter was 9,664. We continue to see significant recruiting opportunity due to current economic conditions and our ability to recruit both virtually and in person.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 3% to $74 million, while life underwriting margin was down 26% to $14 million. The lower underwriting margin is primarily due to COVID claims. Net life sales increased 24% to $18 million, while net health sales were $7 million down 1% from the year ago quarter. The increase in net life sales is due to increased agent count, continued adoption of virtual sales methods and increased ability to conduct worksite sales activities. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 2,705, up 7% from the year ago quarter and up 6% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,770. We are encouraged by Liberty National's continued growth and ability to adapt to the current environment. 
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $82 million, and health underwriting margin increased 17% to $22 million. The increase in underwriting margin is primarily due to improved persistency and lower acquisition expenses. Net health sales were up 17% to $21 million. The increase in net health sales is primarily due to increased agent count. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,452, up 18% from the year ago quarter and up 6% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,463. Family Heritage continues to generate recruiting and sales momentum.
In our direct-to-consumer division at Globe Life, life premiums were up 7% to $224 million, while life underwriting margin declined 42% to $23 million. Frank will further discuss the decline in underwriting margin in his comments. Net life sales were $39 million, up 32% from the year ago quarter. We continued to see strong consumer demand in basic life insurance protection across all channels of the direct-to-consumer distribution.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 7% to $116 million, and health underwriting margin increased 21% to $19 million. The increase in underwriting margin is primarily due to increased premium and improved persistency. Net health sales were $22 million, down 30% compared to the year ago quarter. It is always difficult to predict United American sales as the Medicare supplement marketplace is highly competitive. 
Although it's difficult to predict sales activity in this environment, I will now provide projections based on knowledge of our business and current trends. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2021 to be in the following ranges. American Income, 3% to 14% growth; Liberty National, 1% to 16% growth; Family Heritage, 1% to 9% growth.
Net life sales trends are expected to be as follows: American Income life for the full year 2021, an increase of 9% to an increase of 13%; Liberty National for the full year 2021, an increase of 7% to an increase of 11%; direct-to-consumer for the full year 2021, a decrease of 5% to an increase of 5%. 
Net health sales trends are expected to be as follows: Liberty National for the full year 2021, an increase of 7% to an increase of 11%; Family Heritage for the full year 2021, an increase of 5% to an increase of 9%; United American Individual Medicare supplement for the full year 2021, a decrease of 3% to an increase of 7%.
I will now turn the call back to Gary."

Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income, less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $61 million, a 2% decrease over the year ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 2%. For the year, excess investment income in dollars declined 5% and on a per share basis was down 1%. In 2021, we expect excess investment income to be flat, but up 1% to 3% on a per share basis. 
In the fourth quarter, we invested $359 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the municipal and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 3.54%, an average rating of A and an average life of 26 years. While we continue to invest primarily in fixed maturities, 17% of our total investment acquisitions in 2020 were in other long-term investments, primarily limited partnerships investing in credit instruments. These investments are expected to generate incremental additional yield, while still being in line with our conservative investment philosophy.
For the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.29%, down 12 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019. And as of December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.28%. 
Invested assets were $18.4 billion, including $17.2 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $16.4 billion are investment-grade with an average rating of A minus and below investment-grade bonds are $841 million compared to $840 million at September 30. 
The percentage of below investment-grade bonds of fixed maturities is 4.9%. Excluding net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio, the low investment-grade bonds as a percentage of equity is 15%. 
Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-,  same as a year ago. Bonds rated BBB are 55% of the fixed maturity portfolio, the same as at the end of 2019. While this ratio is in line with the overall bond market, it is high relative to our peers. However, we have little or no exposure to higher risk assets such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgages, CLOs and other asset-backed securities. 
Because we invest long, a key criteria utilized in our investment process is that an issuer must have ability to survive multiple cycles. We believe that the BBB securities that we acquire provide the best risk-adjusted and capital-adjusted returns and due in large part to our unique ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets. 
Finally, the lower interest rates continue to pressure investment income. For 2021, at the midpoint of our guidance, we assume an average yield rate on new fixed maturity investments of around 3.55%. While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, Globe Life can thrive in a lower to longer interest rate environment. Extended low interest rates will not impact the GAAP our statutory balance sheets under the current accounting rules since we sell non-interested protection products. Fortunately, the impact of lower new money rates on our investment income is somewhat limited as we expect to have an average turnover of less than 2% per year in our investment portfolio over the next 5 years.
Now I will turn the call over to Frank for his comments on capital and liquidity."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $45 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent company gener",1213,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $45 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent company generated excess cash flows in 2020 of $388 million compared to $374 million in 2019. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Globe Life shareholders. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we had $433 million of excess cash flow available to the parent during the year.
In the fourth quarter, the parent -- the company purchased 1.4 million shares of Global Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $123 million with an average share price of $88.55. For the full year, we spent $380 million of parent company cash to acquire 4.5 million shares at an average share price of $85.24. 
As noted on our last call, the parent ended the third quarter with $435 million in liquid assets. As just noted, the parent used $123 million of cash for share repurchases in the fourth quarter. In addition, the parent reduced its commercial paper holdings by $25 million during the quarter. The parent ended the fourth quarter with liquid assets of approximately $290 million. 
Looking forward, the parent will continue to generate excess cash flow in 2021. While their 2020 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect our excess cash flow in 2021 to be in the range of $330 million to $360 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at January 1, we currently expect to have around $620 million to $650 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent in 2021. As I'll discuss in more detail in just a few moments, this amount is more than necessary to support the targeted capital levels within our insurance operations and maintain the share repurchase program. 
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. We currently believe share repurchases provide the best return to our shareholders versus other available alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of the parent's excess cash flows. It should be noted that the cash received by the parent company from our insurance operations is after they have made substantial investments during the year to issue new insurance policies, to expand our information technology and other operational capabilities as well as to acquire new long-duration assets to fund future cash needs.
Now capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain our capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. As noted on previous calls, Globe Life has targeted a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320% for 2020. Although we have not finalized our 2020 statutory financial statements, we anticipate that our consolidated RBC ratio for 2020 will be at the midpoint of this range, reflecting additional capital contributions of $20 million to $30 million. For 2021, we intend to maintain the same targeted RBC range.
As discussed on previous calls, a primary driver of potential future capital needs from the parent is the adverse capital effect during this economic downturn from either downgrades that increase required capital or investment credit losses that reduce statutory income and thus, total capital. 
To estimate the potential impact on capital due to changes in our investment portfolio, we continue to model several scenarios that take into account consensus views on the economic impact of the recession, the strength and timing of the eventual recovery and a bottoms-up application of such views on the particular holdings in our portfolio as well as other stress tests. 
We now estimate that our insurance companies will require $35 million to $140 million of additional capital over the course of this credit event to maintain the minimum 300% RBC ratio of our stated target range. This amount is lower than our previous estimate. 
In our base case, we expect less than $20 million in after-tax credit losses and approximately $700 million of additional downgrades over the next 12 to 18 months. In our worst-case scenario, we increased the expected downgrades to approximately $2 billion over that same time period. 
Regardless of whether the need is $35 million or $140 million of capital or something in between, the parent company has ample liquidity to cover the amount required. It is important to note that Globe Life statutory reserves are not negatively impacted by the low interest rates or the equity markets given our basic fixed protection products. Furthermore, the current interest rates do not have any impact on our statutory reserves, given the strong underwriting margin in our products. In the aggregate, our statutory reserves are more than adequate under all cash flow testing scenarios.
As noted by Gary, total life underwriting margins declined by 8% during the quarter. These lower margins were primarily due to an estimated $27 million of COVID-related policy obligations incurred in the quarter, $11 million more than we had anticipated on our last call due to 65,000 more COVID deaths across the U.S. in the fourth quarter than projected. 
During the quarter, direct-to-consumer incurred an additional $13 million in COVID claims and Liberty National incurred an additional $6 million. Absent these additional losses Direct to Consumers' underwriting margin would have been 16% of premium for the quarter. In the Liberty National distribution, absent the estimated policy obligations due to COVID, their underwriting margin would have been 27% of premium for the quarter. 
For the full year 2020, a our total incurred COVID policy obligations across our life operations were approximately $67 million. Absent these additional losses, our total life underwriting margin would have been slightly below 28% of premium comparable to 2019. 
With respect to our health operations, total health claims were approximately $7 million lower than what we expected at the beginning of the year due to COVID. 
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2021. We are projecting net operating income per share will be in the range of $7.16 and to $7.56 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $7.36 midpoint is lower than the midpoint of our previous guidance of $7.55, primarily due to higher anticipated COVID death benefits. 
On our last call, our midpoint included an estimate of $32 million in COVID life claims relating to approximately 160,000 U.S. deaths. The midpoint of our guidance now estimates approximately $52 million of COVID life claims on projections of around 270,000 U.S. deaths, the vast majority of which are expected to occur in the first quarter of 2021.
We continue to estimate that we will incur COVID life claims of roughly $2 million for every 10,000 U.S. deaths. Obviously, the amount of death benefits paid due to COVID-19 in 2021 will depend on many factors, including the effectiveness of the various vaccines and the speed at which the highest risk segments of our population get vaccinated. The larger-than-normal range for our guidance reflects this additional uncertainty.
Those are my comments. I'll now turn the call back to Larry."

In the first quarter, net income was $179 million or $1.70 per share compared to $166 million or $1.52 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $160 million or $1.53 per share, a decrease of 12% per share from a year ago. 
On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of March 31 was 8.6% and book value per share was $75.10. Excluding unrealized gains and fixed maturities, return on equity was 11.4% and book value per share was up 9% to $54.36. In the Life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 9% to $708 million. As we've noted before, we have seen improved persistency and premium collections since the onset of the pandemic. Life underwriting margin was $137 million, down 24% from a year ago. The decline in margin is due primarily to $38 million of COVID-related claims. 
For the year, we expect Life premium revenue to grow around 7% and underwriting margin to growing 4% to 6%. And at the midpoint of our 2021 guidance, we have spend approximately $50 million of COVID claims. In health insurance, premium revenue grew 5% to $294 million, and health underwriting margin was up 14% to $72 million. The increase in underwriting margins was primarily due to improved persistency and lower acquisition expenses. For the year, we expect health premium revenue to grow 5% -- to 6% and underwriting margin to grow 7% to 8%. 
Before continuing, I'm pleased to note that this is the first quarter in company history with total premium revenue exceeded $1 billion. We appreciate the efforts of our agents and our employees in achieving this milestone. Continuing the first quarter results, administrative expenses were $66 million for the quarter, up 4% from a year ago. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.6% compared to 6.8% a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to grow 7% to 8% and be around 6.7% of premium, due primarily to higher pension costs, IT and information security costs as well as a gradual increase in travel and facilities costs.

We experienced strong growth in life sales during the first quarter, and we continue to make progress in the areas that drive recruiting and sales activity. I will now discuss current trends at each distribution channel. At American Income Life, life premiums were up 11% to $335 million, while life underwriting margin was down 2% at $98 million. The lower underwriting margin is primarily due to COVID claims. Net life sales were $70 million, up 11%. The increase in net life sales is primarily due to increased agent count. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 9,918 up 30% from the year ago quarter and up 3% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 10,329. The American income agency has adapted exceptionally well to the virtual environment and continues to generate positive momentum. At Liberty National, life premiums were up 4% to $76 million, while life underwriting margin was down 48% to $10 million. The lower underwriting margin is primarily due to COVID claims. Net life sales grew 30% to $16 million, while net health sales were $6 million, down 2% from the year ago quarter. 
The increase in net life sales is due to an increased agent count and improved agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 2,734 and up 3% from the year ago quarter and up 1% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,727. We are encouraged by Liberty National's continued growth. 
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $83 million, and health underwriting margin grew 12% to $22 million. The increase in underwriting margin is primarily due to improved persistency and lower acquisition expense. Net health sales declined 4% to $16 million due primarily to a decline in agent productivity during the first quarter. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 1,285, up 5% from the year ago quarter, while down 12% from the fourth quarter. The agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,235. The drop in average agent count for the fourth quarter is not unusual. As familiarities typically sees the decline in recruiting activity in the first quarter of the year, we have seen an increase in recruiting activity and productivity over the last several weeks and expect this will continue going forward. 
In our direct-to-consumer division of Global Life, life premiums were up 11% to $244 million. Our life underwriting margin declined 78% to $9 million. Frank will further discuss the decline in underwriting margin in his comments. Net life sales were $40 million, up 22% from the year ago quarter. 
We continue to see strong consumer demand for basic life insurance protection across all channels of the direct-to-consumer distribution in the first quarter. At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 6% to $117 million, and health underwriting margin increased 19% to $19 million, the increase in underwriting margin is primarily due to improved persistency and lower acquisition expenses. Net health sales were $13 million, down 11% compared to the year ago quarter. It is always difficult to predict United American sales as the Medicare Supplement marketplace is highly competitive. 
It's still difficult to predict future activity in this uncertain environment. I will now provide projections based on trends we are seeing and knowledge of our business. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2021 to be in the following ranges: American income, 7% to 17% growth; Liberty National 1% to 16% growth, Family Heritage 1% to 9% growth. Net life sales for the full year 2021 are expected to be as follows: American Income Life, an increase of 11% to 15%; Liberty National, an increase of 16% to 20%; direct-to-consumer, a decrease of 5% to an increase of 5%. The net health sales for the full year 2021 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, an increase of 16% to 20%; Family Heritage, an increase of 4% to 8%; and United American Individual Medicare Supplement, a decrease of 3% to an increase of 7%. 
I will now turn the call back to Gary."

Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $61 million, a 3% decline over the year ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income grew 2%. For the full year, we expect excess investment income to be flat, but up 2% to 3% on a per share basis. As to investment yield, in the first quarter, we invested $299 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 3.41%, an average rating of A minus and an average life of 34 years. We also invested $61 million in limited partnerships that invest in credit instruments. While these investments are expected to produce incremental additional yield, they are in line with our conservative investment philosophy. 
For the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.24%, down 15 basis points from the first quarter of 2020. The portfolio yield as of March 31 was also 5.24%. Invested assets were $18.7 billion, including $17.4 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $16.6 billion are investment-grade with an average rating of A minus and below investment-grade bonds are $802 million compared to $841 million at year-end 2020. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds of fixed maturities is 4.6%, excluding net unrealized gains in fixed maturity portfolio below investment-grade bonds as a percentage of equity is 14%. 
Overall, the total portfolio is rated A minus compared to BBB plus a year ago. Bonds rated BBB are 56% of the fixed maturity portfolio compared to 55% at the end of 2020. While this ratio is in line with the overall volume market, it is high relative to our peers. However, we have little or no exposure to higher risk assets such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgage, CLOs and other asset backed securities. Because we invest long, a key criteria utilized in our investment process is that an issuer is has the ability to survive multiple cycles. We believe that the BBB securities we acquired provide the best risk-adjusted and capital adjusted returns due in large part to our ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets. 
Lower interest rates continued to pressure investment income. For 2021, the average fixed maturity new money yield assumed at the midpoint of our guidance is 3.6% for the full year. While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, Globe Life can drive in a lower for longer interest rate environment. In [indiscernible] rates will not impact the GAAP or statutory balance sheets under the current accounting rules, since we sell non inter assisted protection products. Unfortunately, the impact of lower new volume price on our investment income is somewhat limited as we expect to have an average turnover of less than 2% per year in our pet portfolio over the next 5 years. 
Now I will turn the call over to Frank for his comments on capital and liquidity."
308916,711222880,2255495,"Globe Life Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $290 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent company will",1570,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $290 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent company will generate excess cash flows in 2021. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Globe Life's shareholders. We anticipate our excess cash flow in 2021 will be in the range of $360 million to $370 million, higher than previously indicated and reflective of our final 2020 distributable statutory earnings. 
Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $650 million to $660 million of assets available to the parent during the year. In the first quarter, the parent company repurchased 944,000 shares of Globe Life Inc's. common stock at a total cost of $90 million at an average share price of $95.47. So far in April, we had spent $13 million to repurchase 132,000 shares at an average price of $99.18. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $103 million to purchase 1.1 million shares at an average price of $95.92. Excluding the $103 million spent on repurchases so far this year, we will have approximately $550 million to $560 million of assets available to the parent for the remainder of 2021. 
As I'll discuss in more detail in just a few moments, this amount is more than necessary to support the targeted capital levels within our insurance operations and maintain the share repurchase program. As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. We still believe share repurchases provide the best return to our shareholders over other available alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be the primary use of the parent's $360 million to $370 million of excess cash flows during the year. It should be noted that the cash received by the parent company from our insurance operations is after they have made substantial investments during the year to issue new insurance policies, expand our information technology and other operational capabilities as well as acquire new long duration assets to fund their future cash needs. 
Our goal is to maintain our capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. As noted on previous calls, Globe Life has a targeted consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. At December 31, 2020, and our consolidated RBC ratio was 309%. At this RBC ratio, our insurance subsidiaries have approximately $50 million of capital over the amount required at the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%. 
This excess capital, along with the $550 million to $560 million of liquid assets that we expect to be available at the parent, provide sufficient capital to fund future capital needs. As we discussed on previous calls, a primary driver of potential additional capital needs from the parent in 2021 relates to investment downgrades that increase required capital. To estimate the potential impact on capital due to changes in our investment portfolio, we continue to model several scenarios and stress tests. In our base case, we expect approximately $500 million of additional NAIC One notch downgrades over the course of the year. We do not anticipate any significant credit losses, although some credit losses would normally be expected from time to time. 
With this amount of downgrades, our insurance companies could require up to $70 million of capital to maintain the low end of our targeted RBC ratio of 300%. In addition to the potential capital needed from further investment portfolio downgrades, changes in the NAIC RBC factors related to investments, commonly referred to as C1 factors, could create the need for additional capital for 2021. At this time, we do not know what the final factors will be. However, we believe the worst-case scenario is that additional capital related to the new factors would not exceed $125 million to $150 million. It is important to note that Globe Life statutory reserves are not negatively impacted by the low interest rates or the equity markets, given our basic fixed protection products. In the aggregate, our statutory reserves are more than adequate under all cash flow testing scenarios. 
Bottom line is that the parent company has ample liquidity to cover any additional capital that may be required and still have cash available to make our normal level of share repurchases. Once we get -- once we are able to get comfortable that our investment downgrades have returned to normal levels, and we are able to determine the amount of additional capital required to support the new C1 factors, we will reevaluate our parent company retained assets. We will first determine the appropriate amount of liquid assets that should be retained at the parent. We'll then determine the best use of any excess amounts that remain. 
Depending on available alternatives, we would likely return such excess cash to our shareholders through additional share repurchases. At this time, we anticipate holding our higher level of liquid assets through the end of this year. At this time, I'd like to provide a few comments relating to the impact of COVID-19 on our first quarter results. As noted by Gary, total life underwriting margins declined in the quarter primarily due to an estimated $38 million of COVID debt claims incurred in the quarter. This amount was actually slightly less than we anticipated for the quarter. The total COVID death benefits include approximately $20 million in COVID debt benefits incurred in our direct-to-consumer division, or approximately 8% of its first quarter premium income, approximately $8 million of COVID debt benefits incurred at Liberty National, over 10.5% of its premium for the quarter. And approximately $9 million at American income or 2.7% of its first quarter premium. 
It is important to note that the total COVID benefits paid through March 31, only 71 claims comprising slightly over $600,000 related to policies sold since the beginning of March of 2020. This is a very small percent of the roughly 2 million policies sold in 2020. In addition to the COVID obligations occurred in the quarter, we also saw adverse developments in non-COVID claims relating to both medical and nonmedical causes of death, primarily those related to heart and other circular conditions, Alzheimer's and drug overdoses. This is a continuation of some adverse development that began to emerge last year. While not directly a COVID claim, we believe the elevated deaths are related to the pandemic due to the difficulties many individuals have had in receiving timely health care as well as the adverse effects of isolation and stress. 
Increases in non-COVID death since the start of the pandemic have also been noted by the CDD and the National Center for Health Statistics for the U.S. population as a whole. While we experienced higher obligations from non-COVID causes in each of our distributions, the impact of these higher non-COVID deaths has been more evident in our direct-to-consumer channel, whose insured more closely represent the broader middle-income U.S. population than our other distributions. 
In addition to COVID death, the adverse experience related to non-COVID death also contributed to the lower underwriting margin in the quarter. We anticipated a lower margin as a percent of premium, given the significant number of U.S. deaths expected in the quarter and since evidence of the higher non-COVID death had started to emerge last year. As with COVID, we currently believe this adverse claims experience will moderate over the remainder of the year and that the underwriting margin for the direct-to-consumer channel will be closer to 17% to 18% of premium in the second half of the year. 
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2021. While first quarter earnings were substantially lower than recent quarters due to higher COVID and non-COVID policy obligations. The first quarter operating earnings per share were very close to our expectations. Since we fully anticipated 200,000 COVID deaths in the quarter. We now believe we have seen the peak of COVID claims and anticipate a sharp drop off for the remainder of the year. As noted last quarter, at the midpoint of our guidance, we anticipated approximately 270,000 U.S. COVID deaths over the course of 2021. We still believe that is a reasonable estimate with substantially all of the remaining deaths occurring in the second quarter. As in prior quarters, we continue to estimate that we will incur COVID life claims of roughly $2 million for every 10,000 U.S. deaths. With respect to the higher obligations from non-COVID causes of death, we believe these will also revert to more normal levels over the course of the year as disruptions in health care cease, the economy recovers, and people are able to socialize again. As compared to our previous guidance, higher policy obligations from non-COVID causes are expected to be offset by favorable health claims experience, higher premium income and the favorable impact of share repurchases. As such, we are keeping the midpoint of our guidance for 2021 at $7.36, while narrowing the overall range to $7.21 to $7.51 for the year ended December 31, 2021.

From before the pandemic and what we're seeing in the last year, we're looking at -- are they trying to apply for higher face amounts, are we seeing changes in geographies where maybe there's been a little bit more incidence. And we're really monitoring that, and we're really seeing no distribution shift toward older adults. We're not seeing really any significant change by state groupings. And again, we're not seeing a shift to overall the higher face amounts. 
And then we've also done some limiting between both marketing as well as just in our underwriting, putting some limitations on the amount that they can -- older individuals can't purchase at American income, there's some limitations and some changes on some of the policy there for individuals over 60. So both through the underwriting and the marketing process, doing some things to try to limit our exposure there. And I think as we look at the actual experience, again, I mentioned in my notes that since -- for policies that have been issued since March 1, 2020, we've only seen 71 claims so far that have totaled about $600,000. 
And so that's -- and that's both inclusive of American Income and Liberty and all the different distributions. So it's a very small percentage of the overall policies. And of course, the additional -- the incremental those come in a very small incremental marketing costs.

We've already bought back $100 million. So you got about $270 million that's remaining for this year, then that's where we'll have to look. And that -- so that's really leaving about $230 million remaining out there for various capital needs. So we'll see what type of capital needs we have from C1 and how the downgrades progressed over the year. 
Now that's in excess, clearly where we north of what we think would have -- would be necessary. And so -- but depending on where that is, Tom, I think, depends upon if that's something that -- and how much clarity we have if we end up with a bigger chunk that we're able to return, it probably would come back over a period of time and tail clearly into 2022. I think we'd probably be trying to do it earlier than spread it out over the entire year. 
But I think we'd probably focus on returning it sometime early in 2022. It's a very end of 2021, depending on how much there is."

In the first quarter, net income was $179 million or $1.70 per share compared to $166 million or $1.52 per share a year ago. Net operating income for the quarter was $160 million or $1.53 per share, a decrease of 12% per share from a year ago. 
On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of March 31 was 8.6% and book value per share was $75.10. Excluding unrealized gains and fixed maturities, return on equity was 11.4% and book value per share was up 9% to $54.36. In the life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 9% to $708 million. As we've noted before, we have seen improved persistency and premium collections since the onset of the pandemic. Life underwriting margin was $137 million, down 24% from a year ago. The decline in margin is due primarily to $38 million of COVID-related claims. 
For the year, we expect life premium revenue to grow around 7% and underwriting margin to growing 4% to 6%. And at the midpoint of our 2021 guidance, we have spent approximately $50 million of COVID claims. In health insurance, premium revenue grew 5% to $294 million, and health underwriting margin was up 14% to $72 million. The increase in underwriting margins was primarily due to improved persistency and lower acquisition expenses. For the year, we expect health premium revenue to grow 5% to 6% and underwriting margin to grow 7% to 8%. 
Before continuing, I'm pleased to note that this is the first quarter in company history in which total premium revenue exceeded $1 billion. We appreciate the efforts of our agents and our employees in achieving this milestone. Continuing the first quarter results, administrative expenses were $66 million for the quarter, up 4% from a year ago. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.6% compared to 6.8% a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to grow 7% to 8% and be around 6.7% of premium, due primarily to higher pension costs, IT and information security costs as well as a gradual increase in travel and facilities costs.

We experienced strong growth in life sales during the first quarter, and we continue to make progress in the areas that drive recruiting and sales activity. I will now discuss current trends at each distribution channel. At American Income Life, life premiums were up 11% to $335 million, while life underwriting margin was down 2% at $98 million. The lower underwriting margin is primarily due to COVID claims. Net life sales were $70 million, up 11%. The increase in net life sales is primarily due to increased agent count. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 9,918, up 30% from the year ago quarter and up 3% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 10,329. The American income agency has adapted exceptionally well to the virtual environment and continues to generate positive momentum. At Liberty National, life premiums were up 4% to $76 million, while life underwriting margin was down 48% to $10 million. The lower underwriting margin is primarily due to COVID claims. Net life sales grew 30% to $16 million, while net health sales were $6 million, down 2% from the year ago quarter. 
The increase in net life sales is due to an increased agent count and improved agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 2,734, up 3% from the year ago quarter and up 1% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,727. We are encouraged by Liberty National's continued growth. 
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $83 million, and health underwriting margin grew 12% to $22 million. The increase in underwriting margin is primarily due to improved persistency and lower acquisition expense. Net health sales declined 4% to $16 million due primarily to a decline in agent productivity during the first quarter. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 1,285, up 5% from the year ago quarter, while down 12% from the fourth quarter. The agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,235. The drop in average agent count for the fourth quarter is not unusual. As familiarities typically sees the decline in recruiting activity in the first quarter of the year, we have seen an increase in recruiting activity and productivity over the last several weeks and expect this will continue going forward. 
In our direct-to-consumer division of Global Life, life premiums were up 11% to $244 million. Our life underwriting margin declined 78% to $9 million. Frank will further discuss the decline in underwriting margin in his comments. Net life sales were $40 million, up 22% from the year ago quarter. 
We continue to see strong consumer demand for basic life insurance protection across all channels of the direct-to-consumer distribution in the first quarter. At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 6% to $117 million, and health underwriting margin increased 19% to $19 million, the increase in underwriting margin is primarily due to improved persistency and lower acquisition expenses. Net health sales were $13 million, down 11% compared to the year ago quarter. It is always difficult to predict United American sales as the Medicare Supplement marketplace is highly competitive. 
It's still difficult to predict future activity in this uncertain environment. I will now provide projections based on trends we are seeing and knowledge of our business. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2021 to be in the following ranges: American income, 7% to 17% growth; Liberty National 1% to 16% growth, Family Heritage 1% to 9% growth. 
Net life sales for the full year 2021 are expected to be as follows: American Income Life, an increase of 11% to 15%; Liberty National, an increase of 16% to 20%; direct-to-consumer, a decrease of 5% to an increase of 5%. The net health sales for the full year 2021 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, an increase of 16% to 20%; Family Heritage, an increase of 4% to 8%; and United American Individual Medicare Supplement, a decrease of 3% to an increase of 7%. 
I will now turn the call back to Gary."

Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $61 million, a 3% decline over the year ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income grew 2%. For the full year, we expect excess investment income to be flat, but up 2% to 3% on a per share basis. As to investment yield, in the first quarter, we invested $299 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 3.41%, an average rating of A minus and an average life of 34 years. We also invested $61 million in limited partnerships that invest in credit instruments. While these investments are expected to produce incremental additional yield, they are in line with our conservative investment philosophy. 
For the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.24%, down 15 basis points from the first quarter of 2020. The portfolio yield as of March 31 was also 5.24%. Invested assets were $18.7 billion, including $17.4 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $16.6 billion are investment-grade with an average rating of A minus and below investment-grade bonds are $802 million compared to $841 million at year-end 2020. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds of fixed maturities is 4.6%, excluding net unrealized gains in fixed maturity portfolio below investment-grade bonds as a percentage of equity is 14%. 
Overall, the total portfolio is rated A minus compared to BBB plus a year ago. Bonds rated BBB are 56% of the fixed maturity portfolio compared to 55% at the end of 2020. While this ratio is in line with the overall bond market, it is high relative to our peers. However, we have little or no exposure to higher risk assets such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgage, CLOs and other asset backed securities. Because we invest long, a key criteria utilized in our investment process is that an issuer is has the ability to survive multiple cycles. We believe that the BBB securities we acquired provide the best risk-adjusted and capital adjusted returns due in large part to our ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets. 
Lower interest rates continued to pressure investment income. For 2021, the average fixed maturity new money yield assumed at the midpoint of our guidance is 3.6% for the full year. While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, Globe Life can drive in a lower for longer interest rate environment. In [indiscernible] rates will not impact the GAAP or statutory balance sheets under the current accounting rules, since we sell noninterest asset protection products. Unfortunately, the impact of lower new volume price on our investment income is somewhat limited as we expect to have an average turnover of less than 2% per year in our pet portfolio over the next 5 years. 
Now I will turn the call over to Frank for his comments on capital and liquidity."
308916,711222880,2255742,"Globe Life Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $290 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent company will",1569,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $290 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent company will generate excess cash flows in 2021. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Globe Life's shareholders. We anticipate our excess cash flow in 2021 will be in the range of $360 million to $370 million, higher than previously indicated and reflective of our final 2020 distributable statutory earnings. 
Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $650 million to $660 million of assets available to the parent during the year. In the first quarter, the parent company repurchased 944,000 shares of Globe Life Inc's. common stock at a total cost of $90 million at an average share price of $95.47. So far in April, we had spent $13 million to repurchase 132,000 shares at an average price of $99.18. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent $103 million to purchase 1.1 million shares at an average price of $95.92. Excluding the $103 million spent on repurchases so far this year, we will have approximately $550 million to $560 million of assets available to the parent for the remainder of 2021. 
As I'll discuss in more detail in just a few moments, this amount is more than necessary to support the targeted capital levels within our insurance operations and maintain the share repurchase program. As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. We still believe share repurchases provide the best return to our shareholders over other available alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be the primary use of the parent's $360 million to $370 million of excess cash flows during the year. It should be noted that the cash received by the parent company from our insurance operations is after they have made substantial investments during the year to issue new insurance policies, expand our information technology and other operational capabilities as well as acquire new long duration assets to fund their future cash needs. 
Our goal is to maintain our capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. As noted on previous calls, Globe Life has a targeted consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. At December 31, 2020, our consolidated RBC ratio was 309%. At this RBC ratio, our insurance subsidiaries have approximately $50 million of capital over the amount required at the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%. 
This excess capital, along with the $550 million to $560 million of liquid assets that we expect to be available at the parent, provide sufficient capital to fund future capital needs. As we discussed on previous calls, a primary driver of potential additional capital needs from the parent in 2021 relates to investment downgrades that increase required capital. To estimate the potential impact on capital due to changes in our investment portfolio, we continue to model several scenarios and stress tests. In our base case, we expect approximately $500 million of additional NAIC One notch downgrades over the course of the year. We do not anticipate any significant credit losses, although some credit losses would normally be expected from time to time. 
With this amount of downgrades, our insurance companies could require up to $70 million of capital to maintain the low end of our targeted RBC ratio of 300%. In addition to the potential capital needed from further investment portfolio downgrades, changes in the NAIC RBC factors related to investments, commonly referred to as C1 factors, could create the need for additional capital for 2021. At this time, we do not know what the final factors will be. However, we believe the worst-case scenario is that additional capital related to the new factors would not exceed $125 million to $150 million. It is important to note that Globe Life statutory reserves are not negatively impacted by the low interest rates or the equity markets, given our basic fixed protection products. In the aggregate, our statutory reserves are more than adequate under all cash flow testing scenarios. 
Bottom line is that the parent company has ample liquidity to cover any additional capital that may be required and still have cash available to make our normal level of share repurchases. Once we get -- once we are able to get comfortable that our investment downgrades have returned to normal levels, and we are able to determine the amount of additional capital required to support the new C1 factors, we will reevaluate our parent company retained assets. We will first determine the appropriate amount of liquid assets that should be retained at the parent. We'll then determine the best use of any excess amounts that remain. 
Depending on available alternatives, we would likely return such excess cash to our shareholders through additional share repurchases. At this time, we anticipate holding our higher level of liquid assets through the end of this year. At this time, I'd like to provide a few comments relating to the impact of COVID-19 on our first quarter results. As noted by Gary, total life underwriting margins declined in the quarter primarily due to an estimated $38 million of COVID death claims incurred in the quarter. This amount was actually slightly less than we anticipated for the quarter. The total COVID death benefits include approximately $20 million in COVID death benefits incurred in our direct-to-consumer division, or approximately 8% of its first quarter premium income, approximately $8 million of COVID death benefits incurred at Liberty National, over 10.5% of its premium for the quarter. And approximately $9 million at American income or 2.7% of its first quarter premium. 
It is important to note that the total COVID benefits paid through March 31, only 71 claims comprising slightly over $600,000 related to policies sold since the beginning of March of 2020. This is a very small percent of the roughly 2 million policies sold in 2020. In addition to the COVID obligations occurred in the quarter, we also saw adverse developments in non-COVID claims relating to both medical and nonmedical causes of death, primarily those related to heart and other circular conditions, Alzheimer's and drug overdoses. This is a continuation of some adverse development that began to emerge last year. While not directly a COVID claim, we believe the elevated deaths are related to the pandemic due to the difficulties many individuals have had in receiving timely health care as well as the adverse effects of isolation and stress. 
Increases in non-COVID death since the start of the pandemic have also been noted by the CDD and the National Center for Health Statistics for the U.S. population as a whole. While we experienced higher obligations from non-COVID causes in each of our distributions, the impact of these higher non-COVID deaths has been more evident in our direct-to-consumer channel, whose insured more closely represent the broader middle-income U.S. population than our other distributions. 
In addition to COVID death, the adverse experience related to non-COVID death also contributed to the lower underwriting margin in the quarter. We anticipated a lower margin as a percent of premium, given the significant number of U.S. deaths expected in the quarter and since evidence of the higher non-COVID death had started to emerge last year. As with COVID, we currently believe this adverse claims experience will moderate over the remainder of the year and that the underwriting margin for the direct-to-consumer channel will be closer to 17% to 18% of premium in the second half of the year. 
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2021. While first quarter earnings were substantially lower than recent quarters due to higher COVID and non-COVID policy obligations. The first quarter operating earnings per share were very close to our expectations. Since we fully anticipated 200,000 COVID deaths in the quarter. We now believe we have seen the peak of COVID claims and anticipate a sharp drop off for the remainder of the year. As noted last quarter, at the midpoint of our guidance, we anticipated approximately 270,000 U.S. COVID deaths over the course of 2021. We still believe that is a reasonable estimate with substantially all of the remaining deaths occurring in the second quarter. As in prior quarters, we continue to estimate that we will incur COVID life claims of roughly $2 million for every 10,000 U.S. deaths. With respect to the higher obligations from non-COVID causes of death, we believe these will also revert to more normal levels over the course of the year as disruptions in health care cease, the economy recovers, and people are able to socialize again. As compared to our previous guidance, higher policy obligations from non-COVID causes are expected to be offset by favorable health claims experience, higher premium income and the favorable impact of share repurchases. As such, we are keeping the midpoint of our guidance for 2021 at $7.36, while narrowing the overall range to $7.21 to $7.51 for the year ended December 31, 2021.

And we're really monitoring that, and we're really seeing no distribution shift toward older adults. We're not seeing really any significant change by state groupings. And again, we're not seeing a shift to overall the higher fake amounts. 
And then we've also done some limiting between both marketing as well as just in our underwriting, putting some limitations on the amount that they can -- older individuals can't purchase at American income, there's some limitations and some changes on some of the policy there for individuals over 60. So both through the underwriting and the marketing process, doing some things to try to limit our exposure there. And I think as we look at the actual experience, again, I mentioned in my notes that since -- for policies that have been issued since March 1, 2020, we've only seen 71 claims so far that have totaled about $600,000. 
And so that's -- and that's both inclusive of American Income and Liberty and all the different distributions. So it's a very small percentage of the overall policies. And of course, the additional -- the incremental -- those come in a very small incremental marketing costs.

As noted we have seen improved persistency and premium collections since the onset of the pandemic. Life underwriting margin was $179 million, up 11% from a year ago. The increase in margin is due primarily to the higher premium and lower amortization related to the improved persistency.

In health insurance, premium revenue grew 4% to $296 million, and health underwriting margin was up 16% to $74 million. The increase in underwriting margin was primarily due to improved claims experience and persistency. For the year, we expect health premium revenue to grow between 4% and 5% and underwriting margin to grow around 9%. Administrative expenses were $68 million for the quarter, up 10% from a year ago. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.6% compared to 6.5% a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to grow 8% to 9% and be around 6.7% of premium due primarily to increased IT and information security costs, higher pension expense and a gradual increase in travel and facility costs.

We experienced strong sales growth during the second quarter, and we continue to make progress on agent recruiting. I will now discuss current trends at each distribution channel.
At American Income Life, life premiums were up over the year ago quarter to $348 million, and life underwriting margin was up 16% to $108 million. The higher underwriting margin is primarily due to improved persistency and higher sales in recent quarters. In the second quarter of 2020, sales were limited due to the onset of COVID. In the second quarter of 2021, net life sales were $73 million, up 42%. The increase in net life sales is primarily due to increased agent count and productivity. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 10,478, up 25% from the year ago quarter and from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the second quarter was 10,406. The American Income Agency continues to generate positive momentum.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 6% over the year ago quarter to $78 million, while life underwriting margin was down 16% to $16 million. The decline in underwriting margin is due primarily to higher policy obligations. Net life sales increased 67% to $18 million, and net health sales were $6 million, up 52% from the year-ago quarter due primarily to increased agent count and increased agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 2,700, up 13% from the year ago quarter, while down 1% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,700. We continue to be encouraged by Liberty National's progress.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 9% over the year ago quarter to $85 million, and health underwriting margin increased 18% to $22 million. The increase in underwriting margin is due primarily to improved client experience and improved persistency. Net health sales were up 41% to $19 million due to increased agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 1,220, down 2% from the year ago quarter and down 5% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,171. The agency emphasized agent productivity during the first half of the year. The focus is shifting more towards recruitment for of the remainder of the year. 
In our direct-to-consumer division, a global life premiums were up 6% over the year ago quarter to $249 million, and life underwriting margin increased 22% to $34 million. The increase in margin is due primarily to improved persistency. Net life sales were $42 million, down 14% from the year ago quarter. This decline was expected due to the extraordinary level of sales activity seen in the second quarter of last year during the onset of COVID. While sales declined from a year ago, we are pleased with this quarter's sales activity, as it was 23% higher than the second quarter of 2019.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 3% over the year ago quarter to $116 million, and health underwriting margin increased 16% to $18 million. The increase in margin was due to improved loss ratios and the lower amortization. Net were $12 million, up 1% compared to the year ago quarter. It is still somewhat difficult to predict sales activity in this uncertain environment, but I will now projections based on trends we are seeing and knowledge of our business.
We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2021 to be in the following ranges: American Income Life, 3% to 6% growth; Liberty National, 1% to 8% growth; Family Heritage, a decline of 1% to 9%. Net life sales for the full year 2021 are expected to be as follows: American Income Life, an increase of 13% to 17%; Liberty National, an increase of 26% to 32%; direct-to-consumer, a decrease of 10% to flat. Net health sales for the full year 2021 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National and of 12% to 18%; Family Heritage, an increase of 4% to 8%; United American Individual Medicare Supplement, a decrease of 1% to an increase of 6% -- to an increase of 9%.

Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $60 million, a 2% decline from the year ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income grew 2%. For the full year, we expect excess investment income to decline 1% to 2%, but to grow around 2% on a per share basis.
In the second quarter, we invested $116 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the financial, municipal and industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 3.69%, an average rating of A and an average life of 35 years. We also invested $72 million in limited partnerships that invest in credit instruments. These investments are expected to produce incremental yield and are in line with our conservative investment philosophy. For the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.24%, down 14 basis points from the second quarter of 2020. As of June 30, the portfolio yield was 5.23%.
Invested assets are $19.1 billion, including $17.5 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $16.7 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $764 million compared to $802 million at the end of the first quarter. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.4%. Excluding net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio, the low investment-grade bonds as a percentage of equity of 13%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A- compared to BBB+ a year ago. Consistent with recent years, bonds rated BBB are 55% of the fixed maturity portfolio. While this ratio is in line with the overall bond market, it is high relative to our peers. However, we have little or no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgages, CLOs and other asset-backed securities.
Because we invest long, a key criteria in utilizing our investment process is that an issuer must have the ability to survive multiple syngas. We believe that the BBB securities that we acquire provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in large part to our unique ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets. Low interest rates continue to pressure investment income. At the midpoint of our guidance, we're assuming an average new money rate of around 3.5% for fixed maturities for the remainder of 2021. While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, Globe Life can thrive in a longer -- lower for longer interest rate environment. Extended low interest rates will not impact the GAAP or statutory balance sheets under current accounting rules since we sell noninteractive protection products. Fortunately, the impact of lower new money rates investment income is somewhat limited, as we expect to have an average turnover of less than 2% per year in our investment portfolio over the next 5 years.
Now I will turn the call over to Frank for his comments on capital and liquidity."

First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. The parent ended the second with liquid assets of approximately $545 million. This amount is higher than last quarter bec",1251,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. The parent ended the second with liquid assets of approximately $545 million. This amount is higher than last quarter because in June, the company issued a 40-year $325 million junior subordinated note with a coupon rate of 4.15%. Net proceeds were $317 million. On July 15, the company utilized the proceeds to call our $300 million 6.125% junior subordinated notes due 2056. The remaining proceeds will be used for general purposes.
In addition to these liquid assets, the parent company will generate excess cash flows during the remainder of 2021. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Global Life's shareholders. We anticipate the parent company's excess cash flow for the full year to be approximately $365 million. of which approximately $185 million will be generated in the second half of 2021.
In the second quarter, the company repurchased 1.2 million shares of Global Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $123 million at an average share price of $101.05. The total spend was higher than anticipated as we took advantage of the sharp drop in price at the end of the quarter and accelerated approximately $30 million of purchases from the second half of the year to repurchase shares at an average price of $95.62. So far in July, we have spent $32 million to repurchase 343,000 shares at an average price of $93.81. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent approximately $246 million to purchase 2.5 million shares at an average price of $97.96.
Taking into account the liquid assets of $545 million at the end of the second quarter, plus approximately $185 million of excess cash flows that we are expected to generate in the second half of the year, less the $32 million spent on share repurchases in July and the $300 million to call our junior subordinated note. We will have approximately of assets available to the parent for the remainder of the year. As I'll discuss in more detail in just a few moments, we believe this amount is more than necessary to support the targeted capital levels that are in our insurance operations and maintain the share repurchase program for the remainder of the year. As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. We still believe that share purchases provide the best return or yield to our shareholders over other available alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of the parent's excess cash flows. It should be noted that the cash received by the parent company from our insurance subsidiaries is after they have made substantial investments during the year to issue new insurance policies, expand our information technology and other operational capabilities as well as acquired new long-duration assets to fund future cash needs.
As we progress through the remainder of the year, we will continue to evaluate our available liquidity. If more liquidity is available than needed, some portion of the excess could be returned to shareholders before the end of the year. However, at this time, the midpoint of our earnings guidance only reflects approximately $120 million of share repurchases over the remainder of the year. Our goal is to maintain our capital at levels necessary to support our current rating. As noted on previous calls, Globe Life has targeted a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. At December 31, 2020, our consolidated RBC ratio was 309%. At this RBC ratio, our insurance subsidiaries have approximately $50 million of capital over the amount required at the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%. This excess capital, along with the roughly $400 million of liquid assets we expect to be available at the parent, provide sufficient liquidity to fund future capital needs.
As we discussed on previous calls, the primary drivers of potential additional capital needs from the parent company in 2021 relate to investment downgrades and changes to the NAIC RBC factors related to investments, commonly referred to as C1 factors to estimate the potential impact on capital to changes in our investment portfolio, we continue to model several scenarios and stress tests. In our base case, we anticipate approximately $370 million of additional NAIC 1 notch down grades. In addition, we anticipate full adoption by the NAIC of the new Moody's and NAIC C1 factors for 2021. Combined, our base case approximately $105 million of additional capital will be needed at our insurance subsidiaries to offset the adverse impact of the new factors and additional downgrades in order to maintain the midpoint of our consolidated RBC targets. Bottom line, the parent company has ample liquidity to cover any additional capital that may be required and still have cash available to make our normal level of share repurchases. As previously noted, we will continue to evaluate the best use of any excess cash that could remain, and we'll consider returning a portion of any excess to shareholders before the end of the year. We should be able to provide more guidance on that in our call next quarter.
At this time, I'd like to provide a few comments relating to the impact of COVID-19 on second quarter results. In the first half of 2021, the company has incurred approximately $49 million of COVID death claims, including $11 million in the second quarter. The $11 million incurred is $10 million less than incurred in the year ago quarter and is in line with our expectations for the quarter. The total COVID death benefits in the second quarter included $4.6 million incurred in our direct-to-consumer division or 2% of its second quarter premium income, $1.5 million incurred at Liberty National or 2% of its premium for the quarter and $3.5 million at American Income or 1% of its second quarter premium. At the midpoint of our guidance, we anticipate approximately 20,000 to 30,000 additional COVID deaths to occur over the remainder of 2021. As in prior quarters, we continue to estimate that we will incur COVID life claims of roughly $2 million for every 10,000 U.S. deaths. We are estimating a range of COVID death claims of $53 million to $55 million for the substantially unchanged from our previous guidance.
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2021. In the second quarter, our premium persistency continued to be very favorable and was better than we anticipated, leading to greater premium, higher policy obligations and lower amortization as a percent of premium. At this time, we now expect lapse rates to continue at lower than pre-pandemic levels throughout the remainder of 2021, leading to higher premium and underwriting income growth in our life segment. We also increased the underwriting income in our health segment to reflect the favorable health claims experience we saw in the second quarter. Finally, the impact of our lower share price results in a greater impact from our share repurchases and results in fewer diluted shares. As such, we have increased the midpoint of our guidance from $7.36 to $7.44 with an overall range of $7.34 to $7.54 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry."

With respect to the second quarter, we had anticipated around $15 million for the quarter, down from the $25 million that we saw in the first quarter. We now estimate that they were closer to actually $22 million of excess or around 3% of premium in the second quarter. So this was about $7 million higher than what we thought. This increase was mostly due to the better persistency we're seeing. Remember, the better person requires us to keep more reserves on the books. So in fact, out of the $22 million of these excess obligations that we had in the quarter, about 60% or around $14 million is from the lower lapses. And then around $8 million relates to other higher non-COVID claim activity. The actual claims around the medical and nonmedical was largely in line with what we anticipated. So again, the higher -- the $7 million is higher than what we kind of thought really related to the better persistency. For the full year, we now anticipate that these excess policy obligations will probably be around $70 million, which is around 2.4% of premium, and that's up from roughly the $50 million that we kind of talked about last quarter. Of the 2.4% of premium, it does look like about 1.5% of that will relate to higher reserves due to the lower lapses and about 0.9% will relate to higher non-COVID claim activity. And again, most of -- again, the increase of that $20 million from what we had talked about last quarter relates to the impact of the lower lapses and the reserve that required to retain on the policies that really didn't last as we had anticipated."

What we're seeing there is that the return of not just per enrollment or the addition of virtual enrollments, but the return of on-site sales for work site is really helping Liberty National.

Just to talk about recruiting level, but I do think growing agent count is going challenged through the end of 2021. Let's remember a year ago, there were many unemployed, more importantly, underemployed recruits. So many businesses shut down, hours reduced from many workers and layoffs are recurring everywhere today, we see just the opposite. We see help wanted size of most businesses, and we see a dramatic increase in work opportunities on the job [indiscernible]. So I think our producing agent growth will slow in the short run. However, as the economy to normal growth levels, we believe we'll see a continued growth in our agent count in line with our historical levels. I think the best indicator of future agent growth is always growth in middle management. When we look at that at American Income, year-to-date, we've had a 7% increase in middle management. In Q2, Liberty National had a 6% increase in middle management. Family Heritage had a 13% increase in middle management just important in middle managers, you watch you recruiting and training within the company. I've also stated that agent count growth is always a sterile process. And we don't expect to see growth quarter-to-quarter proven year-over-year over the past 4 years, producing agent count, each agency is growing at a compound rate at American Income approximately and 12% of Family Heritage and Liberty National. However, when you go back as an example, at Liberty National from 2016 to '17, we had 19% agency growth next year. The next 2-year period versus '17 to '18, we had 2.5% growth, followed by 23% growth in next year. And the reason that stairsteps is it takes time to develop middle management, and you want your productivity work over time, so you keep those agents. That's come a long explanation, but we are very confident all agents -- our agents growth rate -- producing agents continue to grow, I remember it's going to be a serious state process."

And we've seen a bigger impact on the Direct Response side, lowering that amortization rate that was 22% -- a little over 22% versus 25% in the second quarter of last year. And that's going to continue through the year. We should be at around 23% of premium for amortization in Direct Response versus over 25% last year. The reason for that reduced amortization is 2 things. One is the increased sales and also the improved persistency, both first year and renewal. In addition to direct response, the high sales that we had last year were -- the acquisition costs we had that were fixed acquisition cost per policy last year, lower than it has been. So there's less DAC that we were putting on the books. So the combination of higher sales, lower acquisition cost per policy plus the improved persistency generating more premium revenue since we amortize our DAC over the premium revenue over the life of the policies, having that higher premium revenues has resulted in a lower amortization percentage. We should again see that through the remainder of this year."

As noted before, we have seen improved persistency and premium collections since the onset of the pandemic. Life underwriting margin was $179 million, up 11% from a year ago. The increase in margin is due primarily to the higher premium and lower amortization related to the improved persistency. For the year, we expect life premium revenue to grow between 8% to 9% and underwriting margin to grow 5% to 6%.
In health insurance, premium revenue grew 4% to $296 million, and health underwriting margin was up 16% to $74 million. The increase in underwriting margin was primarily due to improved claims experience and persistency.

For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to grow 8% to 9% and be around 6.7% of premium due primarily to increased IT and information security costs, higher pension expense and a gradual increase in travel and facility costs.

We experienced strong sales growth during the second quarter, and we continue to make progress on agent recruiting. I will now discuss current trends at each distribution channel.
At American Income Life, life premiums were up 13% over the year ago quarter to $348 million, and life underwriting margin was up 16% to $108 million. The higher underwriting margin is primarily due to improved persistency and higher sales in recent quarters. 
In the second quarter of 2020, sales were limited due to the onset of COVID. In the second quarter of 2021, net life sales were $73 million, up 42%. The increase in net life sales is primarily due to increased agent count and productivity. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 10,478, up 25% from the year ago quarter and up 6% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the second quarter was 10,406. The American Income Agency continues to generate positive momentum.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 6% over the year ago quarter to $78 million, while life underwriting margin was down 16% to $16 million. The decline in underwriting margin is due primarily to higher policy obligations. Net life sales increased 67% to $18 million, and net health sales were $6 million, up 52% from the year-ago quarter due primarily to increased agent count and increased agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 2,700, up 13% from the year ago quarter, while down 1% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,700. We continue to be encouraged by Liberty National's progress.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 9% over the year ago quarter to $85 million, and health underwriting margin increased 18% to $22 million. The increase in underwriting margin is due primarily to improved client experience and improved persistency. Net health sales were up 41% to $19 million due to increased agent productivity. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 1,220, down 2% from the year ago quarter and down 5% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,171. The agency emphasized agent productivity during the first half of the year. The focus is shifting more towards recruiting for of the remainder of the year. 
In our direct-to-consumer division or Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% over the year ago quarter to $249 million, and life underwriting margin increased 22% to $34 million. The increase in margin is due primarily to improved persistency. Net life sales were $42 million, down 14% from the year ago quarter. This decline was expected due to the extraordinary level of sales activity seen in the second quarter of last year during the onset of COVID. While sales declined from a year ago, we are pleased with this quarter's sales activity, as it was 23% higher than the second quarter of 2019.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 3% over the year ago quarter to $116 million, and health underwriting margin increased 16% to $18 million. The increase in margin was due to improved loss ratios and the lower amortization. Net health sales were $12 million, up 1% compared to the year ago quarter. It is still somewhat difficult to predict sales activity in this uncertain environment, but I will now provide projections based on trends we are seeing and knowledge of our business.
We expect for producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2021 to be in the following ranges: American Income Life, 3% to 6% growth; Liberty National, 1% to 8% growth; Family Heritage, a decline of 1% to 9%. 
Net life sales for the full year 2021 are expected to be as follows: American Income Life, an increase of 13% to 17%; Liberty National, an increase of 26% to 32%; direct-to-consumer, a decrease of 10% to flat. 
Net health sales for the full year 2021 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, an increase of 12% to 18%; Family Heritage, an increase of 4% to 8%; United American individual Medicare Supplement, a decrease of 1% to an increase of 6% -- to an increase of 9%.

Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income was required interest on net policy, liabilities and debt was $60 million, a 2% decline from the year ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income grew 2%. For the full year, we expect excess investment income to decline 1% to 2%, but to grow around 2% on a per share basis.
In the second quarter, we invested $116 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the financial, municipal and industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 3.69%, an average rating of A and an average life of 35 years. We also invested $72 million in limited partnerships that invest in credit instruments. These investments are expected to produce incremental yield and are in line with our conservative investment philosophy. For the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.24%, down 14 basis points from the second quarter of 2020. As of June 30, the portfolio yield was 5.23%.
Invested assets are $19.1 billion, including $17.5 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $16.7 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds are $764 million compared to $802 million at the end of the first quarter. The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.4%. Excluding net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio, the low investment-grade bonds as a percentage of equity of 13%. 
Overall, the total portfolio is rated A- compared to BBB+ a year ago. Consistent with recent years, bonds rated BBB are 55% of the fixed maturity portfolio. While this ratio is in line with the overall bond market, it is high relative to our peers. However, we have little or no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgages, CLOs and other asset-backed securities.
Because we invest long, a key criteria in utilizing our investment process is that an issuer must have the ability to survive multiple [ cycles ]. We believe that the BBB securities that we acquire provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in large part to our unique ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets. Low interest rates continue to pressure investment income. At the midpoint of our guidance, we're assuming an average new money rate of around 3.5% for fixed maturities for the remainder of 2021. While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, Globe Life can thrive in a longer -- lower for longer interest rate environment. Extended low interest rates will not impact the GAAP or statutory balance sheets under current accounting rules since we sell [ noninteractive protection products ]. Fortunately, the impact of lower new money rates on our investment income is somewhat limited, as we expect to have an average turnover of less than 2% per year in our investment portfolio over the next 5 years.
Now I will turn the call over to Frank for his comments on capital and liquidity."
308916,1673848833,2349796,"Globe Life Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2021",2021-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. The parent ended the second with liquid assets of approximately $545 million. This amount is higher than last quarter, be",1251,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. The parent ended the second with liquid assets of approximately $545 million. This amount is higher than last quarter, because in June, the company issued a 40-year $325 million junior subordinated note with a coupon rate of 4.15%. Net proceeds were $317 million. On July 15, the company utilized the proceeds to call our $300 million 6.125% junior subordinated notes due 2056. The remaining proceeds will be used for general purposes.
In addition to these liquid assets, the parent company will generate excess cash flows during the remainder of 2021. The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Globe Life's shareholders. We anticipate the parent company's excess cash flow for the full year to be approximately $365 million. Of which, approximately $185 million will be generated in the second half of 2021.
In the second quarter, the company repurchased 1.2 million shares of Globe Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $123 million at an average share price of $101.05. The total spend was higher than anticipated as we took advantage of the sharp drop in share price at the end of the quarter and accelerated approximately $30 million of purchases from the second half of the year to repurchase shares at an average price of $95.62. So far in July, we have spent $32 million to repurchase 343,000 shares at an average price of $93.81. Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent approximately $246 million to purchase 2.5 million shares at an average price of $97.96.
Taking into account the liquid assets of $545 million at the end of the second quarter, plus approximately $185 million of excess cash flows that we are expected to generate in the second half of the year. Less than $32 million spent on share repurchases in July and the $300 million to call our junior subordinated note. We will have approximately $400 million of assets available to the parent for the remainder of the year. 
As I'll discuss in more detail in just a few moments, we believe this amount is more than necessary to support the targeted capital levels within our insurance operations and maintain the share repurchase program for the remainder of the year. 
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. We still believe that share purchases provide the best return or yield to our shareholders over other available alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of the parent's excess cash flows. It should be noted that the cash received by the parent company from our insurance subsidiaries is after they have made substantial investments during the year to issue new insurance policies, expand our information technology and other operational capabilities as well as acquired new long-duration assets to fund future cash needs.
As we progress through the remainder of the year, we will continue to evaluate our available liquidity. If more liquidity is available than needed, some portion of the excess could be returned to shareholders before the end of the year. However, at this time, the midpoint of our earnings guidance only reflects approximately $120 million of share repurchases over the remainder of the year. 
Our goal is to maintain our capital at levels necessary to support our current rating. As noted on previous calls, Globe Life has targeted a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. At December 31, 2020, our consolidated RBC ratio was 309%. At this RBC ratio, our insurance subsidiaries have approximately $50 million of capital over the amount required at the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%. This excess capital, along with the roughly $400 million of liquid assets we expect to be available to parent, provide sufficient liquidity to fund future capital needs.
As we discussed on previous calls, the primary drivers of potential additional capital needs from the parent company in 2021 relate to investment downgrades and changes to the NAIC RBC factors related to investments, commonly referred to as C1 factors. To estimate the potential impact on capital to changes in our investment portfolio, we continue to model several scenarios and stress tests. In our base case, we anticipate approximately $370 million of additional NAIC 1 notch downgrades. In addition, we anticipate full adoption by the NAIC of the new Moody's NAIC C1 factors for 2021. Combined, our base case assumes approximately $105 million of additional capital will be needed at our insurance subsidiaries to offset the adverse impact of the new factors and additional downgrades in order to maintain the midpoint of our consolidated RBC targets. 
Bottom line, the parent company has ample liquidity to cover any additional capital that may be required and still have cash available to make our normal level of share repurchases. As previously noted, we will continue to evaluate the best use of any excess cash that could remain, and we'll consider returning a portion of any excess to shareholders before the end of the year. We should be able to provide more guidance on that in our call next quarter.
At this time, I'd like to provide a few comments relating to the impact of COVID-19 on second quarter results. In the first half of 2021, the company has incurred approximately $49 million of COVID death claims, including $11 million in the second quarter. The $11 million incurred is $10 million less than incurred in the year ago quarter and is in line with our expectations for the quarter. The total COVID death benefits in the second quarter included $4.6 million incurred in our direct-to-consumer division or 2% of its second quarter premium income. $1.5 million incurred at Liberty National or 2% of its premium for the quarter and $3.5 million at American Income or 1% of its second quarter premium. 
At the midpoint of our guidance, we anticipate approximately 20,000 to 30,000 additional COVID deaths to occur over the remainder of 2021. As in prior quarters, we continue to estimate that we will incur COVID life claims of roughly $2 million for every 10,000 U.S. deaths. We are estimating a range of COVID death claims of $53 million to $55 million for the year, substantially unchanged from our previous guidance.
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2021. In the second quarter, our premium persistency continued to be very favorable and was better than we anticipated, leading to greater premium, higher policy obligations and lower amortization as a percent of premium. At this time, we now expect lapse rates to continue at lower than pre-pandemic levels throughout the remainder of 2021, leading to higher premium and underwriting income growth in our life segment. We also increased the underwriting income in our health segment to reflect the favorable health claims experience we saw in the second quarter. 
Finally, the impact of our lower share price results in a greater impact from our share repurchases and results in fewer diluted shares. As such, we have increased the midpoint of our guidance from $7.36 to $7.44 with an overall range of $7.34 to $7.54 for the year ended December 31, 2021.

With respect to the second quarter, we had anticipated around $15 million for the quarter, down from the $25 million that we saw in the first quarter. We now estimate that they were closer to actually $22 million of excess or around 3% of premium in the second quarter. So this was about $7 million higher than what we thought. This increase was mostly due to the better persistency we're seeing. Remember, the better persistency requires us to keep more reserves on the books. So in fact, out of the $22 million of these excess obligations that we had in the quarter, about 60% or around $14 million is from the lower lapses. And then the other around $8 million relates to other higher non-COVID claim activity. The actual claims around the medical and nonmedical was largely in line with what we anticipated. So again, the higher -- the $7 million is higher than what we kind of thought really related to the better persistency. 
For the full year, we now anticipate that these excess policy obligations will probably be around $70 million, which is around 2.4% of premium, and that's up from roughly the $50 million that we kind of talked about last quarter. Of the 2.4% of premium, it does look like about 1.5% of that will relate to higher reserves due to the lower lapses and about 0.9% will relate to higher non-COVID claim activity. And again, most -- again, the increase of that $20 million from what we had talked about last quarter relates to the impact of the lower lapses and the reserve that were required retained on the policies that really didn't last as we had anticipated."

Liberty National is a little different story. There, in Q2, our worksite sales were up 75% compared to the second quarter of 2020. As worksite sales actually were up 12% sequentially. What we're seeing there is that the return of not just virtual enrollments or the addition of virtual enrollments, but the return of on-site sales for worksite is really helping Liberty National, I think at Liberty National and Family Heritage both. In fact this year, the growth will come more from productivity as we see a greater percentage of agents submitting business. And of course, in all 3 agencies as those agents have more experience. You will see the average premium written for agents will also increase. So there are really different drivers at different points of time for distribution."

The Family Heritage, we think it will be down from 9% to negative 1%. Just to talk about recruiting level, but I do think growing agent count is going to be a challenge through the end of 2021. Let's remember a year ago, there were many unemployed, more importantly, underemployed recruits. Many businesses were shut down, hours reduced for many workers and layoffs were occurring everywhere. Today, we see just the opposite. We see [indiscernible] size of most businesses, and we see a dramatic increase in work opportunities on the job [indiscernible]. So I think our producing agent growth will slow in the short run. However, as the economy returns to normal growth levels, we believe we'll see a continued growth in our agent count in line with our historical levels.
I think the best indicator of future agent growth is always growth in middle management. When we look at that at American Income, year-to-date, we've had a 7% increase in middle management. In Q2, Liberty National had a 6% increase in middle management. Family Heritage had a 13% increase in middle management, That's important because middle managers [indiscernible] recruiting the trainee within the company. I've also stated that agent count growth is always a stair step process. And we don't expect to see constant growth quarter-to-quarter, I believe in year-over-year. Over the past 4 years, producing agent count, each agency is growing at a compound rate. 
At American Income, it's approximately 9% and 12% at Family Heritage and Liberty National. However, when you go back to this example, at Liberty National from 2016 to '17, we had 19% agency growth. The next year -- the next 2-year period which is '17 to '18, we had 2.5% growth, followed by 23% growth in next year. And the reason that stair step is it takes time to develop middle management, and you want your productivity work over time, so you keep those agents. That's kind of a long explanation, but we have every confidence we will grow agents -- our agents growth rate -- producing agents will continue to grow, [ I don't know if it ] is going to be a stair step process."

And we -- during the second quarter, we had adjusted our amortization rates throughout for all our distribution systems. And we've seen a bigger impact on the Direct Response side, lowering that amortization rate that was 22% -- a little over 22% versus 25% in the second quarter of last year. And that's going to continue through the year. We should be at around 23% of premium for amortization in Direct Response versus over 25% last year. The reason for that reduced amortization is 2 things. One is the increased sales and also the improved persistency, both first year and renewal. In addition to direct response, the high sales that we had last year were -- the acquisition costs we had that were fixed. So the acquisition cost per policy last year, lower than it has been. So there's less DAC that we were putting on the books. 
So the combination of higher sales, lower acquisition cost per policy plus the improved persistency generating more premium revenue since we amortize our DAC over the premium revenue over the [indiscernible] the policies. Having that higher premium revenue has resulted in a lower amortization percentage. We should again see that through the remainder of this year."

Obviously, the biggest driver of sales is going to be the increase in number of agents and producing agent count is going to grow to the guidance we've given. They are the drivers of productivity. Actually productivity is a little bit lower at American Income Q2 '21 versus Q2 '20. That's because of the increase in agents, and new agents were a little less productive. So as our agent growth from '19 and '20 translates into '21 all 3 agencies, as those agents receive better training and as they become more veteran agents, you'll see that increase, particularly we saw at Family Heritage. 
Q2 when all the recruiting is off, we have best quarter ever for productivity, we've had a 30% increase in health sales per agent Q1 of '21 from sequentially and also we had a 45% increase in health sales per agent over the year ago quarter. That's because when recruiting was down as the agents that last recruited had -- we had more veteran agents, the productivity went up.

On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity was 8.9% and book value per share is $84.52. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, Return on equity was 12.5% and book value per share is $57.11, up 9% from a year ago.

In the third quarter, life premium revenue increased 8% from a year ago to $729 million. 
Life underwriting margin was $162 million, down 5% from a year ago. The decline in margin is due primarily to higher-than-expected COVID-related claims resulting from the impact of the Delta variant. Frank will discuss this further in his comments. 
For the full year, we expect life premium revenue to grow 8% to 9% and underwriting margin to decline about 5%. In health insurance, premium revenue grew 4% over the year ago quarter to $299 million, and health underwriting margin was up 6% to $77 million. The increase in underwriting margin was due primarily to improved claims experience and increased premium. For the year, we expect health premium revenue to grow 5% to 6% and underwriting margin to grow around 11%. 
Administrative expenses were $68 million for the quarter, up 8% from a year ago. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.6% same as the year ago quarter. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to grow 8% to 9% and be around 6.7% of premium due primarily to higher IT and information security costs, higher pension expense and a gradual increase in travel and facilities costs.

Looking forward, the addition of virtual recruiting and selling opportunities will continue to enhance our ability to grow. I will now discuss current trends at each distribution channel. At American Income, life premiums were up 12% over the year ago quarter to $356 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $111 million. The higher underwriting margin is primarily due to improved persistency and higher sales in recent quarters. In the third quarter of 2021, net life sales were $74 million, up 9%. The increase in net life sales is primarily due to increased agent count. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was $9,959, up 7% from the year ago quarter but down 5% from the second quarter. 
The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 9,800. I've often mentioned the stairstep nature of our agency growth it is normal for to see a decline in agent counts after periods of high growth as attrition occurs and more emphasis is placed on training new agents. I remain optimistic regarding our ability to grow this agency over the long term regardless of economic conditions. 
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 6% over the year ago quarter to $79 million, and life underwriting margin was up 10% to $16 million. The increase in underwriting margin is due primarily to higher sales in recent quarters and lower policy obligations. Net life sales increased 33% to $18 million and net health sales were $7 million, up 19% from the year ago quarter due primarily to increased agent count and increased agent productivity. 
The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 2,706, up 6% from the year ago quarter but flat compared to the second quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,700. We are pleased with Liberty National's continued sales growth. At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% over the year ago quarter to $87 million, and health underwriting margin increased at 9% to $24 million. The increase in underwriting margin is due primarily to improved claims experience and improved persistency. 
Net health sales were down 1% to $19 million due to a decreased agent count. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1,152, down 16% from the year ago quarter and down 6% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,192. The focus will continue to be on recruiting for the remainder of the year. 
In our direct-to-consumer division at Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% over the year ago quarter to $241 million, while life underwriting margin declined 65% to $12 million. Frank will further discuss the decline in underwriting margin in his comments. Net life sales were $33 million, down 25% from the year ago quarter. We expected the sales decline. As you recall, there was a 50% increase in sales in the third quarter of 2020. While there is a decline in full year sales growth compared to 2020 -- the current full year 2021 sales guidance is an increase of 19% over 2019. 
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 3% over the year ago quarter to $118 million, while health underwriting margin declined 3% to $18 million. Net health sales were $12 million, down 8% compared to the year ago quarter. The decline is due primarily to a more competitive market we'll continue to protect our margins and pursue this market in an opportunistic manner. It is difficult to predict sales activity in this uncertain environment but I will now provide projections based on trends we are seeing and knowledge of our business. 
We expect the producing agent count for the full year for each agency at the end of 2021 to be in the following ranges: American Income, flat to an increase of 2%. The Liberty National, a decrease of 3% to an increase of 1%. Family Heritage, a decrease of 14% to 18%. Net life sales are expected to be as follows: American Income for the full year 2021, an increase of 12% to 16%. For the full year 2022, an increase of 2% to 10%. Liberty National for the full year 2021, an increase of 29% to 33%. For the full year 2022, an increase of 5% to 13%. 
Direct-to-consumer for the full year 2021, a decrease of 6% to 12%. For the full year 2022, a decrease of 2% to an increase of 8%. Net health sales are expected to be as follows: Liberty National for the full year 2021, an increase of 13% to 17%. For the full year 2022, an increase of 7% to 15%. Family Heritage for the full year 2021, an increase of 1% to 5%. For the full year 2022, an increase of 3% to 11%.

Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy obligations and debt was $59 million, flat compared to a year ago. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income grew 5%. For the full year, we expect excess investment income to decline approximately 2% and but be up 1% to 2% on a per share basis. 
In the third quarter, we invested $325 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the municipal, industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average of 3.19%, an average rating of A+ and an average life of 29 years. We also invested $56 million in limited partnerships that have deadline characteristics. These investments are expected to produce incremental additional yield and are in line with our conservative investment philosophy. 
For the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.21%, down 10 basis points from the third quarter of 2020. As of September 30, the fixed maturity portfolio yield was 5.20%. Invested assets were $19 billion, including $17.6 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $16.8 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. And below investment grade bonds are $782 million compared to $840 million a year ago. 
The percentage of below investment-grade bonds at fixed maturities is 4.4%, and excluding net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio below investment-grade bonds as a percentage of equity or 13%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A- compared to BBB+ a year ago. Bonds rated BBB are 54% of the fixed maturity portfolio. While this ratio is in line with the overall bond market, it is high relative to our peers. However, we have little or no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgages, CLOs and other asset-backed securities. Because we invest long, a key criterion utilized in our investment process is that an issuer has the ability to survive multiple fibers. 
We believe that the BBB securities that we acquire provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in large part to our unique ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets. Low interest rates continue to pressure investment income. At the midpoint of our guidance, we're assuming an average new money rate for fixed maturities of around 3.45% for the fourth quarter and a weighted average rate of around 3.9% in 2022. 
At these new money rates, we expect the annual yield on the fixed maturity portfolio to be around 5.21% for the full year 2021 and 5.11% in 2022. Fortunately, the impact of lower new money rates on our investment income is somewhat limited as we expect to have average turnover of less than 2% per year in our investment portfolio over the next 5 years. While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, low can drive on a lower for longer interest rate environment. 
Now I will turn the call over to Frank for his comments on capital and liquidity."
308916,1685063083,2409044,"Globe Life Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. In the third quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares of Global Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $96.5",2023,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. In the third quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares of Global Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $96.5 million at an average share price of $94.13. 
For the full year, we have utilized approximately $310 million of cash to purchase 3.2 million shares at an average price of $97.17. The parent ended the third quarter with liquid assets of approximately $280 million, down from $545 million in the prior quarter. The decrease is primarily due to the redemption of the $300 million outstanding principal amount of our 6 1 8 percent junior subordinated debentures due 2056. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent company will generate excess cash flow during the remainder of 2021. 
The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Globe Life's shareholders. We anticipate the parent company's excess cash flow for the full year to be approximately $360 million, of which approximately $25 million will be generated in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
Taking into account the liquid assets of $280 million at the end of the third quarter, plus $25 million of excess cash flows expected to be generated in the fourth quarter we will have approximately $305 million of assets available to the parent for the remainder of the year. As I'll discuss in more detail in just a few moments, this amount is sufficient to support the targeted capital levels within our insurance operations and to maintain the share repurchase program for the remainder of the year. 
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. We still believe that share repurchases provide the best return or yield to our shareholders over other available alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of the parent's excess cash flows. At this time, the midpoint of our earnings guidance reflects $90 million to $100 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. In addition, we anticipate using approximately $90 million to $100 million of the parent assets to maintain our insurance subsidiaries RBC levels. 
Thus, taking into account the expected $305 million of assets available to the holding company less the $180 million to $200 million expected to be used for buybacks and subsidiary capital needs, we expect to have in the range of $105 million to $125 million of available assets at the holding company at the end of the year. This is approximately $55 million to $75 million in excess of the $50 million of liquid assets we have historically targeted at the holding company. 
We will continue to evaluate the potential impact of the pandemic on our capital needs. However, we expect that most, if not all of this excess liquidity will be returned to the shareholders in 2022, absent other more favorable alternatives. Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain our capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. As noted on previous calls, Globe Life targets a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%. 
At December 31, 2020, our consolidated RBC ratio was 309%. At this RBC ratio, our insurance subsidiaries have approximately $50 million of capital over the amount required at the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%. This excess capital, along with the $305 million of liquid assets that we expect to be available at the parent, provides sufficient capital to fund future capital needs. The drivers of additional capital needs in 2021 primarily relate to investment downgrades, changes in the newly adopted NAIC RBC C1 investment factors, growth of our business and higher COVID claims. 
With respect to downgrades, our year-to-date downgrades have totaled $291 million, but have been offset by $224 million in upgrades, including a net upgrade of $110 million in the third quarter. At this time, in our base scenario, we are not expecting any significant NAIC one-notch net downgrades or material credit losses in the fourth quarter, consistent with the favorable outlook we continue to see in our portfolio. 
In August, the NAIC fully adopted the new and expanded C1 investment factors. The adoption of these factors will result in higher amounts of required capital for our portfolio. In addition, higher sales, growth of our in-force business and higher COVID claims also increased our capital needs. As I mentioned previously, we anticipate $90 million to $100 million will be needed at our insurance subsidiaries to maintain the midpoint of our consolidated RBC target for 2021, including the estimated $50 million of capital relating to the higher C1 charges. 
As previously noted, the parent company has ample liquidity to cover this additional capital. At this time, I'd like to provide a few comments related to the impact of COVID-19 on third quarter results. Through September 30, the company has incurred approximately $82 million of COVID life claims, including $33 million in the third quarter on approximately 95,000 deaths reported by the CDC. 
The claims incurred in the third quarter were significantly higher than anticipated, primarily due to the significant impact the Delta variant has had on infection rates and debt totals, especially in southern states, and in younger ages met earlier in the pandemic. Our third quarter COVID life claims include approximately $17 million incurred in our direct-to-consumer division, or approximately 7.1% of its third quarter premium income, approximately $8.4 million of COVID life claims occurred at Liberty National, 10.6% of its premium for the quarter and approximately $6.7 million at American Income or 1.9% of its third quarter premium. 
As indicated on prior calls, we estimated that we would incur COVID life claims of roughly $2 million for every 10,000 U.S. deaths. While this was a good benchmark for our claims incurred through June 30,-- The spread of the COVID Delta variant has impacted our in-force book of business differently than the effect of COVID in prior quarters. In the third quarter, COVID shifted to a younger population where GlobaLife has higher risk exposure, both in terms of number of policies and average face amount. 
In addition, we're also seeing a greater concentration of COVID deaths in the southern region of the United States where a greater proportion of our in-force policies resigned. Given our experience to date, and available information on the COVID deaths from the CDC and other sources, including the observed changes to the geography of the pandemic and the ages of people dying from COVID, we now estimate that our incurred losses in the second half of this year will be approximately $3.5 million for every 10,000 U.S. deaths.  
While continued changes in the mix of death in terms of geography or the age of those impacted by COVID will impact this estimate going forward. We anticipate the level of losses per U.S. debt to range from $3 million to $4 million for every 10,000 U.S. debts in 2022. At the midpoint of our guidance for 2022, we have assumed $3.5 million of incurred losses per 10,000 deaths. 
To date, we have experienced low levels of COVID claims on policies sold since the start of the pandemic. In fact, over 2/3 of our clients through September 30 related to policies issued before 2010. Of the nearly 3 million policy sold since March 1, 2020, only 231 COVID clients have been paid through the end of the third quarter, totaling approximately $2.8 million in debt benefits. 
In addition to COVID losses, we continue to experience higher policy obligations from non-COVID causes of death and lower policy lapses. The increase from non-COVID causes of death are primarily medical related, including heart and circulatory nonlung cancer and neurological disorders. The losses we are seeing are elevated over 2019 levels. Do at least in part, we believe, to the pandemic and the existence of either delayed or unavailable health care. 
In the third quarter, the policy obligations relating to the non-COVID causes of death and lapses were just slightly more than we anticipated, primarily due to higher reserves associated with better persistency at our direct-to-consumer channel. Higher-than-expected non-COVID claims and direct-to-consumer during the quarter were mostly offset by lower-than-expected non-COVID claims experience at Liberty National. 
For the full year, we anticipated on our last call that we would incur approximately $70 million in excess policy obligations in 2021 with about $42 million of those related to higher reserves due to lower policy lapses in 2020 and 2021. We now anticipate that our total excess obligations will be approximately $78 million, of which approximately $48 million related to higher reserves from lower lapses. 
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2021 and 2022. After taking into account various estimates of COVID deaths in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, we estimate fourth quarter COVID of approximately $75,000 to $125,000, resulting in approximately $25 million to $45 million of COVID incurred losses. At the midpoint of our guidance, we estimate approximately $35 million of COVID losses on 100,000 U.S. deaths. 
The 100,000 U.S. death is consistent with the October 15 projection by the IHME. As a result of the higher COVID claims in the second half of this year than previously anticipated, we are lowering the midpoint of our guidance from $7.44 to $6.95 with a range of $6.85 to $7.05 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $0.49 decrease in the midpoint is almost entirely due to an increase in COVID incurred losses of nearly $63 million or $0.48 of earnings per share over the amount previously anticipated. 
Looking forward to 2022, we anticipate that COVID deaths will continue to be with us throughout the year but at a lower level than in 2021. We estimate COVID deaths could range from 100,000 deaths for the year to 200,000 and that our losses per 10,000 U.S. debts could range from $3 million to $4 million. 
At the midpoint of our guidance, we anticipate between $50 million to $55 million of COVID-incurred losses on approximately 150,000 U.S. deaths, most of which are expected to occur in the first half of the year. Absent the impact of COVID, we believe our core earnings should be strong buoyed by premium growth in the 6% to 8% range as a result of strong sales in 2021 and continued favorable persistency. 
We also anticipate that the level of excess policy obligations will moderate somewhat, resulting in underwriting margins as a percentage of premium, excluding COVID losses, returning to pre-pandemic levels of around 28%. We also anticipate our health underwriting income to increase 4% to 7% during the year, with underwriting margins as a percent of premium approximately 24% to 25%. 
Overall, we estimate our earnings for 2022 will range from $7.95 to $8.75 with a midpoint of $8.35. The wider than historical range is to take into account the wide range of potential impacts of COVID in 2022, which are largely dependent on the emergence of new variants, adoption and effectiveness of available vaccines and therapeutics, masking practices and many other factors. 
Our 2022 results also reflect a full year of operations for our newest acquisition, Beazley Benefits, which has been rebranded as Globe Life Benefits. The acquisition which we closed upon in the third quarter, is expected to add over $50 million of health premium in 2022 and over $11 million of underwriting income. We are excited about the future of this new acquisition and the ability to grow this business over the long term. 
The agency fits well into our overall business model as they offer group supplemental health insurance solutions to employer groups through brokers, and this is complementary to our existing agencies to focus more on individual sales. Their underwriting results will be reflected in our other health lines along with our United American General Agency division.

And then they also had -- in the ages that were impacted a little bit more by the Delta variant, which tend to be in the -- maybe like in the 40s to 50-year-old, they just have a little bit more exposure proportionately than direct-to-consumer debt. 
But direct-to-consumer is also being hit pretty hard with, if you will, with the excess or compared to the other lines of business. And the -- for the full year with direct-to-consumer, we kind of expect to have maybe like 5.7% higher policy obligations, which most of that is due to losses or a little over half of that is due to lapses versus the excess non-proved claims, whereas Liberty National and American Income, there excess non-COVID claims range from pretty flat to 1.5% or so."

So it didn't have a big statutory impact. So then that knocked down a little bit from those levels because we're our statutory capital didn't change significantly. With the onset of COVID, during the last couple of years, coupled with really low interest rates, our basic statutory income is not growing as much.

On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity was 8.9% and book value per share is $84.52. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, Return on equity was 12.5% and book value per share is $57.11, up 9% from a year ago. In our life insurance operations, as we've noted before, we have seen improved persistency since the onset of the pandemic. In the third quarter, life premium revenue increased 8% from a year ago to $729 million.
Life underwriting margin was $162 million, down 5% from a year ago. The decline in margin is due primarily to higher-than-expected COVID-related claims resulting from the impact of the Delta variant. Frank will discuss this further in his comments.
For the full year, we expect life premium revenue to grow 8% to 9% and underwriting margin to decline about 5%. In health insurance, premium revenue grew 4% over the year ago quarter to $299 million, and health underwriting margin was up 6% to $77 million. The increase in underwriting margin was due primarily to improved claims experience and increased premium. For the year, we expect health premium revenue to grow 5% to 6% and underwriting margin to grow around 11%.
Administrative expenses were $68 million for the quarter, up 8% from a year ago. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.6% same as the year ago quarter. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to grow 8% to 9% and be around 6.7% of premium due primarily to higher IT and information security costs, higher pension expense and a gradual increase in travel and facilities costs.

Looking forward, the addition of virtual recruiting and selling opportunities will continue to enhance our ability to grow. I will now discuss current trends at each distribution channel. At American Income, life premiums were up 12% over the year ago quarter to $356 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $111 million. The higher underwriting margin is primarily due to improved persistency and higher sales in recent quarters. In the third quarter of 2021, net life sales were $74 million, up 9%. The increase in net life sales is primarily due to increased agent count. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was $9,959, up 7% from the year ago quarter but down 5% from the second quarter.
The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 9,800. I've often mentioned the stairstep nature of our agency growth it is normal for to see a decline in agent counts after periods of high growth as attrition occurs and more emphasis is placed on training new agents. I remain optimistic regarding our ability to grow this agency over the long term regardless of economic conditions.
At Liberty National, life premiums were up 6% over the year ago quarter to $79 million, and life underwriting margin was up 10% to $16 million. The increase in underwriting margin is due primarily to higher sales in recent quarters and lower policy obligations. Net life sales increased 33% to $18 million and net health sales were $7 million, up 19% from the year ago quarter due primarily to increased agent count and increased agent productivity.
The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 2,706, up 6% from the year ago quarter but flat compared to the second quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,700. We are pleased with Liberty National's continued sales growth. At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% over the year ago quarter to $87 million, and health underwriting margin increased at 9% to $24 million. The increase in underwriting margin is due primarily to improved claims experience and improved persistency.
Net health sales were down 1% to $19 million due to a decreased agent count. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1,152, down 16% from the year ago quarter and down 6% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,192. The focus will continue to be on recruiting for the remainder of the year.
In our direct-to-consumer division at Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% over the year ago quarter to $241 million, while life underwriting margin declined 65% to $12 million. Frank will further discuss the decline in underwriting margin in his comments. Net life sales were $33 million, down 25% from the year ago quarter. We expected the sales decline. As you recall, there was a 50% increase in sales in the third quarter of 2020. While there is a decline in full year sales growth compared to 2020, the current full year 2021 sales guidance is an increase of 19% over 2019.
At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 3% over the year ago quarter to $118 million, while health underwriting margin declined 3% to $18 million. Net health sales were $12 million, down 8% compared to the year ago quarter. The decline is due primarily to a more competitive market. We'll continue to protect our margins and pursue this market in an opportunistic manner. It is difficult to predict sales activity in this uncertain environment, but I will now provide projections based on trends we are seeing and knowledge of our business.
We expect the producing agent count for the full year for each agency at the end of 2021 to be in the following ranges: American Income, flat to an increase of 2%. Liberty National, a decrease of 3% to an increase of 1%. Family Heritage, a decrease of 14% to 18%. Net life sales are expected to be as follows: American Income for the full year 2021, an increase of 12% to 16%. For the full year 2022, an increase of 2% to 10%. Liberty National for the full year 2021, an increase of 29% to 33%. For the full year 2022, an increase of 5% to 13%.
Direct-to-consumer for the full year 2021, a decrease of 6% to 12%. For the full year 2022, a decrease of 2% to an increase of 8%. Net health sales are expected to be as follows: Liberty National for the full year 2021, an increase of 13% to 17%. For the full year 2022, an increase of 7% to 15%. Family Heritage for the full year 2021, an increase of 1% to 5%. For the full year 2022, an increase of 3% to 11%.

Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy obligations and debt was $59 million flat compared to a year ago. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income grew 5%. For the full year, we expect excess investment income to decline approximately 2% but be up 1% to 2% on a per share basis.
In the third quarter, we invested $325 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the municipal, industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average due for the 3.19%, an average rating of A+ and an average life of 29 years. We also invested $56 million in limited partnerships that have deadline characteristics. These investments are expected to produce incremental additional yield and are in line with our conservative investment philosophy.
For the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.21%, down 10 basis points from the third quarter of 2020. As of September 30, the fixed maturity portfolio yield was 5.20%. Invested assets were $19 billion, including $17.6 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $16.8 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. And below investment grade bonds are $782 million compared to $840 million a year ago.
The percentage of below investment-grade bonds at fixed maturities is 4.4%, and excluding net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio below investment-grade bonds as a percentage of equity are 13%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A- compared to BBB+ a year ago. Bonds rated BBB are 54% of the fixed maturity portfolio. While this ratio is in line with the overall bond market, it is high relative to our peers. However, we have little or no exposure to higher-risk assets such as derivatives, equities, residential mortgages, CLOs and other asset-backed securities. Because we invest long, a key criterion utilized in our investment process is that an issuer has the ability to survive multiple fibers.
We believe that the BBB securities that we acquire provide the best risk-adjusted, capital-adjusted returns due in large part to our unique ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets. Low interest rates continue to pressure investment income. At the midpoint of our guidance, we're assuming an average new money rate for fixed maturities of around 3.45% for the fourth quarter and a weighted average rate of around 3.9% in 2022.
At these new money rates, we expect the annual yield on the fixed maturity portfolio to be around 5.21% for the full year 2021 and 5.11% in 2022. Fortunately, the impact of lower new money rates on our investment income is somewhat limited as we expect to have average turnover of less than 2% per year in our investment portfolio over the next 5 years. While we would like to see higher interest rates going forward, Globe Life can't thrive on a lower for longer interest rate environment.
Now I will turn the call over to Frank for his comments on capital and liquidity."
308916,1685063083,2409123,"Globe Life Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. In the third quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares of Global Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $96.5",2026,"Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchase program, available liquidity and capital position. In the third quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares of Global Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $96.5 million at an average share price of $94.13.
For the full year, we have utilized approximately $310 million of cash to purchase 3.2 million shares at an average price of $97.17. The parent ended the third quarter with liquid assets of approximately $280 million, down from $545 million in the prior quarter. The decrease is primarily due to the redemption of the $300 million outstanding principal amount of our [ 6.18% ] Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2056. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent company will generate excess cash flow during the remainder of 2021.
The parent company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Globe Life's shareholders. We anticipate the parent company's excess cash flow for the full year to be approximately $360 million, of which approximately $25 million will be generated in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Taking into account the liquid assets of $280 million at the end of the third quarter, plus $25 million of excess cash flows expected to be generated in the fourth quarter, we will have approximately $305 million of assets available to the parent for the remainder of the year. As I'll discuss in more detail in just a few moments, this amount is sufficient to support the targeted capital levels within our insurance operations and to maintain the share repurchase program for the remainder of the year.
As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. We still believe that share repurchases provide the best return or yield to our shareholders over other available alternatives. Thus, we anticipate share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of the parent's excess cash flows. At this time, the midpoint of our earnings guidance reflects $90 million to $100 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. In addition, we anticipate using approximately $90 million to $100 million of the parent assets to maintain our insurance subsidiaries RBC levels.
Thus, taking into account the expected $305 million of assets available to the holding company less of $180 million to $200 million expected to be used for buybacks and subsidiary capital needs, we expect to have in the range of $105 million to $125 million of available assets at the holding company at the end of the year. This is approximately $55 million to $75 million in excess of the $50 million of liquid assets we have historically targeted at the holding company.
We will continue to evaluate the potential impact of the pandemic on our capital needs. However, we expect at most, if not all of this excess liquidity will be returned to the shareholders in 2022, absent other more favorable alternatives. Now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. Our goal is to maintain our capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings. As noted on previous calls, Globe Life targets a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%.
At December 31, 2020, our consolidated RBC ratio was 309%. At this RBC ratio, our insurance subsidiaries have approximately $50 million of capital over the amount required at the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%. This excess capital, along with the $305 million of liquid assets that we expect to be available at the parent, provides sufficient capital to fund future capital needs. The drivers of additional capital needs in 2021 primarily relate to investment downgrades, changes in the newly adopted NAIC RBC C1 investment factors, growth of our business and higher COVID claims.
With respect to downgrades, our year-to-date downgrades have totaled $291 million, but have been offset by $224 million in upgrades, including a net upgrade of $110 million in the third quarter. At this time, in our base scenario, we are not expecting any significant NAIC one-notch net downgrades or material credit losses in the fourth quarter, consistent with the favorable outlook we continue to see in our portfolio.
In August, the NAIC fully adopted the new and expanded C1 investment factors. The adoption of these factors will result in higher amounts of required capital for our portfolio. In addition, higher sales, growth of our in-force business and higher COVID claims also increased our capital needs. As I mentioned previously, we anticipate $90 million to $100 million will be needed at our insurance subsidiaries to maintain the midpoint of our consolidated RBC target for 2021, including the estimated $50 million of capital relating to the higher C1 charges.
As previously noted, the parent company has ample liquidity to cover this additional capital. At this time, I'd like to provide a few comments related to the impact of COVID-19 on third quarter results. Through September 30, the company has incurred approximately $82 million of COVID life claims, including $33 million in the third quarter on approximately 95,000 deaths reported by the CDC.
The claims incurred in the third quarter were significantly higher than anticipated, primarily due to the significant impact the Delta variant has had on infection rates and death totals, especially in southern states, and in younger ages a bit earlier in the pandemic. Our third quarter COVID life claims include approximately $17 million incurred in our direct-to-consumer division, or approximately 7.1% of its third quarter premium income, approximately $8.4 million of COVID life claims occurred at Liberty National, 10.6% of its premium for the quarter and approximately $6.7 million at American Income or 1.9% of its third quarter premium.
As indicated on prior calls, we estimated that we would incur COVID life claims of roughly $2 million for every 10,000 U.S. deaths. While this was a good benchmark for our claims incurred through June 30, the spread of the COVID Delta variant has impacted our in-force book of business differently than the effect of COVID in prior quarters. In the third quarter, COVID deaths shifted to a younger population where Globe Life has higher risk exposure, both in terms of number of policies and average face amount.
In addition, we're also seeing a greater concentration of COVID deaths in the southern region of the United States where a greater proportion of our in-force policies resigned. Given our experience to date, and available information on the COVID deaths from the CDC and other sources, including the observed changes to the geography of the pandemic and the ages of people dying from COVID, we now estimate that our incurred losses in the second half of this year will be approximately $3.5 million for every 10,000 U.S. deaths.
While continued changes in the mix of death in terms of geography or the age of those impacted by COVID will impact this estimate going forward. We anticipate the level of losses per U.S. deaths to range from $3 million to $4 million for every 10,000 U.S. deaths in 2022. At the midpoint of our guidance for 2022, we have assumed $3.5 million of incurred losses per 10,000 deaths.
To date, we have experienced low levels of COVID claims on policies sold since the start of the pandemic. In fact, over 2/3 of our clients through September 30 related to policies issued before 2010. Of the nearly 3 million policies sold since March 1, 2020, only 231 COVID claims have been paid through the end of the third quarter, totaling approximately $2.8 million in death benefits.
In addition to COVID losses, we continue to experience higher policy obligations from non-COVID causes of death and lower policy lapses. The increase from non-COVID causes of death are primarily medical related, including heart and circulatory non-lung cancer and neurological disorders. The losses we are seeing are elevated over 2019 levels. Do at least in part, we believe, to the pandemic and the existence of either delayed or unavailable health care.
In the third quarter, the policy obligations relating to the non-COVID causes of death and lapses were just slightly more than we anticipated, primarily due to higher reserves associated with better persistency at our direct-to-consumer channel. Higher-than-expected non-COVID claims and direct-to-consumer during the quarter were mostly offset by lower-than-expected non-COVID claims experience at Liberty National.  
For the full year, we anticipated on our last call that we would incur approximately $70 million in excess policy obligations in 2021 with about $42 million of those related to higher reserves due to lower policy lapses in 2020 and 2021. We now anticipate that our total excess obligations will be approximately $78 million, of which approximately $48 million related to higher reserves from lower lapses.
Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2021 and 2022. After taking into account various estimates of COVID deaths in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, we estimate fourth quarter COVID deaths of approximately 75,000 to 125,000 resulting in approximately $25 million to $45 million of COVID incurred losses. At the midpoint of our guidance, we estimate approximately $35 million of COVID losses on 100,000 U.S. deaths.
The 100,000 U.S. deaths is consistent with the October 15 projection by the IHME. As a result of the higher COVID claims in the second half of this year than previously anticipated, we are lowering the midpoint of our guidance from $7.44 to $6.95 with a range of $6.85 to $7.05 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $0.49 decrease in the midpoint is almost entirely due to an increase in COVID incurred losses of nearly $63 million or $0.48 of earnings per share over the amount previously anticipated.
Looking forward to 2022, we anticipate that COVID deaths will continue to be with us throughout the year but at a lower level than in 2021. We estimate COVID deaths could range from 100,000 deaths for the year to 200,000 and that our losses per 10,000 U.S. deaths could range from $3 million to $4 million.
At the midpoint of our guidance, we anticipate between $50 million to $55 million of COVID-incurred losses on approximately 150,000 U.S. deaths, most of which are expected to occur in the first half of the year. After the impact of COVID, we believe our core earnings should be strong buoyed by premium growth in the 6% to 8% range as a result of strong sales in 2021 and continued favorable persistency.
We also anticipate that the level of excess policy obligations will moderate somewhat, resulting in underwriting margins as a percentage of premium, excluding COVID losses, returning to pre-pandemic levels of around 28%. We also anticipate our health underwriting income to increase 4% to 7% during the year, with underwriting margins as a percent of premium approximately 24% to 25%.
Overall, we estimate our earnings for 2022 will range from $7.95 to $8.75 with a midpoint of $8.35. The wider than historical range is to take into account the wide range of potential impacts of COVID in 2022, which are largely dependent on the emergence of new variants, adoption and effectiveness of available vaccines and therapeutics, masking practices and many other factors.
Our 2022 results also reflect a full year of operations for our newest acquisition, Beazley Benefits, which has been rebranded as Globe Life Benefits. The acquisition which we closed upon in the third quarter, is expected to add over $50 million of health premium in 2022 and over $11 million of underwriting income. We are excited about the future of this new acquisition and the ability to grow this business over the long term.
The agency fits well into our overall business model as they offer group supplemental health insurance solutions to employer groups through brokers, and thus is complementary to our existing agencies to focus more on individual sales. Their underwriting results will be reflected in our other health lines along with our United American General Agency division.

But direct-to-consumer is also being hit pretty hard with, if you will, with the excess COVID compared to the other lines of business. And the -- for the full year with direct-to-consumer, we kind of expect to have maybe like 5.7% higher policy obligations, which most of that is due to lapses or a little over half of that is due to lapses versus the excess non-COVID claims, whereas Liberty National and American Income, their excess non-COVID claims range from pretty flat to 1.5% or so."

So I guess my question is when I look at your free cash flow conversion and I heard your comment on the overall, the sale -- the COVID impact and then the sales stream. But when I just look at the ratio and I compare it to the proportion of GAAP earnings, it's now drifting below 50%.
And I guess, historically, it's been a little bit higher, but that number has actually been coming down. The -- is there -- have you thought about that as a corporate strategy at all improving on that ratio. Now part of it is a high-class problem, right? When you're growing, there's sales stream and you have to pay for that.
But when I compare how your ratio looks versus peers, like the MetLifes of the world that are now up to 70% your -- I guess, your proportion of cash flow relative to GAAP earnings is looking like an outlier on the lower side. Is that something you thought at all about as a way to maybe enhance that?"

But I do recognize that in -- it was down from historic levels where we've been more in that 70% to 80% pretax law change back in 2018. And as we've talked about really in the past, what that tax law did was it reduced -- or it increased our GAAP earnings because of the lower tax rate, but it really didn't change our statutory income very much because our statutory taxes largely as they change the tax base, it really did change the amount of cash taxes that we're paying out.
So it didn't have a big statutory impact. So then that knocked it down a little bit from those levels because we're -- our statutory capital did change significantly. With the onset of COVID, here the last couple of years, coupled with really low interest rates, our basic statutory income is not growing as much. And when you look at the -- and this is the part that none of us here want to change, which is that growth in sales.
And when you look at that statutory drain and the money that we're investing in those new sales, that's going to maintain really strong premiums for the long term. It does kind of have in the near term an adverse impact on our ability to return some of that excess cash flow as a percentage of our GAAP earnings. But we think in the long term, those statutory earnings will, once we get past COVID, we feel really good about where we're at from a statutory income perspective and would expect that to improve in future years as we get out of this."
