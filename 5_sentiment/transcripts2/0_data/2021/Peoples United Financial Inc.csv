We appreciate everyone joining us today and hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy.Let's begin by turning to the full year overview on Slide 2. We are pleased with our performance in 2020, espe",1257,"Thank you, Andrew, and good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today and hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy.
Let's begin by turning to the full year overview on Slide 2. We are pleased with our performance in 2020, especially in light of the uncertain economic environment caused by the pandemic. Full year financial and operating results were strong and reflect the resilience of People's United, its employees and customers. Net income of $573 million increased 10% from a year ago. And on a per common share basis, net income was up $0.05 to $1.32. Operating earnings of $535 million or $1.27 per common share declined 3% and $0.12, respectively. It's important to note that we completed the sale of People's United Insurance Agency in November and realized a pretax gain net of expenses of $75.9 million, which is not included in operating earnings. Pre-provision net revenue of $827 million increased $89 million or 12% from a year ago, reflecting the success of recent acquisitions and solid execution across 4 operations.
Total operating revenues of nearly $2 billion increased 8.5%, driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by modestly lower fee revenues. Operating expenses of $1.165 billion, which includes a full year of United and Belmont results were up 6%. Notably, operating expenses ended the year below the level -- the lower end of the 2021 outlook range we provided a year ago of $1.19 billion. The increase in revenues, along with our continued emphasis on controlling expenses and realizing projected cost savings from acquisitions, lowered the full year efficiency ratio of 160 basis points to 54.2%, marking the seventh consecutive year of improvement.
Turning to the balance sheet. Period-end loans and deposits increased 1% and 20%, respectively, from year-end 2019. Excluding PPV, the loan portfolio decreased approximately $2 billion or 5%, driven by lower retail balances of approximately $2.3 billion, modestly offset by commercial loan growth of $251 million. The decline in retail balances was mostly due to our planned reduction of residential mortgages as we remix the balance sheet with a focus on higher-yielding portfolios. The impact of the pandemic on the economy was evident in the commercial portfolio throughout the year. Demand within the commercial real estate and C&I middle market businesses was limited due to reduced economic activity and funding provided by PPP loans. Conversely, our mortgage warehouse and lease businesses experienced strong growth.
Mortgage warehouse ended 2020 with a record balances of $3.4 billion, which more than doubled from 2019, while lease period end balances increased 19% from the prior year. Lease, which we acquired in 2017 has been a terrific addition to People's United franchise. Reef has successfully leveraged the liquidity and funding provided by the bank and other synergies to achieve significant growth while maintaining both excellent asset quality and high yields. Lease balances ended 2020 at nearly $2 billion, up from approximately $730 million at the time of the acquisition.
Asset quality remained excellent as the net charge-offs to average total loans were 11 basis points for the full year. These results are indicative of the company's conservative approach to underwriting, diversified loan portfolio and deep customer relationships. We are particularly pleased by the continued reduction in loan deferrals, which ended the year at $271 million or 0.6% of total loans, down from $1.6 billion or 3.5% of total loans at the close of the third quarter. Additionally, deferrals have continued to decline since year-end. As of January 15, total deferrals were down to $110 million or less than 0.3% of total loans.
We remain committed to supporting our high-quality customer base and help them navigate these difficult economic times. Consistent with our intentions discussed last quarter, we provided post second deferral modifications to customers in need of further assistance. Approximately $1 billion in loans received modifications. The majority of the modifications are in commercial real estate with the largest concentrations within the hospitality sector as expected.
Moving on to Slide 3. As consumer preferences evolve to more digitally driven experiences, we have continually enhanced our technology capabilities to deliver value, provide convenience and create efficiencies. As a result, customers are increasingly utilizing our online and mobile platforms for their banking needs. Given these accelerating digital banking trends and ships and retail shopping behaviors, we announced today the decision not to renew our existing in-store branch contracts with Stop & Shop in Connecticut, and New York upon expiration. We operate 140 Stop & Shop branches, 84 in Connecticut and 56 in New York. Our contracting Connecticut expires at the end of January 2022, while the New York contract goes to midyear 2022. Currently, discussions with Stop & Shop on renewal terms are ongoing. Although our Stop & Shop relationship has provided meaningful value to the bank and its customers over more than 2 decades, this decision provides us the opportunity to further optimize our branch network while providing the same level of personal line service across each of our channels. In addition, cost savings achieved over time by not renewing these contracts will enable further investment in our digital capabilities and traditional branch network. We remain committed to serving customers in a manner in which they want to interact with us, whether it be in person at a branch, virtually through our online and mobile platforms or a combination of both. We are confident customer and deposit retention will be very strong due to the customer portfolio profile of our Stop & Shop branches, increasing adoption of digital platforms, expanded traditional brand footprint, proximity between in-store and traditional locations and trends in retail shopping behavior.
While in-store branches comprise approximately half of our total branches in Connecticut and New York, only 40% of the customers and 30% of the deposit balances are domiciled in these locations. In addition, in-store customers carry balances that are only 64% from traditional branch customers. Furthermore, only 20% of our branch deposit balances in these 2 states are associated with customers that actually visited an in-store branch in 2020. 
As previously mentioned, customers are increasingly utilizing our online and mobile platforms. Digital engagement has increased significantly year-over-year. For example, mobile log ons are up 40%. Digital enrollments have increased 25%. Mobile wallet transactions are up 162%, and we have experienced a 66% increase in active mobile deposit customers. Notably, our in-store customers are 13% more digitally active than those at traditional branches, and only 10% of deposit balances are associated with customers that use Stop & Shop branches in 2020, but did not utilize the digital channel. Importantly, the strength of our hub-and-spoke branch model we built over time, created a high level of overlap between our in-store and traditional branches. As such, 75% of our Stop & Shop branches and 77% of our Stop & Shop branch deposits are domiciled within 5 miles of one of our traditional locations. In addition, recent bank acquisitions of Sofec in New York, Farmington and United and Connecticut have expanded and better optimize our traditional branch footprint in these states as well as provided customers a greater number of convenient drive up facilities. Finally, changing trends in retail shopping behavior has become apparent. The availability of delivery and curbside pickup options, which have become more prominent during the pandemic have impacted foot traffic inside stores. Additionally, discount stores and wholesale clubs and convenience stores have increased their share of grocery spend, while share of the traditional grocery stores has declined.
With that, here is David to discuss the fourth quarter results."

I will begin on Slide 4 with an overview of the fourth quarter. We concluded the year with a solid financial performance in the fourth quarter.Operating earnings of $147.7 million, increased 2% linked quarter. On a per common share basi",1571,"Thank you, Jack. I will begin on Slide 4 with an overview of the fourth quarter. We concluded the year with a solid financial performance in the fourth quarter.
Operating earnings of $147.7 million, increased 2% linked quarter. On a per common share basis, operating earnings were $0.35, up $0.01. The provision for credit losses on loans decreased for the second consecutive quarter to $14.7 million and further strengthened the allowance for credit losses to total loans by 3 basis points to 97 basis points or 102 basis points, excluding PPP loans. Operating pre-provision net revenue of $196.6 million, declined 3% from the third quarter due to modestly lower net interest income, partially offset by slightly higher fee income and lower expenses.
Finally, it is important to note the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter reflected a $7.1 million benefit related to the revaluation of certain state deferred tax assets.
Moving to Slide 5. Net interest income of $382.8 million decreased $8.6 million or 2% from the third quarter. The decline was driven by the loan portfolio, which unfavorably impacted net interest income by $15.5 million. This headwind was partially offset by lower deposit costs, which benefited net interest income by $6.4 million. Lower borrowings and higher balances in the securities portfolio also collectively benefited net interest income by $500,000. Notably, during 2020, we have reduced borrowings by over $4 billion on a period end basis, as a result of $8.5 billion of deposit growth since the beginning of the year.
Net interest income included $20 million from PPP during the quarter, which consist of $15.4 million in fees and $4.6 million in net interest income. These results reflect $6 million related to loans were given in the quarter.
As displayed on Slide 6, net interest margin of 284 was 13 basis points lower than the third quarter, primarily due to increased excess liquidity, which unfavorably impacted the margin by 9 basis points.
Lower yields in the loan and securities portfolios also unfavorably impacted the margin by 7 basis points and 2 basis points, respectively. In the loan portfolio, new business yields remained lower than the total portfolio yield. However, new business yields and credit spreads modestly improved in the quarter. The largest offset to these negative effects was our continued discipline managing deposit pricing, which benefited the margin by 5 basis points. Average deposit costs were 24 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to 29 basis points in the third quarter, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of lower deposit costs.
Finally, PPP had a 2 basis point favorable impact net interest margin for the quarter.
Turning to loans on Slide 7. Average balances were down $792 million or 2% from the third quarter. While period-end loans decreased approximately $1.4 billion or 3%. The loan portfolio continues to be impacted by reduced retail balances and a low demand for our commercial real estate and middle market C&I businesses due to limited economic activity. On a period end basis, retail loans decreased $715 million, mostly attributable to our planned reduction in residential mortgages, which lowered balances by $577 million from the close of the third quarter.
Commercial loans were down $647 million, which included a $289 million decline in PPP balances due to forgiveness and a combined $107 million reduction in our runoff portfolios.
Conversely, loans benefited from record mortgage warehouse back balances and strong growth by lead. Mortgage warehouse period end balances closed the quarter at $3.4 billion, up $161 million from September 30, as results continue to be driven by robust mortgage origination activity and the addition of new customer relationships.
Lease average and period end balances grew 5% and 6%, respectively, from the third quarter. Balances in the transactional portion of the New York multifamily portfolio, which is in runoff mode, ended the quarter at $512 million, down $47 million linked quarter and $225 million for the year. In addition, the period on balance for the United Loans we have chosen to run off was $845 million. A decline of $60 million from September 30 and $268 million since year-end 2019.
Moving to deposits on Slide 8. Average balances were up $1.1 billion or 2% from the third quarter, while period end balances grew $2.5 billion or 5%. The growth which helped to lower the loan-to-deposit ratio to 84% was broad-based as balances increased across our retail, commercial and municipal businesses. Both average and period end back balances were up across all categories with the exception of time deposits as higher cost CDs rolled off. Average time balances decreased $865 million linked quarter, while on a period end basis, balances were down $668 million. The decrease in time deposits is a reflection of customer preference for liquidity during this uncertain economic and low interest rate environment.
Importantly, period end noninterest-bearing deposits increased for the seventh consecutive quarter. Balances of $15.9 billion were up $1.8 billion from the end of the third quarter and $6.1 billion for the year. Noninterest-bearing deposits now account for more than 30% of total period end balances, up from 22% a year ago.
Turning to Slide 9. Noninterest income of $178.2 million, increased $77.1 million or 76% linked quarter. As referenced earlier, we completed the sale of People's United insurance Agency, realizing a $75.9 million gain. Excluding this gain, operating noninterest income of $102.3 million grew $1.2 million or 1% from the third quarter. This increase was driven by commercial bank lending fees, which were up $2.8 million, primarily driven by higher pre loan prepayment fees, an increase in customer interest rate swap income of $1 million and higher operating lease income and cash management fees, which collectively benefited noninterest income by $800,000.
In addition, other noninterest income was up $2.2 million, primarily due to the mark-to-market of 1 equity security position. The largest offset to these increases was a $5.6 million reduction in insurance revenues due to the sale of PUIA in early November.
On Slide 10, noninterest expense of $293.4 million decreased $200,000 linked quarter. The fourth quarter included $4.9 million of nonoperating costs, an increase of $300,000 compared to the third quarter, and they were in the following categories: the $3.8 million in other noninterest expense, $800,000 in professional and outside services and $300,000 in equipment and occupancy and equipment.
Excluding nonoperating costs, noninterest expense of $288.5 million decreased $500,000 compared to the previous quarter. Noninterest expense benefited from lower regulatory assessments and operating lease expense, which were down $1.5 million and $800,000, respectively, in the third quarter. Conversely, noninterest expense was unfavorably impacted by higher costs in occupancy and equipment of $2.4 million due to seasonality and professional and outside services of $1.4 million related to the timing of projects.
Briefly on Slide 11, the efficiency ratio of 55.5% increased 170 basis points linked quarter, primarily due to modestly lower revenues. As I stated last quarter, we will remain very diligent in our management of expenses and continue to be focused on enhancing operating leverage as we move forward in this current low interest rate environment.
As Jack mentioned earlier, our asset quality remains excellent. As displayed on Slide 12, net loan charge-offs to average total loans of 12 basis points improved 3 basis points linked quarter. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and REO of 78 basis points to 7 basis points higher compared to the third quarter. This increase was attributable to our Motor Coach portfolio in the People's Capital and leasing business within equipment finance. The Motor Coach segment has been significantly impacted by the pandemic, primarily due to the decline in tourism.
Looking at Slide 13. It is evident the gain related to the PUIA sale had a significant favorable impact on fourth quarter returns. However, on an operating basis, returns were generally consistent with the third quarter. Operating return on average assets of 95 basis points increased 1 basis point, while operating return on average tangible equity of 13.3% was down slightly from 13.4%.
Finally, on Slide 14, capital ratios continue to be strong given our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management. It is again important to note, adjusting for PPP loans, the proforma tier 1 leverage ratio at quarter end is 8.7% for the holding company compared to 8.4% and 9.1% for the bank compared to 8.7%. Additionally, the TCE ratio, excluding PPP, is approximately 7.8% compared to the reported 7.5%.
Before turning the call over to Jack to go over our 2021 outlook, I wanted to mention that we are still in the process of performing our annual goodwill impairment assessment. Additional time is necessary to complete the analysis given the complexities brought about by the macroeconomic effects of the pandemic, particularly the current and projected low interest rate environment and a decline in bank stock valuations last fall, including on the company's annual assessment date of October 1. Any potential goodwill impairment charge could be material to reported earnings, but would represent a noncash charge and have no effect on cash balances, liquidity or tangible equity. In addition, because goodwill and other intangible assets are not included in the calculation of regulatory capital, our well-capitalized regulatory capital ratios would not be affected by this potential noncash expense. The analysis will be completed prior to the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K with the SEC.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jack."

Looking forward, we are cautiously optimistic about the economy as society continues to adjust to the pandemic. In particular, we are pleased banking activity trends continue to improve despite ongoing social distancing protocols. We are also hopeful the vaccines will help restore a bit of normalcy and potentially help to accelerate economic improvement in the latter half of the year. However, a lot of uncertainty remains. While we enter 2021 in a position of strength, the recent surge in the virus nationwide and a prolonged low interest rate environment presents a challenging backdrop for loan growth, net interest income and margin. Despite these headwinds, we are very confident in the resilience of our franchise to maintain strong execution across our operations, further invest in digital capabilities and deliver exceptional service to customers. With that backdrop in mind, let me outline our full year outlook for 2021, as listed on Slide 15. It is important to note, our announcement today on the decision not to renew our existing in-store branch contracts with Stop & Shop will not have an impact on 2021 financial results.
We expect to grow loans, excluding PPP balances in the range of 0% to 3% on a period end basis. PPP balances totaling $2.3 billion at year-end, our current expectation is these loans will be forgiven in the first half of 2021. Secondly, we anticipate anticipated period-end balance deposit balances to change in the range of down 2% to up 2%. This expectation is reflective of the significant deposit growth in 2020 and uncertainty of additional government stimulus measures. We expect net interest income to decrease in the range of 2% to 4%. Embedded in this outlook is the expectation for net interest margin to be in the range of 2.85 to 2.95. This net interest margin range is derived from many different factors, one of which is an assumption of no change in the Fed funds rate during the year.
Operating noninterest income is expected to grow in the range of 1% to 3% from an adjusted 2020 operating base of $372 million, which excludes $28 million of noninterest income from the PUIA and a $17 million gain from the sale of loans acquired in the United transactions. Operating noninterest expense, which excludes merger-related costs, is anticipated to be in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.18 billion as compared to $1.142 billion in 2020, which excludes $23 million of People's United insurance expense. This expense outlook reflects our continued commitment to invest in digital capabilities to further enhance efficiencies and convenience of customers. We also expect to maintain excellent credit quality with a provision in the range of $60 million to $80 million. The wider range compared to prior year's outlook is indicative of continued uncertainty caused by the pandemic. In addition, we anticipate our effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of 20% to 22%.
Finally, we plan to maintain strong capital levels with an expectation that at year-end, holding company common equity tier 1 capital ratio will be in the range of 10% to 10.5%.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, please proceed to the Q&A portion of the call."

So there's a large opportunity for us over time in that. And as we -- as Jack said in his comments, we've got -- there's contractual rundown periods for this. So from a financial perspective, there's a large opportunity for us over time. We spent a lot of time on this decision, thinking about it. And the -- Jack went through a lot of statistics in his prepared comments about seeing substantially higher levels of digital engagement, the fact that some of the recent acquisitions have changed the complexion of our traditional branch network, which gives us confidence that we can do this with a very reasonable and small risk of deposit attrition over time."

And it really is that many of our Stop & Shop branches are fairly close to a traditional branch. So we've always recognized that as a business model risk going into the in stores, and we intentionally created that hub-and-spoke approach.

So as we look forward, we'll start to see some growth in the residential mortgage line.

So the $285 million to $295 million is, as Jack said, is predicated on no change in the Fed funds rate for the year. We have seen a modest steepening of the yield curve and think we'll see a bit more as the year unfolds. The some of the components that we're thinking about, the one that really came to bear on the margin in the fourth quarter was the excess liquidity, right? So we had, if you look on the short-term investment line in the press release, you'll see that we were up $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter. The reality is that money is sitting at the Fed right now at 10 basis points. So that had in '20, in the fourth quarter, a 9 basis point negative impact to the margin. We invested -- we grew the securities portfolio, about $1 billion in the fourth quarter, and we are continuing to deploy some of that excess liquidity into the securities market. So we'll be able to reverse some of that 9 basis point drag there. I think that will probably offset some of the positive benefit we think we'll get in the payoff of the PPP fees, right, which, in Jack's comments, talked about in the first half of the year. So about half of our loan book is floating, and it's really not going to change much, but half of the loan book is fixed rate, and there's about $5 billion in equipment finance in there, that cash flows fairly nicely. And each quarter, we expect to get a little better reinvestment yields on that half of the loan portfolio. So that and deploying some of that excess liquidity and picking up a little over 100 to 120 basis points on that excess liquidity are some of the major drivers we're thinking about around that loan guidance. I'm sorry, around the margin guidance."

There's a clear preference for liquidity amongst customers. And because the industry is this is an industry issue.

The good news, when I think about commercial banking fees is the -- even in the this year, we've seen nice syndication fees out of our efforts to build those capabilities. We're leading more credit deals. We're earning servicing fees on some of those deals, whether it's in our health care, our fund banking group or even our mortgage warehouse group. So the commercial be activity and generation capabilities continue to get stronger. Last year was a tough year for our interest rate swap business. We were down about $9 million in aggregate year-over-year. And we're -- we stand ready for every customer interest we have. It's just when origination activities are subdued, those activities are also subdued. As soon as activity levels come back, we'll see a resumption of those fees. And they are the type of fees that will come back strongly and quickly."

We appreciate everyone joining us today and hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy.Let's begin by turning to the full year overview on Slide 2. We are pleased with our performance in 2020, espe",1257,"Thank you, Andrew, and good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today and hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy.
Let's begin by turning to the full year overview on Slide 2. We are pleased with our performance in 2020, especially in light of the uncertain economic environment caused by the pandemic. Full year financial and operating results were strong and reflect the resilience of People's United, its employees and customers. Net income of $573 million increased 10% from a year ago. And on a per common share basis, net income was up $0.05 to $1.32. Operating earnings of $535 million or $1.27 per common share declined 3% and $0.12, respectively. It's important to note that we completed the sale of People's United Insurance Agency in November and realized a pretax gain net of expenses of $75.9 million, which is not included in operating earnings. Pre-provision net revenue of $827 million increased $89 million or 12% from a year ago, reflecting the success of recent acquisitions and solid execution across 4 operations.
Total operating revenues of nearly $2 billion increased 8.5%, driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by modestly lower fee revenues. Operating expenses of $1.165 billion, which includes a full year of United and Belmont results were up 6%. Notably, operating expenses ended the year below the level -- the lower end of the 2021 outlook range we provided a year ago of $1.19 billion. The increase in revenues, along with our continued emphasis on controlling expenses and realizing projected cost savings from acquisitions, lowered the full year efficiency ratio of 160 basis points to 54.2%, marking the seventh consecutive year of improvement.
Turning to the balance sheet. Period-end loans and deposits increased 1% and 20%, respectively, from year-end 2019. Excluding PPV, the loan portfolio decreased approximately $2 billion or 5%, driven by lower retail balances of approximately $2.3 billion, modestly offset by commercial loan growth of $251 million. The decline in retail balances was mostly due to our planned reduction of residential mortgages as we remix the balance sheet with a focus on higher-yielding portfolios. The impact of the pandemic on the economy was evident in the commercial portfolio throughout the year. Demand within the commercial real estate and C&I middle market businesses was limited due to reduced economic activity and funding provided by PPP loans. Conversely, our mortgage warehouse and lease businesses experienced strong growth.
Mortgage warehouse ended 2020 with a record balances of $3.4 billion, which more than doubled from 2019, while lease period end balances increased 19% from the prior year. Lease, which we acquired in 2017 has been a terrific addition to People's United franchise. Reef has successfully leveraged the liquidity and funding provided by the bank and other synergies to achieve significant growth while maintaining both excellent asset quality and high yields. Lease balances ended 2020 at nearly $2 billion, up from approximately $730 million at the time of the acquisition.
Asset quality remained excellent as the net charge-offs to average total loans were 11 basis points for the full year. These results are indicative of the company's conservative approach to underwriting, diversified loan portfolio and deep customer relationships. We are particularly pleased by the continued reduction in loan deferrals, which ended the year at $271 million or 0.6% of total loans, down from $1.6 billion or 3.5% of total loans at the close of the third quarter. Additionally, deferrals have continued to decline since year-end. As of January 15, total deferrals were down to $110 million or less than 0.3% of total loans.
We remain committed to supporting our high-quality customer base and help them navigate these difficult economic times. Consistent with our intentions discussed last quarter, we provided post second deferral modifications to customers in need of further assistance. Approximately $1 billion in loans received modifications. The majority of the modifications are in commercial real estate with the largest concentrations within the hospitality sector as expected.
Moving on to Slide 3. As consumer preferences evolve to more digitally driven experiences, we have continually enhanced our technology capabilities to deliver value, provide convenience and create efficiencies. As a result, customers are increasingly utilizing our online and mobile platforms for their banking needs. Given these accelerating digital banking trends and ships and retail shopping behaviors, we announced today the decision not to renew our existing in-store branch contracts with Stop & Shop in Connecticut, and New York upon expiration. We operate 140 Stop & Shop branches, 84 in Connecticut and 56 in New York. Our contracting Connecticut expires at the end of January 2022, while the New York contract goes to midyear 2022. Currently, discussions with Stop & Shop on renewal terms are ongoing. Although our Stop & Shop relationship has provided meaningful value to the bank and its customers over more than 2 decades, this decision provides us the opportunity to further optimize our branch network while providing the same level of personal line service across each of our channels. In addition, cost savings achieved over time by not renewing these contracts will enable further investment in our digital capabilities and traditional branch network. We remain committed to serving customers in a manner in which they want to interact with us, whether it be in person at a branch, virtually through our online and mobile platforms or a combination of both. We are confident customer and deposit retention will be very strong due to the customer portfolio profile of our Stop & Shop branches, increasing adoption of digital platforms, expanded traditional brand footprint, proximity between in-store and traditional locations and trends in retail shopping behavior.
While in-store branches comprise approximately half of our total branches in Connecticut and New York, only 40% of the customers and 30% of the deposit balances are domiciled in these locations. In addition, in-store customers carry balances that are only 64% from traditional branch customers. Furthermore, only 20% of our branch deposit balances in these 2 states are associated with customers that actually visited an in-store branch in 2020. 
As previously mentioned, customers are increasingly utilizing our online and mobile platforms. Digital engagement has increased significantly year-over-year. For example, mobile log ons are up 40%. Digital enrollments have increased 25%. Mobile wallet transactions are up 162%, and we have experienced a 66% increase in active mobile deposit customers. Notably, our in-store customers are 13% more digitally active than those at traditional branches, and only 10% of deposit balances are associated with customers that use Stop & Shop branches in 2020, but did not utilize the digital channel. Importantly, the strength of our hub-and-spoke branch model we built over time, created a high level of overlap between our in-store and traditional branches. As such, 75% of our Stop & Shop branches and 77% of our Stop & Shop branch deposits are domiciled within 5 miles of one of our traditional locations. In addition, recent bank acquisitions of Sofec in New York, Farmington and United and Connecticut have expanded and better optimize our traditional branch footprint in these states as well as provided customers a greater number of convenient drive up facilities. Finally, changing trends in retail shopping behavior has become apparent. The availability of delivery and curbside pickup options, which have become more prominent during the pandemic have impacted foot traffic inside stores. Additionally, discount stores and wholesale clubs and convenience stores have increased their share of grocery spend, while share of the traditional grocery stores has declined.
With that, here is David to discuss the fourth quarter results."

The provision for credit losses on loans decreased for the second consecutive quarter to $14.7 million and further strengthened the allowance for credit losses to total loans by 3 basis points to 97 basis points or 102 basis points, excluding PPP loans. Operating pre-provision net revenue of $196.6 million, declined 3% from the third quarter due to modestly lower net interest income, partially offset by slightly higher fee income and lower expenses.
Finally, it is important to note the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter reflected a $7.1 million benefit related to the revaluation of certain state deferred tax assets.
Moving to Slide 5. Net interest income of $382.8 million decreased $8.6 million or 2% from the third quarter. The decline was driven by the loan portfolio, which unfavorably impacted net interest income by $15.5 million. This headwind was partially offset by lower deposit costs, which benefited net interest income by $6.4 million. Lower borrowings and higher balances in the securities portfolio also collectively benefited net interest income by $500,000. Notably, during 2020, we have reduced borrowings by over $4 billion on a period end basis, as a result of $8.5 billion of deposit growth since the beginning of the year.
Net interest income included $20 million from PPP during the quarter, which consist of $15.4 million in fees and $4.6 million in net interest income. These results reflect $6 million related to loans were given in the quarter.
As displayed on Slide 6, net interest margin of 284 was 13 basis points lower than the third quarter, primarily due to increased excess liquidity, which unfavorably impacted the margin by 9 basis points.
Lower yields in the loan and securities portfolios also unfavorably impacted the margin by 7 basis points and 2 basis points, respectively. In the loan portfolio, new business yields remained lower than the total portfolio yield. However, new business yields and credit spreads modestly improved in the quarter. The largest offset to these negative effects was our continued discipline managing deposit pricing, which benefited the margin by 5 basis points. Average deposit costs were 24 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to 29 basis points in the third quarter, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of lower deposit costs.
Finally, PPP had a 2 basis point favorable impact net interest margin for the quarter.
Turning to loans on Slide 7. Average balances were down $792 million or 2% from the third quarter. While period-end loans decreased approximately $1.4 billion or 3%. The loan portfolio continues to be impacted by reduced retail balances and a low demand for our commercial real estate and middle market C&I businesses due to limited economic activity. On a period end basis, retail loans decreased $715 million, mostly attributable to our planned reduction in residential mortgages, which lowered balances by $577 million from the close of the third quarter.
Commercial loans were down $647 million, which included a $289 million decline in PPP balances due to forgiveness and a combined $107 million reduction in our runoff portfolios.
Conversely, loans benefited from record mortgage warehouse back balances and strong growth by lead. Mortgage warehouse period end balances closed the quarter at $3.4 billion, up $161 million from September 30, as results continue to be driven by robust mortgage origination activity and the addition of new customer relationships.
Lease average and period end balances grew 5% and 6%, respectively, from the third quarter. Balances in the transactional portion of the New York multifamily portfolio, which is in runoff mode, ended the quarter at $512 million, down $47 million linked quarter and $225 million for the year. In addition, the period on balance for the United Loans we have chosen to run off was $845 million. A decline of $60 million from September 30 and $268 million since year-end 2019.
Moving to deposits on Slide 8. Average balances were up $1.1 billion or 2% from the third quarter, while period end balances grew $2.5 billion or 5%. The growth which helped to lower the loan-to-deposit ratio to 84% was broad-based as balances increased across our retail, commercial and municipal businesses. Both average and period end back balances were up across all categories with the exception of time deposits as higher cost CDs rolled off. Average time balances decreased $865 million linked quarter, while on a period end basis, balances were down $668 million. The decrease in time deposits is a reflection of customer preference for liquidity during this uncertain economic and low interest rate environment.
Importantly, period end noninterest-bearing deposits increased for the seventh consecutive quarter. Balances of $15.9 billion were up $1.8 billion from the end of the third quarter and $6.1 billion for the year. Noninterest-bearing deposits now account for more than 30% of total period end balances, up from 22% a year ago.
Turning to Slide 9. Noninterest income of $178.2 million, increased $77.1 million or 76% linked quarter. As referenced earlier, we completed the sale of People's United insurance Agency, realizing a $75.9 million gain. Excluding this gain, operating noninterest income of $102.3 million grew $1.2 million or 1% from the third quarter. This increase was driven by commercial bank lending fees, which were up $2.8 million, primarily driven by higher pre loan prepayment fees, an increase in customer interest rate swap income of $1 million and higher operating lease income and cash management fees, which collectively benefited noninterest income by $800,000.
In addition, other noninterest income was up $2.2 million, primarily due to the mark-to-market of 1 equity security position. The largest offset to these increases was a $5.6 million reduction in insurance revenues due to the sale of PUIA in early November.
On Slide 10, noninterest expense of $293.4 million decreased $200,000 linked quarter. The fourth quarter included $4.9 million of nonoperating costs, an increase of $300,000 compared to the third quarter, and they were in the following categories: the $3.8 million in other noninterest expense, $800,000 in professional and outside services and $300,000 in equipment and occupancy and equipment.
Excluding nonoperating costs, noninterest expense of $288.5 million decreased $500,000 compared to the previous quarter. Noninterest expense benefited from lower regulatory assessments and operating lease expense, which were down $1.5 million and $800,000, respectively, in the third quarter. Conversely, noninterest expense was unfavorably impacted by higher costs in occupancy and equipment of $2.4 million due to seasonality and professional and outside services of $1.4 million related to the timing of projects.
Briefly on Slide 11, the efficiency ratio of 55.5% increased 170 basis points linked quarter, primarily due to modestly lower revenues. As I stated last quarter, we will remain very diligent in our management of expenses and continue to be focused on enhancing operating leverage as we move forward in this current low interest rate environment.
As Jack mentioned earlier, our asset quality remains excellent. As displayed on Slide 12, net loan charge-offs to average total loans of 12 basis points improved 3 basis points linked quarter. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and REO of 78 basis points to 7 basis points higher compared to the third quarter. This increase was attributable to our Motor Coach portfolio in the People's Capital and leasing business within equipment finance. The Motor Coach segment has been significantly impacted by the pandemic, primarily due to the decline in tourism.
Looking at Slide 13. It is evident the gain related to the PUIA sale had a significant favorable impact on fourth quarter returns. However, on an operating basis, returns were generally consistent with the third quarter. Operating return on average assets of 95 basis points increased 1 basis point, while operating return on average tangible equity of 13.3% was down slightly from 13.4%.
Finally, on Slide 14, capital ratios continue to be strong given our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management. It is again important to note, adjusting for PPP loans, the proforma tier 1 leverage ratio at quarter end is 8.7% for the holding company compared to 8.4% and 9.1% for the bank compared to 8.7%. Additionally, the TCE ratio, excluding PPP, is approximately 7.8% compared to the reported 7.5%.
Before turning the call over to Jack to go over our 2021 outlook, I wanted to mention that we are still in the process of performing our annual goodwill impairment assessment. Additional time is necessary to complete the analysis given the complexities brought about by the macroeconomic effects of the pandemic, particularly the current and projected low interest rate environment and a decline in bank stock valuations last fall, including on the company's annual assessment date of October 1. Any potential goodwill impairment charge could be material to reported earnings, but would represent a noncash charge and have no effect on cash balances, liquidity or tangible equity. In addition, because goodwill and other intangible assets are not included in the calculation of regulatory capital, our well-capitalized regulatory capital ratios would not be affected by this potential noncash expense. The analysis will be completed prior to the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K with the SEC.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jack."

Looking forward, we are cautiously optimistic about the economy as society continues to adjust to the pandemic. In particular, we are pleased banking activity trends continue to improve despite ongoing social distancing protocols. We are also hopeful the vaccines will help restore a bit of normalcy and potentially help to accelerate economic improvement in the latter half of the year. However, a lot of uncertainty remains. While we enter 2021 in a position of strength, the recent surge in the virus nationwide and a prolonged low interest rate environment presents a challenging backdrop for loan growth, net interest income and margin. Despite these headwinds, we are very confident in the resilience of our franchise to maintain strong execution across our operations, further invest in digital capabilities and deliver exceptional service to customers. With that backdrop in mind, let me outline our full year outlook for 2021, as listed on Slide 15. It is important to note, our announcement today on the decision not to renew our existing in-store branch contracts with Stop & Shop will not have an impact on 2021 financial results.
We expect to grow loans, excluding PPP balances in the range of 0% to 3% on a period end basis. PPP balances totaling $2.3 billion at year-end, our current expectation is these loans will be forgiven in the first half of 2021. Secondly, we anticipate anticipated period-end balance deposit balances to change in the range of down 2% to up 2%. This expectation is reflective of the significant deposit growth in 2020 and uncertainty of additional government stimulus measures. We expect net interest income to decrease in the range of 2% to 4%. Embedded in this outlook is the expectation for net interest margin to be in the range of 2.85 to 2.95. This net interest margin range is derived from many different factors, one of which is an assumption of no change in the Fed funds rate during the year.
Operating noninterest income is expected to grow in the range of 1% to 3% from an adjusted 2020 operating base of $372 million, which excludes $28 million of noninterest income from the PUIA and a $17 million gain from the sale of loans acquired in the United transactions. Operating noninterest expense, which excludes merger-related costs, is anticipated to be in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.18 billion as compared to $1.142 billion in 2020, which excludes $23 million of People's United insurance expense. This expense outlook reflects our continued commitment to invest in digital capabilities to further enhance efficiencies and convenience of customers. We also expect to maintain excellent credit quality with a provision in the range of $60 million to $80 million. The wider range compared to prior year's outlook is indicative of continued uncertainty caused by the pandemic. In addition, we anticipate our effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of 20% to 22%.
Finally, we plan to maintain strong capital levels with an expectation that at year-end, holding company common equity tier 1 capital ratio will be in the range of 10% to 10.5%.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, please proceed to the Q&A portion of the call."

So there's a large opportunity for us over time in that. And as we -- as Jack said in his comments, we've got -- there's contractual rundown periods for this. So from a financial perspective, there's a large opportunity for us over time. We spent a lot of time on this decision, thinking about it. And the -- Jack went through a lot of statistics in his prepared comments about seeing substantially higher levels of digital engagement, the fact that some of the recent acquisitions have changed the complexion of our traditional branch network, which gives us confidence that we can do this with a very reasonable and small risk of deposit attrition over time."

So we've always recognized that as a business model risk going into the in stores, and we intentionally created that hub-and-spoke approach.

So the $285 million to $295 million is, as Jack said, is predicated on no change in the Fed funds rate for the year. We have seen a modest steepening of the yield curve and think we'll see a bit more as the year unfolds. The some of the components that we're thinking about, the one that really came to bear on the margin in the fourth quarter was the excess liquidity, right? So we had, if you look on the short-term investment line in the press release, you'll see that we were up $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter. The reality is that money is sitting at the Fed right now at 10 basis points. So that had in '20, in the fourth quarter, a 9 basis point negative impact to the margin. We invested -- we grew the securities portfolio, about $1 billion in the fourth quarter, and we are continuing to deploy some of that excess liquidity into the securities market. So we'll be able to reverse some of that 9 basis point drag there. I think that will probably offset some of the positive benefit we think we'll get in the payoff of the PPP fees, right, which, in Jack's comments, talked about in the first half of the year. So about half of our loan book is floating, and it's really not going to change much, but half of the loan book is fixed rate, and there's about $5 billion in equipment finance in there, that cash flows fairly nicely. And each quarter, we expect to get a little better reinvestment yields on that half of the loan portfolio. So that and deploying some of that excess liquidity and picking up a little over 100 to 120 basis points on that excess liquidity are some of the major drivers we're thinking about around that loan guidance. I'm sorry, around the margin guidance."

The -- so that's the 1 that's hard to call, and that's the good news, bad news piece that we experienced that every year. The good news, when I think about commercial banking fees is the -- even in the this year, we've seen nice syndication fees out of our efforts to build those capabilities. We're leading more credit deals. We're earning servicing fees on some of those deals, whether it's in our health care, our fund banking group or even our mortgage warehouse group. So the commercial be activity and generation capabilities continue to get stronger. Last year was a tough year for our interest rate swap business. We were down about $9 million in aggregate year-over-year. And we're -- we stand ready for every customer interest we have. It's just when origination activities are subdued, those activities are also subdued. As soon as activity levels come back, we'll see a resumption of those fees. And they are the type of fees that will come back strongly and quickly."

We appreciate everyone joining us today and hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy.Let's begin by turning to the full year overview on Slide 2. We are pleased with our performance in 2020, espe",1253,"Thank you, Andrew, and good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today and hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy.
Let's begin by turning to the full year overview on Slide 2. We are pleased with our performance in 2020, especially in light of the uncertain economic environment caused by the pandemic. Full year financial and operating results were strong and reflect the resilience of People's United, its employees and customers. Net income of $573 million increased 10% from a year ago. And on a per common share basis, net income was up $0.05 to $1.32. Operating earnings of $535 million or $1.27 per common share declined 3% and $0.12, respectively. It's important to note that we completed the sale of People's United Insurance Agency in November and realized a pretax gain net of expenses of $75.9 million, which is not included in operating earnings. Pre-provision net revenue of $827 million increased $89 million or 12% from a year ago, reflecting the success of recent acquisitions and solid execution across core operations.
Total operating revenues of nearly $2 billion increased 8.5%, driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by modestly lower fee revenues. Operating expenses of $1.165 billion, which includes a full year of United and Belmont results were up 6%. Notably, operating expenses ended the year below the level -- the lower end of the 2021 outlook range we provided a year ago of $1.19 billion. The increase in revenues, along with our continued emphasis on controlling expenses and realizing projected cost savings from acquisitions lowered the full year efficiency ratio 160 basis points to 54.2%, marking the seventh consecutive year of improvement.
Turning to the balance sheet. Period-end loans and deposits increased 1% and 20%, respectively, from year-end 2019. Excluding PPP, the loan portfolio decreased approximately $2 billion or 5%, driven by lower retail balances of approximately $2.3 billion, modestly offset by commercial loan growth of $251 million. The decline in retail balances was mostly due to our planned reduction of residential mortgages as we remix the balance sheet with a focus on higher-yielding portfolios. The impact of the pandemic on the economy was evident in the commercial portfolio throughout the year. Demand within the commercial real estate and C&I middle market businesses was limited due to reduced economic activity and funding provided by PPP loans. Conversely, our mortgage warehouse and LEAF businesses experienced strong growth.
Mortgage warehouse ended 2020 with a record balances of $3.4 billion, which more than doubled from 2019, while LEAF period-end balances increased 19% from the prior year. LEAF, which we acquired in 2017, has been a terrific addition to People's United franchise. LEAF has successfully leveraged the liquidity and funding provided by the bank and other synergies to achieve significant growth while maintaining both excellent asset quality and high yields. LEAF's balances ended 2020 at nearly $2 billion, up from approximately $730 million at the time of the acquisition.
Asset quality remained excellent as the net charge-offs to average total loans were 11 basis points for the full year. These results are indicative of the company's conservative approach to underwriting, diversified loan portfolio and deep customer relationships. We are particularly pleased by the continued reduction in loan deferrals, which ended the year at $271 million or 0.6% of total loans, down from $1.6 billion or 3.5% of total loans at the close of the third quarter. Additionally, deferrals have continued to decline since year-end. As of January 15, total deferrals were down to $110 million or less than 0.3% of total loans.
We remain committed to supporting our high-quality customer base and help them navigate these difficult economic times. Consistent with our intentions discussed last quarter, we provided post second deferral modifications to customers in need of further assistance. Approximately $1 billion in loans received modifications. The majority of the modifications are in commercial real estate with the largest concentrations within the hospitality sector as expected.
Moving on to Slide 3. As consumer preferences evolve to more digitally driven experiences, we have continually enhanced our technology capabilities to deliver value, provide convenience and create efficiencies. As a result, customers are increasingly utilizing our online and mobile platforms for their banking needs. Given these accelerating digital banking trends and shifts in retail shopping behaviors, we announced today the decision not to renew our existing in-store branch contracts with Stop & Shop in Connecticut and New York upon expiration. We operate 140 Stop & Shop branches, 84 in Connecticut and 56 in New York. Our contract in Connecticut expires at the end of January 2022, while the New York contract goes to midyear 2022. Currently, discussions with Stop & Shop on renewal terms are ongoing. Although our Stop & Shop relationship has provided meaningful value to the bank and its customers over more than 2 decades, this decision provides us the opportunity to further optimize our branch network while providing the same level of personalized service across each of our channels. In addition, cost savings achieved over time by not renewing these contracts will enable further investment in our digital capabilities and traditional branch network. We remain committed to serving customers in a manner in which they want to interact with us, whether it be in person, at a branch, virtually through our online and mobile platforms or a combination of both. We are confident customer and deposit retention will be very strong due to the customer portfolio profile of our Stop & Shop branches, increasing adoption of digital platforms, expanded traditional branch footprint, proximity between in-store and traditional locations and trends in retail shopping behavior.
While in-store branches comprise approximately half of our total branches in Connecticut and New York, only 40% of the customers and 30% of the deposit balances are domiciled in these locations. In addition, in-store customers carry balances that are only 64% from traditional branch customers. Furthermore, only 20% of our branch deposit balances in these 2 states are associated with customers that actually visited an in-store branch in 2020.
As previously mentioned, customers are increasingly utilizing our online and mobile platforms. Digital engagement has increased significantly year-over-year. For example, mobile log-ons are up 40%, digital enrollments have increased 25%, mobile wallet transactions are up 162% and we have experienced a 66% increase in active mobile deposit customers. Notably, our in-store customers are 13% more digitally active than those at traditional branches, and only 10% of deposit balances are associated with customers that used Stop & Shop branches in 2020, but did not utilize a digital channel. Importantly, the strength of our hub-and-spoke branch model we built over time created a high level of overlap between our in-store and traditional branches. As such, 75% of our Stop & Shop branches and 77% of our Stop & Shop branch deposits are domiciled within 5 miles of one of our traditional locations. In addition, recent bank acquisitions of Suffolk in New York, Farmington and United in Connecticut have expanded and better optimized our traditional branch footprint in these states as well as provided customers a greater number of convenient drive-up facilities. 
Finally, changing trend in retail shopping behavior has become apparent. The availability of delivery and curbside pickup options, which have become more prominent during the pandemic, have impacted foot traffic inside stores. Additionally, discount stores and wholesale clubs and convenience stores have increased their share of grocery spend, while share of the traditional grocery stores has declined.
With that, here is David to discuss the fourth quarter results."
295774,699220207,2178204,"People's United Financial, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jack. I will begin on Slide 4 with an overview of the fourth quarter. We concluded the year with a solid financial performance in the fourth quarter.Operating earnings of $147.7 million increased 2% linked quarter. On a per common share basis",1558,"Thank you, Jack. I will begin on Slide 4 with an overview of the fourth quarter. We concluded the year with a solid financial performance in the fourth quarter.
Operating earnings of $147.7 million increased 2% linked quarter. On a per common share basis, operating earnings were $0.35, up $0.01. Provision for credit losses on loans decreased for the second consecutive quarter to $14.7 million and further strengthened the allowance for credit losses to total loans by 3 basis points to 97 basis points or 102 basis points excluding PPP loans. Operating pre-provision net revenue of $196.6 million declined 3% from the third quarter due to modestly lower net interest income, partially offset by slightly higher fee income and lower expenses.
Finally, it is important to note the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter reflected a $7.1 million benefit related to the revaluation of certain state-deferred tax assets.
Moving to Slide 5. Net interest income of $382.8 million decreased $8.6 million or 2% from the third quarter. The decline was driven by the loan portfolio, which unfavorably impacted net interest income by $15.5 million. This headwind was partially offset by lower deposit costs, which benefited net interest income by $6.4 million. Lower borrowings and higher balances in the securities portfolio also collectively benefited net interest income by $500,000. Notably, during 2020, we have reduced borrowings by over $4 billion on a period-end basis, as a result of $8.5 billion of deposit growth since the beginning of the year.
Net interest income included $20 million from PPP during the quarter, which consist of $15.4 million in fees and $4.6 million in net interest income. These results reflect $6 million related to loans forgiven in the quarter.
As displayed on Slide 6, net interest margin of 2.84% was 13 basis points lower than the third quarter, primarily due to increased excess liquidity, which unfavorably impacted the margin by 9 basis points.
Lower yields in the loan and securities portfolios also unfavorably impacted the margin by 7 basis points and 2 basis points, respectively. In the loan portfolio, new business yields remained lower than the total portfolio yield. However, new business yields and credit spreads modestly improved in the quarter. The largest offset to these negative effects was our continued discipline managing deposit pricing, which benefited the margin by 5 basis points. Average deposit costs were 24 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to 29 basis points in the third quarter, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of lower deposit costs.
Finally, PPP had a 2 basis point favorable impact on net interest margin for the quarter.
Turning to loans on Slide 7. Average balances were down $792 million or 2% from the third quarter, while period-end loans decreased approximately $1.4 billion or 3%. The loan portfolio continues to be impacted by reduced retail balances and a low demand for our commercial real estate and middle market C&I businesses due to limited economic activity. On a period-end basis, retail loans decreased $715 million, mostly attributable to our planned reduction in residential mortgages, which lowered balances by $577 million from the close of the third quarter. Commercial loans were down $647 million, which included a $289 million decline in PPP balances due to forgiveness and a combined $107 million reduction in our runoff portfolios. Conversely, loans benefited from record mortgage warehouse balances and strong growth by LEAF. Mortgage warehouse period-end balances closed the quarter at $3.4 billion, up $161 million from September 30, as results continue to be driven by robust mortgage origination activity and the addition of new customer relationships. LEAF's average and period-end balances grew 5% and 6%, respectively, from the third quarter. 
Balances in the transactional portion of the New York multifamily portfolio, which is in runoff mode, ended the quarter at $512 million, down $47 million linked quarter and $225 million for the year. In addition, the period-end balance for the United loans we have chosen to run off was $845 million, a decline of $60 million from September 30 and $268 million since year-end 2019.
Moving to deposits on Slide 8. Average balances were up $1.1 billion or 2% from the third quarter, while period-end balances grew $2.5 billion or 5%. The growth, which helped to lower the loan-to-deposit ratio to 84%, was broad-based as balances increased across our retail, commercial and municipal businesses. Both average and period-end balances were up across all categories with the exception of time deposits as higher-cost CDs rolled off. Average time balances decreased $865 million linked quarter, while on a period-end basis, balances were down $668 million. The decrease in time deposits is a reflection of customer preference for liquidity during this uncertain economic and low interest rate environment.
Importantly, period-end noninterest-bearing deposits increased for the seventh consecutive quarter. Balances of $15.9 billion were up $1.8 billion from the end of the third quarter and $6.1 billion for the year. Noninterest-bearing deposits now account for more than 30% of total period-end balances, up from 22% a year ago.
Turning to Slide 9. Noninterest income of $178.2 million increased $77.1 million or 76% linked quarter. As referenced earlier, we completed the sale of People's United Insurance Agency, realizing a $75.9 million gain. Excluding this gain, operating noninterest income of $102.3 million grew $1.2 million or 1% from the third quarter. This increase was driven by commercial bank lending fees, which were up $2.8 million, primarily driven by higher pre loan prepayment fees, an increase in customer interest rate swap income of $1 million and higher operating lease income and cash management fees, which collectively benefited noninterest income by $800,000.
In addition, other noninterest income was up $2.2 million, primarily due to the mark-to-market of 1 equity's security position. The largest offset to these increases was a $5.6 million reduction in insurance revenues due to the sale of PUIA in early November.
On Slide 10, noninterest expense of $293.4 million decreased $200,000 linked quarter. The fourth quarter included $4.9 million of nonoperating costs, an increase of $300,000 compared to the third quarter, and they were in the following categories: $3.8 million in other noninterest expense, $800,000 in professional and outside services and $300,000 in equipment and occupancy -- occupancy and equipment.
Excluding nonoperating costs, noninterest expense of $288.5 million decreased $500,000 compared to the previous quarter. Noninterest expense benefited from lower regulatory assessments and operating lease expense, which were down $1.5 million and $800,000, respectively, from the third quarter. Conversely, noninterest expense was unfavorably impacted by higher costs in occupancy and equipment of $2.4 million due to seasonality and professional and outside services of $1.4 million related to the timing of projects.
Briefly on Slide 11, the efficiency ratio of 55.5% increased 170 basis points linked quarter, primarily due to modestly lower revenues. As I stated last quarter, we will remain very diligent in our management of expenses and continue to be focused on enhancing operating leverage as we move forward in this current low interest rate environment.
As Jack mentioned earlier, our asset quality remains excellent. As displayed on Slide 12, net loan charge-offs to average total loans of 12 basis points improved 3 basis points linked quarter. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and REO of 78 basis points was 7 basis points higher compared to the third quarter. This increase was attributable to our motor coach portfolio in the People's Capital and Leasing business within Equipment Finance. The motor coach segment has been significantly impacted by the pandemic, primarily due to the decline in tourism.
Looking at Slide 13. It is evident the gain related to the PUIA sale had a significant favorable impact on fourth quarter returns. However, on an operating basis, returns were generally consistent with the third quarter. Operating return on average assets of 95 basis points increased 1 basis point, while operating return on average tangible equity of 13.3% was down slightly from 13.4%.
Finally, on Slide 14, capital ratios continue to be strong given our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management. It is again important to note, adjusting for PPP loans, the pro forma tier 1 leverage ratio at quarter end is 8.7% for the holding company compared to 8.4% and 9.1% for the bank compared to 8.7%. Additionally, the TCE ratio, excluding PPP, is approximately 7.8% compared to the reported 7.5%.
Before turning the call over to Jack to go over our 2021 outlook, I wanted to mention that we are still in the process of performing our annual goodwill impairment assessment. Additional time is necessary to complete the analysis given the complexities brought about by the macroeconomic effects of the pandemic, particularly the current and projected low interest rate environment and a decline in bank stock valuations last fall, including on the company's annual assessment date of October 1. Any potential goodwill impairment charge could be material to reported earnings, but would represent a noncash charge and have no effect on cash balances, liquidity or tangible equity. In addition, because goodwill and other intangible assets are not included in the calculation of regulatory capital, our well-capitalized regulatory capital ratios would not be affected by this potential noncash expense. The analysis will be completed prior to the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K with the SEC.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jack."

Looking forward, we are cautiously optimistic about the economy as society continues to adjust to the pandemic. In particular, we are pleased banking activity trends continue to improve despite ongoing social distancing protocols. We are also hopeful the vaccines will help restore a bit of normalcy and potentially help to accelerate economic improvement in the latter half of the year. However, a lot of uncertainty remains. While we enter 2021 in a position of strength, the recent surge in the virus nationwide and a prolonged low interest rate environment present a challenging backdrop for loan growth, net interest income and margin. Despite these headwinds, we are very confident in the resilience of our franchise to maintain strong execution across our operations, further invest in digital capabilities and deliver exceptional service to customers. 
With that backdrop in mind, let me outline our full year outlook for 2021, as listed on Slide 15. It is important to note, our announcement today on the decision not to renew our existing in-store branch contracts with Stop & Shop will not have an impact on 2021 financial results.
We expect to grow loans, excluding PPP balances in the range of 0% to 3% on a period-end basis. PPP balances totaling $2.3 billion at year-end, our current expectation is these loans will be forgiven in the first half of 2021. 
Secondly, we anticipate period-end balance -- deposit balances to change in the range of down 2% to up 2%. This expectation is reflective of the significant deposit growth in 2020 and uncertainty of additional government stimulus measures. 
We expect net interest income to decrease in the range of 2% to 4%. Embedded in this outlook is the expectation for net interest margin to be in the range of 2.85% to 2.95%. This net interest margin range is derived from many different factors, one of which is an assumption of no change in the Fed funds rate during the year.
Operating noninterest income is expected to grow in the range of 1% to 3% from an adjusted 2020 operating base of $372 million, which excludes $28 million of noninterest income from the PUIA and a $17 million gain from the sale of loans acquired in the United transactions. 
Operating noninterest expense, which excludes merger-related costs, is anticipated to be in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.18 billion as compared to $1.142 billion in 2020, which excludes $23 million of People's United insurance expense. This expense outlook reflects our continued commitment to invest in digital capabilities to further enhance efficiencies and convenience of customers. We also expect to maintain excellent credit quality with a provision in the range of $60 million to $80 million. The wider range compared to prior year's outlook is indicative of continued uncertainty caused by the pandemic. 
In addition, we anticipate our effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of 20% to 22%.
Finally, we plan to maintain strong capital levels with an expectation that at year-end, holding company common equity tier 1 capital ratio will be in the range of 10% to 10.5%.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, you please proceed to the Q&A portion of the call."

So from a financial perspective, there's a large opportunity for us over time. We spent a lot of time on this decision, thinking about it. And the -- Jack went through a lot of statistics in his prepared comments about seeing substantially higher levels of digital engagement, the fact that some of the recent acquisitions have changed the complexion of our traditional branch network, which gives us confidence that we can do this with a very reasonable and small risk of deposit attrition over time."

We've described over the years kind of a hub-and-spoke approach to the way we've established our branch system in Connecticut, and we were able to replicate that some in New York. And it really is that many of our Stop & Shop branches are fairly close to a traditional branch. So we've always recognized that as a business model risk going into the in-stores, and we intentionally created that hub-and-spoke approach. And as the world has changed and customers' preferences have changed, we now feel we need to take advantage of the expiration of these contracts and take this strategic step."

So as we look forward, we'll start to see some growth in the residential mortgage line. Mortgage warehouse is -- had a banner year, obviously, in 2020, but rates are low, refinance opportunities are still out there for a large part of the mortgage universe. So we think we will be able to hold balances fairly well in that business. Those positives, I would say, are offset by continued reduced activity in our commercial real estate book."

So the $285 million to $295 million is, as Jack said, is predicated on no change in the Fed funds rate for the year. We have seen a modest steepening of the yield curve and think we'll see a bit more as the year unfolds. Some of the components that we're thinking about, the one that really came to bear on the margin in the fourth quarter was the excess liquidity, right? So we had -- if you look on the short-term investment line in the press release, you'll see that we were up $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter. The reality is that money is sitting at the Fed right now at 10 basis points. So that had in '20, in the fourth quarter, a 9 basis point negative impact to the margin. We invested -- we grew the securities portfolio, about $1 billion in the fourth quarter, and we are continuing to deploy some of that excess liquidity into the securities market. So we'll be able to reverse some of that 9 basis point drag there. I think that will probably offset some of the positive benefit we think we'll get in the payoff of the PPP fees, right, which, in Jack's comments, talked about in the first half of the year. 
So about half of our loan book is floating, and it's really not going to change much, but half of the loan book is fixed rate, and there's about $5 billion in Equipment Finance in there, that cash flows fairly nicely. And each quarter, we expect to get a little better reinvestment yields on that half of the loan portfolio. So that and deploying some of that excess liquidity and picking up a little over 100 to 120 basis points on that excess liquidity are some of the major drivers we're thinking about around that loan guidance. I'm sorry, around the margin guidance."
