Skyworks delivered record quarterly results in the first fiscal quarter of 2021. Leveraging our expansive technology reach, and deep customer engagements, spanning both mobile and broad markets.
We established new quarterly records for revenue, operating margin and earnings per share. Demonstrating both the power of our financial model and unique opportunity to lead the global transition to more advanced wireless communications.
Now looking at the quarter in more detail. We delivered revenue of $1.51 billion, more than $455 million above the midpoint of our guidance. We posted earnings per share of $3.36, exceeding our guidance by $1.30, effectively doubling year-over-year earnings. We achieved gross margin of 51.1% and record operating margin of 41.2%. And we generated strong operating cash flow totaling $485 million in the quarter.
As our results demonstrate, the demand for always-on connectivity is accelerating, and extending into new applications, including telemedicine, high-speed video conferencing, remote learning, autonomous transport, essential services for the infrastructure markets, store-to-door delivery and touchless commerce. This is a global phenomenon, where upgrades of key technologies are increasingly critical in the face of the ongoing pandemic.
The investments we've made over the last 2 decades have prepared skyworks to address these challenges. The mobile and wireless ecosystems will benefit from these dynamics, yet outsized gains will largely accrue to those companies that have invested deeply in core technology and scale. These gains are being driven by both a growing device count and an expanding content per device, in some cases, doubling or even tripling for Skyworks.
We are proud to play an instrumental role in shaping the fast-evolving landscape. Collaborating with our partners and customers, leveraging key technologies from TC SAW to high-performance bot filtering, SOI, gallium arsenide and state-of-the-art packaging technologies. Our strong results in Q1 demonstrate our execution around these themes.
Specifically, in mobile, we accelerated the ramp of our Sky5 portfolio. Supporting the next wave of 5G launches at Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and other Tier 1s. In IOT, we captured design wins across a diversified array of new and existing customers. Specifically, we partnered with ASUS, delivering the world's first WiFi 6E connected home router. We shipped WiFi 6 solutions for access points at top network OEMs including Cisco, NETGEAR, CenturyLink and Aruba. We captured new wins at Google for their latest Fitbit smartwatch, and we delivered low latency cognitive audio solutions, powering wireless gaming headsets at multiple Tier 1 accounts.
In industrial, we ramped Itron's multistandard ISM connectivity solutions for smart cities. In infrastructure, we deployed 5G amplifier and receive modules, supporting multiple European base station OEMs.
And finally, in automotive, we accelerated shipments of advanced connectivity solutions supporting the world's premier EV manufacturer. We leveraged V2X solutions with Volkswagen and Toyota for their enhanced safety systems. And partnered with MediaTek, for 5G reference designs, specifically targeted at automotive applications.
Moving forward, we are seeing the confluence of multiple market developments. A significant rise in device complexity and expansion in wireless spectrum and band count, combined with a technology bar that has never been higher. These trends directly translate to increased opportunity for Skyworks, with both new and existing customers.
With essential technologies and scale, propelling performance gains across a broad set of applications. Our purpose-built solutions address all key network protocols. Spanning 5G, WiFi, enhanced GPS and Bluetooth. Additionally, we expect the current C-band auction to be a catalyst. With new spectrum creating significant content opportunities for our Sky5 platform.
While smartphones were the first to embrace 5G, the performance gains will power a broad set of use cases, extending into billions of IoT devices. Looking ahead, we see 5G as a transformative technology, catalyzing new applications while acting as the universal connector from the home to the car to the factory floor.
In summary, Skyworks is solidifying market leadership as connectivity meaningfully alters the way we live, work, Play and educate, not just from home but from anywhere. Our record performance clearly reflects this dynamic.
With that, I will turn the call over to Kris, for a discussion of Q1 and our outlook for Q2."

Skyworks started fiscal '21 with very strong Q1 results. Delivering all-time record revenue of $1.51 billion, adding more than $550 million of incremental sequential revenue and exceeding the midpoint of the guidance for Q1 by $455 million.",560,"Thanks, Liam. Skyworks started fiscal '21 with very strong Q1 results. Delivering all-time record revenue of $1.51 billion, adding more than $550 million of incremental sequential revenue and exceeding the midpoint of the guidance for Q1 by $455 million. Revenue was up 58% sequentially and up 69% year-over-year. Driven by increasing adoption of our mobile solutions with all smartphone OEMs, along with record broad market revenue and customer reach.
Mobile revenue grew 80% sequentially as well as on a year-over-year basis, largely driven by widespread content increases as 5G phones are ramping with all major smartphone brands worldwide. Broad markets revenue grew to $326 million, establishing a new quarterly record. This reflects revenue growth of 35% over Q1 of last year, benefiting from a diverse set of use cases, supporting work, play, learn from anywhere. And the increasing adoption of technologies such as WiFi 6 and 6E, along with the continued momentum in our Audio Solutions business.
Gross profit in the first quarter was $771 million, resulting in a gross margin of 51.1%, up 70 basis points sequentially and up 100 basis points year-over-year.
Operating expenses were $149 million or 10% of revenue, demonstrating strong leverage in our operating model, while continuing our strategic investments in support of future growth. We generated $622 million of operating income, translating into an all-time record operating margin of 41.2%. Other income was $1 million, and our effective tax rate was 10%, resulting in net income of $560 million or a net income margin of 37.1%.
Top line momentum and execution on both gross and operating margins drove record diluted earnings per share of $3.36, beating the guidance by $1.30.EPS grew 82% sequentially and doubled when compared to Q1 of last year.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. First fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $485 million. Capital expenditures were $119 million. We paid $83 million in dividends and we spent $196 million to repurchase 1.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately $139 per share.
Additionally, as noted in our separate press release issued today, Skyworks' Board of Directors has authorized a new $2 billion stock repurchase program. This new buyback plan reflects our Board's confidence in Skyworks' business model and in management's ability to consistently produce strong free cash flow, allowing us to leverage share repurchases and dividends to generate higher stockholder returns.
Now let's move on to our outlook for Q2 of fiscal 2021. We expect the continued and rapid adoption of multiple wireless protocols and expanding use cases to drive strong year-over-year growth for Skyworks. Specifically, in the second fiscal quarter of 2021, we anticipate revenue to be between $1.125 billion and $1.175 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.34, at the midpoint of our revenue range. This translates into year-over-year revenue growth of 50% at the midpoint of the revenue range, and year-over-year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 75%. Gross margin is projected to be in the range of 50.5% to 51%. We expect operating expenses to be between $150 million and $152 million. And below the line, we anticipate roughly $1 million in other income and a tax rate of approximately 10%. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 166.5 million shares.
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Liam."

Well, a couple of things. The 5G cycle really is just beginning, and that's clear. And I think if you listen to Skyworks and what we've been saying, it's all about complexity, it's all about content gains. And the culmination of those coming together with a tremendous unit launch in 5G. And again, very early in 5G. The estimates for unit uptake at 5G, if you think about 2020, maybe there were 200 million, 220 million phones. Those numbers are going to be more than double going into '21, and they'll continue to move. You've got almost 7 billion subscribers in the planet. And the percentage that own a 5G phone are very, very low. So there's a tremendous upside there in our core business in mobile, and also advanced by great technology execution with our team. So that's 1 big driver.
The second driver that's been bubbling up for a while is our broad market portfolio. We had tremendous gains in our broad market portfolio, 35% year-over-year with a broad set of customers, names like Nokia, names like Honeywell, names like GE, Bosch, just an entirely new landscape of customers that we've been able to engage with. And then we talked a lot about usage cases here in the call. Usage cases, new applications that require connectivity, whether it's WiFi, whether it's Bluetooth, whether it's 5G. All of those trends are moving in the right direction for us, and they're sustainable."

But I will say this, we have made the unique investments in capital and scale. We have our own 10 billion unit TC SAW factory for customized filtering. We have bulk acoustic wave in-house. We have our own assembly and test and packaging capabilities that are unique and purpose-built for this market. So we were able to avoid some of the real challenges in supply chain because we've built a lot of this in-house in our own factories. But there certainly have been some bumps on the execution side throughout the landscape, the technology landscape and the connectivity landscape, but we're starting to see that clear. And fortunately, we're able to execute through that in the December quarter."

And it further accelerates our year-over-year revenue growth with all those accounts or the Korean, the Chinese as well as thousands of broad market customer."

And the data rates and speed are demonstrably more powerful. You could see that in your Zoom costs or whatever. So WiFi 6E is a big driver for us as is WiFi 6. And that's one of the things to think about with Skyworks, it's really about connectivity. Connectivity can be 5G, connectivity can be WiFi 6, WiFi 6E, can be Bluetooth, all those protocols are there. But WiFi 6 and 6E are meaningful, and they are really now the product of choice in the work at home, work from anywhere dynamic. And I think that's an opportunity for continued gains for us.

It's going to be an important piece of the 5G landscape, a very necessary piece going from low to mid to high, kind of the layer cake approach, if you will, with low-band at the bottom, mid-band in the middle and then technologies like millimeter wave narrowly at the top.

So first of all, there was an accelerating demand signal here in the December quarter, which was great. Things were a little bit slower in the Q4 period, and we started really seeing the wheels turn in the right way in December, and that accelerated. That was -- the December quarter was a quarter that accelerated. It didn't decelerate. We've had other periods where we had launches that started out great and kind of tailed off. That didn't happen.
And so what it did is to put a lot of focus on execution, supply chain execution. And fortunately, and if you look at, obviously, our filings, we've been spending money on capital, on CapEx. And that really isn't just adding lanes of new equipment. It's actually bringing new technology to the market.
So it was a culmination of supply chain execution, largely within Skyworks. And then we had a couple of hiccups outside. We don't make everything in-house, but most of it's done in-house. So owning our own factories, delivering within our facilities, being efficient there, managing the constraints, but then also bringing that technology up. And we learned a lot in that period. It puts us in a much better position at the company. The lessons learned when the intensity was high, I think it really are key for us and will make us a better company as we supply further.
But then some of the other things that Chris mentioned, this was not just the mobile launch. Mobile was great and was the highlight, but we really executed in our broad markets. And I'm really proud about that some of the customer names I already rattled off at really high-quality accounts that were not customers of Skyworks a year ago, and they are today and they will be in the future."

And if you have a follow-up, I'll throw it to Kris. Yes. I mean, great question for you there. And I think one of the things that you know very well is the complexity in 5G and the nuances around that technology. And really, all key elements need to come together. So we were able to put that forward with, of course, our largest customer, but we're also gaining in China with key players, the Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, we've got great attachment with MediaTek as well. It's still so early. If you look at units in 5G versus where they could be in a couple of years, right? You've got 6.5 million to 7 billion mobile subscribers and we're talking about a couple of hundred million units of 5G phones in 2020. It'll probably double in 2021, but there's still a great opportunity for us at Skyworks.
And the other thing that we do well is we are an under-the-hood player. We get in there with those customers and help them stitch together the necessary technologies to make it work in 5G. When you look at the Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi. I mean that the people support that we provide is very unique. The Sky5 platform is highly integrated and really puts them on a fast, fast time line of market, which is ideal. We're also seeing our large customer perform extremely well, extremely well and taking share globally, in our view. So there's a lot of positives there, and it's sustainable. 5G, again, still early innings, we believe this is a multiyear thematic cycle for us and in others. And then the inflection towards other markets, automotive, IoT, so many other markets that will consume these technologies. I think it just comes together for a good long-term thesis here."

That's also kind of porting into WiFi 6E and almost every wireless solution in the current standard point. Are you seeing -- is the competitive dynamic changing much at all? I mean, do you, Qorvo, less to much lesser extent, Ovagu, because they don't play in all of these things. Outside of that group, are you seeing anybody else?

And we build our stuff in-house, which has been strategically advantageous for us. But when you look at China, we provide the perfect recipe. We can scale, we can provide content. We can provide coaching and flexibility in the architectures and bring them the market in a technology that is just incredible today. So all that comes together.
And as you said, the smaller players right now, it's a difficult task. It's a difficult task. The technology bar is really, really high in 5G. So it's not a slogan, right?

So it is early innings for millimeter wave. In time, over time, it's possible that, that footprint could expand, and millimeter wave become more pervasive in the smartphone. But I'll tell you, the interesting thing, though, is the C band auction here opens up new spectrum that will allow immediate lanes of transmission back and forth that just haven't been there today that could step up and provide another path for 5G. So I think millimeter wave will continue to move on and it's a great application in certain environments, line of sight environments, campus environments, large stadiums, things like that would be perfect. But it's a bit more difficult for broad stream technology. So it's quite possible that as we build out 5G and the advancements are made, you're going to see that layer cake low band, mid-band and then millimeter wave at the top for certain applications. So I think all technologies there can play millimeter wave right now is probably the lowest in terms of introduction and exposure. But I think there's opportunity for it to grow.

As we look ahead at the calendar year, I think we'd typically think that seasonally, the business would be down a few percent in the calendar second quarter, just given the pause between first half builds and second half builds. But you did mention earlier the doubling in 5G smartphone units and ongoing content gains, and you and Kris both touched on the secular dynamics in broad markets. And so the question is, in part, just how are you thinking about the gives and takes as we look towards the middle of the year? And then given the strength we're seeing to start the year, can we still expect to see the typical type of seasonality we would expect in the second half of the year? Or are we just starting so robustly that for whatever reason linearity would be flatter?"

I think what we're seeing now is, again, great adoption right out of the gate with our 5G portfolio, we're thrilled to see that early innings, so there's a lot to do. And then in parallel, these broad market opportunities are really scaling right now. We talked a lot about WiFi 6, we've got Bluetooth, we've got GPS and we're in platforms that are just proliferate. Even with our largest customer, that the amount of revenue derived in non phone devices or not noncellular advices can be incredible, and that's a new area for us to see. So that's continuing to advance.
And broad markets, again, 35% year-over-year, incredible numbers. And we're just really -- and that's a market that there's so much share that we haven't captured. It's just -- it's compelling to continue to make those investments in people and in technology to grow that.
And then the mobile business will continue to do very, very well. If you look at where we see the market, we continue to see new content opportunities that we chase and variably win. We've got a China position now that I think is going to inflect higher as the content there on a relative basis is still lower than it is in other markets. So there's a great opportunity to move. And then the expansion of use cases. So it's customers and use cases that we just haven't seen. Some of that came through the pandemic, a difficult period of time. And some of that were technologies that just emerge. And you think about Zoom, you think about Peloton, store to door delivery to your house, touchless payments, all of this stuff is not going to go away. It's not going to go away. But it's also going to be powered by connectivity. It's going to be connected by the kind of things that we offer. Again, whether it's WiFi, whether it's 5G, whether it's bluetooth. I mean so there's a parallel market here that is building and creating unique momentum.
I'm incredibly excited about the 35% broad market number in a period of time that typically was all about mobile. So we're really demonstrating the ability to create diversification. But still, in many cases, use common technology cores that run through our factories."

We established new qu",682,"Thanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone. Skyworks delivered record quarterly results in the first fiscal quarter of 2021, leveraging our expansive technology reach and deep customer engagements, spanning both mobile and broad markets. 
We established new quarterly records for revenue, operating margin and earnings per share, demonstrating both the power of our financial model and unique opportunity to lead the global transition to more advanced wireless communications. 
Now looking at the quarter in more detail. We delivered revenue of $1.51 billion, more than $455 million above the midpoint of our guidance. We posted earnings per share of $3.36, exceeding our guidance by $1.30, effectively doubling year-over-year earnings. We achieved gross margin of 51.1% and record operating margin of 41.2%. And we generated strong operating cash flow totaling $485 million in the quarter. 
As our results demonstrate, the demand for always-on connectivity is accelerating and extending into new applications, including telemedicine, high-speed video conferencing, remote learning, autonomous transport, essential services for the infrastructure markets, store-to-door delivery and touchless commerce. This is a global phenomenon where upgrades of key technologies are increasingly critical in the face of the ongoing pandemic. 
The investments we've made over the last 2 decades have prepared Skyworks to address these challenges. The mobile and wireless ecosystems will benefit from these dynamics, yet outsized gains will largely accrue to those companies that have invested deeply in core technology and scale. These gains are being driven by both a growing device count and an expanding content per device, in some cases, doubling or even tripling for Skyworks. 
We are proud to play an instrumental role in shaping the fast-evolving landscape. Collaborating with our partners and customers, leveraging key technologies from TC-SAW to high-performance bot filtering, SOI, gallium arsenide and state-of-the-art packaging technologies. Our strong results in Q1 demonstrate our execution around these themes. 
Specifically, in mobile, we accelerated the ramp of our Sky5 portfolio, supporting the next wave of 5G launches at Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and other Tier 1s. 
In IoT, we captured design wins across a diversified array of new and existing customers. Specifically, we partnered with ASUS, delivering the world's first WiFi 6E connected home router. We shipped WiFi 6 solutions for access points at top network OEMs including Cisco, NETGEAR, CenturyLink and Aruba. We captured new wins at Google for their latest Fitbit smartwatch. And we delivered low latency cognitive audio solutions, powering wireless gaming headsets at multiple Tier 1 accounts. 
In industrial, we ramped Itron's multistandard ISM connectivity solutions for smart cities. In infrastructure, we deployed 5G amplifier and receive modules, supporting multiple European base station OEMs. 
And finally, in automotive, we accelerated shipments of advanced connectivity solutions supporting the world's premier EV manufacturer. We leveraged V2X solutions with Volkswagen and Toyota for their enhanced safety systems; and partnered with MediaTek, for 5G reference designs, specifically targeted at automotive applications. 
Moving forward, we are seeing the confluence of multiple market developments, a significant rise in device complexity and expansion in wireless spectrum and band count, combined with a technology bar that has never been higher. These trends directly translate to increased opportunity for Skyworks with both new and existing customers with essential technologies and scale, propelling performance gains across a broad set of applications. Our purpose-built solutions address all key network protocols, spanning 5G, WiFi, enhanced GPS and Bluetooth. Additionally, we expect the current C-band auction to be a catalyst. With new spectrum creating significant content opportunities for our Sky5 platform. 
While smartphones were the first to embrace 5G, the performance gains will power a broad set of use cases, extending into billions of IoT devices. 
Looking ahead, we see 5G as a transformative technology, catalyzing new applications while acting as the universal connector from the home to the car to the factory floor. 
In summary, Skyworks is solidifying market leadership as connectivity meaningfully alters the way we live, work, play and educate not just from home but from anywhere. Our record performance clearly reflects this dynamic. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of Q1 and our outlook for Q2."

Skyworks started fiscal '21 with very strong Q1 results, delivering all-time record revenue of $1.51 billion, adding more than $550 million of incremental sequential revenue and exceeding the midpoint of the guidance for Q1 by $455 million.",561,"Thanks, Liam. Skyworks started fiscal '21 with very strong Q1 results, delivering all-time record revenue of $1.51 billion, adding more than $550 million of incremental sequential revenue and exceeding the midpoint of the guidance for Q1 by $455 million. Revenue was up 58% sequentially and up 69% year-over-year driven by increasing adoption of our mobile solutions with all smartphone OEMs, along with record broad market revenue and customer reach. 
Mobile revenue grew 80% sequentially as well as on a year-over-year basis, largely driven by widespread content increases as 5G phones are ramping with all major smartphone brands worldwide. Broad markets revenue grew to $326 million, establishing a new quarterly record. This reflects revenue growth of 35% over Q1 of last year, benefiting from a diverse set of use cases, supporting work, play, learn from anywhere and the increasing adoption of technologies such as WiFi 6 and 6E, along with the continued momentum in our audio solutions business. 
Gross profit in the first quarter was $771 million, resulting in a gross margin of 51.1%, up 70 basis points sequentially and up 100 basis points year-over-year. 
Operating expenses were $149 million or 10% of revenue, demonstrating strong leverage in our operating model, while continuing our strategic investments in support of future growth. We generated $622 million of operating income, translating into an all-time record operating margin of 41.2%. Other income was $1 million and our effective tax rate was 10%, resulting in net income of $560 million or a net income margin of 37.1%. 
Top line momentum and execution on both gross and operating margins drove record diluted earnings per share of $3.36, beating the guidance by $1.30. EPS grew 82% sequentially and doubled when compared to Q1 of last year. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. First fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $485 million. Capital expenditures were $119 million. We paid $83 million in dividends, and we spent $196 million to repurchase 1.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately $139 per share. 
Additionally, as noted in our separate press release issued today, Skyworks' Board of Directors has authorized a new $2 billion stock repurchase program. This new buyback plan reflects our Board's confidence in Skyworks' business model and in management's ability to consistently produce strong free cash flow, allowing us to leverage share repurchases and dividends to generate higher stockholder returns. 
Now let's move on to our outlook for Q2 of fiscal 2021. We expect the continued and rapid adoption of multiple wireless protocols and expanding use cases to drive strong year-over-year growth for Skyworks. Specifically, in the second fiscal quarter of 2021, we anticipate revenue to be between $1.125 billion and $1.175 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.34 at the midpoint of our revenue range. This translates into year-over-year revenue growth of 50% at the midpoint of the revenue range and year-over-year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 75%. Gross margin is projected to be in the range of 50.5% to 51%. We expect operating expenses to be between $150 million and $152 million. And below the line, we anticipate roughly $1 million in other income and a tax rate of approximately 10%. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 166.5 million shares. 
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Liam."

The estimates for unit uptake at 5G, if you think about 2020, maybe there were 200 million, 220 million phones. Those numbers are going to be more than double going into '21, and they'll continue to move. You've got almost 7 billion subscribers in the planet. And the percentage that own a 5G phone are very, very low. So there's a tremendous upside there in our core business in mobile and also advanced by great technology execution with our team. So that's one big driver. 
The second driver that's been bubbling up for a while is our broad market portfolio. We had tremendous gains in our broad market portfolio, 35% year-over-year with a broad set of customers, names like Nokia, names like Honeywell, names like GE, Bosch, just an entirely new landscape of customers that we've been able to engage with. 
And then we talked a lot about usage cases here in the call. Usage cases, new applications that require connectivity, whether it's WiFi, whether it's Bluetooth, whether it's 5G. All of those trends are moving in the right direction for us, and they're sustainable."

We have our own assembly and test and packaging capabilities that are unique and purpose-built for this market. 
So we were able to avoid some of the real challenges in supply chain because we've built a lot of this in-house in our own factories.

I mean it was a quarter that started a little slow and really accelerated through the period. A tremendous amount of technology execution behind this on the mobile side. But again, in broad markets, we had a record 35% year-over-year. So it's a culmination of strong 5G launches with the most important customers. And within those launches, an extended reach of technology from Skyworks. The content that we're putting forth right now is significantly more advanced and more impactful than what we've had in prior years. And that comes through our own technology fabs, our own investments in R&D and in scale to make that happen. 
So you had a very strong mobile opportunity and then you had a broad market opportunity in parallel that was leveraging some of the core technologies as well. But again, things like WiFi moved, GPS, Bluetooth, all the connectivity protocols, the new usage cases popped up, customers that we didn't have before emerged, so it was a culmination of multiple factors.

It's going to be an important piece of the 5G landscape, a very necessary piece going from low to mid to high, kind of the layer cake approach, if you will, with low band at the bottom, mid-band in the middle and then technologies like millimeter wave narrowly at the top.

So first of all, there was an accelerating demand signal here in the December quarter, which was great. Things were a little bit slower in the Q4 period, and we started really seeing the wheels turn in the right way in December. And that accelerated. That was -- the December quarter was a quarter that accelerated. It didn't decelerate. We've had other periods where we had launches that started out great and kind of tailed off. That didn't happen.
And so what it did is it put a lot of focus on execution -- supply chain execution. And fortunately -- and if you look at, obviously, our filings, we've been spending money on capital, on CapEx. And that really isn't just adding lanes of new equipment. It's actually bringing new technology to the market.
So it was a culmination of supply chain execution, largely within Skyworks. And then we had a couple of hiccups outside. We don't make everything in-house, but most of it is done in-house. So owning our own factories, delivering within our facilities, being efficient there, managing the constraints, but then also bringing that technology up. 
And we learned a lot in that period. It puts us in a much better position at the company. The lessons learned when the intensity was high, I think, really are key for us and will make us a better company as we supply further.
But then some of the other things that Kris mentioned, this was not just the mobile launch. Mobile was great and was the highlight, but we really executed in our broad markets.

And I think one of the things that you know very well is the complexity in 5G and the nuances around that technology. And really, all key elements need to come together. So we were able to put that forward with, of course, our largest customer, but we're also gaining in China with key players, the Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi. We've got great attachment with MediaTek as well. 
It's still so early. If you look at units in 5G versus where they could be in a couple of years, right? You've got 6.6 -- 6.5 billion to 7 billion mobile subscribers and we're talking about a couple of hundred million units of 5G phones in 2020. It'll probably double in 2021, but there's still a great opportunity for us at Skyworks.
And the other thing that we do well is we are an under-the-hood player. We get in there with those customers and help them stitch together the necessary technologies to make it work in 5G. When you look at the Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, I mean the people support that we provide is very unique. The Sky5 platform is highly integrated and really puts them on a fast, fast time line to market, which is ideal. 
We're also seeing our large customer perform extremely well, extremely well and taking share globally, in our view. So there's a lot of positives there, and it's sustainable. 5G, again, still early innings. We believe this is a multiyear thematic cycle for us and others. And then the inflection towards other markets, automotive, IoT, so many other markets that will consume these technologies. I think it just comes together for a good long-term thesis here."

So what I'm trying to -- I guess the question really is, is that the complexity that we've already seen into your largest customers and is now being designed into some of the Chinese phones to acquire some of these more elaborate modules with all the system design, et cetera, that's also kind of porting into WiFi 6E and almost every wireless solution in the current standard at this point.

But when you look at China, we provide the perfect recipe. We can scale. We can provide content. We can provide coaching and flexibility in the architectures and bring them to market in a technology that is just incredible today. So all that comes together.

It is still a bit of a challenging technology today. There's line of sight issues. There's power consumption issues and there's cost issues. So it is early innings for millimeter wave. 
In time, over time, it's possible that, that footprint could expand and millimeter wave become more pervasive in the smartphone. But I'll tell you, the interesting thing, though, is the C-band auction here opens up new spectrum that will allow immediate lanes of transmission back and forth that just haven't been there today that could step up and provide another path for 5G. 
So I think millimeter wave will continue to move on. And it's a great application in certain environments, line of sight environments, campus environments, large stadiums, things like that would be perfect. But it's a bit more difficult for broad stream technology. So it's quite possible that as we build out 5G and the advancements are made, you're going to see that layer cake low band, mid-band and then millimeter wave at the top for certain applications. 
So I think all technologies there can play millimeter wave. Right now is probably the lowest in terms of introduction and exposure. But I think there's opportunity for it to grow. And we're making investments in millimeter wave as well here at Skyworks to make sure that we're close to the action and doing what we need to do to support our customers."

Now we're shipping hundreds of millions of units of bulk acoustic wave. And that technology is purpose-built for mid and high-band spectrum. 
So that is being laid out. You're seeing it now in some of the teardowns or some of the phones that we're working with today that are on the shelves.

Liam, the question I wanted to ask, and I typically wouldn't ask it this early in the year, but it really seems to be big given the strength of the business in the December quarter and in the March quarter. 
As we look ahead at the calendar year, I think we'd typically think that seasonally the business would be down a few percent in the calendar second quarter, just given the pause between first half builds and second half builds. But you did mention earlier the doubling in 5G smartphone units and ongoing content gains, and you and Kris both touched on the secular dynamics in broad markets. 
And so the question is, in part, just how are you thinking about the gives and takes as we look towards the middle of the year? And then given the strength we're seeing to start the year, can we still expect to see the typical type of seasonality we would expect in the second half of the year? Or are we just starting so robustly that for whatever reason linearity would be flatter?"

I think what we're seeing now is, again, great adoption right out of the gate with our 5G portfolio. We're thrilled to see that early innings, so there's a lot to do. And then in parallel, these broad market opportunities are really scaling right now. We talked a lot about WiFi 6. We've got Bluetooth. We've got GPS. And we're in platforms that are just -- even with our largest customer, that the amount of revenue derived in nonphone devices or noncellular devices have been incredible, and that's a new area for us to see. So that's continuing to advance.
And broad markets, again, 35% year-over-year, incredible numbers. And we're just really -- and that's a market that there's so much share that we haven't captured. It's just -- it's compelling to continue to make those investments in people and in technology to grow that.
And then the mobile business will continue to do very, very well. If you look at where we see the market, we continue to see new content opportunities that we chase and variably win. We've got a China position now that I think is going to inflect higher as the content there on a relative basis is still lower than it is in other markets. So there's a great opportunity to move. And then the expansion of use cases. So it's customers and use cases that we just haven't seen. 
Some of that came through the pandemic, a difficult period of time. And some of that were technologies that just emerged. You think about Zoom, you think about Peloton, store-to-door delivery to your house, touchless payments, all of this stuff is not going to go away. It's not going to go away. But it's also going to be powered by connectivity. It's going to be connected by the kind of things that we offer, again, whether it's WiFi, whether it's 5G, whether it's Bluetooth. I mean so there's a parallel market here that is building and creating unique momentum.
I'm incredibly excited about the 35% broad market number in a period of time that typically was all about mobile. So we're really demonstrating the ability to create diversification but still, in many cases, use common technology cores that run through our factories."

Skyworks delivered another record quarter with strong year-over-year growth in revenue, margins and earnings per share for Q2. We continue to leverage our expansive technology reach and deep customer engagements, spanning both mobile and broad markets to capture the exploding demand for connectivity. 
And with our planned acquisition of the infrastructure and automotive business of Silicon Labs, we expect to accelerate that momentum further. Here are a few highlights in the quarter. We delivered revenue of $1.17 billion, 53% above Q2 of last year. Our broad markets portfolio generated record revenue of $385 million, 67% growth over the same period last year. We posted a new Q2 record for earnings per share of $2.37, representing a year-over-year increase of 77% and demonstrating strong operating leverage. 
Importantly, we drove $616 million in operating cash flow, a quarterly record, a new quarterly record for the company. Looking ahead, the technology bar has never been higher as billions of daily interactions move online, spanning a growing set of use cases from remote work, virtual education, touchless commerce, cognitive audio, machine-to-machine communication and autonomous transport. These advances rely on radical upgrades in speed, latency and reliability with comparable requirements for power efficiency and smaller form factors. 
For nearly 2 decades, Skyworks has prepared for this opportunity, investing in innovative technologies, human capital and manufacturing infrastructure, positioning us to capitalize on the secular global transition. Notably, our strong cash generation fortifies our ability to fund deep investments in technology, fabs and manufacturing scale. Further, our proven and flexible model is squarely aligned with the complex demands of our customers. Our demonstrated operational expertise allowed us to drive yet another strong quarter of design win execution. 
In mobile, we expanded the reach of our Sky5 portfolio across premium and mid-tier 5G smartphone launches at Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and other leading OEMs. 
In the IoT space, we secured wins across a diverse set of customers. Specifically, we partnered with NETGEAR to deploy Wi-Fi 6 and 6E routers, launch Wi-Fi 6 gateways at Deutsche Telekom, Nokia and Altice, ship home security solutions to Xfinity, capture design wins with Google Nest, and we delivered low latency cognitive audio systems powering wireless gaming headsets at Microsoft and Sony. 
Moving to the industrial space. We delivered IoT modules to Quectel and Gemalto, in an infrastructure, we leveraged our wireless portfolio to deploy MIMO base stations with Nokia and Ericsson. 
And finally, in automotive, we ramp telematics and driver assist platforms with Volkswagen, LG and GM OnStar. Moving forward, we see a multiyear technological technology evolution with our aperture widening from smartphones, industrial to automotive to an expanding set of IoT devices. Today, we support a global network that extends to over 20 billion interconnected devices, spanning a new class of ecosystems from autonomous transport to smart cities and robotics. 
Skyworks is fueling this dramatic shift with our unique capabilities, integrating not only 5G, but other critical protocols, including high-performance Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and precision GPS. 
Finally, Skyworks is well positioned to win with deep customer relationships established over 20 years, experience across multiple technology transitions, a technically seasoned and talented workforce and an efficient cash flow engine that funds a pipeline of market leading solutions, while providing strong returns to our shareholders. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of Q2 and our outlook for Q3."

Skyworks posted another quarter of strong financial results delivering record Q2 revenue of $1.172 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Total revenue grew 53% year-over-year based on early 5G adoption as well as strong demand for our broad market solutions. 
Mobile revenue grew 47% year-over-year, largely driven by widespread content increases as 5G phones are ramping across smartphone OEMs worldwide. Broad markets revenue grew further in Q2 to an all-time record of $385 million. This reflects revenue growth of 67% over Q2 of last year, benefiting from a diverse set of use cases, including the adoption of technologies such as Wi-Fi 6 and 6E, 5G wireless infrastructure and automotive, along with the continued positive momentum in our audio solutions business. 
Gross profit in the quarter was $595 million, resulting in a gross margin of 50.8%, up 60 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $155 million or 13.2% of revenue, demonstrating spending discipline while continuing our strategic investments to drive growth. We generated $440 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 37.6%, a 510 basis points improvement over Q2 of last year. Other income was $1 million, and our effective tax rate was 10.5%, resulting in net income of $395 million or a net income margin of 33.7%. Execution on both gross and operating margins drove record Q2 diluted earnings per share of $2.37, beating the guidance by $0.03 and an increase of 77% when compared to fiscal Q2 of 2020. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Second fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $616 million, a quarterly record for Skyworks. Capital expenditures were $141 million, resulting in a record $475 million of free cash flow, translating into a strong free cash flow margin of 41%. We paid $83 million in dividends. And given the recently announced acquisition of the infrastructure and automotive business of Silicon Labs, which we expect to close in the September quarter, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program. 
Now let's move on to our outlook for Q3 of fiscal 2021. Based on robust demand for connectivity solutions in mobile and broad markets, we expect continued momentum and year-over-year growth in the June quarter. Specifically, in the third fiscal quarter of 2021, we anticipate revenue to be between $1.075 billion and $1.125 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.13 at the midpoint of our revenue range. This translates into year-over-year revenue growth of 49% at the midpoint of the revenue range and year-over-year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 70%. 
Gross margin is projected to be in the range of 50.25% to 50.75%. We expect operating expenses to be between $159 million and $161 million. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $1.5 million in other income and a tax rate of approximately 10.5%. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 167 million shares.

So there's a lot of diversity within the broad market portfolio, but there's also a lot of technology differentiation that allows us to gain share. And we're looking forward to continuing to put up above market results in that category."

Well, obviously, the China market is very important to the overall ecosystem, and we are doing very well in that space. Again, players like Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, and then MediaTek, a whole another angle, which we've been working with MediaTek for years, a very strong baseband provider, and we have unique technologies that wrap around their core baseband, and we've been doing that for quite a while. So we still feel very good about China. It is lifted off first in the 5G landscape. Of course, there's a tremendous amount of opportunity between now and the next 4 or 5 years or more as we populate and drive subscriptions in 5G. But with the MediaTek side, we're gaining market share at MediaTek, and their platform is getting stronger. It's more powerful, more potent. And it is one of the leading platforms when we look at APAC. And again, populating some of these brands and also hitting some new markets as well. So the MediaTek relationship we have is outstanding. It's a technically driven relationship. We know the company. We've been working with them for years. And those solutions often put portfolio out in the Android ecosystem with the names that we mentioned, the OVX, et cetera. So we've got a very good handle on that. 
And the other thing, Chris, here is that these customers really like the fact that we grow our own technologies, develop our own packaging and test can get very, very flexible, can integrate in Sky5 solution that makes it very easy for them to go to market. So there's some unique elements in the Skyworks strategy that go beyond just kind of the parts, right? So that's always been a key play for us. And players like MediaTek, that's an ideal solution for them."

As I said earlier in the call, the diversity of the customers was really unique for us. So more and more companies that had not been had not been customers of Skyworks are now customers of Skyworks.

How do you see that cadence for 5G, there's a lot more bands, there's a lot of stuff going on. There's different frequencies being added, spectrum, C-band, et cetera. Is that a number that is likely to go -- that content add number on a yearly basis. Is that a number that's likely to creep up because of all that 5G brings?"

Now we go from 1 gig to 6 gig and even higher. So there's new spectrum in the 5G world. There's new challenges. There's new technologies that need to be brought to bear. And then the ability to integrate that in a fungible asset, delivering that as a complete system that our customers can assimilate. That is really special. And we do that, and that's back to the comments that Kris and I made about having our own technology, having our own factories, have a unique packaging, assembly and test to really customize a full solution.

It's been slow, but it's starting to pick up. And it's necessary as you move into 5G. It's necessary as we build out that spectrum. And then as you mentioned, the C-band auction is great now because that money has been spent, and the carriers want to deploy more and more. They basically want to leverage that technology as quickly as possible. So the infrastructure is going to pop up a little bit there. And it also could add content opportunities to core mobile device. So you have a two-pronged approach there with the infrastructure side and we have positions there. And then, of course, when we look at C-band and the unique spectrum there, there's going to be devices that we'll need to be navigating and populating that spectrum within the handset. So that's something that's starting -- it's been happening, but there's definitely lots of room to move on that end."

Skyworks delivered another record quarter with strong year-over-year growth in revenue, margins and earnings per share for Q2. We continue to leverage our expansive technology reach and deep customer engagements, spanning both mobile and broad markets to capture the exploding demand for connectivity. 
And with our planned acquisition of the infrastructure and automotive business of Silicon Labs, we expect to accelerate that momentum further. Here are a few highlights in the quarter. We delivered revenue of $1.17 billion, 53% above Q2 of last year. Our broad markets portfolio generated record revenue of $385 million, 67% growth over the same period last year. We posted a new Q2 record for earnings per share of $2.37, representing a year-over-year increase of 77% and demonstrating strong operating leverage. 
Importantly, we drove $616 million in operating cash flow, a quarterly record -- a new quarterly record for the company. Looking ahead, the technology bar has never been higher as billions of daily interactions move online, spawning a growing set of use cases from remote work, virtual education, touchless commerce, cognitive audio, machine-to-machine communication and autonomous transport. These advances rely on radical upgrades in speed, latency and reliability with comparable requirements for power efficiency and smaller form factors. 
For nearly 2 decades, Skyworks has prepared for this opportunity, investing in innovative technologies, human capital and manufacturing infrastructure, positioning us to capitalize on the secular global transition. Notably, our strong cash generation fortifies our ability to fund deep investments in technology, fabs and manufacturing scale. Further, our proven and flexible model is squarely aligned with the complex demands of our customers. Our demonstrated operational expertise allowed us to drive yet another strong quarter of design win execution. 
In mobile, we expanded the reach of our Sky5 portfolio across premium and mid-tier 5G smartphone launches at Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and other leading OEMs. 
In the IoT space, we secured wins across a diverse set of customers. Specifically, we partnered with NETGEAR to deploy Wi-Fi 6 and 6E routers, launched Wi-Fi 6 gateways at Deutsche Telekom, Nokia and Altice, shipped home security solutions to Xfinity, capture design wins with Google Nest, and we delivered low latency cognitive audio systems powering wireless gaming headsets at Microsoft and Sony. 
Moving to the industrial space. We delivered IoT modules to Quectel and Gemalto, in an infrastructure, we leveraged our wireless portfolio to deploy MIMO base stations with Nokia and Ericsson. 
And finally, in automotive, we ramped telematics and driver assist platforms with Volkswagen, LG and GM OnStar. Moving forward, we see a multiyear technological -- technology evolution with our aperture widening from smartphones, industrial to automotive to an expanding set of IoT devices. Today, we support a global network that extends to over 20 billion interconnected devices, spanning a new class of ecosystems from autonomous transport to smart cities and robotics. 
Skyworks is fueling this dramatic shift with our unique capabilities, integrating not only 5G, but other critical protocols, including high-performance Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and precision GPS. 
Finally, Skyworks is well positioned to win with deep customer relationships established over 20 years, experience across multiple technology transitions, a technically seasoned and talented workforce and an efficient cash flow engine that funds a pipeline of market leading solutions, while providing strong returns to our shareholders. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of Q2 and our outlook for Q3."

Gross profit in the quarter was $595 million, resulting in a gross margin of 50.8%, up 60 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $155 million or 13.2% of revenue, demonstrating spending discipline while continuing our strategic investments to drive growth. We generated $440 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 37.6%, a 510 basis points improvement over Q2 of last year. Other income was $1 million, and our effective tax rate was 10.5%, resulting in net income of $395 million or a net income margin of 33.7%. Execution on both gross and operating margins drove record Q2 diluted earnings per share of $2.37, beating the guidance by $0.03 and an increase of 77% when compared to fiscal Q2 of 2020. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Second fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $616 million, a quarterly record for Skyworks. Capital expenditures were $141 million, resulting in a record $475 million of free cash flow, translating into a strong free cash flow margin of 41%. We paid $83 million in dividends. And given the recently announced acquisition of the infrastructure and automotive business of Silicon Labs, which we expect to close in the September quarter, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program. 
Now let's move on to our outlook for Q3 of fiscal 2021. Based on robust demand for connectivity solutions in mobile and broad markets, we expect continued momentum and year-over-year growth in the June quarter. Specifically, in the third fiscal quarter of 2021, we anticipate revenue to be between $1.075 billion and $1.125 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.13 at the midpoint of our revenue range. This translates into year-over-year revenue growth of 49% at the midpoint of the revenue range and year-over-year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 70%. 
Gross margin is projected to be in the range of 50.25% to 50.75%. We expect operating expenses to be between $159 million and $161 million. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $1.5 million in other income and a tax rate of approximately 10.5%. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 167 million shares. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam."

But on the other hand, we are very close to our customers the channel. We try to keep that as lean as possible, so we get the real demand and natural demand, and that's the way we want it. The diversity in broad markets, though, is a theme that we should think about here because we really are expanding the aperture. It's multiple technologies, whether it's Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi 6 or Bluetooth or GPS. But then there's a broadening set of customers that have stepped up and joined the Skyworks design win team.

Well, obviously, the China market is very important to the overall ecosystem, and we are doing very well in that space. Again, players like Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, and then MediaTek, a whole another angle, which we've been working with MediaTek for years, a very strong baseband provider, and we have unique technologies that wrap around their core baseband, and we've been doing that for quite a while. 
So we still feel very good about China. It has lifted off first in the 5G landscape. Of course, there's a tremendous amount of opportunity between now and the next 4 or 5 years or more as we populate and drive up subscriptions in 5G. But with the MediaTek side, we're gaining market share at MediaTek, and their platform is getting stronger. It's more powerful, more potent. And it is one of the leading platforms when we look at APAC. And again, populating some of these brands and also hitting some new markets as well. 
So the MediaTek relationship we have is outstanding. It's a technically driven relationship. We know the company. We've been working with them for years. And those solutions often portfolio out in the Android ecosystem with the names that we mentioned, the OVX, et cetera. So we've got a very good handle on that. 
And the other thing, Chris, here is that these customers really like the fact that we grow our own technologies, develop our own packaging and tests can get very, very flexible, can integrate in a Sky5 solution that makes it very easy for them to go to market. So there's some unique elements in the Skyworks strategy that go beyond just kind of the parts, right? So that's always been a key play for us.

And we're investing in aggressively technology investments in our fabs, in our packaging houses and really just the platform that we have in Sky5 as we move forward. 
So all that kind of weaves together. And you get leverage because these are really strong markets that have a pretty potent unit curve on them as well. So part of the strategy is to really drive a solution that can then spin-off derivatives, but still have that same core.

It's the type of output that we're capable of doing consistently and growing consistently. 
As I said earlier in the call, the diversity of the customers was really unique for us. So more and more companies that had not been customers of Skyworks are now customers of Skyworks. And we love to see that. And once we establish a beachhead with some of these players, we can do a lot more. 
So you heard today, names like Microsoft, names like Sony, names like GM and OnStar and moving into industrial markets. That's all coming together. And the nice thing is it's using the kind of the needs -- and it needs the technology that we have, and we have it ready for them. So it isn't a case where we have to spin up something unique. 
By and large, the technologies that we have now are ready to go. So we're able to deliver those solutions in Wi-Fi, deliver those solutions in a cellular format, whether it's 5G or otherwise. We have the technology protocols to address what the customers want. So -- and we'll continue to do that. I think some of the impacts that we've seen with the COVID crisis is that the ability to be flexible and adapt, and we've seen this usage case change where we have customers that were not interested in some of the things that we did or didn't have a need for it. 
And now mobility and connectivity has become paramount and critical and essential. And that's driving our business in ways that we really didn't anticipate. But we understand it deeply. And as we move forward, we're going to continue to develop those customers and bring the best technologies we can to each and every one of their own applications."

And we have great technology there with MIMO solutions, small cell solutions, a lot of the core recipes that we need in gallium arsenide and other places. So we feel really good about it. It's been slow, but it's starting to pick up. And it's necessary as you move into 5G. It's necessary as we build out that spectrum. And then as you mentioned, the C-band auction is great now because that money has been spent, and the carriers want to deploy more and more. They basically want to leverage that technology as quickly as possible. So the infrastructure is going to pop up a little bit there. And it also could add content opportunities to a core mobile device. 
So you have a two-pronged approach there with the infrastructure side and we have positions there. And then, of course, when we look at C-band and the unique spectrum there, there's going to be devices that we'll need to be navigating and populating that spectrum within the handset.

And the spectrum need, it continues to be more and more complex.
The C-band auction that was just mentioned is a big driver. And it's really -- that's a technology that you take anywhere. The challenge with millimeter wave is that you have substantial current consumption needs. You have a physical size that is a challenge in a mobile phone. And then you have point-to-point interference. 
So it's a technology that could have use in certain environments, going into stadiums or campus environments unimpeded, of course. It works but if you look at what we can do in 5G today with the solutions that we have today and the spectrum that we have today, it's incredible. The speeds, the performance, the latency and the ability to roam and expand that signal anywhere unimpeded. 
So it's going to be a challenge. But like anything else. I mean, there's layers in the cake, right?

You'll see that with launches this year. You'll see that with phones that are out there now. 
And the complexity continues to rise. That drives content. And the consumer demand for the technology around mobility, just continues to grow. So it's a great market to be in, but there's a lot of problems to be solved, and that's what really gets us excited and it puts us in a position to outperform."

Skyworks delivered record third quarter results with strong year-over-year growth in both revenue and earnings per share. Further, the completion of our acquisition of the infrastructure and automotive business of Sil",525,"Thanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone. Skyworks delivered record third quarter results with strong year-over-year growth in both revenue and earnings per share. Further, the completion of our acquisition of the infrastructure and automotive business of Silicon Labs, we have significantly expanded our market opportunity while accelerating our top and bottom line growth. 
Here are a few highlights. In the quarter, we delivered revenue of $1.116 billion, 52% above Q3 of last year. We posted a new Q3 record for earnings with EPS of $2.15, above consensus and representing a year-over-year increase of 72%. And given our strong and predictable cash generation, we announced a substantial increase to our quarterly dividend. Looking ahead, we expect continued momentum as we execute on strong design wins with our mobile and broad market customers, levered by the performance gains of 5G. We are seeing a tipping point with 5G acting as the catalyst transforming entire industries from telemedicine and autonomous driving to factory automation and intelligent energy management. By increasing efficiency, these 5G-enabled applications are also lowering carbon footprints and driving renewable energy. 
Skyworks is at the center of this unique technological shift and its reliance on wireless connectivity, with innovative solutions developed over 20 years and across multiple technology transitions. The combination of our innovative solutions, broad customer reach and unrivaled manufacturing scale drove another quarter of strong design win execution. In mobile, we expanded the reach of our Sky5 portfolio, powering upcoming smartphone launches at Tier 1 manufacturers, including Google, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, among others. In IoT, we secured wins across a diverse set of customers. Specifically, we delivered WiFi front-end modules to Facebook for their new portal launch, captured design wins at Peloton, supporting home fitness applications, partnered with Linksys on their newest WiFi 6E mesh network system and ramped additional advanced WiFi platforms at Altice, Charter Communications and Aruba Networks. 
We also launched connected home and security solutions at Honeywell, and shipped cognitive audio platforms to Samsung and Vizio for their home theater systems. In wireless infrastructure, we continue to leverage our small cell and advanced MIMO expertise in support of multiple Tier 1 OEMs. And finally, in automotive, we strengthened our position across the global ecosystem with our integrated solutions, enabling advanced telematics for leading auto manufacturers. 
In summary, Skyworks' trusted technologies play a pivotal and essential role in the way we live, work, play and educate, enabling ubiquitous, reliable, ultra-fast connections, positioning our business for continued growth. Skyworks' success is underpinned by unique strengths, including our highly integrated connectivity engines powering applications across an increasingly diverse array of customers in multiple high-growth end markets. A differentiated manufacturing footprint, levering strategic technologies, from high-performance filters to custom gallium arsenide and advanced packaging. And finally, along with our seasoned and diligent workforce, we maintain deep collaborative relationships with our customers. These advantages will be further enhanced by the acquisition of the I&A business. This combination immediately broadens our product portfolio, augments our engineering prowess and expands our market reach while diversifying revenue and enhancing profitability. With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of Q3 and our outlook for Q4."

Skyworks posted another quarter of strong financial results, delivering record Q3 revenue of $1.116 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Total revenue grew 52% year-over-year, demonstrating exceptional performance across both mobile and growth markets. Mobile revenue grew 52% year-over-year as we capitalized on technology-rich content powering an impactful set of 5G customers. 
In parallel, broad markets revenue was up 50% year-over-year, benefiting from strong demand for IoT solutions, including WiFi 6 and 6E and smart audio as well as emerging use cases in industrial and automotive markets. Gross profit in the quarter was [ $565 ] million, resulting in a gross margin of 50.6%, up 50 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $161 million or 14.5% of revenue, demonstrating spending discipline while continuing our strategic investments to drive growth. 
We generated $403 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 36.1%, a 480 basis point improvement over Q3 of last year. Other expense was $3 million, reflecting a partial quarter of interest expense associated with the recently completed acquisition of the infrastructure and automotive business of Silicon Labs. Our effective tax rate was 10.4%, resulting in net income of $359 million or a net income margin of 32.1%. Execution on top and bottom line growth while expanding gross and operating margins drove record Q3 diluted earnings per share of $2.15 beating the guidance by $0.02 and an increase of 72% when compared to fiscal Q3 of 2020. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Third fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $273 million, capital expenditures were $115 million, and we paid $83 million in dividends. We ended the quarter with a net cash position of $1.5 billion with $3 billion in cash and investments and $1.5 billion in debt. 
Moving to our outlook now for Q4 of fiscal 2021 based on continued robust demand for connectivity solutions in mobile and broad markets and the inclusion of a partial quarter of revenue from the recently completed acquisition, we expect continued growth into the September quarter. Specifically,  in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021, we anticipate revenue to be between $1.27 billion and $1.33 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.53 at the midpoint of our revenue range. 
This represents revenue growth of 36% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 37% compared to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020. Exclusive of acquisition-related revenue, we expect double-digit sequential growth in both mobile and broad markets. Gross margin is projected to be in the range of 51% to 51.5%. 
And we expect operating expenses to be between $180 million and $183 million. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $11 million in other expense, reflecting the interest expense associated with the acquisition financing. We expect a tax rate of approximately 10.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 167.5 million shares. And lastly, given our conviction in Skyworks' strategic outlook and predictable strong cash generation, today, we also announced a 12% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.56 per share. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam."

And it's going to be a lot of fun doing that.

So we have a -- the benefit of that scale and the investments that we've made over the years to fortify our position in supply chain. Now having said that, as we all know that any given platform, whether it's a smartphone or a piece of the infrastructure pie, all the components have to come together to create a solution for the customer. So if anything is short anywhere in the food chain, it can impede demand, right? Execution around demand. So we are certainly seeing that I feel like our teams are doing a good job navigating through, but it's clear that there's more demand opportunity now that hasn't really been executed. So I think we're going to do work on our end to support our customers. We're certainly doing the work in our fabs in our labs to be a little bit more efficient there and driving the technology.

I'm sure. This looks to be more like a TI national acquisitions where it's kind of plug-and-play diversification role. I'm not clear, I know you plan on growing it. I know they've got a lot of great technologies and excellent profile in terms of margins. But can you give us some examples of where you think you can grow this into your customer base?

There's a lot we can do there. There's quite a bit of customer and sales synergy here that we can unlock.

And the early innings here, what we're seeing and the engagements with their customers and what we're doing with our sales channel, I think, is going to be unique. And then the manufacturing benefits, right? For the most part, the I&A business has been outsourced. And I think there's a great deal of synergy that we can use in our assembly and test operations, even if there's some fabless elements, just having the packaging assembly and test in-house is a strategic advantage as well. So we're really excited about it, and we spent a great deal of time working through this transaction, and we haven't done a lot of deals here at Skyworks. We're very conservative with that.

In terms of cash and cash usage and cash allocation, I would say, first of all, we will continue to invest in technology and innovation with our research and development activities that is key to what Skyworks is doing. Secondly, we will also continue to further expand our manufacturing assets in gallium arsenide, in filter, advanced packaging. And so we will continue to contribute substantial amounts of CapEx to further expand our reach and expand our manufacturing assets. Despite all of that, we will continue to deliver strong free cash flow. We have a free cash flow target of 30%. We will continue to make further improvements towards that target and the free cash flow will be used, first of all, to pay the dividend. And we just announced a 12% increase in dividend now at $0.56, and there is further room for improvement there. Secondly, we will focus on repaying the debt. We have $2.5 billion of debt on the balance sheet as of today, including a $1 billion term loan. We are going to focus on repaying that term loan. We do have an authorized share buyback program, but we have temporarily suspended that as we for now focus on repaying that term loan.

But how should we look at that in second gen 5G phones this year. Wouldn't be the increase down to maybe a high single digit year-over-year in terms of content? And then the follow-up question is in China, you did mention opportunities in China, but the adoption rate for 5G phones, there is almost 80%. So are you expecting to gain market share? Or is it that the second-gen 5G phones in China are going to use much more RF content than the first generation because clearly, the adoption rate is up there already."

Well, first of all, what I would say is there's tiers of 5G in China. So you have a 5G phone that has a certain level of complexity [indiscernible], but you could have another 5G phone that is much higher in complexity and performance. And we can scale through all of those nodes. So penetration may be still relatively high. There's still a tremendous amount of 5G phones in China that need another [indiscernible] performance. It's a reality. And we know that because I mean we see the entire market. We see the market from end to end from the U.S. to Europe to Asia. And so there's a lot of opportunity for content gains from the current position in China. If you look at other markets, we're seeing the same push for technology, higher performing. We're seeing more features, more applications and a higher burden that's put on the smartphones in 5g. And that's all good stuff for us. It gives us the opportunity to come in with our solutions all the way from TC-SAW to bulk acoustic wave, assembly and test, packaging in-house in our own fabs. So we're really excited about it. So we do see continuous growth in content, but the content is getting harder. It's not more things. It's more complex things. And so you need to have an architect that could bring this together and make it easier for our customers to assimilate. 
That's what we do. So every year, it's not just phone to phone, the phone -- the technology and the complexity within the device is rising. And that, for us, it's very, very good, and it limits the competition, and it puts us in a great position to delight the customer. So we look forward to that. And overall, 5G penetration at a high level is still very low right now globally. There's a lot of room to move from here. And there's a lot of upgrades that haven't yet commenced. So we're looking forward to it, but the technology is not stagnant. It continues to get tougher and tougher, higher bar and opportunities for just a few players like Skyworks to execute."

Skyworks delivered record third quarter results with strong year-over-year growth in both revenue and earnings per share. Further, the completion of our acquisition of the infrastructure and automotive business of Silicon Labs, we have significantly expanded our market opportunity while accelerating our top and bottom line growth. 
Here are a few highlights. In the quarter, we delivered revenue of $1.116 billion, 52% above Q3 of last year. We posted a new Q3 record for earnings with EPS of $2.15, above consensus and representing a year-over-year increase of 72%. And given our strong and predictable cash generation, we announced a substantial increase to our quarterly dividend. Looking ahead, we expect continued momentum as we execute on strong design wins with our mobile and broad market customers, levered by the performance gains of 5G. We are seeing a tipping point with 5G acting as the catalyst transforming entire industries from telemedicine and autonomous driving to factory automation and intelligent energy management. By increasing efficiency, these 5G-enabled applications are also lowering carbon footprints and driving renewable energy. 
Skyworks is at the center of this unique technological shift and its reliance on wireless connectivity, with innovative solutions developed over 20 years and across multiple technology transitions. The combination of our innovative solutions, broad customer reach and unrivaled manufacturing scale drove another quarter of strong design win execution. In mobile, we expanded the reach of our Sky5 portfolio, powering upcoming smartphone launches at Tier 1 manufacturers, including Google, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, among others. In IoT, we secured wins across a diverse set of customers. Specifically, we delivered WiFi front-end modules to Facebook for their new portal launch, captured design wins at Peloton, supporting home fitness applications, partnered with Linksys on their newest WiFi 6E mesh network system and ramped additional advanced WiFi platforms at Altice, Charter Communications and Aruba Networks. 
We also launched connected home and security solutions at Honeywell, and shipped cognitive audio platforms to Samsung and Vizio for their home theater systems. In wireless infrastructure, we continue to leverage our small cell and advanced MIMO expertise in support of multiple Tier 1 OEMs. And finally, in automotive, we strengthened our position across the global ecosystem with our integrated solutions, enabling advanced telematics for leading auto manufacturers.
In summary, Skyworks' trusted technologies play a pivotal and essential role in the way we live, work, play and educate, enabling ubiquitous, reliable, ultra-fast connections, positioning our business for continued growth. Skyworks' success is underpinned by unique strengths, including our highly integrated connectivity engines, powering applications across an increasingly diverse array of customers in multiple high-growth end markets. A differentiated manufacturing footprint, levering strategic technologies, from high-performance filters to custom gallium arsenide and advanced packaging. 
And finally, along with our seasoned and diligent workforce, we maintain deep collaborative relationships with our customers. These advantages will be further enhanced by the acquisition of the I&A business. This combination immediately broadens our product portfolio, augments our engineering prowess and expands our market reach while diversifying revenue and enhancing profitability. With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of Q3 and our outlook for Q4."

Skyworks posted another quarter of strong financial results, delivering record Q3 revenue of $1.116 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Total revenue grew 52% year-over-year, demonstrating exceptional performance across both mobile and growth markets. Mobile revenue grew 52% year-over-year as we capitalized on technology-rich content powering an impactful set of 5G customers. 
In parallel, broad markets revenue was up 50% year-over-year, benefiting from strong demand for IoT solutions, including WiFi 6 and 6E and smart audio as well as emerging use cases in industrial and automotive markets. Gross profit in the quarter was $565 million, resulting in a gross margin of 50.6%, up 50 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $161 million or 14.5% of revenue, demonstrating spending discipline while continuing our strategic investments to drive growth.
We generated $403 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 36.1%, a 480 basis points improvement over Q3 of last year. Other expense was $3 million, reflecting a partial quarter of interest expense associated with the recently completed acquisition of the infrastructure and automotive business of Silicon Labs. Our effective tax rate was 10.4%, resulting in net income of $359 million or a net income margin of 32.1%. Execution on top and bottom line growth while expanding gross and operating margins drove record Q3 diluted earnings per share of $2.15 beating the guidance by $0.02 and an increase of 72% when compared to fiscal Q3 of 2020. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Third fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $273 million, capital expenditures were $115 million, and we paid $83 million in dividends. We ended the quarter with a net cash position of $1.5 billion with $3 billion in cash and investments and $1.5 billion in debt.
Moving to our outlook now for Q4 of fiscal 2021. Based on continued robust demand for connectivity solutions in mobile and broad markets and the inclusion of a partial quarter of revenue from the recently completed acquisition, we expect continued growth into the September quarter. Specifically,  in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021, we anticipate revenue to be between $1.27 billion and $1.33 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.53 at the midpoint of our revenue range. 
This represents revenue growth of 36% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 37% compared to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020. Exclusive of acquisition-related revenue, we expect double-digit sequential growth in both mobile and broad markets. Gross margin is projected to be in the range of 51% to 51.5%. 
And we expect operating expenses to be between $180 million and $183 million. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $11 million in other expense, reflecting the interest expense associated with the acquisition financing. We expect a tax rate of approximately 10.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 167.5 million shares. And lastly, given our conviction in Skyworks' strategic outlook and predictable strong cash generation, today, we also announced a 12% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.56 per share. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam."

So we have a -- the benefit of that scale and the investments that we've made over the years fortify our position in supply chain. Now having said that, as we all know that any given platform, whether it's a smartphone or a piece of the infrastructure pie, all the components have to come together to create a solution for the customer. So if anything is short anywhere in the food chain, it can impede demand, right? Execution around demand. So we are certainly seeing that. I feel like our teams are doing a good job navigating through, but it's clear that there's more demand opportunity now that hasn't really been executed.

But -- and I don't think this is going to be a long-term problem, but it's certainly a problem that it is making its way through the semiconductor cycle. Some companies had worse than others.

But it is certainly a unique case where demand is being impeded to some degree with supply chain issues. And that is just a kind of a global issue now in the semiconductor space, a lot of work being done to get that free flow of demand again. But the demand opportunity is there.

This looks to be more like a TI-National acquisitions where it's kind of plug-and-play diversification role. I'm not clear -- I know you plan on growing it. I know they've got a lot of great technologies and excellent profile in terms of margins. But can you give us some examples of where you think you can grow this into your customer base? 
And most of it, I imagine, is going to be in broad markets.

There's a lot we can do there. There's quite a bit of customer and sales synergy here that we can unlock.

And that's something that we do very well here. So we're going to lever up the scale. We're going to enhance the technology. We're going to invest in this portfolio.

And the early innings here what we're seeing and the engagements with their customers and what we're doing with our sales channel, I think, is going to be unique. And then the manufacturing benefits, right? For the most part, the I&A business has been outsourced. And I think there's a great deal of synergy that we can use in our assembly and test operations, even if there's some fabless elements, just having the packaging, assembly and test in-house is a strategic advantage as well. 
So we're really excited about it, and we spent a great deal of time working through this transaction, and we haven't done a lot of deals here at Skyworks. We're very conservative with that.

I guess the question is, for how long do you expect that WiFi 6 ramp to continue? It has been -- WiFi has been one of the segments that's benefited from work from home. But I guess what we've also heard is there's also an enterprise refresh on WiFi 6 that has to happen.

We have great relationships with our customers. It's kind of a ubiquitous player in terms of connectivity. So it's been a strong driver for us and the complexity in the devices continues to go up. 
We have a really good business, Wi-Fi enhanced, but then we also have incredible opportunities when we look at the access point in routers that we're seeing today that are really scaling up significantly in terms of the performance and the data rates. And so that's continuing to move. 
And I don't think it's really just a work from home. I think we're starting to see that become a really must-have type of technology. So that's been a play for us. Other areas in broad markets grow. We're doing really good work in the infrastructure space. We've got customers like Honeywell in the industrial area, the wireless infrastructure side with names like Nokia and Ericsson are stepping up a bit. And as Kris mentioned, you're talking about 50% year-over-year in that business. 
So it is a unique portfolio, continues to grow, very diverse and also a great partner to tag with our I&A portfolio. So I think you're going to be able to bring some cross-selling and new customer engagement through that process as well. So we look forward to -- but WiFi, as you said at the beginning, is really strategic and we're very well positioned."

A lot of that, of course, helps as we scale up the business, right? We -- last year, we did $3.3 billion, $3.4 billion of revenue. This year, we will be doing more than $5 billion of revenue. 
So we are able to mitigate some of those headwinds. And as I said before, we keep on climbing the technology ladder, right, higher complexity, higher performance, more 5G, more WiFi 6 and 6E. 
And then in addition, you have the I&A business at higher margins. So you combine all of that, you will see continuing further gross margin improvement. Once some of those headwinds will start turning and become tailwinds, we will make further improvements towards our target model of 53%."

Well, first of all, what I would say is there's tiers of 5G in China. So you have a 5G phone that has a certain level of complexity, but you could have another 5G phone that is much higher in complexity and performance. And we can scale through all of those nodes. So penetration may be still relatively high. There's still a tremendous amount of 5G phones in China that need another click in performance to really move. And we know that because I mean we see the entire market. We see the market from end to end from the U.S. to Europe to Asia. 
And so there's a lot of opportunity for content gains from the current position in China. If you look at other markets, we're seeing the same push for technology, higher performing. We're seeing more features, more applications and a higher burden that's put on the smartphones in 5G. And that's all good stuff for us. 
It gives us the opportunity to come in with our solutions all the way from TC-SAW to bulk acoustic wave, assembly and test, packaging in-house in our own fabs. So we're really excited about it. So we do see continuous growth in content, but the content is getting harder. It's not more things. It's more complex things. And so you need to have an architect that could bring this together and make it easier for our customers to assimilate.
That's what we do. So every year, it's not just phone to phone, the phone -- the technology and the complexity within the device is rising. And that, for us, is very, very good, and it limits the competition, and it puts us in a great position to delight the customer. So we look forward to that. 
And overall, 5G penetration at a high level is still very low right now globally. There's a lot of room to move from here. And there's a lot of upgrades that haven't yet commenced. So we're looking forward to it, but the technology is not stagnant. It continues to get tougher and tougher, higher bar and opportunities for just a few players like Skyworks to execute."

Before I touch on the fourth fiscal quarter results, I want to highlight the significant accomplishments that underpin a record-breaking year for Skyworks. First, total revenue grew to $5.1 billion, 52% ahead of last year, representing an increase of over $1.7 billion. 
We increased earnings per share to $10.50, up 71%. Operating cash flow expanded to $1.8 billion, an increase of 47%, and we completed a strategic and compelling acquisition, immediately diversifying our product portfolio and expanding our market reach. Finally, with the investments we've made, Skyworks navigated a complex supply chain environment, leveraging world-class manufacturing capabilities across strategic technology. 
Now turning to Q4, where Skyworks delivered record performance. Revenues in our mobile and broad markets portfolios both grew at double-digit rates sequentially and year-over-year as we capitalized on broad-based momentum, fueled by demand for our unique connectivity solutions. Specifically, we delivered revenue of [ 1 billion ] -- $1.31 billion, achieved gross margin of 51% and operating margin of 37.2%. We posted earnings per share of $2.62, exceeding our guidance by $0.09 and generated strong operating cash flow totaling $398 million in the quarter. 
The complexity inherent in 5G and the demand for highly integrated solutions were a major catalyst in driving our performance. The momentum in global 5G carrier subscription is building with estimates of 580 million users today, expanding to more than 3 billion users by the end of 2025. 
As expected, smartphones are leading the early transition but new innovative use cases are emerging from automotive and industrial IoT, to enhance virtual reality, gaming and telemedicine. Importantly, the power of 5G is increasingly being harnessed to drive sustainability efforts across industries worldwide, providing the wireless backbone to AI-powered ecosystems, combining measurement, analysis and optimization. 
For example, a major U.S. manufacturer is combining wireless sensor-enabled cameras with artificial intelligence to reduce chemical usage by 90%. And a European start-up is deploying wireless climate sensors and agricultural applications to drive crop yields up to 3x. 
Looking ahead, 5G has the capacity to manage diverse connections across industries as it becomes the universal connector from the home to the office to the factory floor and to the farm. Skyworks is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this transformation with decades of connectivity leadership. The acceleration of 5G powered a broad set of use cases in Q4 with design wins encompassing the newest, most innovative smartphones and IoT devices, as well as gains in wireless infrastructure. 
Specifically, in mobile, we accelerated the reach of our Sky5 portfolio, powering the latest launches at leading Tier 1 smartphone OEMs supporting more than 20 platforms. In addition, we shipped Sky5 solutions across Samsung Galaxy's tablet portfolio. 
In IoT, we continue to gain new customers and extend content. We delivered 5G CP connectivity solutions to Nokia. We partnered with Swisscom to launch their WiFi 6 GPON residential gateway. We ramped WiFi 6 and 60 platforms at NETGEAR and Cisco, launched connectivity and home security devices with Amazon, Ring and Comcast, and captured design wins at Garmin supporting mobile fitness applications. 
In automotive, we supported autonomous driving systems with a market-leading road with platform, enabled advanced charge control unit systems for a Tier 1 European automotive OEM. Across the infrastructure markets, we provided power isolation solutions to a strategic manufacturer of EV including residential solar and energy storage systems, and we secured multiple design wins in next-generation MIMO and small cell base station installations. 
Moving ahead, we see a multiyear secular technology evolution with our aperture widening from smartphones to industrial, automotive and an expansive set of IoT devices. Skyworks is fueling this dramatic technological shift with our unique capabilities, integrating not only 5G, but increasingly with our other critical connectivity protocols, including high-performance Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and precision GPS. 
As these opportunities emerge, Skyworks is positioned to win with the breadth and depth of our customer relationships established over 20 years, our experience across multiple technology transitions and a dedicated and talented workforce that executed extraordinarily well during fiscal 2021. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris."

Operating expenses were $180 million or 13.8% of revenue, demonstrating leverage in our operating model while continuing our strategic investments in support of future growth. We generated $488 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 37.2%. 
We incurred $11 million of other expenses, and our effective tax rate was 8%, driving net income of $439 million. So top line momentum and execution on margins drove diluted earnings per share of $2.62 ahead of consensus estimates. EPS grew 22% sequentially and increased 42% compared to Q4 of last year. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Fourth fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $398 million. Capital expenditures were $263 million, and we paid $93 million in dividends and repaid $250 million of our term loan.
Let's also review our record-breaking full fiscal year performance. Revenue grew 52% to EUR 5.1 billion, adding over $1.7 billion in incremental revenue over fiscal 2020. Gross profit was $2.6 billion, resulting in a gross margin of 50.9%. Operating income increased 73% to EUR 2 billion with an all-time record operating margin of 38.2%, up 450 basis points from the prior year.
Net income was $1.8 billion, translating into $10.50 of diluted earnings per share, up 71% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was up 47% to $1.8 billion. And during fiscal 2021, we returned $536 million of cash back to the shareholders with $340 million in dividends and $196 million in share buybacks, all during Q1 of fiscal '21. 
Starting in Q2 of fiscal '21, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in connection with the acquisition of the Infrastructure and Automotive business from Silicon Labs. Given the strength of our business and the progress we have made on integrating the acquisition And given the low leverage ratio of less than one turn, going forward, we will, from time to time, consider share repurchases as part of our capital allocation strategy depending on market conditions, and in addition to our dividend program and further term loan repayments. 
In summary, the Skyworks team executed exceptionally well, delivering record revenue, profitability and cash generation, while making the investments that advance our technology leadership and manufacturing footprint in order to drive long-term profitable growth. Now let's move on to our outlook for Q1 of fiscal 2022. We expect to deliver another quarter of double-digit sequential revenue and earnings per share growth in the December quarter. 
Specifically, we anticipate revenue between $1.475 billion and $1.525 billion. At the midpoint of $1.5 billion, revenue for the quarter is expected to increase 14% sequentially. Gross margin is projected to be in the range of 51% to 51.5%. We expect operating expenses of approximately $184 million to $187 million. 
And below the line, we anticipate roughly $10 million in other expense and a tax rate of approximately 9.5%. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 167.5 million shares. Accordingly, at the midpoint of the revenue range, we intend to deliver diluted earnings per share of $3.10, an increase of 18% sequentially. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam."

Also, I just want to point out on a full year basis, broad markets was over $1.4 billion in revenue, growing at 45% on a year-over-year basis. 
So very strong performance in our broad markets business. On the flip side, of course, we had -- mobile in Q4 was 71% of our revenue, up 40% year-over-year and up 19% sequentially. So really strong execution there of course, as we supported the ramp of new phone platforms at our largest customer.

We definitely have the technology that is needed to make that lift in China. And our numbers there continue to look very strong. So it's a great part of the portfolio. It definitely is an opportunity to kind of enrich the technology within those phones. They're still a little bit lighter than some of the flagships that we have in the U.S. But we have to know how to do it. 
The other thing about the China market is they want integration. They want labs to fat types of products. They want our applications engineers. They need people that can make the job easier for them and fulfill a smooth transition to the consumer. So all that stuff around the edges, that's our bread and butter.

This -- I mean, this is a big number, but it really underscores the deep customer engagement that we have with this customer, by the way, not only in their smartphone lineup, but almost in every other product that they have and that they sell, you will find Skyworks inside. 
Also, in Q4, the quarter we just closed, the Skyworks team really executed well, supporting the launch and the ramp of a new smartphone platform that yet again, for now almost 10 or 13 times in a row, we were able to obtain higher dollar content per phone as witnessed by the tier downs that came out when the phone came out. 
And you can see when you look at the tier downs, we really provided multiple high-performance, very complex, highly integrated solutions, multiple sockets in that form that includes, in many cases, multiple best-in-class filters, including TC SAW and bulk acoustic wave technology across the transmit chain, the receive chain as well as many other functionalities, including GPS and WiFi, of course.

I think the key here, and Kris kind of mentioned it, it's all about performance. It's not just -- it's not phone to phone, it's technology to technology. And you see a very, very different technology in the higher-end players in China, where they are embracing the kinds of increasingly complex signals that Kris mentioned, using bulk acoustic wave using our TC SAW, using an integrated approach, a Sky5 approach. 
In that side of the field, it's great, and we have a tremendous opportunity. We're continuing to grow the content because the complexity is going up. The complexity is what's driving the content. So we're making that adoption happen rapidly depending -- independent of market conditions. And we're also trying to uplift the lower end. There's still a pretty high percentage of lower-end phones in China that we want to uplift and bring them to full 5G capability. 
And in those cases, you could have a $2 to $3 content that could move to $4 to $5. And so there's pretty good leverage on that side. So you've got multiple market focuses within China. We're able to address all of them from the highest to the most economical. And that's one of the strategies that's worked for us. And very often, the first phone that we may work with with a customer, we'll have that customer for 5 to 10 years and continue to move the dial on content and performance as we step along.

With respect to our ability to execute and deliver in cases maybe where some others were not able to do that, is really about investments that we've made and investments that we made early. So if you let me indulge here for a minute, go back to where we were a year ago. we went from $3.3 billion to $5.1 billion in 1 year, in 1 year with no M&A. How do we do that? Well, we made those investments months and months 6 to 12 months before to ready ourselves to win. 
And also knowing that we have the right customer set that appreciated the performance and technology that we could bring to the market. And so that worked great for us, and we executed tremendously. So the upside to that is those capital assets and those technology investments are there. They're on the job today, but there's a lot more we need to do. 
So of course, we were kicked up a little bit here in the supply chain issues and shortages. But having our assets in-house, and you've heard me talk about this for a long time, having those assets in-house are strategic. It's critical. It's what customers want to see, all the way from gallium arsenide to packaging, assembly and test, TS SAW, bulk acoustic wave, Standard saw, all of that. We can mix and match to put the right solution together. 
So that is one of the reasons why our numbers here that we're talking about today, they're very strong. And certainly, we're experiencing the same market environment, but it was the ability to invest early, drive that cash flow, drive that performance to continue to do that and then bring those products to market in ways that are very flexible and having the ability to go from IoT to 5G, to Bluetooth, to Wi-Fi -- whatever the connectivity protocol may be, we will have the technology execution vehicles within our company to execute for our customers."

If we would not have made the necessary investments in our manufacturing footprint. By the way, not only just expanding the capacity but also adding new technology and improving the performance of our technology and our products that was a very smart decision by the team here, proactively putting that capacity in place. 
And that's why -- I mean there is a lot of supply issues in the world, but it's not necessarily because of scar words. I mean there is tightness and there are -- we're not perfect, right? We -- the demand is higher than the supply, but Skyworks has, compared to peers and competitors and other industry players executed really well because we did not hesitate and put the CapEx in place. 
And again, this is just the beginning of a long 5G cycle, the beginning of WiFi upgrade, the beginning of proliferation of 5G outside of mobile into broad markets. 
And so we are not going to hesitate that we are going to make the necessary investments to further continue and support the growth of the business. As it relates to gross margin, it's -- we did 51 , so we were up 40 basis points sequentially, up 60 basis points year-over-year. I mean, we all wish it was higher, and the team will continue to work and and drive it higher. But I've talked about that before. We are still facing COVID-19 headwinds. And yes, it is a tight supply constrained environment, and we are facing some input cost increases right now.
Again, the team is handling it very well. We continue to drive further operational efficiencies. And when you put it all together, we have a path to further improve gross margins over time."

But we really want to continue to raise our bar with our technology and our R&D teams and our execution. to bring customers the performance levels that they really need."

Is that still happening with you folks? Are you still constrained to the fact that you can't ship everything that customers ask for? 
And does that suggest that there's going to be some catch-up in terms of your shipments as you go into the seasonally slower first half of the calendar year?"

On one hand, the fact that we have our own manufacturing assets allows us to be really close to the demand curve. So we're not subject to these big overhangs where we're waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting for parts. We're making our products. So we're largely an in-house technology company with -- around the edges, we will use some fabless partners. So our exposure to that is much, much lower than others. Do we still have some effects, of course, because it only takes 1 or 2 parts that could muck up a finished product and everybody understands that. 
So it does create some wrinkles. But I would say that given the work that we've done at Skyworks for years and then more lately, as we talked about, as evidenced by the 3.3% to 5.1%, the ability to stretch and scale the business is a pretty good indicator of what our capabilities are. 
So I believe that we're going to do very, very well when we've got a tailwind, and we're going to do well and it's a muddy field. We're capable of doing it either way. And again, a lot of that has to do with managing your own technologies, making those investments, with your own people, your own teams and platforms that you know exactly where they're going to go. 
So that's kind of our strategy as we go forward. And I think that tries going to work very, very well for the future."

One of the things that is really advantageous for Skyworks, and we talked about the technologies and the in-house capacity and scale. 
It's going to help us quite a bit in China because in China, as you know, the content is not as rich as it is in some of the higher-end phones, but there's a tremendous opportunity to lift that content. 
And a lot of that comes down to the technical knowhow in demonstrating what a couple of dollars of incremental content can do to the user experience to the performance of the connected devices. And it's significant. And I think those that are deeply in this industry know that.
So we have to do a little bit of engagement there to continue to demonstrate with our customers what performance can really mean to the user. And we're getting very, very good response to that, and that's going to drive our content because you've got to have a catalyst to get that content up there. And I think when users can see the performance levels that really are right there in front of them, I just need to embrace it. 
There's an opportunity for them to see a much better -- and gain a much better experience with connected solutions that we can provide. So -- and we do that with many, many other customers with much higher end performance marks. We know how to do it. We have great application engineers that can work across each baseband as well.

Before I touch on the fourth fiscal quarter results, I want to highlight the significant accomplishments that underpin a record-breaking year for Skyworks. First, total revenue grew to $5.1 billion, 52% ahead of last year, representing an increase of over $1.7 billion.
We increased earnings per share to $10.50, up 71%. Operating cash flow expanded to $1.8 billion, an increase of 47%, and we completed a strategic and compelling acquisition, immediately diversifying our product portfolio and expanding our market reach. Finally, with the investments we've made, Skyworks navigated a complex supply chain environment, leveraging world-class manufacturing capabilities across strategic technology.
Now turning to Q4, where Skyworks delivered record performance. Revenues in our mobile and broad markets portfolios both grew at double-digit rates sequentially and year-over-year as we capitalized on broad-based momentum, fueled by demand for our unique connectivity solutions.  Specifically, we delivered revenue of  -- $1.31 billion, achieved gross margin of 51% and operating margin of 37.2%. We posted earnings per share of $2.62, exceeding our guidance by $0.09 and generated strong operating cash flow totaling $398 million in the quarter.  
The complexity inherent in 5G and the demand for highly integrated solutions were a major catalyst in driving our performance. The momentum in global 5G carrier subscription is building with estimates of 580 million users today, expanding to more than 3 billion users by the end of 2025.
As expected, smartphones are leading the early transition but new innovative use cases are emerging from automotive and industrial IoT, to enhance virtual reality, gaming and telemedicine.   Importantly, the power of 5G is increasingly being harnessed to drive sustainability efforts across industries worldwide, providing the wireless backbone to AI-powered ecosystems, combining measurement, analysis and optimization.  
For example, a major U.S. manufacturer is combining wireless sensor-enabled cameras with artificial intelligence to reduce chemical usage by 90%. And a European start-up is deploying wireless climate sensors and agricultural applications to drive crop yields up to 3x.
Looking ahead, 5G has the capacity to manage diverse connections across industries as it becomes the universal connector from the home to the office to the factory floor and to the farm. Skyworks is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this transformation with decades of connectivity leadership. The acceleration of 5G powered a broad set of use cases in Q4 with design wins encompassing the newest, most innovative smartphones and IoT devices, as well as gains in wireless infrastructure.
Specifically, in mobile, we accelerated the reach of our Sky5 portfolio, powering the latest launches at leading Tier 1 smartphone OEMs supporting more than 20 platforms. In addition, we shipped Sky5 solutions across Samsung Galaxy's tablet portfolio.  
In IoT, we continue to gain new customers and expand content. We delivered 5G CPE connectivity solutions to Nokia. We partnered with Swisscom to launch their WiFi 6 GPON residential gateway.  We ramped WiFi 6 and 6E platforms at NETGEAR and Cisco. Launched connectivity and home security devices with Amazon, Ring and Comcast, and captured design wins at Garmin supporting mobile fitness applications.  
In automotive, we supported autonomous driving systems with a market-leading Robotaxi platform and enabled advanced Charge Control Unit systems for a Tier 1 European automotive OEM. 
Across the infrastructure markets, we provided power isolation solutions to a strategic manufacturer of EV including residential solar and energy storage systems, and we secured multiple design wins in next-generation MIMO and small cell base station installations.
Moving ahead, we see a multiyear secular technology evolution with our aperture widening from smartphones to industrial, automotive and an expansive set of IoT devices.   Skyworks is fueling this dramatic technological shift with our unique capabilities, integrating not only 5G, but increasingly with our other critical connectivity protocols, including high-performance Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and precision GPS.  
As these opportunities emerge, Skyworks is positioned to win. With the breadth and depth of our customer relationships established over 20 years, our experience across multiple technology transitions and a dedicated and talented workforce that executed extraordinarily well during fiscal 2021. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Kris."

Skyworks revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021 was $1.311 billion, up 17% sequentially and up 37% year-over-year, driven by both mobile solutions and broad markets.

Skyworks revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021 was $1.311 billion, up 17% sequentially and up 37% year-over-year, driven by both mobile solutions and broad markets. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $668 million, resulting in a gross margin of 51% up 40 basis points sequentially and 60 basis points year-over-year.  
Operating expenses were $180 million or 13.8% of revenue, demonstrating leverage in our operating model while continuing our strategic investments in support of future growth. We generated $488 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 37.2%.  
We incurred $11 million of other expenses, and our effective tax rate was 8%, driving net income of $439 million.   So top line momentum and execution on margins drove diluted earnings per share of $2.62 ahead of consensus estimates.  EPS grew 22% sequentially and increased 42% compared to Q4 of last year.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Fourth fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $398 million. Capital expenditures were $263 million, and we paid $93 million in dividends and repaid $250 million of our term loan.
Let's also review our record-breaking full fiscal year performance. Revenue grew 52% to $5.1 billion, adding over $1.7 billion in incremental revenue over fiscal 2020. Gross profit was $2.6 billion, resulting in a gross margin of 50.9%. Operating income increased 73% to $2 billion with an all-time record operating margin of 38.2%, up 450 basis points from the prior year.  Net income was $1.8 billion, translating into $10.50 of diluted earnings per share, up 71% year-over-year.  Cash flow from operations was up 47% to $1.8 billion. And during fiscal 2021, we returned $536 million of cash back to the shareholders with $340 million in dividends and $196 million in share buybacks, all during Q1 of fiscal '21.
Starting in Q2 of fiscal '21, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in connection with the acquisition of the Infrastructure & Automotive business from Silicon Labs. Given the strength of our business and the progress we have made on integrating the acquisition And given the low leverage ratio of less than one turn, going forward, we will, from time to time, consider share repurchases as part of our capital allocation strategy depending on market conditions, and in addition to our dividend program and further term loan repayments.
In summary, the Skyworks team executed exceptionally well, delivering record revenue, profitability and cash generation, while making the investments that advance our technology leadership and manufacturing footprint in order to drive long-term profitable growth.  
Now let's move on to our outlook for Q1 of fiscal 2022. We expect to deliver another quarter of double-digit sequential revenue and earnings per share growth in the December quarter.    
Specifically, we anticipate revenue between $1.475 billion and $1.525 billion.  At the midpoint of $1.5 billion, revenue for the quarter is expected to increase 14% sequentially. Gross margin is projected to be in the range of 51% to 51.5%. We expect operating expenses of approximately $184 million to $187 million. And below the line, we anticipate roughly $10 million in other expense and a tax rate of approximately 9.5%. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 167.5 million shares. Accordingly, at the midpoint of the revenue range, we intend to deliver diluted earnings per share of $3.10, an increase of 18% sequentially. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam."

Also, I just want to point out on a full year basis, broad markets was over $1.4 billion in revenue, growing at 45% on a year-over-year basis. So very strong performance in our broad markets business.   
On the flip side, of course, we had mobile, in Q4 was 71% of our revenue, up 40% year-over-year and up 19% sequentially. So really strong execution there, of course, as we supported the ramp of new phone platforms at our largest customer. On a full year basis, just in mobile, we did more than 3 point -- or approximately $3.7 billion of revenue, up 55% on a year-over-year basis, clearly, supported by the early adoption of 5G.

So good work in broad markets. As Kris noted, we've got some substantial top line. We're going to continue to drive that. Our research and development folks are driving innovation every day, not just in broad but also deeply in mobile. And that recipe is working very well. 
In addition, the manufacturing assets that we have and the technology development that we put forth really gives us the flexibility to hit each and every one of those customers in a way that they want to see the products."

We definitely have the technology that is needed to make that lift in China.  And our numbers there continue to look very strong. So it's a great part of the portfolio.  It definitely is an opportunity to kind of enrich the technology within those phones. They're still a little bit lighter than some of the flagships that we have in the U.S.  But we have to know how to do it.  
The other thing about the China market is they want integration. They want labs to fast types of products. They want our applications engineers.

And you see a very, very different technology in the higher-end players in China, where they are embracing the kinds of increasingly complex signals that Kris mentioned, using bulk acoustic wave, using our TC-SAW, using an integrated approach, a Sky5 approach.
In that side of the field, it's great, and we have a tremendous opportunity. We're continuing to grow the content because the complexity is going up. The complexity is what's driving the content. So we're making that adoption happen rapidly depending -- independent of market conditions. And we're also trying to uplift the lower end. There's still a pretty high percentage of lower-end phones in China that we want to uplift and bring them to full 5G capability. 
And in those cases, you could have a $2 to $3 content that could move to $4 to $5. And so there's pretty good leverage on that side. So you've got multiple market focuses within China. We're able to address all of them from the highest to the most economical. And that's one of the strategies that's worked for us. And very often, the first phone that we may work with a customer, we'll have that customer for 5 to 10 years and continue to move the dial on content and performance as we step along.

Well, we made those investments months and months, 6 to 12 months before to ready ourselves to win. 
And also knowing that we have the right customer set that appreciated the performance and technology that we could bring to the market. And so that worked great for us, and we executed tremendously. So the upside to that is those capital assets and those technology investments are there. They're on the job today, but there's a lot more we need to do. 
So of course, we were nipped up a little bit here in the supply chain issues and shortages. But having our assets in-house, and you've heard me talk about this for a long time, having those assets in-house are strategic. It's critical. It's what customers want to see, all the way from gallium arsenide to packaging, assembly and test, TC-SAW, bulk acoustic wave, standard SAW, all of that. We can mix and match to put the right solution together. 
So that is one of the reasons why our numbers here that we're talking about today, they're very strong. And certainly, we're experiencing the same market environment, but it was the ability to invest early, drive that cash flow, drive that performance to continue to do that and then bring those products to market in ways that are very flexible and having the ability to go from IoT to 5G, to Bluetooth, to WiFi -- whatever the connectivity protocol may be, we will have the technology execution vehicles within our company to execute for our customers."

So first of all, on the CapEx in fiscal '21, CapEx was running at about 12% to revenue, which is somewhat in line with the last couple of years. We've been in that 10%, 12% range. And we're very fortunate that we did make the investments. I mean as we just explained, we grew the revenue 50 -- more than 50% year-over-year. If we would not have made the necessary investments in our manufacturing footprint. By the way, not only just expanding the capacity but also adding new technology and improving the performance of our technology and our products that was a very smart decision by the team here, proactively putting that capacity in place.
And that's why -- I mean there is a lot of supply issues in the world, but it's not necessarily because of Skyworks. I mean there is tightness and there are -- we're not perfect, right? We -- the demand is higher than the supply, but Skyworks has, compared to peers and competitors and other industry players executed really well because we did not hesitate and put the CapEx in place. 
And again, this is just the beginning of a long 5G cycle, the beginning of WiFi upgrade, the beginning of proliferation of 5G outside of mobile into broad markets. 
And so we are not going to hesitate that we are going to make the necessary investments to further continue and support the growth of the business. As it relates to gross margin, it's -- we did 51%, so we went up 40 basis points sequentially, up 60 basis points year-over-year. I mean, we all wish it was higher, and the team will continue to work and drive it higher. But I've talked about that before. We are still facing COVID-19 headwinds. And yes, it is a tight supply constrained environment, and we are facing some input cost increases right now.
Again, the team is handling it very well. We continue to drive further operational efficiencies. And when you put it all together, we have a path to further improve gross margins over time."

So I think our teams are constantly crafting and developing next-generation solutions and also broadening the reach. So it isn't just a certain set of customers. It's a broader set of customers.
And what we find is that there's just a tremendous need for performance, right? I mean, performance is really what's going to drive this. And then performance really means that you've got to deliver the technology behind that. So we're spending a lot of money in that area. But strategically, we've got some great R&D folks in-house that are crafty that know how to get stuff done and developing solutions for the next wave, right? Markets like WiFi 6 and 6E are also right now in a great position for growth as we move forward. And I think connectivity around WiFi is going to be great, and we'll complement what we're doing in classic mobile device. 
So I think there's a lot of good stuff going on. The appetite with our customers is fantastic. I mean there's no end to the ideas, on the inquiries and the challenges that we're being asked to address, which is great. I mean, I'd much rather talk about that than worry about supply chains.

On one hand, the fact that we have our own manufacturing assets allows us to be really close to the demand curve. So we're not subject to these big overhangs where we're waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting for parts. We're making our products. So we're largely an in-house technology company with -- around the edges, we will use some fabless partners. So our exposure to that is much, much lower than others. Do we still have some effects, of course, because it only takes 1 or 2 parts that could muck up a finished product and everybody understands that. 
So it does create some wrinkles. But I would say that given the work that we've done at Skyworks for years and then more lately, as we talked about, as evidenced by the 3.3% to 5.1%, the ability to stretch and scale the business is a pretty good indicator of what our capabilities are.
So I believe that we're going to do very, very well when we've got a tailwind, and we're going to do well when it's a muddy field. We're capable of doing it either way. And again, a lot of that has to do with managing your own technologies, making those investments, with your own people, your own teams and platforms that you know exactly where they're going to go. 
So that's kind of our strategy as we go forward. And I think that going to work very, very well for the future."

One of the things that is really advantageous for Skyworks, and we talked about the technologies and the in-house capacity and scale. 
It's going to help us quite a bit in China because in China, as you know, the content is not as rich as it is in some of the higher-end phones, but there's a tremendous opportunity to lift that content.
And a lot of that comes down to the technical knowhow in demonstrating what a couple of dollars of incremental content can do to the user experience to the performance of the connected devices. And it's significant. And I think those that are deeply in this industry know that.
So we have to do a little bit of engagement there to continue to demonstrate with our customers what performance can really mean to the user. And we're getting very, very good response to that, and that's going to drive our content because you've got to have a catalyst to get that content up there. And I think when users can see the performance levels that really are right there in front of them, they just need to embrace it.
There's an opportunity for them to see a much better -- and gain a much better experience with connected solutions that we can provide.
