I would say earlier in the year, I think people were just trying to sort out how to deal with COVID, how to deal with the current environment, how to manage their cash flows, and so we really didn't see a lot of interest from other parties in terms of discussing M&A. 
I would say as we move here through the fourth quarter and people start to see markets returning more to normal and feel more confident about their outlook for 2021, and therefore, a reasonable valuation basis, we are starting to see people having more interest in discussions around M&A. So I'd say the market is opening up. Obviously, it takes us a little while to get through these discussions, but definitely looking better as we go into 2021."

So we really do see the prices stabilizing now for to and maybe even a little bit of upward movement. So that's good. So if you look at our outlook for tow, we're basically saying we think for the next many years, it's going to be pretty much flat at this kind of 2 50 to 2 60 range. 
In terms of transaction, look, we didn't to do the transaction last time because of competition concerns in the EU. There's nothing that's changed in the landscape that makes that different. So I think it's unlikely that we would be able to do a similar type transaction even today."

When we did that, we assumed we would either shut down or cut back capacity in Asia. So it was kind of a net capacity neutral. And the project was based on -- it's justified based on productivity. When we made the decision to delay the project for 18 months given the low oil environment, the uncertainties around COVID, et cetera, we took that as an opportunity to really go back and reexamine the basis for the project. And in doing so, we found another $50 million of savings in capital we could make in the project. We also had a chance to go work with some of our suppliers in Asia. And we're able to negotiate during that low raw material environment and very favorable contracts going forward, both for Singapore and for Nanjing, which makes both of those locations more attractive from a competitiveness standpoint. And we also found other sources of productivity, specifically around catalyst usage and Clear Lake and some other areas, that when we really looked at it in total, we said, you know what? Given also the strong recovery we're seeing in acetic acid, our view to the future that acetic acid will continue to grow at GDP, plus maybe a little bit more, we said it really makes more sense for us to go ahead and do the expansion at Clear Lake, which, by the way, we're actually going to be able to expand Clear Lake to be about 2.6 million tons capable so we will do that larger expansion at Clear Lake, keep all the facilities available to us and running in Asia, which, again, we won't run them full necessarily. We'll run them to meet what we need in the market and meet the demand. But gives us the option in the future, if we do see more robust growth, to run them at higher rates, and we still get the same level of productivity and credit on a smaller capital base in Clear Lake. So actually, I think the delay turned out to be a good thing. We actually had a chance to go back and reexamine some elements of the projects and have what I think is a stronger, more robust economically project now as well as additional capacity we can use for the future."

And then on Engineered Materials, if you could just help us understand how you think the shape of that is going to play out. I know one of the big drivers is going to be how fast the health care part comes back. But how are you thinking of that?

So starting with acetyls, yes, we do expect a really robust first quarter as we guided to, and we do expect some normalization as we move into second quarter and what could really change that. I mean if you look at what's driving kind of the 4Q and the, let's call it, really December and the 1Q pricing, we've had more robust demand, all in China, I would say, for acetic acid and for BAM. So it really has been more demand-led. There have been a number of shorter outages in China for acetic acid and VAM. If you actually look at the data, it's not been significantly different than most fourth quarters. So I would say the tightness we've seen in December and going into January and February has really been demand-driven. Now some of those outages that we've had, although there was a few more in January which has given us some volatility in acetic acid, those plants are coming back online. And that's we say kind of once plants are back, as people now have adjusted to this new level of demand, I mean, quite frankly, we saw what we thought was a little bit of panic buying over these 3 months where people, because demand was coming up and because there was a few outages, responded by doing a little bit of restocking because it made them nervous. I think that's going to calm down as we go forward and people see security of supply and a more stable demand outlook. 
Now clearly, look, if there's another outage, especially if there were an outage in the Western Hemisphere, could we see these conditions, these kind of $500 to $700 per ton conditions continue on into the second quarter? I mean we could. It's just we don't have any visibility of right that right now, and so we would say we expect it to kind of normalize to normal ranges. I would expect we should have -- we expect $170 million to $200 million every quarter through the rest of the year. That's what we consider a pretty normalized level of earnings for acetyls and fully expect to be in that range. 
For Engineered Materials, we guided to $120 million on some modest price and volume recovery. Obviously, we're seeing headwinds from raws, but we've been making price movements that we think will largely offset that movement we've seen in raws. I would expect a little bit of improvement on that in second and third quarter, typical of what we see those being stronger demand months. We should also expect a little bit more recovery in our affiliate earnings. So expect to see that roll through in second and third quarter. And then fourth quarter typically looks more like first quarter, so I would think of it that way for the year."

And I think this year is a good example of why we're starting to transition a little bit away from a number of projects to more towards value of projects. 
So if you look at 2020, we actually, with all the challenges of COVID and everything else, ended up ending the year with about 90% of the number of project wins as we had in 2019. But if you look at the value of the wins we had in 2020, they were actually right at the same level as the value of the wins we had in 2019. And that's really what we're focusing on on projects, which is not just, are we generating a high number? But are we generating projects that have value and have extended value? So we've really been focusing on project wins in some of those program areas I mentioned earlier. So things like future mobility, around electric vehicles and autonomous, and connectivities, of 5G, and those sorts of things and mobile. If you look at it, for example, the growth in the number of projects we've had in terms of value is more than 65% for autonomous vehicles and electric vehicles. And for connectivity, it's over 60%. So we're really shifting our focus to those, I would say, newer focuses, things that we think are going to have long life. And we're having a very high success rate in those areas. 
So if we look towards next year, clearly, we would expect that value to continue to grow. It needs to grow to continue to meet our expectations for EBIT growth year-on-year. So we continue to -- but again, we're focusing on value of project wins, not just number of project wins."

We're always looking to add new capability there. So I would say that's not changed. I would say, given the time we had this year in 2020, we've used that to cast maybe a little broader net than we've had before and looked at some other -- not just polymers, but other chemistries that use a similar business model to what we use in EM and that we think we could add value to. So I'd say we're looking broadly to make sure we're not missing any opportunities to really grow value for the shareholders."

I mean, this year, our margins were compressed in EM, for 2 reasons, I would say. One is a pretty significant amount of turnaround expense we had this year with both the Bisha and the IPH POM turnaround. So those were 2 very large turnarounds which we also had quite a bit of inventory draw to cover those. So those together had a pretty significant impact. The other thing this year is with lower volumes, and we ran plants in second and third quarter, certainly at -- some shut down for a period of time, some run at lower rates. This is a high fixed cost business. And so that fixed cost gets spread across the rest of the volumes, and that certainly had an impact on our margins. 
I would say, as we go into 2021, I would certainly expect to be back at that in -- excuse me, if I always think in EBIT, but at that kind of 20% to 25% range of EBIT margins as we go into 2021, and we see back to normal rates volume and kind of a normal level of turnaround activity."

Look, we think sustainable margins in acetyls [ up ] $170 million to $200 million. We consider those kind of a foundational level of earnings, and therefore, sustainable over a pretty wide variety of conditions. And I think it's really based on the flexibility we have in the chain and the optionality we have in the chain. I mean earlier in the year, although we weren't at those levels, we saw still good returns from acetyls because we were able, even with acetic demand being down, BAM being stronger, emulsions being stronger, being able to flex our chain to produce more of those molecules. Now with acetic acid stronger, we can flex back and put more back into acetic acid. So that flexibility that we have and the geographic flexibility -- I mean, as you say, Nanjing, with coal prices up, but natural gas prices aren't really up in the Gulf Coast, and we still have all that Clear Lake capacity. So that we just shift more to Clear Lake and take advantage of low U.S. Gulf Coast natural gas prices. Oil has been fairly low, so that's made our Singapore capacity pretty attractive. So having that geographical as well as the flexibility within the chain, we think gives us a lot of optionality across a wide range of economic conditions. And that's why we feel that $170 million to $200 is very sustainable. Now the higher level that we're seeing, kind of that $225-plus million level that we're predicting for Q1, that's a little higher -- harder level to sustain. That's really based on some very high acetic acid pricing, specifically in China. But certainly, that $170 million to $200 million, we think is sustainable."

We just aren't seeing the impacts now from COVID. I mean if you look, we're really getting back to 2019 levels of demand. And we're not hearing anything different from customers. 
So I think truly demand is driving the increase that we're seeing in the acetyl chain. I think demand is driving the increases we're seeing in EM. Now we have had some bumpiness and volatility in December and into the first few months of this year in acetyl. I think that's been based on people, because they are confident about the future, being worried about these what turned out to be fairly minor supply disruptions and causing some volatility in the market. But I think, overall, and the reason we are optimistic about 2021 and growth into 2021 is, overall, we really see confidence by our customers and continued growth in the markets and that steady increase in demand."

We think that should be enough to kind of keep it in front of the raw material environment that's developing and basically keep it flat, if you will, fourth quarter to first quarter. So we think we're out in front of it. I mean our teams do a great job keeping our eyes on raw materials and trying to figure out what's happening and making sure that we can put sufficient price increases out there to cover the cost of raw materials. But there is always a bit of a lag, especially in EM, between when we see those raw material increases and when we see them in our books and when we can pass through prices. I think in this case, we have pretty low inventory. So we're seeing that a bit sooner.

But because of our technology and because of some of the contracts that we've been able to negotiate, if you look at Singapore, certainly kind of this is $40 to $50 oil, it is also very cost competitive. And even Nanjing, even at higher coal prices, I would say all of our facilities are in the top 25% to 30% -- in terms of top, meaning the best, 25% or 30% of all of the acetic acid facilities in the world.

There's a number of factors there. First is we did add Elite in April of 2020. So there's some volume that comes with Elotex that gets added to those numbers. We did see, of course, demand recovery in fourth quarter of '20 and some tightness in the market, which helps drive volumes up. I would also remind you, we had a fairly significant outage at our Clear Lake plant in fourth quarter of last year. And although we had secured some volumes last year to cover that, fourth quarter last year was actually a little bit softer quarter than we typically have seen in acetyls. So I would say, one, it was a strong fourth quarter for acetyls in terms of demand, certainly, the best we've seen this year, not surprising with COVID, but even good versus last year. As we see the market, normalizing, we saw a little less seasonality. We saw some seasonality in emulsions, but we're able to shift that volume into strong demand for acid and VAM, especially in China. And that's really where we saw the difference in strength this year, much stronger demand in China this year, Western hemisphere, about the same."

Or if we were to see significant supply outages in acetic acid, that would certainly be an upside to both the quarter and to the year. I think the obvious biggest challenge on the downside is what you laid out in terms of COVID, is do the markets lose confidence? Do we see automakers, for example, shut down again for 2 months? That would be the biggest downside. The vaccine rolling out helps, I think, in that area of confidence and also sure we have enough employees who are well to run plants around the globe. As I said earlier, it is a downside. We're not baking that in because, quite frankly, we're not seeing that behavior from our customers. What we're seeing is people have demand, people want to run back at normal buying patterns. So unless we see a significant change from where we've been to date on COVID, we think that's a manageable downside risk."

I would say earlier in the year, I think people were just trying to sort out how to deal with COVID, how to deal with the current environment, how to manage their cash flows, and so we really didn't see a lot of interest from other parties in terms of discussing M&A. 
I would say as we move here through the fourth quarter and people start to see markets returning more to normal and feel more confident about their outlook for 2021, and therefore, a reasonable valuation basis, we are starting to see people having more interest in discussions around M&A. So I'd say the market is opening up. Obviously, it takes us a little while to get through these discussions, but definitely looking better as we go into 2021."

So I do think there's -- as you said, we saw less decline in smoking last year than expected in some areas, even an increase in smoking. I guess people had more time at home. So we really do see the prices stabilizing now for tow and maybe even a little bit of upward movement. So that's good. So if you look at our outlook for tow, we're basically saying we think for the next many years, it's going to be pretty much flat at this kind of [ 2 50 ] to [ 2 60 ] range.  
In terms of transaction, look, we didn't to do the transaction last time because of competition concerns in the EU. There's nothing that's changed in the landscape that makes that different. So I think it's unlikely that we would be able to do a similar type transaction even today."

When we did that, we assumed we would either shut down or cut back capacity in Asia. So it was kind of a net capacity neutral. And the project was based on -- it's justified based on productivity. When we made the decision to delay the project for 18 months given the low oil environment, the uncertainties around COVID, et cetera, we took that as an opportunity to really go back and reexamine the basis for the project. And in doing so, we found another $50 million of savings in capital we could make in the project. 
We also had a chance to go work with some of our suppliers in Asia. And we're able to negotiate during that low raw material environment and very favorable contracts going forward, both for Singapore and for Nanjing, which makes both of those locations more attractive from a competitiveness standpoint. And we also found other sources of productivity, specifically around catalyst usage in Clear Lake and some other areas, that when we really looked at it in total, we said, you know what? Given also the strong recovery we're seeing in acetic acid, our view to the future that acetic acid will continue to grow GDP, plus maybe a little bit more. 
We said, it really makes more sense for us to go ahead and do the expansion at Clear Lake, which, by the way, we're actually going to be able to expand Clear Lake to be about 2.6 million tons capable. So we will do that larger expansion at Clear Lake, keep all the facilities available to us and running in Asia, which, again, we won't run them full necessarily. We'll run them to meet what we need in the market and meet the demand. But gives us the option in the future if we do see more robust growth to run them at higher rates, and we still get the same level of productivity and credit on a smaller capital base in Clear Lake. 
So actually, I think the delay turned out to be a good thing. We actually had a chance to go back and reexamine some elements of the projects and have what I think is a stronger, more robust economically project now as well as additional capacity we can use for the future."

You will see the equity earnings line which comes in on an after-tax basis that will -- the portion that kind of flips to the marketing return that we get will move above the line, and we will then add revenue, obviously, for what we're selling there onto the P&L.

And then on Engineered Materials, if you could just help us understand how you think the shape of that is going to play out. I know one of the big drivers is going to be how fast the health care part comes back. But how are you thinking of that?

And we do expect some normalization as we move into second quarter and what could really change that. I mean if you look at what's driving kind of the 4Q and the, let's call it, really December and the 1Q pricing, we've had more robust demand, all in China, I would say, for acetic acid and for VAM. So it really has been more demand-led. 
There have been a number of shorter outages in China for acetic acid and VAM. If you actually look at the data, it's not been significantly different than most fourth quarters. So I would say the tightness we've seen in December and going into January and February has really been demand-driven. Now some of those outages that we've had, although there was a few more in January which has given us some volatility in acetic acid, those plants are coming back online. And that's we say, kind of once plants are back, as people now have adjusted to this new level of demand, I mean, quite frankly, we saw what we thought was a little bit of panic buying over these 3 months where people, because demand was coming up and because there was a few outages, responded by doing a little bit of restocking because it made them nervous. I think that's going to calm down as we go forward and people see security of supply and a more stable demand outlook.  
Now clearly, look, if there's another outage, especially if there were an outage in the Western Hemisphere, could we see these conditions, these kind of $500 to $700 per ton conditions continue on into the second quarter? I mean we could. It's just we don't have any visibility of that right now, and so we would say we expect it to kind of normalize to normal ranges. I would expect we should have -- we expect $170 million to $200 million every quarter through the rest of the year. That's what we consider a pretty normalized level of earnings for acetyls and fully expect to be in that range.  
For Engineered Materials, we guided to $120 million on some modest price and volume recovery. Obviously, we're seeing headwinds from raws, but we've been making price movements that we think will largely offset that movement we've seen in raws. I would expect a little bit of improvement on that in second and third quarter, typical of what we see those being stronger demand months. We should also expect a little bit more recovery in our affiliate earnings. So expect to see that roll through in second and third quarter. And then fourth quarter typically looks more like first quarter. So I would think of it that way for the year."

Thanks for the question, Mike. Yes, tell you about the projects a little bit. And I think this year is a good example of why we're starting to transition a little bit away from a number of projects to more towards value of projects.  
So if you look at 2020, we actually, with all the challenges of COVID and everything else, ended up ending the year with about 90% of the number of project wins as we had in 2019. But if you look at the value of the wins we had in 2020, they were actually right at the same level as the value of the wins we had in 2019. And that's really what we're focusing on, on projects, which is not just, are we generating a high number, but are we generating projects that have value and have extended value? 
So we've really been focusing on project wins in some of those program areas I mentioned earlier. So things like future mobility, around electric vehicles and autonomous and connectivities, so 5G, and those sorts of things and mobile. If you look at it, for example, the growth in the number of projects we've had in terms of value is more than 65% for autonomous vehicles and electric vehicles. And for connectivity, it's over 60%. So we're really shifting our focus to those, I would say, newer focuses, things that we think are going to have long life. And we're having a very high success rate in those areas.  
So if we look towards next year, clearly, we would expect that value to continue to grow. It needs to grow to continue to meet our expectations for EBIT growth year-on-year. So we continue to -- but again, we're focusing on value of project wins, not just number of project wins."

We're always looking to add new capability there. So I would say that's not changed. 
I would say, given the time we had this year in 2020, we've used that to cast maybe a little broader net than we've had before and looked at some other -- not just polymers, but other chemistries that use a similar business model to what we use in EM and that we think we could add value to.

I mean this year, our margins were compressed in EM for two reasons, I would say. One is a pretty significant amount of turnaround expense we had this year with both the Bishop and the IPH POM turnaround. So those were 2 very large turnarounds which we also had quite a bit of inventory draw to cover those. So those together had a pretty significant impact. The other thing this year is with lower volumes, and we ran plants in second and third quarter certainly at -- some shut down for a period of time, some run at lower rates. This is a high fixed cost business. And so that fixed cost gets spread across the rest of the volumes, and that certainly had an impact on our margins. 
I would say, as we go into 2021, I would certainly expect to be back at that in -- excuse me, because I always think in EBIT, but at that kind of 20% to 25% range of EBIT margins as we go into 2021, and we see back to normal rates of volume and kind of a normal level of turnaround activity."

Look, we think sustainable margins in acetyls of $170 million to $200 million. We consider those kind of a foundational level of earnings, and therefore, sustainable over a pretty wide variety of conditions. And I think it's really based on the flexibility we have in the chain and the optionality we have in the chain. I mean earlier in the year, although we weren't at those levels, we saw still good returns from acetyls because we were able, even with acetic demand being down, VAM being stronger, emulsions being stronger, being able to flex our chain to produce more of those molecules. Now with acetic acid stronger, we can flex back and put more back into acetic acid. 
So that flexibility that we have and the geographic flexibility -- I mean as you say, Nanjing, with coal prices up, but natural gas prices aren't really up in the Gulf Coast, and we still have all that Clear Lake capacity. So that -- we just shift more to Clear Lake and take advantage of low U.S. Gulf Coast natural gas prices. Oil has been fairly low, so that's made our Singapore capacity pretty attractive. 
So having that geographical as well as the flexibility within the chain, we think gives us a lot of optionality across a wide range of economic conditions. And that's why we feel that $170 million to $200 is very sustainable. Now the higher level that we're seeing, kind of that $225-plus million level that we're predicting for Q1, that's a little higher -- harder level to sustain. That's really based on some very high acetic acid pricing, specifically in China. But certainly, that $170 million to $200 million, we think is sustainable."

We just aren't seeing the impacts now from COVID. I mean if you look, we're really getting back to 2019 levels of demand. And we're not hearing anything different from customers. 
So I think truly, demand is driving the increase that we're seeing in the acetyl chain. I think demand is driving the increases we're seeing in EM. Now we have had some bumpiness and volatility in December and into the first few months of this year in acetyl. I think that's been based on people, because they are confident about the future, being worried about these, what turned out to be fairly minor supply disruptions and causing some volatility in the market. But I think, overall, and the reason we are optimistic about 2021 and growth into 2021 is, overall, we really see confidence by our customers and continued growth in the markets and that steady increase in demand."

We think that should be enough to kind of keep it in front of the raw material environment that's developing and basically keep it flat, if you will, fourth quarter to first quarter. 
So we think we're out in front of it. I mean our teams do a great job keeping our eyes on raw materials and trying to figure out what's happening and making sure that we can put sufficient price increases out there to cover the cost of raw materials. But there is always a bit of a lag, especially in EM, between when we see those raw material increases and when we see them in our books and when we can pass through prices.

But because of our technology and because of some of the contracts that we've been able to negotiate, if you look at Singapore, certainly kind of this is $40 to $50 oil, it is also very cost competitive.

We did see, of course, demand recovery in fourth quarter of '20 and some tightness in the market, which helps drive volumes up. I would also remind you, we had a fairly significant outage at our Clear Lake plant in fourth quarter of last year. And although we had secured some volumes last year to cover that, fourth quarter last year was actually a little bit softer quarter than we typically have seen in acetyls. 
So I would say, one, it was a strong fourth quarter for acetyls in terms of demand. Certainly, the best we've seen this year, not surprising with COVID. But even good versus last year. As we see the market normalizing, we saw a little less seasonality. We saw some seasonality in emulsions, but we're able to shift that volume into strong demand for acid and VAM, especially in China.

Or if we were to see significant supply outages in acetic acid, that would certainly be an upside to both the quarter and to the year. 
I think the obvious biggest challenge on the downside is what you laid out in terms of COVID is, do the markets lose confidence? Do we see automakers, for example, shut down again for 2 months? That would be the biggest downside. The vaccine rolling out helps, I think, in that area of confidence and also pretty sure we have enough employees who are well to run plants around the globe. 
As I said earlier, it is a downside. We're not baking that in because, quite frankly, we're not seeing that behavior from our customers. What we're seeing is people have demand, people want to run, people are back at normal buying patterns. So unless we see a significant change from where we've been to date on COVID, we think that's a manageable downside risk."

I would say earlier in the year, I think people were just trying to sort out how to deal with COVID, how to deal with the current environment, how to manage their cash flows, and so we really didn't see a lot of interest from other parties in terms of discussing M&A. 
I would say as we move here through the fourth quarter and people start to see markets returning more to normal and feel more confident about their outlook for 2021, and therefore, a reasonable valuation basis, we are starting to see people having more interest in discussions around M&A. So I'd say the market is opening up. Obviously, it takes us a little while to get through these discussions, but definitely looking better as we go into 2021."

So I do think there's -- as you said, we saw less decline in smoking last year than expected in some areas, even an increase in smoking. I guess people had more time at home. So we really do see the prices stabilizing now for tow and maybe even a little bit of upward movement. So that's good. So if you look at our outlook for tow, we're basically saying we think for the next many years, it's going to be pretty much flat at this kind of [ 2 50 ] to [ 2 60 ] range. 
In terms of transaction, look, we didn't to do the transaction last time because of competition concerns in the EU. There's nothing that's changed in the landscape that makes that different. So I think it's unlikely that we would be able to do a similar type transaction even today."

When we did that, we assumed we would either shut down or cut back capacity in Asia. So it was kind of a net capacity neutral. And the project was based on -- it's justified based on productivity. When we made the decision to delay the project for 18 months given the low oil environment, the uncertainties around COVID, et cetera, we took that as an opportunity to really go back and reexamine the basis for the project. And in doing so, we found another $50 million of savings in capital we could make in the project. 
We also had a chance to go work with some of our suppliers in Asia. And we're able to negotiate during that low raw material environment and very favorable contracts going forward, both for Singapore and for Nanjing, which makes both of those locations more attractive from a competitiveness standpoint. And we also found other sources of productivity, specifically around catalyst usage in Clear Lake and some other areas, that when we really looked at it in total, we said, you know what? Given also the strong recovery we're seeing in acetic acid, our view to the future that acetic acid will continue to grow GDP, plus maybe a little bit more. 
We said, it really makes more sense for us to go ahead and do the expansion at Clear Lake, which, by the way, we're actually going to be able to expand Clear Lake to be about 2.6 million tons capable. So we will do that larger expansion at Clear Lake, keep all the facilities available to us and running in Asia, which, again, we won't run them full necessarily. We'll run them to meet what we need in the market and meet the demand. But gives us the option in the future if we do see more robust growth to run them at higher rates, and we still get the same level of productivity and credit on a smaller capital base in Clear Lake. 
So actually, I think the delay turned out to be a good thing. We actually had a chance to go back and reexamine some elements of the projects and have what I think is a stronger, more robust economically project now as well as additional capacity we can use for the future."

You will see the equity earnings line which comes in on an after-tax basis that will -- the portion that kind of flips to the marketing return that we get will move above the line, and we will then add revenue, obviously, for what we're selling there onto the P&L.

I know one of the big drivers is going to be how fast the health care part comes back. But how are you thinking of that?

And we do expect some normalization as we move into second quarter and what could really change that. I mean if you look at what's driving kind of the 4Q and the, let's call it, really December and the 1Q pricing, we've had more robust demand, all in China, I would say, for acetic acid and for VAM. So it really has been more demand-led. 
There have been a number of shorter outages in China for acetic acid and VAM. If you actually look at the data, it's not been significantly different than most fourth quarters. So I would say the tightness we've seen in December and going into January and February has really been demand-driven. Now some of those outages that we've had, although there was a few more in January which has given us some volatility in acetic acid, those plants are coming back online. And that's we say, kind of once plants are back, as people now have adjusted to this new level of demand, I mean, quite frankly, we saw what we thought was a little bit of panic buying over these 3 months where people, because demand was coming up and because there was a few outages, responded by doing a little bit of restocking because it made them nervous. I think that's going to calm down as we go forward and people see security of supply and a more stable demand outlook. 
Now clearly, look, if there's another outage, especially if there were an outage in the Western Hemisphere, could we see these conditions, these kind of $500 to $700 per ton conditions continue on into the second quarter? I mean we could. It's just we don't have any visibility of that right now, and so we would say we expect it to kind of normalize to normal ranges. I would expect we should have -- we expect $170 million to $200 million every quarter through the rest of the year. That's what we consider a pretty normalized level of earnings for acetyls and fully expect to be in that range. 
For Engineered Materials, we guided to $120 million on some modest price and volume recovery. Obviously, we're seeing headwinds from raws, but we've been making price movements that we think will largely offset that movement we've seen in raws. I would expect a little bit of improvement on that in second and third quarter, typical of what we see those being stronger demand months. We should also expect a little bit more recovery in our affiliate earnings. So expect to see that roll through in second and third quarter. And then fourth quarter typically looks more like first quarter. So I would think of it that way for the year."

We're going to talk a lot about innovation in end markets and especially the programs that we started in electric vehicles and 5G and medical pharma. We're already seeing good results from those, really good growth and expect that to continue. So we'll be talking more about those and giving some examples.

Thanks for the question, Mike. Yes, tell you about the projects a little bit. And I think this year is a good example of why we're starting to transition a little bit away from a number of projects to more towards value of projects. 
So if you look at 2020, we actually, with all the challenges of COVID and everything else, ended up ending the year with about 90% of the number of project wins as we had in 2019. But if you look at the value of the wins we had in 2020, they were actually right at the same level as the value of the wins we had in 2019. And that's really what we're focusing on, on projects, which is not just, are we generating a high number, but are we generating projects that have value and have extended value? 
So we've really been focusing on project wins in some of those program areas I mentioned earlier. So things like future mobility, around electric vehicles and autonomous and connectivities, so 5G, and those sorts of things and mobile. If you look at it, for example, the growth in the number of projects we've had in terms of value is more than 65% for autonomous vehicles and electric vehicles. And for connectivity, it's over 60%. So we're really shifting our focus to those, I would say, newer focuses, things that we think are going to have long life. And we're having a very high success rate in those areas. 
So if we look towards next year, clearly, we would expect that value to continue to grow. It needs to grow to continue to meet our expectations for EBIT growth year-on-year. So we continue to -- but again, we're focusing on value of project wins, not just number of project wins."

I mean this year, our margins were compressed in EM for two reasons, I would say.

So those were 2 very large turnarounds which we also had quite a bit of inventory draw to cover those. So those together had a pretty significant impact. The other thing this year is with lower volumes, and we ran plants in second and third quarter certainly at -- some shut down for a period of time, some run at lower rates. This is a high fixed cost business. And so that fixed cost gets spread across the rest of the volumes, and that certainly had an impact on our margins. 
I would say, as we go into 2021, I would certainly expect to be back at that in -- excuse me, because I always think in EBIT, but at that kind of 20% to 25% range of EBIT margins as we go into 2021, and we see back to normal rates of volume and kind of a normal level of turnaround activity."

Look, we think sustainable margins in acetyls of $170 million to $200 million. We consider those kind of a foundational level of earnings, and therefore, sustainable over a pretty wide variety of conditions. And I think it's really based on the flexibility we have in the chain and the optionality we have in the chain. I mean earlier in the year, although we weren't at those levels, we saw still good returns from acetyls because we were able, even with acetic demand being down, VAM being stronger, emulsions being stronger, being able to flex our chain to produce more of those molecules. Now with acetic acid stronger, we can flex back and put more back into acetic acid. 
So that flexibility that we have and the geographic flexibility -- I mean as you say, Nanjing, with coal prices up, but natural gas prices aren't really up in the Gulf Coast, and we still have all that Clear Lake capacity. So that -- we just shift more to Clear Lake and take advantage of low U.S. Gulf Coast natural gas prices. Oil has been fairly low, so that's made our Singapore capacity pretty attractive. 
So having that geographical as well as the flexibility within the chain, we think gives us a lot of optionality across a wide range of economic conditions. And that's why we feel that $170 million to $200 is very sustainable. Now the higher level that we're seeing, kind of that $225-plus million level that we're predicting for Q1, that's a little higher -- harder level to sustain. That's really based on some very high acetic acid pricing, specifically in China. But certainly, that $170 million to $200 million, we think is sustainable."

So I think truly, demand is driving the increase that we're seeing in the acetyl chain. I think demand is driving the increases we're seeing in EM. Now we have had some bumpiness and volatility in December and into the first few months of this year in acetyl. I think that's been based on people, because they are confident about the future, being worried about these, what turned out to be fairly minor supply disruptions and causing some volatility in the market.

We think that should be enough to kind of keep it in front of the raw material environment that's developing and basically keep it flat, if you will, fourth quarter to first quarter. 
So we think we're out in front of it. I mean our teams do a great job keeping our eyes on raw materials and trying to figure out what's happening and making sure that we can put sufficient price increases out there to cover the cost of raw materials. But there is always a bit of a lag, especially in EM, between when we see those raw material increases and when we see them in our books and when we can pass through prices.

But because of our technology and because of some of the contracts that we've been able to negotiate, if you look at Singapore, certainly kind of this is $40 to $50 oil, it is also very cost competitive.

We're also making investments in other parts of the world. I mean we've had the Forli Center of Excellence to better serve our European customers. We've talked about the Bishop GUR expansion. And we continue to do footprint optimization in the U.S. to better -- and also technology build-out in the U.S. to better serve our U.S. and North American customers. So I would say that growth is going to be all over the world, maybe a bit more Asia focus, but really spread where we need it to best serve our customers. 
And I would say in terms of what we're replacing, I would like to mention, while -- Polyplastics, we -- was always marketed by Polyplastics. So those molecules weren't really in our portfolio, if you would say. We're really excited about KEP, in fact, that we now will be able to put those molecules into our portfolio as part of our Asia footprint. And now it gives us palm capacity globally, which we really didn't have before."

We did see, of course, demand recovery in fourth quarter of '20 and some tightness in the market, which helps drive volumes up. I would also remind you, we had a fairly significant outage at our Clear Lake plant in fourth quarter of last year. And although we had secured some volumes last year to cover that, fourth quarter last year was actually a little bit softer quarter than we typically have seen in acetyls. 
So I would say, one, it was a strong fourth quarter for acetyls in terms of demand. Certainly, the best we've seen this year, not surprising with COVID. But even good versus last year. As we see the market normalizing, we saw a little less seasonality. We saw some seasonality in emulsions, but we're able to shift that volume into strong demand for acid and VAM, especially in China.

So we've assumed, even if the market needs no additional capacity, what are the benefits? So we get a $100 million benefit on that $350 million investment. Clearly, if there is more demand in the market and it makes sense to run Clear Lake higher our other facilities around the world at higher rates, then there is a lot of additional upside for this project.

Or if we were to see significant supply outages in acetic acid, that would certainly be an upside to both the quarter and to the year. 
I think the obvious biggest challenge on the downside is what you laid out in terms of COVID is, do the markets lose confidence? Do we see automakers, for example, shut down again for 2 months? That would be the biggest downside. The vaccine rolling out helps, I think, in that area of confidence and also pretty sure we have enough employees who are well to run plants around the globe. 
As I said earlier, it is a downside. We're not baking that in because, quite frankly, we're not seeing that behavior from our customers. What we're seeing is people have demand, people want to run, people are back at normal buying patterns. So unless we see a significant change from where we've been to date on COVID, we think that's a manageable downside risk."

I would say earlier in the year, I think people were just trying to sort out how to deal with COVID, how to deal with the current environment, how to manage their cash flows, and so we really didn't see a lot of interest from other parties in terms of discussing M&A. 
I would say as we move here through the fourth quarter and people start to see markets returning more to normal and feel more confident about their outlook for 2021, and therefore, a reasonable valuation basis, we are starting to see people having more interest in discussions around M&A. So I'd say the market is opening up. Obviously, it takes us a little while to get through these discussions, but definitely looking better as we go into 2021."

So we really do see the prices stabilizing now for tow and maybe even a little bit of upward movement. So that's good. So if you look at our outlook for tow, we're basically saying we think for the next many years, it's going to be pretty much flat at this kind of [ 2 50 ] to [ 2 60 ] range. 
In terms of transaction, look, we didn't to do the transaction last time because of competition concerns in the EU. There's nothing that's changed in the landscape that makes that different. So I think it's unlikely that we would be able to do a similar type transaction even today."

When we did that, we assumed we would either shut down or cut back capacity in Asia. So it was kind of a net capacity neutral. And the project was based on -- it's justified based on productivity. When we made the decision to delay the project for 18 months given the low oil environment, the uncertainties around COVID, et cetera, we took that as an opportunity to really go back and reexamine the basis for the project. And in doing so, we found another $50 million of savings in capital we could make in the project. 
We also had a chance to go work with some of our suppliers in Asia. And we're able to negotiate during that low raw material environment and very favorable contracts going forward, both for Singapore and for Nanjing, which makes both of those locations more attractive from a competitiveness standpoint. And we also found other sources of productivity, specifically around catalyst usage in Clear Lake and some other areas, that when we really looked at it in total, we said, you know what? Given also the strong recovery we're seeing in acetic acid, our view to the future that acetic acid will continue to grow GDP, plus maybe a little bit more. 
We said, it really makes more sense for us to go ahead and do the expansion at Clear Lake, which, by the way, we're actually going to be able to expand Clear Lake to be about 2.6 million tons capable. So we will do that larger expansion at Clear Lake, keep all the facilities available to us and running in Asia, which, again, we won't run them full necessarily. We'll run them to meet what we need in the market and meet the demand. But gives us the option in the future if we do see more robust growth to run them at higher rates, and we still get the same level of productivity and credit on a smaller capital base in Clear Lake. 
So actually, I think the delay turned out to be a good thing. We actually had a chance to go back and reexamine some elements of the projects and have what I think is a stronger, more robust economically project now as well as additional capacity we can use for the future."

And we do expect some normalization as we move into second quarter and what could really change that. I mean if you look at what's driving kind of the 4Q and the, let's call it, really December and the 1Q pricing, we've had more robust demand, all in China, I would say, for acetic acid and for VAM. So it really has been more demand-led. 
There have been a number of shorter outages in China for acetic acid and VAM. If you actually look at the data, it's not been significantly different than most fourth quarters. So I would say the tightness we've seen in December and going into January and February has really been demand-driven. Now some of those outages that we've had, although there was a few more in January which has given us some volatility in acetic acid, those plants are coming back online. And that's we say, kind of once plants are back, as people now have adjusted to this new level of demand, I mean, quite frankly, we saw what we thought was a little bit of panic buying over these 3 months where people, because demand was coming up and because there was a few outages, responded by doing a little bit of restocking because it made them nervous. I think that's going to calm down as we go forward and people see security of supply and a more stable demand outlook. 
Now clearly, look, if there's another outage, especially if there were an outage in the Western Hemisphere, could we see these conditions, these kind of $500 to $700 per ton conditions continue on into the second quarter? I mean we could. It's just we don't have any visibility of that right now, and so we would say we expect it to kind of normalize to normal ranges. I would expect we should have -- we expect $170 million to $200 million every quarter through the rest of the year. That's what we consider a pretty normalized level of earnings for acetyls and fully expect to be in that range. 
For Engineered Materials, we guided to $120 million on some modest price and volume recovery. Obviously, we're seeing headwinds from raws, but we've been making price movements that we think will largely offset that movement we've seen in raws. I would expect a little bit of improvement on that in second and third quarter, typical of what we see those being stronger demand months. We should also expect a little bit more recovery in our affiliate earnings. So expect to see that roll through in second and third quarter. And then fourth quarter typically looks more like first quarter. So I would think of it that way for the year."

And I think this year is a good example of why we're starting to transition a little bit away from a number of projects to more towards value of projects. 
So if you look at 2020, we actually, with all the challenges of COVID and everything else, ended up ending the year with about 90% of the number of project wins as we had in 2019. But if you look at the value of the wins we had in 2020, they were actually right at the same level as the value of the wins we had in 2019. And that's really what we're focusing on, on projects, which is not just, are we generating a high number, but are we generating projects that have value and have extended value? 
So we've really been focusing on project wins in some of those program areas I mentioned earlier. So things like future mobility, around electric vehicles and autonomous and connectivities, so 5G, and those sorts of things and mobile. If you look at it, for example, the growth in the number of projects we've had in terms of value is more than 65% for autonomous vehicles and electric vehicles. And for connectivity, it's over 60%. So we're really shifting our focus to those, I would say, newer focuses, things that we think are going to have long life. And we're having a very high success rate in those areas. 
So if we look towards next year, clearly, we would expect that value to continue to grow. It needs to grow to continue to meet our expectations for EBIT growth year-on-year. So we continue to -- but again, we're focusing on value of project wins, not just number of project wins."

I mean this year, our margins were compressed in EM for two reasons, I would say. One is a pretty significant amount of turnaround expense we had this year with both the Bishop and the IPH POM turnaround. So those were 2 very large turnarounds which we also had quite a bit of inventory draw to cover those. So those together had a pretty significant impact. The other thing this year is with lower volumes, and we ran plants in second and third quarter certainly at -- some shut down for a period of time, some run at lower rates. This is a high fixed cost business. And so that fixed cost gets spread across the rest of the volumes, and that certainly had an impact on our margins. 
I would say, as we go into 2021, I would certainly expect to be back at that in -- excuse me, because I always think in EBIT, but at that kind of 20% to 25% range of EBIT margins as we go into 2021, and we see back to normal rates of volume and kind of a normal level of turnaround activity."

Look, we think sustainable margins in acetyls of $170 million to $200 million. We consider those kind of a foundational level of earnings, and therefore, sustainable over a pretty wide variety of conditions. And I think it's really based on the flexibility we have in the chain and the optionality we have in the chain. I mean earlier in the year, although we weren't at those levels, we saw still good returns from acetyls because we were able, even with acetic demand being down, VAM being stronger, emulsions being stronger, being able to flex our chain to produce more of those molecules. Now with acetic acid stronger, we can flex back and put more back into acetic acid. 
So that flexibility that we have and the geographic flexibility -- I mean as you say, Nanjing, with coal prices up, but natural gas prices aren't really up in the Gulf Coast, and we still have all that Clear Lake capacity. So that -- we just shift more to Clear Lake and take advantage of low U.S. Gulf Coast natural gas prices. Oil has been fairly low, so that's made our Singapore capacity pretty attractive. 
So having that geographical as well as the flexibility within the chain, we think gives us a lot of optionality across a wide range of economic conditions. And that's why we feel that $170 million to $200 is very sustainable. Now the higher level that we're seeing, kind of that $225-plus million level that we're predicting for Q1, that's a little higher -- harder level to sustain. That's really based on some very high acetic acid pricing, specifically in China. But certainly, that $170 million to $200 million, we think is sustainable."

So I think truly, demand is driving the increase that we're seeing in the acetyl chain. I think demand is driving the increases we're seeing in EM. Now we have had some bumpiness and volatility in December and into the first few months of this year in acetyl.

So we think we're out in front of it. I mean our teams do a great job keeping our eyes on raw materials and trying to figure out what's happening and making sure that we can put sufficient price increases out there to cover the cost of raw materials. But there is always a bit of a lag, especially in EM, between when we see those raw material increases and when we see them in our books and when we can pass through prices.

But because of our technology and because of some of the contracts that we've been able to negotiate, if you look at Singapore, certainly kind of this is $40 to $50 oil, it is also very cost competitive.

We did see, of course, demand recovery in fourth quarter of '20 and some tightness in the market, which helps drive volumes up. I would also remind you, we had a fairly significant outage at our Clear Lake plant in fourth quarter of last year. And although we had secured some volumes last year to cover that, fourth quarter last year was actually a little bit softer quarter than we typically have seen in acetyls. 
So I would say, one, it was a strong fourth quarter for acetyls in terms of demand. Certainly, the best we've seen this year, not surprising with COVID. But even good versus last year. As we see the market normalizing, we saw a little less seasonality. We saw some seasonality in emulsions, but we're able to shift that volume into strong demand for acid and VAM, especially in China.

Well, I think with higher volumes in the fourth quarter versus third quarter, a lot is just based upon demand recovery and producing into that demand. You're right. We lost some volume in Clear Lake, but we did buy volumes in order to provide our customers around the globe to replace that. We also always do watch the market. And if we see what we think is a tightening market and a higher demand market, we will source additional materials in order to anticipate customer needs and make sure we have sufficient volumes together. So all of those 3 things, I think, came together in the fourth quarter. And what we ended up seeing was both a very high-volume demand quarter as well as a very good pricing quarter."

Or if we were to see significant supply outages in acetic acid, that would certainly be an upside to both the quarter and to the year. 
I think the obvious biggest challenge on the downside is what you laid out in terms of COVID is, do the markets lose confidence? Do we see automakers, for example, shut down again for 2 months? That would be the biggest downside. The vaccine rolling out helps, I think, in that area of confidence and also pretty sure we have enough employees who are well to run plants around the globe. 
As I said earlier, it is a downside. We're not baking that in because, quite frankly, we're not seeing that behavior from our customers. What we're seeing is people have demand, people want to run, people are back at normal buying patterns. So unless we see a significant change from where we've been to date on COVID, we think that's a manageable downside risk."

And at the time that we locked in our guidance for Investor Day, we were really seeing some softening in methanol prices in China, and we were anticipating -- even on the back of Uri, and we were anticipating that, that trend might continue. 
Now having said that, we also had some uncertainty around Uri. We had some uncertainty around how -- what we would one off, what we wouldn't, what the total of those would be. And in fact, we had some of that baked into the guidance, some of which slipped into second quarter because it came with invoicing timing. It came with materials and inventory, et cetera. 
But then what we really saw is right around the time of Investor Day, we saw prices take off again in China and really versus where we had been in March, which was around, call it, $700, $750 really in the last many weeks. We've seen prices greatly increase and now were sometimes over $1,000. 
And it's not just acetic acid, but it's also the fact that VAM and other derivative pricing has also followed something, which hasn't always happened in times of high pricing before and during a period where methanol pricing is high, but not as high as they we saw in 2018. 
So a lot of factors coming together that have really given us very, very healthy margins in the acetyl chain going forward as well as the continued strength and growth we see in Engineered Materials."

Now as this drags on, we are starting to see, and you probably saw some announcements by some of the OEMs this week that they are curtailing production for a period of time because of chips that we do think that will start to affect us in the second quarter. 
There's also some resin shortages, quite frankly, in the industry that is also impacting the automakers, and you might see something around that, especially around nylon and some other materials. So we do expect to see some impact in auto for us in second quarter, which is why we're calling second quarter flat on EM.

We are, of course, doubling our capacity in Clear Lake, so the equivalent of adding a 13 hundred thousand tons facility in Clear Lake. So another world-scale capacity facility. 
Look, Clear Lake is the cheapest producing acetic acid in the world. I think customers are happy to have that kind of stability in the Gulf Coast, and I do expect others to announce maybe. Do they ultimately get build? That's always a bigger question. I think no one's going to build on what they see as a surge in pricing. It really has to be a sustainable level of pricing. And I mean, look, you can't just go put an acetic acid plant anywhere. You need to have access to methanol or some form of syngas. You need to have access to CO2. You need RCO, sorry, you need to have access to hydrogen. 
So this is not something that you can easily say, I'm just going to go put a plant somewhere. You need to be an industrial area, you need to have access. And frankly, it's what keeps keep acetic acid plants from being built kind of everywhere in the world is these other components.

So we, of course, do expect a record Q2 in acetyls as we laid out in our documents. And I think it's really based on a couple of things. 
I mean one is we have had a significant lift in foundational earnings even since 2018. So we've added RDP. We've got other capacity around emulsions and VAM through low-cost debottlenecks. We've continued to refine the model. And frankly, we've just gotten better and better every year about how to use the optionality available to us and how to really flex our model. 
We've also seen improving industry dynamics. Acetyls is growing a couple -- a little bit over GDP every year. We haven't seen any major capacity addition. So it's a better industry dynamic of supplier supply/demand chain. 
If you look at 2018, 2018 was very much supply-driven. Inventory and demands were pretty much in normal levels. But starting at the end of '17, you saw a whole series of shutdown in the industry, especially in the western hemisphere, which really drove a supply shortage and drove that price up to that $700 to $800 a ton. But remember, that was that methanol around 4 50 or so. Crude was around $80 right then. 
2021 is fundamentally different in that we went into this it's both a supply and a demand problem. I mean we've seen really robust demand since at least the fourth quarter of '20 as the world moved into recovery and again, not just in acetic acid, but also in VAM and emulsions which is a little different than 2018, which is really focused on acetic acid. And our inventories were very low as we went into this year into 2021, and that was true globally. So it's already a really tight supply-demand market. 
And then we had Winter Storm Uri, which we lost 3 of the 4 large producers in the U.S. for a considerable period of time, I mean a minimum of about 4 weeks as everything had to get back up and running. And we've done that, but we still haven't seen methanol prices go way up. I mean, methanol is still around 3 50, crude is 60. 
So we have a larger margin. Now that's partially offset by higher precious metal prices. So there is some offset there. But fundamentally, this is -- I would say, if this is a deeper disconnect between supply and demand than we had in '18, and that's why we're seeing record level pricing in China that reflects that. 
So I think -- I do think there's the possibility this is going to be longer and bigger for a period of time than 2018 was. Again, it will just depend on how fast recovery happens around the world, the demand levels stay up, what happens with methanol pricing, what happens with precious metal pricing, all of that will play into. But I do definitely think the probability. And what we've baked into our revised outlook is that this continues through Q2 and We continue to see somewhat elevated pricing through Q3 as well."

Can you get credit for materials that you make that help, for example, for lightweighting and things that help to reduce other people's greenhouse gas emissions. 
I mean, let's be honest, on the one hand, it's a real opportunity for us because many of the products that we make will be needed by others to meet that kind of a commitment. Even in the construction industry, if you think about acetyls and how much of that goes into weatherproofing and insulation and things like that, which would also be necessary, it could be a huge opportunity for us. As far as reducing our greenhouse gas emissions of our own facilities, that really has to do with heat recovery, lower furnace firing, uses of alternative energy like our solar contract at Clear Lake as well as recovery of venting of CO2, which, as we're doing in Clear Lake, maybe there's options to recycle back into our operations.

As we see our financial outlook improving for the full year, we basically showed that additional cash available to us is buybacks to make sure that the shareholders will benefit from the kind of the additional earnings this year. 
If we have higher earnings, I would anticipate we'll put those into buybacks. But it still doesn't change our desire to do significant M&A this year and next year. Remember, we still have $1 billion -- even after these buybacks, we'll still have $1 billion on the balance sheet in order to put towards meaningful M&A. 
So I think it really was more of an indication, if you will, in our belief that we want to make sure that the shareholders benefit from this increased earnings outlook we're seeing from this year, and so we reflected that as buyback"

So what makes this really attractive for us is we have spare synthesis capacity currently at Fairway. We have a source of hydrogen available to us to ramp that unit up, from the hydrogen grid industrial grid in that area. And we have the availability of high-purity CO2 vent streams available to us.

So if you look at kind of fourth quarter to first quarter, yes, we did have a significant uplift in earnings. I mean, almost doubled our earnings in Engineered Materials. 
So we had about a 6% increase in volume, which I would just say is continued growth in demand really across all sectors. Really in EU, we saw automotive, returning to kind of pre-COVID levels joining the U.S. and Asia that have gotten there in the fourth quarter. We saw industrial continue to go up, and we did see continued recovery in our medical again, not just implants, but other areas of medical now that -- because of the programs that we put in place are really starting to show up. So that was about a 6% increase. 
Then we had about a 6% increase in price. And I would say about half of that were proactive pricing measures that we took last year to get in front of the raw materials. And then about half of that was really product mix. So again, more medical, more higher-end premium palm applications, really pushing the molecules that we did have into our more premium products. 
And then we also had a bit of a help from -- we didn't have a POM turnaround because we took that in the fourth quarter of last year in IPH. So kind of another $30 million uplift there, not having the -- and then the POM turnaround in this quarter. 
And then we had another about $10 million uplift from affiliate, really kind of across the board in affiliates. So I mean, those are the big factors that really accounted for the pretty dramatic uplift that we saw in EM."

So I think a lot of those sectors are seeing lasting increases in demand, even paints and coatings, I mean that maybe can be a bit more cyclical.

So I think we are seeing a structural improvement in demand for acetyl products. I do expect we'll see some capacity come online. I mean, probably other than what we've announced, not a lot in the near term, again, because things take a little while to build. But if you go out 4 years, would I expect to see some additional capacity adds, yes, assuming that continues. 
That said, I also expect that, especially in China, new environmental regulations, other safety regulations may lead to some consolidation of capacity in China in certain parts of the world.

So normally, for example, Europe is an import market. Normally, everybody ships from the U.S., which is the lowest-cost location, to Europe to meet the demand there for acetic acid, but more importantly, VAM and emulsions. 
If you look at then Hurricane Uri with nothing coming out of the U.S., everything started coming out of China and other parts of Asia. So that really kept -- that's really what's been driving, I think, the higher pricing in China and Asia is demand there as well as exporting now into Europe. Going forward -- because we know now all the plants are running again in the U.S., they're all coming back up to full capacity. Going forward, I think it will still be tight, but I think it could be tightened further, depending on the timing of now the China turnarounds that need to occur as well as any unplanned outages that could happen anywhere around the globe."

I mean the difference between POM content is very large between ICE and EV, but for POM specifically, pretty flat between the 2. 
Now if you look at GUR, I mean, GUR, we've seen really significant growth over the last few years really supporting the expansions that we're putting in place. So if you look at, say, so lithium battery separator growth from '19 to '20, that was up 25%. And then if you look at between '20 and '21, it's going to even be above 25% growth year-on-year. So huge demand for the ultrahigh molecular weight material for lithium-ion battery separators. We are able to expand into that capacity at very low capital cost. So we're continuing to do so, and that's why we announced the Bishop GUR plant, which will start up here next year and then a GUR plant to follow in Europe that will start up in 2024. 
And then in terms of acetic acid VAM, I mean, gosh, that's a really hard question. I mean if you're expanding acetic acid and VAM, which is what we have been doing, I would say you get pretty -- you can get -- and you have good capital efficiency, you can get really good payout, let's say kind of nominally 3-year kind of payout. 
I think if you're talking about greenfields or brand-new builds, again, everybody's economics are different, but I'm going to say you're probably talking closer to a 10-year payout even at pretty good, maybe 7 years if you're really, really capitally efficient. But again, and i1 the infrastructure it takes to build in acetic acid, you have to have hydrogen, you have to have methanol. You have to have unless you're in an industrial area, this gets really, really expensive. And just the transport, the stuff moves around stainless tanks. I mean it's the transport -- it is an expensive proposition for a new player to get into city acid and VAM."

And look, we sourced quite a few materials going into the freeze in anticipation of shutdowns and wanting to make sure that we could supply our customers as best we can, recognizing that we thought there would be some disruption. But I think it's just really a factor of the model and the fact that we're always in the market. So we don't need to activate a new team to go do anything when we see something like this coming.

And at the time that we locked in our guidance for Investor Day, we were really seeing some softening in methanol prices in China, and we were anticipating -- even on the back of Uri, and we were anticipating that, that trend might continue.
Now having said that, we also had some uncertainty around Uri. We had some uncertainty around how -- what we would one-off, what we wouldn't, what the total of those would be. And in fact, we had some of that baked into the guidance, some of which slipped into second quarter because it came with invoicing timing. It came with materials and inventory, et cetera. But then what we really saw is right around the time of Investor Day, we saw prices take off again in China and really versus where we had been in March, which was around, call it, $700, $750 really in the last many weeks. We've seen prices greatly increase and now -- or sometimes over $1,000.
And it's not just acetic acid, but it's also the fact that VAM and other derivative pricing has also followed, something which hasn't always happened in times of high pricing before and during a period where methanol pricing is high but not as high as, say, we saw in 2018. So a lot of factors coming together that have really given us very, very healthy margins in the acetyl chain going forward as well as the continued strength and growth we see in Engineered Materials."

Vincent, that's exactly what we're assuming in the second quarter. I mean we really have not seen much impact from the chip shortage yet, again, primarily because we've been in luxury vehicles and platforms like trucks and SUVs which have been prioritized by the automakers and not affected as much. 
Now as this drags on, we are starting to see, and you probably saw some announcements by some of the OEMs this week, that they are curtailing production for a period of time because of chips that we do think that will start to affect us in the second quarter. There's also some resin shortages, quite frankly, in the industry that is also impacting the automakers, and you might see something around that, especially around nylon and some other materials. So we do expect to see some impact in auto for us in second quarter, which is why we're calling second quarter flat on EM. But we also expect most of those issues to be resolved through the quarter and back to more normal levels by third quarter."

Is that a fair way to think about it? And then if it is, what's the delta in free cash flow? Because my guess is as there are some more puts and takes there, working capital probably eats a little bit more cash with higher prices. But if we could work off that $440 million, if that's the right number, increment, how would that flow through the cash flow statement then?"

I think we -- that really is tied to that incremental cash flow that we have this year versus what we had originally planned on. 
And you highlighted where the delta is. It's really on the working capital build, and so it really is just a timing thing. We think that recovery of that, call it, $450 million of EBITDA, the balance that we won't generate in free cash flow, we would expect to collect as we get into next year. So a lot will just depend on how working capital develops for the balance of the year. But right now, our projections are is we will have a working capital build. And it's driven by the fact that pricing is moving up but also that raw materials are moving up."

We are, of course, doubling our capacity in Clear Lake, so the equivalent of adding a 1,300,000-ton facility in Clear Lake, so another world-scale capacity facility. 
Look, Clear Lake is the cheapest-producing acetic acid in the world. I think customers are happy to have that kind of stability in the Gulf Coast, and I do -- I expect others to announce maybe do they ultimately get build? That's always a bigger question. I think no one's going to build on what they see as a surge in pricing. It really has to be a sustainable level of pricing. And I mean, look, you can't just go put an acetic acid plant anywhere. You need to have access to methanol or some form of syngas. You need to have access to CO2. You need -- or CO, sorry. You need to have access to hydrogen. 
So this is not something that you can easily say, ""I'm just going to go put a plant somewhere."" You need to be an industrial area. You need to have access. And frankly, it's what keeps acetic acid plants from being built kind of everywhere in the world is these other components. 
So what I would say is there may be an announcement. I don't know what others will do, but it's also 3 to 4 years kind of minimum before anybody could actually have one online."

So we, of course, do expect a record Q2 in acetyls, as we laid out in our documents. And I think it's really based on a couple of things. I mean one is we have had a significant lift in foundational earnings even since 2018. So we've added RDP. We've got other capacity around emulsions and VAM through low-cost debottlenecks. We've continued to refine the model. And frankly, we've just gotten better and better every year about how to use the optionality available to us and how to really flex our model. 
We've also seen improving industry dynamics. Acetyls is growing a couple -- a little bit over GDP every year. We haven't seen any major capacity addition, so it's a better industry dynamic of supplier supply/demand chain. 
If you look at 2018, 2018 was very much supply-driven. Inventory and demands were pretty much in normal levels. But starting at the end of '17, you saw a whole series of shutdown in the industry, especially in the Western Hemisphere, which really drove a supply shortage and drove that price up to that $700 to $800 a ton. But remember, that was at methanol around $450 or so. Crude was around $80 right then. 
2021 is fundamentally different in that we went into this -- it's both a supply and a demand problem. I mean we've seen really robust demand since at least the fourth quarter of '20 as the world moved into recovery, and again, not just in acetic acid, but also in VAM and emulsions, which is a little different than 2018, which is really focused on acetic acid. And our inventories were very low as we went into this year into 2021, and that was true globally. So it's already a really tight supply/demand market. And then we had Winter Storm Uri, which we lost 3 of the 4 large producers in the U.S. for a considerable period of time, I mean, a minimum of about 4 weeks as everything had to get back up and running. And we've done that, but we still haven't seen methanol prices go way up. I mean, methanol is still around $350. Crude is at $60. 
So we have a larger margin. Now that's partially offset by higher precious metal prices, so there is some offset there. But fundamentally, this is -- I would say if this is a deeper disconnect between supply and demand than we had in '18, and that's why we're seeing record level pricing in China that reflects that. So I think -- I do think there's the -- a possibility this is going to be longer and bigger for a period of time than 2018 was. Again, it will just depend on how fast recovery happens around the world. Do demand levels stay up, what happens with methanol pricing, what happens with precious metal pricing, all of that will play into. But I do definitely think the probability -- and what we've baked into our revised outlook is that this continues through Q2, and We continue to see somewhat elevated pricing through Q3 as well."

Unfortunately, there's not really enough details out about the plan to know what that really means in terms of how it's measured, can you get credit for materials that you make that help, for example, for lightweighting and things that help to reduce other people's greenhouse gas emissions. 
I mean, let's be honest, on the one hand, it's a real opportunity for us because many of the products that we make will be needed by others to meet that kind of a commitment. Even in the construction industry, if you think about acetyls and how much of that goes into weatherproofing and insulation and things like that, which would also be necessary, it could be a huge opportunity for us. As far as reducing our greenhouse gas emissions of our own facilities, that really has to do with heat recovery, lower furnace firing, uses of alternative energy like our solar contract at Clear Lake, as well as recovery of venting of CO2, which, as we're doing in Clear Lake, maybe there's options to recycle back into our operations. 
So I don't know. We don't know yet. Is it possible to reduce our own footprint by that amount? Again, we need to see the details of the plan. But I would say, in general, it's probably more of an opportunity for us than a threat at this point in time."

Remember, we still have $1 billion -- even after these buybacks, we'll still have $1 billion on the balance sheet in order to put towards meaningful M&A. 
So I think it really was more of an indication, if you will, and our belief that we want to make sure that the shareholders benefit from this increased earnings outlook we're seeing from this year, and so we reflected that as buybacks."

So that's what makes this very affordable for us at Clear Lake as we can take those streams, further compress them, further purify them and add them directly to our synthesis gas at Fairway, where it's converted into methanol.
So what makes this really attractive for us is we have spare synthesis capacity currently at Fairway. We have a source of hydrogen available to us to ramp that unit up from the hydrogen grid, industrial grid in that area, and we have availability of high-purity CO2 vent streams available to us.

So let me try to take that. let's see if I understand your question correctly. So if you look at kind of fourth quarter to first quarter, yes, we did have a significant uplift in earnings, I mean, almost doubled our earnings in Engineered Materials. So we had about a 6% increase in volume, which I would just say is continued growth in demand really across all sectors. 
Really in EU, we saw automotive returning to kind of pre-COVID levels, joining the U.S. and Asia that have gotten there in the fourth quarter. We saw industrial continue to go up, and we did see continued recovery in our medical, again, not just implants, but other areas of medical now that -- because of the programs that we put in place are really starting to show up. So that was about a 6% increase, then we had about a 6% increase in price. And I would say about half of that were proactive pricing measures that we took last year to get in front of the raw materials, and then about half of that was really product mix. So again, more medical, more higher-end premium POM applications really pushing the molecules that we did have into our more premium products. 
And then we also had a bit of a help from -- we didn't have a POM turnaround because we took that in the fourth quarter of last year in IPH. So kind of another $30 million uplift there, not having the POM and then the POM turnaround in this quarter. And then we had another about $10 million uplift from affiliates -- really kind of across the board in affiliates. So I mean, those are the big factors that really accounted for the pretty dramatic uplift that we saw in EM."

So I think a lot of those sectors are seeing lasting increases in demand, even paints and coatings. I mean, well, that maybe can be a bit more cyclical. 
Again, I think what's happening with infrastructure bills and desire to reduce energy usage, you see a lot more going into insulation and exterior coatings and things to further weatherproof existing buildings as well as better materials the new buildings. So I think we are seeing a structural improvement in demand for acetyl products. I do expect we'll see some capacity come online, I mean, probably other than what we've announced, not a lot in the near term, again, because things take a little while to build. But if you go out 4 years, would I expect to see some additional capacity adds? Yes, assuming that continues. 
That said, I also expect that, especially in China, new environmental regulations, other safety regulations may lead to some consolidation of capacity in China, in certain parts of the world. So I think -- look, I don't think this pricing level is going to continue forever, and I've talked about that already.

How would you think about that?"

Normally, everybody ships from the U.S., which is the lowest-cost location, to Europe to meet the demand there for acetic acid, but more importantly, VAM and emulsions. 
If you look at then Hurricane Uri with nothing coming out of the U.S., everything started coming out of China and other parts of Asia. So that really kept -- that's really what's been driving, I think, the higher pricing in China and Asia is demand there as well as exporting now into Europe. Going forward, because we know now all the plants are running again in the U.S., they're all coming back up to full capacity. Going forward, I think it will still be tight, but I think it could be tightened further, depending on the timing of now the China turnarounds that need to occur as well as any unplanned outages that could happen anywhere around the globe."

Can you just tell us, Lori, how much of POM is in ICE versus EV. And then what sort of growth do you expect in your ultra polyethylene as EV penetration sort of goes up and the wet end capacity in separators comes through? That's my first question.

What is really the current sort of payback for any current player or a new player that wants to enter this market, considering all the things that you've described of the market which point to fundamentally better demand/supply balance than it was maybe in the previous cycles?"

It's really other component that add -- I mean the difference between polymer content is very large between ICE and EV, but for POM specifically, pretty flat between the 2. 
Now if you look at GUR, I mean, GUR, we've seen really significant growth over the last few years, really supporting the expansions that we're putting in place. So if you look at, say -- so lithium-ion battery separator growth from '19 to '20, that was up 25%. And then if you look at between '20 and '21, it's going to even be above 25% growth year-on-year. So huge demand for the ultra-high molecular weight material for lithium-ion battery separators. We are able to expand into that capacity at very low capital cost. So we're continuing to do so, and that's why we announced the Bishop DUR plant which will start up here next year and then a GUR plant to follow in Europe that will start up in 2024. 
And then in terms of acetic acid, VAM, I mean, gosh, that's a really hard question. I mean if you're expanding acetic acid and VAM, which is what we have been doing, I would say you get pretty -- you can get -- and you have good capital efficiency, you can get really good payout, let's say, kind of nominally 3-year kind of payout. I think if you're talking about greenfields or brand-new builds, again, everybody's economics are different, but I'm going to say you're probably talking closer to a 10-year payout, even at pretty good -- maybe 7 years if you're really, really capitally efficient. 
But again -- and it's the infrastructure it takes to build in acetic acid. You have to have hydrogen, you have to have methanol. You have to have CO. Unless you're in an industrial area, this gets really, really expensive. And just the transport. The stuff moves around in stainless tanks. I mean it's the transport -- it is an expensive proposition for a new player to get into acetic acid and VAM."

As some of you called out, there are some turnarounds happening in the third quarter in China. But I would say kind of within the normal level. So I think I'd say supply has certainly stabilized in first quarter. But I would also say demand, while it continues to be robust, we are seeing some pockets of more demand potentially going forward, with COVID and the Delta variant and especially in Southeast Asia. So I think it's a little bit of both. I think what's interesting to note is if you look at the moderation that we've called out in China pricing, it's really a very slow moderation compared to what we saw, say, in 2018. And we think that is because it is demand driven as much as supply driven, whereas 18 months, you've got the supply back, it dropped very quickly. And if you look at recent prices, I mean, prices have China have been really stable over the last, call it, week.

So for EM, I would characterize the end markets as all of the markets has recovered to pre-COVID levels at this point in time with the exception of medical implants. And as you said, auto which is really more due to shortages of chips, Microchip and also some shortages of resins in Q2. In fact, we've seen growth above 2019 levels and industrial and channel and electronics and some of the other sectors. So if we look at implants, which is kind of your question, implants have improved across second quarter. We expect them to continue to recover through the end of the year and really be back at normalized rates in 2022. I will say other areas of medical though, we have seen really good growth in this year, including like long dose drug delivery, diabetes applications, et cetera. So medical overall, I has recovered. It's just specifically the implant business, which is our GUR business, which will be into 2022 before we see full normalization. I think auto, which is the other big end market, as we called out, and [indiscernible] was down 8% and in the quarter, but that's versus North America dropping bills of 12% and in Germany drop in builds of 15%, which is our 2 largest end markets. And so we think we've been helped there. Autos have prioritized premium vehicles. We've talked about that in the past, and we have the majority of our content in premium vehicles. But we're also seeing a real help from our programs that we put in place, specifically around electric vehicles. So if you think about it in the EU, 17% of all electric vehicle cells are now -- sorry, all vehicle cells are now electric vehicles. And so that project pipeline where we've grown that, -- those volumes have really helped us. We've also, as we called out and expanding our content in electric vehicles. So we talked about the 20 kilograms content that we have in Europe for 1 of our EVs, which is 4x our average ICE. Just to give you another idea, just GUR alone is 6 to 8 kilograms per electric vehicle. So a really big space that we have. We have really good polymers to go into those spaces. So as we look to the second half,  we do expect growth again in Q3 as we see chip recovery, and we've had resin recovery -- We probably won't be back to Q1 levels in Q3, but anticipate we'll be back to Q levels for auto by Q4. And we continue to see that few percent growth across other end uses as we move through the end of the year."

If you look at our margin percent this quarter, we had a few impacts there that brought our margin down slightly from last quarter. Some of it was increased spend in the plan as we needed to add more people to deal with the increased demand. We also had higher energy costs, especially in Europe. And then logistics and transportation, as I'm sure you're hearing from other was certainly a big headwind this past quarter and will continue to be a headwind probably through the end of the year and even into early next year. So I think as we see labor markets stabilize, as we see logistics and transportation stabilize, I think we would expect to get back to previous levels of margin going forward. I would also just say, Bob, the real difference here from what we've seen in the past is our constraint in Q2 and continuing in Q3 is not demand driven. It's really supply constrained. It's our ability to make resin, get the additives, especially glassfiber as we called out which has continued to deteriorate as we move through second quarter and into third quarter. It's really supply constrained. So there is also more more volume upside as we go forward and are able to resolve those supply constraints."

And certainly, reliability of supply in certain materials is very important for us right now. And so we may choose to hold a little bit more raw material, if possible if we can get it in certain areas of tightness. We are not going to be bound by that working capital number because our working capital efficiency has historically been very strong, and we can bring that down fairly quickly, if necessary, in the future. I think in terms of how we see that working its way, our greater than $1.2 billion for the year assumes we get some of that working capital back towards the end of the year, but but certainly not all of it and certainly not back to how we started the year. And so a lot will depend upon what happens with raw materials and as well as our pricing. I mean 1 of the important characteristics here is accounts receivable. And we've seen in pricing in Asia, in acetyls which tends to have slightly longer payment terms, we're carrying a little more accounts receivable today than what we have historically.

I will give you my opinion, which is look, they've only had this business since 1980s. It was a JV. They acquired it fully and, I think, about 200 -- maybe 2010, sometime in that first decade. Look, this is not 1 of their core businesses. Exxon is an oil and gas, commodity chemical player. This is a highly specialized business. And I'm sure why I've enjoyed the margins and returns from it. It's not -- it doesn't really fit their model of what they're trying to do. And having come out of an Exxon specialty business, they struggle to run them in a way that can be highly competitive with others. So my guess is they realized it was more valuable to us than it was to them. If you look at end markets, it is largely into auto, think things that need to be recyclable or long life or soft touch or lightweighting. But there are also applications for it into medical applications into construction, think seals around windows and sky scrapers. And so as we look at it, we think it's a really good fit for us to cross-sell with our automotive side. We think there are some really exciting new applications in medical going forward that given our knowledge now is medical and pharma industry, we can exploit. And so we think there's a lot of opportunities there to really apply these materials to businesses we already know, already understand and already know how to access the market. Again, our willingness to do -- deal with complexity is just different than Exxon. We deal with small orders every day. That's not something Exxon wants to do. They -- So I think we see a lot of value uplift opportunity here in what we consider very profitable end markets as we go forward. In terms of new capacity, we are not aware of any new capacity coming on in this area. It is a highly specialized material. And we don't see any now, we don't anticipate any for the future. This, in fact, Exxon had grown the capacity of this business in just the last couple of years, I think, in the Newport facility."

I mean, certainly global, a lot of problems for people trying to get things out of China, as you know, but I would say really whatever what you're going, it's pretty hard right now, whether it's by ship or on ground or rail, there is just a lot of volume being moved around the world. not sure I could explain all the reasons why, but certainly, people are moving more things around. I mean, just even the amount of things you buy on Amazon these days. It's we just see a real constraint there. And that's really what I was referring to. I think it's well into next year and possibly even after Chinese New Year before we really start to see stabilization in those markets. The labor phenomenon I discussed has really been more of an issue in the U.S. than in other parts of the world. We haven't had as many issues in Asia, for example, or we had the issues in China. But in the U.S., I think we just -- we see people we're hiring to expand and run our plants, being hired by Amazon to run their warehouses, for example. And so it's just a very competitive labor market, and we've had to make adjustments as we've wanted to add shifts and do things that would let us expand rather quickly to our labor rates. But I think in time, this will stabilize as we see more people going back to work in the u.s., I think this will also stabilize. But I do think probably on this will take into next year as well."

Maybe to be a little bit more clear on the characterization. I mean if we look at second quarter, we would estimate we probably lost as much as $5 million revenue due to problems around class fiber as well as a little bit of logistics transportation issues. If we look at third quarter, that number is probably going to double -- But we do expect it to resolve and we get some of those volumes back starting in the fourth quarter and going into 2022. Look, we are seeing glass fiber makers coming back. We are seen the volumes go up glass fiber that goes into polymer is a very small percentage of the glass fiber market, but it's probably 1 of the more profitable segments for them. So we do expect to start seeing more glass fiber coming back towards us as we move into fourth quarter. Look, I think long term, as this goes on, it has been an opportunity for us to convert people to other polymers.  Our polymers that also have glass fibers that we prioritized because they're higher-margin polymers, so that people can get their product. So I think there is some upside here, and we've been able to convert some of it to higher margin products. But I think long term, it is about 1/3 of our portfolio that uses glass fiber. So it is a pretty important raw material for us going forward. And we've taken steps commercially to secure supply of glass fiber in future years. So hopefully, we don't run into this problem again."

So it's kind of a broad question, but let me try to break it down. So I discussed some of the things we did that we think improved our foundational earnings in terms of productivity and capacity bottlenecks, et cetera, and strengthening of our chain and strengthening of our model. I think it's also fair to say that we believe the acetyls industry dynamics has improved over the long term. So if you think about it just growing at kind of GDP, between '18 and '21, we saw nearly 1 million tons in demand growth for the industry. And during that time, we didn't add any new capacity. So it is a more tightly constrained market than it was, say, back in '18, the last time we had a price run up. We have a little bit of capacity coming on stream here in China that we talked about. And of course, we have a lot of capacity, our own capacity coming on 1.3 million tons coming on in 2023.  So those are the big capacity ads that are out there. But even if you add those together, it's kind of 3 or 4 years of growth in a very tight market. And again, we don't intend to run our capacity unless it makes sense to do so. So I think the market dynamics have definitely improved over the last few years and continue to improve with just normal GDP growth. That could motivate people to get into the market. But I would say it's a very expensive market to get into. I mean you know our 1.3 million tons of capacity that we're adding at Clear Lake, we're spending [ $350 ] million to do so. But if we look at greenfield build like they're doing in china, our own estimate of building that plant in China because they don't have the infrastructure or everything else is well in excess of $2 billion. That's a big hump for people to get over. You have to have availability of syngas. You have to have access to hydrogen. You have to have a good energy source. I mean it's a big hurdle for people to get over. It's a little better in the Gulf Coast of the U.S., but again, we already have a lot of players in the Gulf Coast. So we don't see any new capacity coming on immediately even if someone were to start today, they're still 4 or 5 years out from adding new capacity. So we see for the foreseeable future, this remaining a pretty robust type market."

Now",262,"Yes. I think it's a little bit of both. So I think we are seeing some supply stability or -- of course, it varies day by day, but we -- our things in supply stability as we've come out of Uri and Western Hemisphere supplies have been more stabilized. Now we have been in a period of higher turnaround in the Western Hemisphere this last quarter. So we expect some of those plants to come back online. As some of you called out, there are some turnarounds happening in the third quarter in China, but I would say kind of within the normal level.
So I think I'd say supply has certainly stabilized at first quarter. But I would also say demand, while it continues to be robust, we are seeing some pockets of lower demand potentially going forward, with COVID and the Delta variant and especially in Southeast Asia. So I think it's a little bit of both.
I think what's interesting to note is if you look at the moderation that we've called out in China pricing, it's really a very slow moderation compared to what we saw, say, in 2018. And we think that is because it is demand-driven as much as supply-driven, whereas 18 months, you've got the supply back, it dropped very quickly. And if you look at recent prices, I mean, prices have -- in China have been really stable over the last, call it, week. And we think that's more indicative of the slow moderation we expect to see through the remainder of the year."

So we really are expecting much less seasonality in acetyls.

So our focus remains on opportunities that fit well within our business models and really meet our disciplined return criteria and our requirements around synergies.

So for EM, I would characterize the end markets as all of the markets has recovered to pre-COVID levels at this point in time with the exception of medical implants. And as you said, auto which is really more due to shortages of those chips, microchips and also some shortages of resins in Q2. In fact, we've seen growth above 2019 levels in industrial and channel and electronics and some of the other sectors.
So if we look at implants, which is kind of your question, implants have improved across second quarter. We expect them to continue to recover through the end of the year and really be back at normalized rates in 2022. I will say other areas of medical though, we have seen really good growth in this year, including like long dose drug delivery, diabetes applications, et cetera. So medical overall, I would say, has recovered. It's just specifically the implant business, which is our GUR business, which will be into 2022 before we see full normalization.
I think auto, which is the other big end market, as we called out in our comments was down 8% in the quarter, but that's versus North America dropping builds of 12% and in Germany dropping builds of 15%, which is our 2 largest end markets. And so we think we've been helped there. Autos have prioritized premium vehicles.
We've talked about that in the past, and we have the majority of our content in premium vehicles. But we're also seeing a real help from our programs that we put in place, specifically around electric vehicles. So if you think about it in the EU, 17% of all electric vehicle cells are now -- sorry, of all vehicle cells are now electric vehicles. And so that project pipeline where we've grown that -- those volumes have really helped us.
We've also, as we called out and expanding our content in electric vehicles. So we talked about the 20 kilograms content that we have in Europe for 1 of our EVs, which is 4x our average ICE. Just to give you another idea, just GUR alone is 6 to 8 kilograms per electric vehicle. So a really big space that we have. We have really good polymers to go into those spaces.
So as we go to the second half, we do expect growth again in Q3 as we see chip recovery, and we've had resin recovery. We probably won't be back to Q1 levels in Q3, but anticipate we'll be back to Q1 levels for auto by Q4. And we continue to see that few percent growth across other end uses as we move through the end of the year."

If you look at our margin percent this quarter, we had a few impacts there that brought our margin down slightly from last quarter. Some of it was increased spend in the plants as we needed to add more people to deal with the increased demand. We also had higher energy costs, especially in Europe. And then logistics and transportation, as I'm sure you're hearing from other, was certainly a big headwind this past quarter and will continue to be a headwind probably through the end of the year and even into early next year. So I think as we see labor markets stabilize, as we see logistics and transportation stabilize, I think we would expect to get back to previous levels of margin going forward.
I would also just say, Bob, the real difference here from what we've seen in the past is our constraint in Q2 and continuing in Q3 is not demand-driven. It's really supply-constrained. It's our ability to make resin, get the additives, especially glass fiber as we called out, which has continued to deteriorate as we move through second quarter and into third quarter. It's really supply-constrained. So there is also more volume upside as we go forward and are able to resolve those supply constraints."

I mean, I think it really depends upon the business and the material and where we're at and how we see things going forward and particularly how our business is performing. And certainly, reliability of supply in certain materials is very important for us right now. And so we may choose to hold a little bit more raw material, if possible, if we can get it in certain areas of tightness. We are not going to be bound by that working capital number because our working capital efficiency has historically been very strong, and we can bring that down fairly quickly, if necessary, in the future.
I think in terms of how we see that working its way, our greater than $1.2 billion for the year assumes we get some of that working capital back towards the end of the year, but certainly not all of it and certainly not back to how we started the year. And so a lot will depend upon what happens with raw materials and as well as our pricing. I mean one of the important characteristics here is accounts receivable. And with what we've seen in pricing in Asia, in acetyls which tends to have slightly longer payment terms, we're carrying a little more accounts receivable today than what we have historically. So as that normalizes, we'll get some of that back. And so there will be a catch-up likely into next year."

I will give you my opinion, which is look, they've only had this business since 1980s. It was a JV. They acquired it fully in, I think, about -- maybe 2010, sometime in that first decade.
Look, this is not one of their core businesses. Exxon is an oil and gas, commodity chemical player. This is a highly specialized business. And I'm sure, while they've enjoyed the margins and returns from it, it's not -- it doesn't really fit their model of what they're trying to do. And having come out of an Exxon specialty business, they struggle to run them in a way that can be highly competitive with others. So my guess is they realized it was more valuable to us than it was to them.
If you look at end markets, it is largely into auto. Think things that need to be recyclable or long life or soft touch or lightweighting. But there are also applications for it into medical applications, into construction, think seals around windows and skyscrapers. And so as we look at it, we think it's a really good fit for us to cross-sell with our automotive side. We think there are some really exciting new applications in medical going forward that given our knowledge now at the medical and pharma industry, we can exploit. And so we think there's a lot of opportunities there to really apply these materials to businesses we already know, already understand and already know how to access the market.
Again, our willingness to do -- deal with complexity is just different than Exxon. We deal with small orders every day. That's not something Exxon wants to do. They -- so I think we see a lot of value uplift opportunity here in what we consider very profitable end markets as we go forward.
In terms of new capacity, we are not aware of any new capacity coming on in this area. It is a highly specialized material. And we don't see any -- now, we don't anticipate any for the future. This, in fact, Exxon had grown the capacity of this business in just the last couple of years, I think, in the Newport facility."

I mean I would say the logistics and transportation issues are global. I mean certainly global. We see a lot of problems for people trying to get things out of China, as you know, but I would say really, whatever what you're going, it's pretty hard right now. Whether it's by ship or on ground or rail, there is just a lot of volume being moved around the world. Not sure I could explain all the reasons why, but certainly, people are moving more things around. I mean, just even the amount of things you buy on Amazon these days.
It's -- we just see a real constraint there. And that's really what I was referring to. I think it's well into next year, I think possibly even after Chinese New Year before we really start to see stabilization in those markets.
The labor phenomenon I discussed has really been more of an issue in the U.S. than in other parts of the world. We haven't had as many issues in Asia, for example, nor we had the issues in China. But in the U.S., I think we just -- we see people we're hiring to expand and run our plants, are also being hired by Amazon to run their warehouses, for example.
And so it's just a very competitive labor market, and we've had to make adjustments as we've wanted to add shifts and do things that would let us expand rather quickly to our labor rates. But I think in time, this will stabilize as we see more people going back to work in the U.S., I think this will also stabilize. But I do think probably on this will take into next year as well."

Can you talk about the upside opportunities and the downside risks related to that supply shortage, for example, on the volume side, how much might you be constrained?

And then on the price side, I guess my question would be, is there opportunity to capitalize by raising price in the engineered products that might require glass fiber. I assume that's certain polyesters and maybe Celstran and some nylon grades. Maybe you could just elaborate on what's going on there."

Maybe to be a little bit more clear on the characterization. I mean if we look at second quarter, we would estimate, we probably lost as much as $5 million revenue due to problems around glass fiber as well as a little bit of logistics transportation issues. If we looked at third quarter, that number is probably going to double. But we do expect it to resolve and we get some of those volumes back starting in the fourth quarter and going into 2022.
Look, we are seeing glass fiber makers coming back. We are seeing the volumes go up. Glass fiber that goes into polymer is a very small percentage of the glass fiber market, but it's probably one of the more profitable segments for them. So we do expect to start seeing more glass fiber coming back towards us as we move into fourth quarter.
Look, I think long term, as this goes on, it has been an opportunity for us to convert people to other polymers. Our polymers that also have glass fibers that we prioritized because they're higher-margin polymers, so that people can get their product. So I think there is some upside here, and we've been able to convert some of it to higher margin products. But I think long term, it is about 1/3 of our portfolio that uses glass fiber. So it is a pretty important raw material for us going forward. And we've taken steps commercially to secure supply of glass fiber in future years. So hopefully, we don't run into this problem again."

I think it's a competitive gap. I think, look, we continue to invest in R&D. I know our competitors do as well. I would say we think we continue to have advantaged technologies, in acetic acid, in VAM and emulsions. We don't really see that gap closing. We think everybody continues to move up, but we don't really see that gap closing at this point in time."

So it's kind of a broad question, but let me try to break it down. So I discussed some of the things we did that we think improved our foundational earnings in terms of productivity and capacity debottlenecks, et cetera, and strengthening of our chain and strengthening of our model. I think it's also fair to say that we believe that the acetyl industry dynamics has improved over the long term.
So if you think about it just growing at kind of GDP, between '18 and '21, we saw nearly 1 million tons in demand growth for the industry. And during that time, we didn't add any new capacity. So it is a more tightly constrained market than it was, say, back in '18, the last time we had a price run up. We have a little bit of capacity coming on stream here in China that we talked about. And of course, we have a lot of capacity, our own capacity coming on, 1.3 million tons coming on in 2023. So those are the big capacity adds that are out there. But even if you add those together, it's kind of 3 or 4 years of growth in a very tight market. And again, we don't intend to run our capacity unless it makes sense to do so.
So I think the market dynamics have definitely improved over the last few years and continue to improve with just normal GDP growth. That could motivate people to get into the market. But I would say it's a very expensive market to get into. I mean you know our 1.3 million tons of capacity that we're adding at Clear Lake, we're spending $350 million to do so.
But if we look at greenfield build like they're doing in china, our own estimate of building that plant in China, because they don't have the infrastructure or everything else, is well in excess of $2 billion. That's a big hump for people to get over. You have to have availability of syngas. You have to have access to hydrogen. You have to have a good energy source. I mean it's a big hurdle for people to get over. It's a little better in the Gulf Coast of the U.S., but again, we already have a lot of players in the Gulf Coast.
So we don't see any new capacity coming on immediately. Even if someone were to start today, they're still 4 or 5 years out from adding new capacity. So we see for the foreseeable future, this remaining a pretty robust type market."

If we look at Q3, auto builds were down pretty significantly globally, like 12% down from the prior quarter. And certainly, that had some impact on us. What I would say is, though, it had less impact on us as -- just given the nature of where we are. I mean, if we really look at our Q3 volumes, they were down into auto only about 1%. And there's a couple of reasons for that.
One is, if you look at -- we have shifted our portfolio more to electric vehicles. Electric vehicles are actually up about 35% year-on-year in terms of builds, and we expect that to continue into next year. And because we have so much more exposure now to electric vehicles, so think about lithium-ion battery separator film, which has grown 40% year-on-year. Even though only about 10% to 15% of our portfolio now goes to electric vehicles, that still did in a long way in kind of negating the impact we saw from the overall decline in auto builds.
So what I would say is, yes, while we did shift some volume out of auto, we also have the shift within auto which allowed us to keep -- really get through the quarter with very little volume loss into end markets. And we did see some more shifts into other applications like industrial and electrical, which were strong during the quarter. But I would say actually more of the shift was probably within auto into the EV, which is consistent with the strategy that we laid out at the end of 2019."

What I would say is, look, we have seen this happen in China from time to time as a result of their Blue Sky initiatives, whether it's for the Olympics or some other things. And so we're not going to speculate on what's driving this energy curtailment. But while we expect the curtailments to be moderate in the fourth quarter, we don't really know what to expect yet for next year. So I think it's a little early to address this.
What I would say is we are a little different than some of our competition in China just in terms of what else our syngas provider does. So they have some choices that they can make about where the syngas go, whether it comes to us or whether it goes into olefins.

They tend to be higher-margin projects that we're able to close and they're higher-volume projects. So if you look at that going forward, it just says, our ability to shift between areas, as we're essentially in a sole position, will continue to be where we can continue to ship volumes into high-margin products."

As we look towards the fourth quarter for pricing, I think we did see Q3 moderate from Q2, I mean, down about 15% in China. Similarly, though, we saw Western Hemisphere prices for acetic acid go up 15%.
So I think right now, after the brief surge we had in prices following the energy curtailment, acetic acid has settled in now to kind of that $1,000 per ton price. So that's a little above Q3, but I do expect it's going to continue to moderate over the quarter. So I guess on average, our best view at this point is probably Q4 will look similar to Q3 in terms of averages for acetic acid.
I think VAM is a little trickier. We have seen a surge in VAM pricing following the energy curtailment as not just our VAM capacity, which was shut down for a few weeks, but others' VAM capacity was shut down because these are more highly energy-intensive processes in the Acetyl Chain. So we have seen more loss of VAM capacity in China. With the higher raw materials, we've seen some of that capacity slow to come back or additional capacity stay down.
So VAM prices remain quite high, I mean, record levels, well over $2,000 a ton. And I think we're not seeing any falloff in demand for VAM and for downstream VAM derivatives just because there are such low inventories, as you may be hearing from others on their calls, in the chain. So I would expect VAM pricing to -- it's quite high in Q3, but I would expect that to stay at that level or possibly even a little stronger as we go into Q4, which would offset any further softening we see in acetic acid."

What continues to change is the supply-demand balance gets tighter and tighter. And we've been calling that out for a few years. I mean, every year, demand goes up 600 kt. And so that's like one plant every year, and nobody has been building plants.
So we are steadily now in that structural utilization kind of mid-80s to 90s, which means instantaneous utilization when you account for turnarounds and unplanned downtimes. And everything is in that high 90s, mid-90s to 100%. And that's going to continue. So it is a structural change in the industry which affects where I think we'll settle. I don't think we're going to settle acetic acid prices down in the 300 range where we used to see it settle. I think it is going to be higher than that because structurally, it's just a much tighter industry.
And I think what you see is the outages really reinforce that point because we very rapidly see the run-up in pricing anytime there's a slightest bubble. So I think it's not the outages that have changed my view. It's -- I think the outages have reinforced our view that structurally, this is a tightening market that is going to enjoy good margins for some period of time.
And we've talked about it in other quarters as -- there's not -- we had a little bit of capacity come on in China this year with Ye Glance. We have our capacity coming on in 2023, which, of course, we will run to meet the market demand and have a lot of flexibility to take it up and down depending on what's going on with the market. But there's nothing else currently being built. And so -- and yes, demand is going to continue grow. So it is going to settle higher, but I think it's really the overlying structure versus, say, the outages.
So what does that mean in terms of availability? I mean, yes, we were down this year for the freeze event. And of course, we had some supplier issues for some time following the freeze event. Other than that, actually, our units run very reliably this year. I do think, as we move into future years, we will be back at a normal pattern of turnaround. So while I think there's some incremental capacity available to us next year, I wouldn't say it's probably really significant from a volume standpoint."

Maybe a little bit to follow on the last question and also tying into several of your big customers on the coatings side have actually called out emulsions as being problematic from a pricing and sourcing standpoint. So when you look at how tight you see things over the next couple of years, when you look at the size of those customers, should we expect some meaningful-sized new announcements over the next year either on VAM, where you would maybe ship in acetic acid? Or would there be anybody that would look at doing kind of an integrated acetic acid in the VAM project in the U.S.?"
405277,1683287582,2409988,"Celanese Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2021",2021-10-22,"Earnings Calls","Celanese Corporation","Executives","Yes. It's an interesting question, Duffy. I mean let me kind of take the last part. I really wouldn't expect anybody to do an acetic acid to VAM to VAE kind of newbuild. I just don't think economically -- I mean that's probably -- just the acetic acid par",316,"Yes. It's an interesting question, Duffy. I mean let me kind of take the last part. I really wouldn't expect anybody to do an acetic acid to VAM to VAE kind of newbuild. I just don't think economically -- I mean that's probably -- just the acetic acid part of that is probably at least a $2 billion investment. And then you add on the VAM and VAE, it might even double that depending on the size of the facility.
So I think that's a pretty big lift for just about anybody, not to mention the space, the infrastructure, the permitting, everything. This is a 5- to 7-year prospect if someone were to start now. So that's a ways out there. So I'm not worried about that. Like I said, we have 1.3 million tons coming on in 2023, which is basically the equivalent of 2 world-scale plants for acetic acid. And you'll recall, we've announced a series of VAM and VAE expansions globally around the world, trying to meet what we do see as continuing strong demand.
I mean part of the problem right now, of course, is with the freeze, with other outages, things have gotten behind. At one point, as people restock, the world will normalize again. As we see acetic acid prices come down, that will lead eventually to lower VAM prices and lower VAE prices. Energy is a big factor.
So I mean I think it's going to normalize even short of a lot of new capacity being added. But we do see the need for more capacity to come online, which is a need we think we're best positioned to be given our great technology, our lower -- our energy-efficient technology and our integration not just within our plants, but also our networks globally that allow us to really optimize and provide secure supply to our customers around the globe."

Let me just kind of walk through it and comment on some of the things we're assuming in that number. So what we said is next -- an adjusted EPS next year of at least $15. That is based on a belief our acetyls business will have an EBIT between $1.2 b",479,"Yes. Let me just kind of walk through it and comment on some of the things we're assuming in that number. So what we said is next -- an adjusted EPS next year of at least $15. That is based on a belief our acetyls business will have an EBIT between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. As I said a little earlier in the call, that assumes we see relatively strong pricing, we're expecting, in the fourth quarter continuing into the first half of the year. Where you are in that range indicates where it might -- the different places we think it might start to moderate, whether it's a little bit before the third quarter, whether it's into the third quarter.
We do, though, expect to see moderation to normalized pricing sometime midyear, and as I said, similar volumes to what we did this year because we think with turnaround -- levels of turnarounds and everything, I just assume kind of similar volumes.
For EM, we are expecting $700 million to $800 million of EBIT. That does include Santoprene. It does include the organic growth both from our project model and our growth model, but also the Bishop GUR expansion. But I would say it's also dampened a bit by our expectation that auto builds will not recover year. So we're expecting auto builds at the same level we're seeing auto builds in 2021. And that affects our normal materials into auto and -- but it also will affect Santoprene because it is 65% into auto.
And then in tow, we expect it to be pretty consistent with this year because we expect it to continue to be challenged by acetic acid pricing, at least in the first half of the year, and also by energy pricing. I will say if you add all those up, you might come up with a number slightly over $15. So what you should be aware of is we do expect the other to go up as we expect less pension income next year with maybe a softening in the market, which will then raise our BU Other.
So if you look at that in terms of free cash flow, I mean, free cash flow, we're basically saying even with a lower expectation on EBIT earnings driven primarily by moderation in acetyls, we do expect about the same level of free cash flow. So lower earnings, but we do -- would then get that working capital normalization that shows up as free cash flow on our books if we see the moderation in acetyls.
And we do expect slightly higher CapEx. We're still taking CapEx around $600 million next year. But we won't have the EU payment. So kind of look at all that, that washes out to basically free cash flow in the same level we expect to see this year."

And you cited sort of escalation in pricing for catalysts and the like as well.

If you look at like a decade ago, our foundational earnings for acetyls were in that $300 million to $400 million. And then if you go as recently as even last year, we were saying we think our foundational earnings are around $800 million. And that was based on continued rationalization of our footprint, expansion activities we had done, work we had done to improve the productivity of our sites, whether it be energy efficiency or catalyst recovery systems and things that lowered our cost of production.
And now we're saying we think that base level is greater than $1 billion. And so it's really the same thing. I mean it is productivity, it is energy efficiency, but it also is a market dynamic that I was talking about. I mean, if you go back a decade, we had really overbuilt in China. We -- but the industry had overbuilt in China. And we were at low utilization, I mean, mid-60s going to mid-70s. Now we're at a much higher level of utilization with no new capacity other than our own on the horizon and maybe a few other little things around the globe. And so we are just in a much tighter area of supply-demand, which we expect will continue for the next 5 to 7 years, unless someone else build new capacity. But it will take them that long. And that's really why we're saying that foundational earning being kind of the lowest we think we will achieve in any given time is now at about that $1 billion level.
Now obviously, that could change if we had a global economic recession or something. I mean -- but I'm just saying in normal economic conditions, we think that's the floor. And I think that's -- I think it's really demonstrate also the power of the model that we've developed over the last 10 years, where we are able to -- as we did in the third quarter, we had a 15% decline in the price of acetic acid in China, but we were able to recover that with the price in the Western Hemisphere because we still had tightness in the Western Hemisphere. And we had 8% less earnings from asset globally in the third quarter than we did in second quarter, but we were able to recover that in margins for VAM and VAE and other downstream derivatives because -- and having that flexibility to shift geographically and having that ability to flex in the chain is what gives us confidence that, unlike many of our competitors who don't have that flexibility, we will be able to deliver that $1 billion of foundational means going forward."

Now there are other reasons to be in China like we are, which is making things in China for the China market, which continues to be a great market. But making things in China for export, not so attractive anymore.
And I think that's true for other commodities as well and for other regions of the world as well. And I think also with the supply chain issues that we've all experienced this year, I think our strategy of making locally for local demand has proven to be a good one and probably one we'll see others start to follow as well."

China coal had gotten more expensive even than Singapore for a while because Singapore was oil-based. But coal has gone up, oil has gone up.

And it's a period typically where you have seasonality, and we weren't expecting much this year. But I would say that's fully both baked into our fourth quarter.
But clearly, those curtailments and the impact they're having on others as well as the curtailments we had in the third quarter has changed our view of how long this pricing situation is going to last. People are not going to be able to rebuild inventories now in the fourth quarter. And so I think it just pushes that higher range of pricing further into 2022. As we do fully expect, people -- once prices start to moderate, even at what are still fairly high prices, they will want to rebuild inventory, especially because we're already be going into the next construction season at the end of 1Q.
So I think that really accounts for the change in our outlook for 2022 is just this continued level of higher pricing, higher margins for acetyls extending longer into the year now than what we thought a quarter ago."

We actually saw it increase by 10x versus what we had, had in previous years.
Now a lot of these same materials go into other applications, they go into catalytic converters. And back when auto was really picking up, we really saw a lot of competition for that limited supply of precious metals. Interestingly enough, with -- not surprisingly also, with the reduction in auto bill, not so many catalytic converters being built, we've actually seen some moderation back to maybe now only 5x what it is. So I would say precious metals are [indiscernible] too. But we have seen some moderation. And I think the volatility we're seeing in pricing there is just typical of the volatility we're seeing around the world, where a lot of pent-up demand, people really wanting to produce but a lot of, I would say, almost worsening issues around supply chain logistics and other -- and everything else, which is keeping all of these markets quite volatile.

I mean it used to be an advantage in China probably due to some government support. I think that's -- a lot of that is gone now. So I think cost of materials in China is really not that much less labor, not necessarily versus the U.S. but versus maybe other parts of Asia. The labor has more normalized -- I mean I think labor is still a bit more expensive in the U.S., but you also get a bit more productivity in the U.S.
So I'm just saying that this -- the difference in -- whereas it used to almost be a 2:1 advantage to build in China versus the U.S. or any other part of Asia, and you could do it and you could get through permitting and things more quickly, that benefit has vanished. Is there still a 10% advantage? Maybe, but it's not as large as it used to be. And that's really what I was referring to in my previous comments.
But again, it still makes sense to build in China if you're building for materials that are going to be consumed in China because you get around any tariff issues or any trade war issues, transportation, logistics issues. So it can still make sense to build in China. I'm just saying you're not -- we would not see the advantage of building in China for something we're going to export to some other part of the region or some other part of the world."

Look, I would say we expect auto builds to be flat year-on-year, if you look at the industry and globally. Now I think that changes region to region. I think Asia is doing a bit better.

Now I think that changes region to region. I think Asia is doing a bit better. I think Europe is doing a bit worse. I think the U.S. has been between there. I think that's pretty consistent, though, with an industry view on auto builds.
I think while we all hope the chip shortage was going to improve, I think now every most things you read by knowledgeable people say, it's probably the end of next year before that starts to improve. So our expectation is auto builds will continue to be flat year-on-year. Our own -- what that means for Celanese, so maybe I should call that out because I think it's important, is actually we expect our auto volumes to be up 15% next year versus where they were this year, just really as driven by the mix that we have, again, the higher exposure than we have in EV than we used to have; EVs have a higher kilogram per vehicle; the presence we have in lithium-ion battery separator films, enhanced by the expansion in Bishop that will finish here at the end of the year. So in -- again, industry-wide, we expect flat auto builds. We expect though our volume into auto to continue to grow by 15% next year.
And I think your last question, Bob, but I had a little problem hearing it, I think it was really around elective procedures and medical -- for medical and what we're seeing there. Yes, so what I would say is on medical, electric procedures have been flat this year. We kept calling out we expected them to increase. We also didn't expect the delta variant. And so what we've really seen is they're still flat. We're seeing a little bit of pickup in some regions, but I would say nothing of significance in terms of our orthopedic side of the medical business.
What I will say, though, is we have seen a notable pickup in our business for other medical and pharma. And it's really on the back of our focus we put on this and our strategy in 2019 trying to expand our presence in other parts of medical and pharma. And we did see an increase in that in the third quarter, which is really what helps kind of keep our mix pretty steady versus second quarter.
And just as an example of the kind of projects that we're bringing in now in medical outside of orthopedic, we've actually just closed the deal to provide pump into a dry powder inhaler for a company in India. So this is for an inhaler, uses dry powder, uses our POM. This is a high-value application with pretty good -- not just good margins but good volumes going forward. So -- and that's really where we're starting to see more growth, higher-margin business, things like inhalers, things like wearables, diabetes devices. Obviously, still continuing to grow our vital dose, long-dose delivery platform. I mean we are seeing really good growth in these segments and expect that to continue into next year and beyond."

Now they've gained in productivity. So I don't think it's that, it's going to switch. I don't think it's going to be cheaper to build in other parts of the world. But I don't think China is ever going to go back to being the super low-cost producer that it once was. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, right? We see China also moving to create more high-value materials, more things in China to meet the growing demand of the population in China. So I just don't think there'll always be the huge low-cost exporter that they once were. But we've seen many economies go through that, right? And so who knows what the next economy. But they're still the second largest economy in the world, so there's no doubt China will remain a very important part of the world's balance and certainly the chemical and polymer world balance in terms of where things come from."

Lori talked about catalysts. Catalysts usage of these disadvantaged technologies is higher than what ours is. So we're seeing the cost increase. They're seeing the cost increase at a greater rate. And so that should hopefully -- and that's kind of why we've signaled strength as we work our way into 2022 is we do think that there is some changes here that we do believe are sustainable when then you layer on the fact that supply/demand utilizations are getting into the 90% range."

So if we look at natural gas, I mean, obviously, natural gas is an issue in the U.S., where we purchased about 55 million BTUs annually. But it's also a real issue in Europe, where we don't necessarily purchase much natural gas directly, but we certainly see it as a factor in many of our raw material costs as well as a factor in our steam and other things that we purchase from others. And so it has been a significant factor this year, third quarter a step-up from second quarter.
In fourth quarter, we do expect to see another, call it, 25% increase in the U.S. at a nearly doubling of natural gas prices in the EU. So this will be a significant factor for us in the fourth quarter.
Now with the surcharges, with other things, we do expect we'll be able to recover some of that. I think the -- we will see, for example, in EM, another $20 million increase. With the surcharge, we're recovering some, but it means we're probably just going to be flat to third quarter to fourth quarter. Not every contract can we put a surcharge on. Not every molecule will have a surcharge. Some contracts are fixed for a short period of time. So we won't be able to recover everything, but we do think we'll be able to basically mitigate the impact of the increase from third quarter to fourth quarter.
If we stay in the winter months, next year, we'd expect first quarter to be kind of the same level of pricing we see in the fourth quarter. But again, we have been able to pass more of those costs on. So we should see a bit of help as we move into next year as it comes to the impact of natural gas pricing on our overall margins."

I mean glass fiber demand has surged and the ability of the providers to respond to that, especially post freeze, is just -- it's just hard to get them back on and get the production up. So I don't really see probably an improvement in glass fiber in the fourth quarter. We do expect to start seeing some improvement next year.
Similarly, flame retardants, I mean that one is a little -- even more complicated because pretty much all of the yellow phosphorus that's used to make flame retardants comes out of Hunan province in China, which was curtailed as part of the energy curtailments in Q3 and will probably be impacted in the fourth quarter. So that situation is not going to get better, probably again this year, hopefully, will get better next year. But there right now is just a single source of this raw material and it happens to be in China. So we need a bit more time to understand what the energy curtailments are going to mean going forward to really know when that issue is going to resolve itself.
And resins, I would say, are mostly resolved at this point in time. I don't expect resin availability to be as much of an issue in the fourth quarter and certainly not as we move into next year."

Now that said, we look at everything with a lot of discipline, and we look at it through the lens that we laid out at Investor Day. So we look at -- we really focus on, can we achieve synergies with it? What do we think is our unique ability to get value creation from it? So is it something that we can provide our business model, our project pipelines, our growth models too, all of those criterias, where do we think it is in the value chain. We look at -- but we look at everything. We choose very few things to pursue. And so maybe I just stop at that.
What I will say, though, is we think we have a lot of managerial and financial bandwidth in order to complete transactions of any size or multiple transactions of a smaller size. So at the time of the Investor Day, we said we outlined about a $6 billion of -- having $6 billion available on our balance sheet in order to do M&A. I will tell you, even with the expected close of Santoprene here in December, we still think we have about $6 billion available to us on our balance sheet because of our higher earnings that we've had this year and what that's meant in terms of cash generation and where our balance sheet is at.
So I mean, assume we look at everything, assume we continue to look at it through the criteria we laid out at Investor Day and know that we have a very large pot of money ready to go when we find the right opportunity, and we have a management team that's ready to both negotiate and integrate."

But if you think about CO, if you think about methanol, I mean, in the U.S., these are all natural gas derivatives. So there is a kind of direct correlation to raw material feedstock. Having natural gas, though, for acetyls from an energy standpoint, like -- this is very small because actually acetic acid, it's exothermic. It's heat integrated with others downstream. So not -- kind of the inverse of what you think. It is a big deal for raw materials. We tend to be able to pass that through, not such a big deal in terms of direct cost of energy in our U.S. operations.
In Europe, again, more EM exposure. Most EM tends to be lower energy intensity, so I think compounding really doesn't require much energy. But something like POM requires a lot of energy. So you think about POM, right, you have to heat it. You have to crystallize it. You have to dry it. It's -- that takes a lot of energy. So there, we really do see the direct impact of natural gas, which has almost doubled from third quarter to what we expect in the fourth quarter and is kind of 4x what it was in the third quarter -- or in the second quarter. There you see a very direct relationship and one that's a little harder to pass through because it really has to do with steam costs and electricity costs and all those sort of things."

The -- can you touch on, given the improved structural outlook for acetyls, why not pull forward CapEx to sort of fill in the pipeline -- the industry pipeline in 2026 to 2028? And on carbon pricing, to the extent that carbon prices move higher, are your EM customers giving you any sense of how that factors into pricing for your products? Are you seeing any kind of favorable mix shifts or negative from that? And similarly, within acetyls, is there a certain level of carbon prices where some of the Acetyl Chain becomes disadvantaged relative to substitutes?"

Look, I think in response to your first question, not just for acetyls but for EM, we continue to look at our ability to pull forward all of our projects because my margins are high still and we believe that, that structural demand is there. Similarl",394,"Yes. Look, I think in response to your first question, not just for acetyls but for EM, we continue to look at our ability to pull forward all of our projects because my margins are high still and we believe that, that structural demand is there. Similarly in EM, we can sell everything we can make right now. So -- and we expect that to continue as the desire for high-quality unique products like we make continues to grow.
So we actually look at -- we constantly have been looking at how do we pull all of these up. The limitations are really the actual time it just takes to do a project between permitting, which unfortunately, has been slowed down in most parts of the world because of COVID, all the way to just the ability to get raw materials, and we talked a little bit about steel, about concrete, everything. There's so much demand right now for construction projects that we're finding it difficult to pull our projects up in a meaningful way. But we'll continue to look at that, and we'll continue to update you as we move through the year.
And then on your second question, what I would say is for most of the high-value products that we produce in EM, customers just want the product. I mean we've had 3 consecutive quarters of price increases in EM, kind of the first time in our history. And what we find is that is not impacting the desire by customers to take products.
So I think in the inflationary environment we're all experiencing on everything, people understand you may not like it, but they understand why we're having to push through these price increases to cover raw materials and energy and have -- again, have not seen any loss of volume due to pricing.
I would say the same thing really in asset and downstream Acetyl Chain derivatives. The demand for construction products and packaging and all these things that acetyls go into is only increasing and even at the higher prices. I mean people maybe have been a bit slower to refill inventory at these prices, but there's no material anyway available to refill inventory. So again, we've not -- our customers would take more at these prices if we could produce more. We'll just leave it at that."

If we look at Q3, auto builds were down pretty significantly globally, like 12% down from the prior quarter. And certainly, that had some impact on us. What I would say is, though it had less impact on us, as -- just given the nature of where we are. I mean, if we really look at our Q3 volumes, they were down into auto only about 1%. And there's a couple of reasons for that. 
One is, if you look at -- we have shifted our portfolio more to electric vehicles. Electric vehicles are actually up about 35% year-on-year in terms of builds, and we expect that to continue into next year. And because we have so much more exposure now to electric vehicles, so think about lithium-ion battery separator film, which has grown 40% year-on-year. Even though only about 10% to 15% of our portfolio now goes to electric vehicles, that still did -- went a long way in kind of negating the impact we saw from the overall decline in auto builds. 
So what I would say is, yes, while we did shift some volume out of auto, we also have the shift within auto which allowed us to keep -- really get through the quarter with very little volume loss into end markets. And we did see some more shift into other applications like industrial and electrical, which were strong during the quarter. But I would say actually more of the shift was probably within auto into the EV, which is consistent with the strategy that we laid out at the end of 2019."

What I would say is, look, we have seen this happen in China from time to time as a result of their Blue Sky initiatives, whether it's for the Olympics or some other things. And so we're not going to speculate on what's driving this energy curtailment. But while we expect the curtailments to be moderate in the fourth quarter, we don't really know what to expect yet for next year. So I think it's a little early to address this. 
What I would say is we are a little different than some of our competition in China, just in terms of what else our syngas provider does. So they have some choices that they can make about where the syngas go, whether it comes to us or whether it goes into olefins.

They tend to be higher-margin projects that we're able to close and they're higher-volume projects. So if you look at that going forward, it just says, our ability to shift between areas, as we're essentially in a sole position, will continue to be where we can continue to ship volumes into high-margin products."

As we look towards the fourth quarter for pricing, I think we did see Q3 moderate from Q2, I mean, down about 15% in China. Similarly, though, we saw Western Hemisphere prices for acetic acid go up 15%. 
So I think right now, after the brief surge we had in prices following the energy curtailment, acetic acid has settled in now to kind of that $1,000 per ton price. So that's a little above Q3, but I do expect it's going to continue to moderate over the quarter. So I guess on average, our best view at this point is probably Q4 will look similar to Q3 in terms of averages for acetic acid. 
I think VAM is a little trickier. We have seen a surge in VAM pricing following the energy curtailment as -- not just our VAM capacity, which was shut down for a few weeks, but others' VAM capacity was shut down because these are more highly energy-intensive processes in the Acetyl Chain.  So we have seen more loss of VAM capacity in China. With the higher raw materials, we've seen some of that capacity slow to come back or additional capacity stay down. 
So VAM prices remain quite high, I mean, record levels, well over $2,000 a ton. And I think we're not seeing any falloff in demand for VAM and for downstream VAM derivatives just because there are such low inventories, as you may be hearing from others on their calls, in the chain. So I would expect VAM pricing to -- it's quite high in Q3, but I would expect that to stay at that level or possibly even a little stronger as we go into Q4, which would offset any further softening we see in acetic acid."

Have all of these different events led you to have a different view of where acetic acid and VAM pricing might be at the end of next year? That is, have they structurally changed the way that you expect the industry to evolve? And then secondly, with all of the outages that you've had this year, how much more acetyl volume can you produce next year than you produce this year at a normal operating rate?"

So have the outages affected my view of the industry? I think the answer is no. What continues to change is the supply-demand balance gets tighter and tighter. And we've been calling that out for a few years. I mean, every year, demand goes up 600 kt",427,"Yes. So have the outages affected my view of the industry? I think the answer is no. What continues to change is the supply-demand balance gets tighter and tighter. And we've been calling that out for a few years. I mean, every year, demand goes up 600 kt. And so that's like one plant every year, and nobody has been building plants. 
So we are steadily now in that structural utilization kind of mid-80s to 90s, which means instantaneous utilization when you account for turnarounds and unplanned downtimes. And everything is in that high 90s, mid-90s to 100%. And that's going to continue. So it is that structural change in the industry which affects where I think we'll settle. I don't think we're going to settle acetic acid prices down in the 300 range where we used to see it settle. But I think it is going to be higher than that because structurally, it's just a much tighter industry. 
And I think what you see is the outages really reinforce that point because we very rapidly see the run-up in pricing anytime there's a slightest bubble. So I think it's not the outages that have changed my view. It's -- I think the outages have reinforced our view that structurally, this is a tightening market that is going to enjoy good margins for some period of time. 
And we've talked about it in other quarters as -- there's not -- we had a little bit of capacity come on in China this year with [ Wu Yi, Jiang Xi ]. We have our capacity coming on in 2023, which, of course, we will run to meet the market demand and have a lot of flexibility to take it up and down depending on what's going on with the market. But there's nothing else currently being built. And so -- and yes, demand is going to continue grow. So it is going to settle higher, but I think it's really the overlying structure versus, say, the outages.
So what does that mean in terms of availability? I mean, yes, we were down this year for the freeze event. And of course, we had some supplier issues for some time following the freeze event. Other than that, actually, our units run very reliably this year. I do think, as we move into future years, we will be back at a normal pattern of turnaround. So while I think there's some incremental capacity available to us next year, I wouldn't say it's probably really significant from a volume standpoint."

So when you look at how tight you see things over the next couple of years, when you look at the size of those customers, should we expect some meaningful-sized new announcements over the next year either on VAM, where you would maybe ship in acetic acid? Or would there be anybody that would look at doing kind of an integrated acetic acid in the VAM project in the U.S.?"

I mean let me kind of take the last part. I really wouldn't expect anybody to do an acetic acid to VAM to VAE kind of newbuild.

I really wouldn't expect anybody to do an acetic acid to VAM to VAE kind of newbuild. I just don't think economically -- I mean that's probably -- just the acetic acid part of that is probably at least a $2 billion investment. And then you add on the VAM and VAE, it might even double that depending on the size of the facility.
So I think that's a pretty big lift for just about anybody, not to mention the space, the infrastructure, the permitting, everything. This is a 5- to 7-year prospect if someone were to start now. So that's a ways out there. So I'm not worried about that. Like I said, we have 1.3 million tons coming on in 2023, which is basically the equivalent of 2 world-scale plants for acetic acid. And you'll recall, we've announced a series of VAM and VAE expansions globally around the world, trying to meet what we do see as continuing strong demand.
I mean part of the problem right now, of course, is with the freeze, with other outages, things have gotten behind. At one point, as people restock, the world will normalize again. As we see acetic acid prices come down, that will lead eventually to lower VAM prices and lower VAE prices. Energy is a big factor.
So I mean I think it's going to normalize even short of a lot of new capacity being added. But we do see the need for more capacity to come online, which is a need we think we're best positioned to be given our great technology, our lower -- our energy-efficient technology and our integration not just within our plants, but also our networks globally that allow us to really optimize and provide secure supply to our customers around the globe."

Let me just kind of walk through it and comment some of the things we're assuming in that number. So what we said is next -- an adjusted EPS next year of at least $15. That is based on a belief our acetyls business will have an EBIT between $1.2 bill",480,"Yes. Let me just kind of walk through it and comment some of the things we're assuming in that number. So what we said is next -- an adjusted EPS next year of at least $15. That is based on a belief our acetyls business will have an EBIT between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. As I said a little earlier in the call, that assumes we see relatively strong pricing, we're expecting in the fourth quarter, continuing into the first half of the year. Where you are in that range indicates where it might -- the different places we think it might start to moderate, whether it's a little bit before the third quarter, whether it's into the third quarter.
We do, though, expect to see moderation to normalized pricing sometime midyear. And as I said, similar volumes to what we did this year because we think with the turnaround -- normalized levels of turnarounds and everything, I just assume kind of similar volumes.
For EM, we are expecting $700 million to $800 million of EBIT. That does include Santoprene. It does include the organic growth both from our project model and our growth model, but also the Bishop GUR expansion. But I would say it's also dampened a bit by our expectation that auto builds will not recover year. So we're expecting auto builds at the same level we're seeing auto builds in 2021. And that affects our normal materials into auto and -- but it also will affect Santoprene because it is 65% into auto.
And then in tow, we expect it to be pretty consistent with this year because we expect it to continue to be challenged by acetic acid pricing, at least in the first half of the year, and also by energy pricing. I will say if you add all those up, you might come up with a number slightly over $15. So what you should be aware of is we do expect the other to go up as we expect less pension income next year with maybe a softening in the market, which will then raise our BU Other.
So if you look at that in terms of free cash flow, I mean, free cash flow, we're basically saying even with a lower expectation on EBIT earnings driven primarily by moderation in acetyls, we do expect about the same level of free cash flow. So lower earnings, but we do -- would then get that working capital normalization that shows up as free cash flow on our books if we see the moderation in acetyls.
And we do expect slightly higher CapEx. We're still taking CapEx around $600 million next year. But we won't have the EU payment. So kind of look at all that, that washes out to basically free cash flow in the same level we expect to see this year."

So I just wanted to sort of get your thoughts around what's going on over there. Obviously, I see what's happening with the raw material side of things and the like. And you cited sort of escalation in pricing for catalysts and the like as well.

I think -- I'll just back up a little bit, Hassan. If you look at like a decade ago, our foundational earnings for acetyls were in that $300 million to $400 million.

If you look at like a decade ago, our foundational earnings for acetyls were in that $300 million to $400 million. And then if you go as recently as even last year, we were saying we think our foundational earnings are around $800 million. And that was based on continued rationalization of our footprint, expansion activities we had done, work we had done to improve the productivity of our sites, whether it be energy efficiency or catalyst recovery systems and things that lowered our cost of production.
And now we're saying we think that base level is greater than $1 billion. And so it's really the same thing. I mean it is productivity, it is energy efficiency, but it also is this market dynamic that I was talking about. I mean, if you go back a decade, we had really overbuilt in China. We -- but the industry had overbuilt in China. And we were at low utilization, I mean, mid-60s going to mid-70s. Now we're at a much higher level of utilization with no new capacity other than our own on the horizon and maybe a few other little things around the globe. And so we are just in a much tighter area of supply-demand, which we expect will continue for the next 5 to 7 years, unless someone else builds new capacity. But it will take them that long. And that's really why we're saying that foundational earning, being kind of the lowest we think we will achieve in any given time, is now at about that $1 billion level.
Now obviously, that could change if we had a global economic recession or something. I mean -- but I'm just saying in normal economic conditions, we think that's the floor. And I think that's -- I think it really demonstrates also the power of the model that we've developed over the last 10 years, where we are able to -- as we did in the third quarter, we had a 15% decline in the price of acetic acid in China, but we were able to recover that with the price in the Western Hemisphere because we still had tightness in the Western Hemisphere. And we had 8% less earnings from asset globally in the third quarter than we did in second quarter, but we were able to recover that in margins for VAM and VAE and other downstream derivatives because -- and having that flexibility to shift geographically and having that ability to flex in the chain is what gives us confidence that, unlike many of our competitors who don't have that flexibility, we will be able to deliver that $1 billion of foundational earnings going forward."

Now look, we're still bullish on China. We still are bullish about our operations there, but that advantage of being in China just from -- just as a place to be because of lower cost materials, doesn't really exist anymore. Now there are other reasons to be in China like we are, which is making things in China for the China market, which continues to be a great market. But making things in China for export, not so attractive anymore.
And I think that's true for other commodities as well and for other regions of the world as well. And I think also with the supply chain issues that we've all experienced this year, I think our strategy of making locally for local demand has proven to be a good one and probably one we'll see others start to follow as well."

China coal had gotten more expensive even than Singapore for a while, because Singapore was oil-based. But coal has gone up, oil has gone up.

And it's a period typically where you have seasonality, and we weren't expecting much this year. But I would say that's fully both baked into our fourth quarter.
But clearly, those curtailments and the impact they're having on others as well as the curtailments we had in the third quarter has changed our view of how long this pricing situation is going to last. People are not going to be able to rebuild inventories now in the fourth quarter. And so I think it just pushes that higher range of pricing further into 2022. As we do fully expect, people -- once prices start to moderate, even at what are still fairly high prices, they will want to rebuild inventory, especially because we're already be going into the next construction season at the end of 1Q.
So I think that really accounts for the change in our outlook for 2022, is just this continued level of higher pricing, higher margins for acetyls extending longer into the year now than what we thought a quarter ago."

And the second question there, you talk about the capital advantage to build capacity in China versus U.S. is now negligible, which is very interesting, because steel costs are the same everywhere and they always had cheap labor, and China was exporting deflation all these years.

We actually saw it increase by 10x versus what we had, had in previous years.
Now a lot of these same materials go into other applications, they go into catalytic converters. And back when auto was really picking up, we really saw a lot of competition for that limited supply of precious metals. Interestingly enough, with -- not surprisingly also, with the reduction in auto bill, not so many catalytic converters being built, we've actually seen some moderation back to maybe now only 5x what it is. So I would say precious metals are [indiscernible] too. But we have seen some moderation. 
And I think the volatility we're seeing in pricing there is just typical of the volatility we're seeing around the world, where a lot of pent-up demand, people really wanting to produce, but a lot of, I would say, almost worsening issues around supply chain logistics and other -- and everything else, which is keeping all of these markets quite volatile.

I mean, it used to be an advantage in China probably due to some government support. I think that's -- a lot of that is gone now. So I think cost of materials in China is really not that much less labor, not necessarily versus the U.S. but versus maybe other parts of Asia. The labor has more normalized -- I mean I think labor is still a bit more expensive in the U.S., but you also get a bit more productivity in the U.S.
So I'm just saying that this -- the difference in -- whereas it used to almost be a 2:1 advantage to build in China versus the U.S. or any other part of Asia, and you could do it and you could get through permitting and things more quickly, that benefit has vanished. Is there still a 10% advantage? Maybe. But it's not as large as it used to be. And that's really what I was referring to in my previous comments.
But again, it still makes sense to build in China if you're building for materials that are going to be consumed in China because you get around any tariff issues or any trade war issues, transportation, logistics issues. So it can still make sense to build in China. I'm just saying you're not -- we would not see the advantage of building in China for something we're going to export to some other part of the region or some other part of the world."

Now I think that changes region to region. I think Asia is doing a bit better. I think Europe is doing a bit worse. I think the U.S. has been between there. I think that's pretty consistent, though, with an industry view on auto builds. I think while we all hope the chip shortage was going to improve, I think now every most things you read by knowledgeable people will say, it's probably the end of next year before that starts to improve. 
So our expectation is auto builds will continue to be flat year-on-year. Our own -- what that means for Celanese, though, maybe I should call that out because I think it's important, is actually we expect our auto volumes to be up 15% next year versus where they were this year, just really as driven by the mix that we have, again, the higher exposure that we have in EVs than we used to have; EVs have a higher kilogram per vehicle; the presence we have in lithium-ion battery separator films, enhanced by the expansion in Bishop that will finish here at the end of the year. So again, industry-wide, we expect flat auto builds. We expect though our volume into auto to continue to grow by 15% next year.
And I think your last question, Bob, but I had a little problem hearing it, I think it was really around elective procedures and medical -- for medical and what we're seeing there. Yes, so what I would say is on medical, elective procedures have been flat this year. We kept calling out we expected them to increase. We also didn't expect the delta variant. And so what we've really seen is they're still flat. We're seeing a little bit of pickup in some regions, but I would say nothing of significance in terms of our orthopedic side of the medical business.
What I will say, though, is we have seen a notable pickup in our business for other medical and pharma. And it's really on the back of our focus we put on this and our strategy in 2019 trying to expand our presence in other parts of medical and pharma. And we did see an increase in that in the third quarter, which is really what helps kind of keep our mix pretty steady versus second quarter.
And just as an example of the kind of projects that we're bringing in now in medical outside of orthopedic, we've actually just closed the deal to provide POM into a dry powder inhaler for a company in India. So this is for an inhaler, uses dry powder, uses our POM. This is a high-value application with pretty good -- not just good margins but good volumes going forward.

As developing economies get more developed and get -- and strive to get a bigger middle class, strive to increase wages, strive to improve the quality of life for people in that company, they do lose their cost advantage over time.
Now they've gained in productivity. So I don't think it's that, it's going to switch. I don't think it's going to be cheaper to build in other parts of the world. But I don't think China is ever going to go back to being the super low-cost producer that it once was. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, right? We see China also moving to create more high-value materials, more things in China to meet the growing demand of the population in China. So I just don't think they'll always be the huge low-cost exporter that they once were. But we've seen many economies go through that, right? And so who knows what the next economy will be. But they're still the second largest economy in the world, so there's no doubt China will remain a very important part of the world's balance, and certainly the chemical and polymer world balance in terms of where things come from."

Lori talked about catalysts. Catalysts usage of these disadvantaged technologies is higher than what ours is. So we're seeing the cost increase. They're seeing the cost increase at a greater rate. And so that should hopefully -- and that's kind of why we've signaled strength as we work our way into 2022 is we do think that there is some changes here that we do believe are sustainable when -- then you layer on the fact that supply/demand utilizations are getting into the 90% range."

The things really driving the lower level of tow margins is acetic acid pricing, is natural gas pricing.

So if we look at natural gas, I mean, obviously, natural gas is an issue in the U.S., where we purchased about 55 million BTUs annually. But it's also a real issue in Europe, where we don't necessarily purchase much natural gas directly, but we certainly see it as a factor in many of our raw material costs as well as a factor in our steam and other things that we purchase from others. And so it has been a significant factor this year, a third quarter -- a step-up from second quarter. In fourth quarter, we do expect to see another, call it, 25% increase in the U.S. at a nearly doubling of natural gas prices in the EU. So this will be a significant factor for us in the fourth quarter.
Now with the surcharges, with other things, we do expect we'll be able to recover some of that. I think the -- we will see, for example, in EM, another $20 million increase. With the surcharge, we're recovering some, but it means we're probably just going to be flat to third quarter to fourth quarter. Not every contract can we put a surcharge on. Not every molecule will have a surcharge. Some contracts are fixed for a short period of time. So we won't be able to recover everything, but we do think we'll be able to basically mitigate the impact of the increase from third quarter to fourth quarter.
If we stay in the winter months, next year, we'd expect first quarter to be kind of the same level of pricing we see in the fourth quarter. But again, we have been able to pass more of those costs on. So we should see a bit of help as we move into next year as it comes to the impact of natural gas pricing on our overall margins."

I mean glass fiber demand has surged and the ability of the providers to respond to that, especially post freeze, is just -- it's just hard to get them back on and get the production up. So I don't really see probably an improvement in glass fiber in the fourth quarter. We do expect to start seeing some improvement next year.
Similarly, flame retardants, I mean that one's a little even more complicated because pretty much all of the yellow phosphorus that's used to make flame retardants comes out of Hunan province in China, which was curtailed as part of the energy curtailments in Q3 and will probably be impacted in the fourth quarter. So that situation is not going to get better probably again this year. Hopefully, will get better next year. But there -- right now, it's just a single source of this raw material and it happens to be in China. So we need a bit more time to understand what the energy curtailments are going to mean going forward to really know when that issue is going to resolve itself.
And resins, I would say, are mostly resolved at this point in time. I don't expect resin availability to be as much of an issue in the fourth quarter and certainly not as we move into next year."

Now that said, we look at everything with a lot of discipline, and we look at it through the lens that we laid out at Investor Day. So we look at -- we really focus on, can we achieve synergies with it? What do we think is our unique ability to get value creation from it? So is it something that we can provide our business model, our project pipelines, our growth models too, all of those criterias, where do we think it is in the value chain. We look at -- but we look at everything. We choose very few things to pursue. And so maybe I just stop at that.
What I will say, though, is we think we have a lot of managerial and financial bandwidth in order to complete transactions of any size or multiple transactions of a smaller size. So at the time of the Investor Day, we said we outlined about a $6 billion of -- having $6 billion available on our balance sheet in order to do M&A. I will tell you, even with the expected close of Santoprene here in December, we still think we have about $6 billion available to us on our balance sheet because of our higher earnings that we've had this year and what that's meant in terms of cash generation and where our balance sheet is at.
So I mean, assume we look at everything, assume we continue to look at it through the criteria we laid out at Investor Day, and know that we have a very large pot of money ready to go when we find the right opportunity, and we have a management team that's ready to both negotiate and integrate."

So even in the U.S., we've seen almost a doubling of nat gas costs from, say, last year to this year -- to the current price this year.
But if you think about CO, if you think about methanol, I mean, in the U.S., these are all natural gas derivatives. So there is a kind of direct correlation to raw material feedstock. Having natural gas, though, for acetyls from an energy standpoint, like -- this is very small because actually acetic acid, it's exothermic, it's heat integrated with others downstream. So not -- kind of the inverse of what you think. It is a big deal for raw materials. We tend to be able to pass that through, not such a big deal in terms of direct cost of energy in our U.S. operations.
In Europe, again, more EM exposure. Most EM tends to be lower energy intensity, so I think compounding really doesn't require much energy. But something like POM requires a lot of energy. So you think about POM, right? You have to heat it. You have to crystallize it. You have to dry it. That takes a lot of energy. So there, we really do see the direct impact of natural gas, which has almost doubled from third quarter to what we expect in the fourth quarter and is kind of 4x what it was in the third quarter -- or in the second quarter. There, you see a very direct relationship and one that's a little harder to pass through because it really has to do with steam costs and electricity costs and all those sort of things."

Look, I think in response to your first question, not just for acetyls but for EM, we continue to look at our ability to pull forward all of our projects, because my margins are high in acetyls and we believe that, that structural demand is there. Similarly in EM, we can sell everything we can make right now. So -- and we expect that to continue as the desire for high-quality, unique products like we make continues to grow.
So we actually look at -- we constantly have been looking at how do we pull all of these up. The limitations are really the actual time it just takes to do a project between permitting, which unfortunately, has been slowed down in most parts of the world because of COVID, all the way to just the ability to get raw materials, and we talked a little bit about steel, about concrete, everything. There's so much demand right now for construction projects that we're finding it difficult to pull our projects up in a meaningful way. But we'll continue to look at that, and we'll continue to update you as we move through the year.
And then on your second question, what I would say is for most of the high-value products that we produce in EM, customers just want the product. I mean we've had 3 consecutive quarters of price increases in EM kind of the first time in our history. And what we find is that is not impacting the desire by customers to take products.
So I think in the inflationary environment we're all experiencing on everything, people understand. They may not like it, but they understand why we're having to push through these price increases to cover raw materials and energy and have -- again, have not seen any loss of volume due to pricing.
I would say the same thing really in asset and downstream Acetyl Chain derivatives. The demand for construction projects -- products and packaging and all these things that acetyls go into is only increasing and even at the higher prices. I mean people maybe have been a bit slower to refill inventory at these prices, but there's no material anyway available to refill inventory. So again, we've not -- our customers would take more at these prices if we could produce more. We'll just leave it at that."
