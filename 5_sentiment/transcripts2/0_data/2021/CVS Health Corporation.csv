He set a bold path for CVS Health, changed the health care industry in this country. Larry did an incredible job bringing together our unique assets and establishing the foundation for our future. 
Our transformation over the last decade has enabled us to become the nation's leading diversified health services company. As one of the most trusted brands in America, our presence in communities across the country allows us to meet consumers where they are and become a bigger part of their everyday house. Our unparalleled capabilities reach and relationship with over 100 million people uniquely positions us to support them for every meaningful moment of health throughout their lifetime. These are unprecedented times, and our purpose to help people on their path to better health has never been more important. CVS colleagues are on the front lines every day helping millions of Americans with COVID testing and vaccines, in home and virtual care services and face-to-face care in our CVS locations. We understand our responsibility to support our customers, members and communities during these difficult times, and we are delivering. I am proud of the nearly 300,000 colleagues on the CVS Health team and all that we've achieved in this past year. 
Turning to performance. Our strong results in 2020 show that both our strategy and business model are working. We exceeded our earnings commitments while delivering 6% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth. We grew rev 4.5% to achieve adjusted revenues of $268 billion. We delivered continued strong growth in our PBM and Government services business, once again, achieving solid results in Medicare Advantage. We generated strong cash flow from operations of nearly $16 billion as we continue to delever while investing in our business for future growth. We served a prominent role in supporting our customers, providers and communities during one of the biggest public health crisis in our nation's history. We continue to progress against our strategic road map. And we set 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of $7.39 to $7.55, with mid- single-digit growth from our baseline. Eva will go into much more detail about our performance and our outlook. 
Turning to our 3 business segments. We delivered strong results in 2020 in the Health Care Benefits segment. We grew total revenue by 8% for the year with increases in our government businesses, partially offset by declines in our commercial business. In the fourth quarter, we saw utilization of total health care services in the aggregate, returned to more near-normal seasonal levels as higher COVID-related costs were partially offset by somewhat lower levels of traditional services. Adjusted operating income was in line with expectations. 
As we head into 2021, we demonstrated growth within each of our Medicare product lines in January. Overall, we are on track for another very strong year of Medicare growth. For years, we've used our voice to advocate for policies, programs and regulations at the local state and national levels that support access to affordable care for all Americans. After careful consideration, we have decided to reenter the individual public exchange market as of January 1, 2022. As the ACA has evolved, there is evidence of market stabilization and remedies to earlier issues. It is now time for us to participate in these markets. We will show that we can bring great value to those who seek coverage. You can expect to hear more about our exchange reentry plans and future updates. 
Turning to our PBM. Our Pharmacy Services segment has been resilient through the pandemic. We demonstrated the value we bring to our customers and our members. We achieved strong retention rates and positive momentum in winning new business in 2021. And finally, in our retail long-term care segment, we continue to advance our clinical programs, which improved medication adherence and health outcomes. We increased the level of engagement with our loyalty and subscription customers, and we also achieved high customer satisfaction results. 
During the last year, we delivered new market solutions, and we strengthened our role as a personal and trusted health care partner in response to COVID 19. We pivoted and rapidly innovated to meet customer needs for COVID testing in the community. 
We also advanced our digital capabilities to create a seamless experience across CVS health touch points. Today, we remain the largest community testing organization in the U.S. We've administered approximately 15 million tests at our more than 4,800 testing locations nationwide. Over 50% of these tests have been administered in communities with significant need for support according to the CDC Social Vulnerability Index. 
Additionally, we launched our return ready solution to help employers and universities as they execute their return to work and school strategies. To date, 100 clients have enrolled, representing over 1.5 million individuals with interest continuing to grow. Such leadership enabled us to establish new relationships with approximately 8 million consumers through our COVID testing efforts. These are people who are new to CVSL. 
Turning to vaccines. We've been working with the federal government on vaccine distribution readiness for several months. We were selected as 1 of the partners for vaccine administration and long-term care facilities. We've administered more than 3 million vaccine doses to the patients and staff in over 40,000 long-term care facilities across the country. We completed the first doses of vaccine administration in all skilled nursing facilities and we'll complete the second doses by the end of the month as planned. We are on track to complete both doses of vaccine administration for assisted living facilities by mid-March. This will fulfill our commitment to administer vaccines and long-term care facilities. 
We've also been selected as one of the national partners for the Federal pharmacy partnership program. This is the linchpin of the Biden administration's plan to vaccinate 300 million Americans by the end of the summer. 
As part of this program, we are administering approximately 250,000 COVID immunizations across 11 states and in over 350 CVs locations each week. Early feedback from customers has been very positive on their overall experience across both our in person and digital channels. We will continue to add stores as the vaccine supply increases. 
With the commitment and hard work of our employees, we have the capacity to administer 20 million to 25 million doses per month depending on supply availability. Millions of new customers will engage with CVS Health for the first time through testing and vaccine administration services. We will use this opportunity to shape a health experience that demonstrates the value we bring. It will create the opportunity to expand our customer base while deepening relationships with current customers. 
We have made measurable and important progress with our strategy as a health services company that utilizes all our assets that integrates them for a superior consumer experience. And firmly addresses the total cost of care. For example, we are creating health platforms that combine local points of care, remote biometric monitoring and access to health care professionals, all within a personalized consumer-centric model. Our new diabetes program is an example of this. We have approximately 1.4 million members in this new program, with about 50% representing integrated Caremark-Aetna plan members. 
We've had strong reception to our fully integrated plan, the Aetna connected plan. And expect to add 15 markets in 2021. Key features include $0 co-pays at MinuteClinic locations, standard formulary and use of our Coram infusion services. 
We deepened our pharmacy penetration in the Health Care Benefits segment through increased cross-sell of medical and pharmacy plans. This is expected to result in approximately $350 million in incremental revenue in 2021. 
We are bringing dialysis services into the home to better manage chronic kidney disease. This program offers a simpler, more patient-centered approach. It delays the onset of end-stage renal disease, reduces hospital admissions and supports people with treatment options. Our kidney program will engage a targeted cohort across businesses currently available to over 7.5 million eligible members. 
And finally, our oncology program helps patients start on the best treatment and matches eligible patients to clinical trials. Our goal is to improve patient outcomes and lower overall costs at every point of the cancer care journey. Our program has expanded to more than 125 provider systems across 28 states, covering over 30% of Aetna's insured oncology population. 
As we engage consumers in addressing their most prevalent, costly and complex health conditions impacting their lives, we are also concentrating on expanding access to affordable quality care. We launched new medical benefit plans designed with low co-pay or no co-pay at MinuteClinic to offer broader access to care. We have approximately 6 million commercial and Medicare members enrolled to date. In our small group product, which was the first to adopt, we achieved 25% greater use of MinuteClinics, and CVS pharmacy retail scripts increased from 30% to 65%. And this continues to strongly demonstrate the value of bringing CVSs assets together to support across their health care needs. 
We continue to expand access through our integrated care delivery approach. We ended 2020 with just over 650 HealthHUBs nationwide, including locations in underserved communities. HealthHUBs are one of many channels we have to engage with consumers for their health that also complement the traditional health care system. 
We continue to expand our virtual care capabilities. We launched our e-clinic service and our MinuteClinic across 33 states and in the district of Columbia. Consumers are now able to interact with nurse practitioners for comprehensive virtual care in a convenient way. Through this offering, we can help customers with both episodic care and provide a longitudinal integrated care experience. We launched our virtual first primary care program, members engage with providers virtually. They are then directed to lower cost, high-quality sites of care, such as MinuteClinic or other face-to-face in-network provider care settings as needed. We are delivering value by creating a superior system that is centered around the consumer, where they want and need health care. 
In closing, we are starting 2021 with strong momentum. We are accelerating our pace of progress to drive our consumer-centric strategy, a strategy built upon the fundamental belief that solving consumer health needs will create value for all, our customers, our communities, our people and our shareholders. We will further develop and refine our strategy to leverage the rapid shift in health care underway in the U.S., trends that we are not only on top of, but in many places, thriving. 
As we move forward with this work, the touchstones of our strategy will remain focused in the following areas: we will demonstrate the integrated value of CVS Health's unique portfolio of products and assets. We will enhance the consumer experience through the expansion of digital services and platforms that seamlessly connect to in person channels. We will expand our portfolio with new, innovative consumer-oriented solutions that improve health, lower medical costs while creating better health outcomes. We will continue to build a high-performing organization that is passionate about our purpose that reflects the diverse populations we serve and is empowered to do the right thing, the right way for consumers' health and well-being. I am confident in our future and our ability to help people on their path to better help. CVS Health will lower costs, improve customer experience, enhance access and be their trusted health care partner. 
Now I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Eva Boratto."
93625,703009055,2212125,"CVS Health Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2021",2021-02-16,"Earnings Calls","CVS Health Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. As Karen stated, our strong performance across the enterprise continued in the fourth quarter as we executed on our strategy during this challenging time. For the full year, we delivered $7.50 adjusted earnings p",1863,"Thanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. As Karen stated, our strong performance across the enterprise continued in the fourth quarter as we executed on our strategy during this challenging time. For the full year, we delivered $7.50 adjusted earnings per share, and importantly, achieved over $900 million of integration synergies, above the high end of our expectations. We've hit the T21 run rate and the synergies are fully embedded in the business. 
During the quarter, we generated $3.6 billion of cash from operations bringing our full year to $15.9 billion, which is above the high end of our expectations, and we paid down $2.5 billion of net debt in the quarter exiting the year at a low 4x leverage ratio. Since the close of the Aetna transaction, we have paid down more than $12.2 billion in net debt and remain on track with our low 3x leverage ratio goal in 2022. We maintained our dividend, while we also invested in our enterprise to support our colleagues and customers during the pandemic and to accelerate future growth. 
Looking at our fourth quarter results by segment, our Health Care Benefits segment's total adjusted revenues increased 9.6% year-over-year driven by membership growth in our government products and the reinstatement of the HIF. Adjusted revenues exclude the ACA risk order payment received during the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income was $153 million, in line with our expectations, largely reflecting the planned COVID-19-related investments benefiting customers, testing and treatment costs and the divestitures of the Aetna PDP and our workers' comp business. 
Total membership increased about 140,000 sequentially, with Medicaid membership of about 90,000 as states continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by suspending eligibility redeterminations. 
Additionally, our Medicare portfolio continues to show growth with strong Medicare Advantage and med sub membership growth, increasing sequentially about 90,000, up over 2%. These increases were partially offset by a modest sequential decrease in commercial membership of about 35,000 members driven by additional membership attrition due to COVID-19. 
Our adjusted MBR for the quarter, excluding the ACA payment, was 88.3% and in line with our expectations, representing an increase of 260 basis points compared to the prior year. The higher MBR was driven by COVID-19-related investments, testing and treatment costs, the divestiture of the PDP business, partially offset by the reinstatement of the HIF. 
Overall, fourth quarter utilization was generally in line with our baseline, including higher COVID-19-related costs. 
Days claims payable were 48 days for Q4 2020, consistent with our Q4 '19 and a day lower than Q3 2020, largely driven by pharmacy payments. We remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. 
Moving to Pharmacy services. Total revenues declined approximately 2% versus last year primarily driven by the previously disclosed client losses and continued price compression. The decline in revenue was partially offset by growth in Specialty Pharmacy, of approximately 4% and brand drug price inflation. 
Total pharmacy claims grew 0.7% in Q4 compared to last year driven by net new business. Momentum in pharmacy services continues, with adjusted operating income increasing 7.9% compared to the fourth quarter last year. Improvements in purchasing economics and the ongoing benefit to our clients and CVS Health from several generic launches and our continued success with customers in managing specialty pharmacy continues to fuel the growth. The quarter also reflected higher investments to support our successful 2021 welcome season. 
And finally, retail long-term care total revenues grew 6.6% year-over-year driven by a 2% increase in prescription volume, including strong flu immunizations as well as benefits from our diagnostic testing and brand inflation, partially offset by a 1.6% decline in front store sales. Our COVID-19 diagnostic testing program contributed nearly $400 million in the quarter. Prescription growth was driven in part by continued adoption of our patient care programs. Offsetting the growth was lower incidence of flu and flu-like illness, which reduced flu-related scripts nearly 40% and affected cough and cold sales in the front store by approximately 30%. 
Gross margins for the segment declined 140 basis points versus 2019 driven by continued reimbursement pressure and mix, partially offset by testing. Adjusted operating income declined 12.6% year-over-year, reflecting the items I have discussed as well as costs related to COVID-19. 
Moving to other items on the income statement. We incurred lower interest expense as a result of our continued debt pay down, and the adjusted tax rate was higher in Q4 compared to Q4 '19 primarily due to the return of the HIF. 
Transitioning to 2021 guidance. Full year adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.39 to $7.55, an increase of approximately 4% to 6% from our 2020 baseline of about $7.11 and in line with our mid- single-digit growth expectation. 
Consistent with our practice, net realized capital gains or losses and prior year's development are excluded from our outlook. We expect to generate between $12 billion and $12.5 billion of cash flow from operations in 2021. This includes the impact of timing of certain payables and receivables that contributed to our 2020 outperformance. Our gross capital expenditure expectations of $2.7 billion to $3 billion is above historical levels as we expand our investments in technology and digital, enhancing our app and systems workflow, and we continue to invest in our health hubs. 
As noted over the course of 2020, there were positive and negative impacts from COVID-19, many that offset across our segments, stemming from changes in consumer behavior. We are pleased with our ability to pivot, to deliver the products and services in demand to drive continued growth at our enterprise as we create a better way to deliver health care. 
In 2021, COVID-19 is expected to have an immaterial impact on our adjusted earnings per share. As we have highlighted in our slides, COVID-19 is expected to have a benefit to the retail long-term care segment and have an unfavorable temporal impact to the Health Care Benefits segment. 
Importantly, we will continue to drive our enterprise cost savings initiatives, which we expect to deliver between $900 million and $1.1 billion and will ramp as we move throughout the year. 
Key drivers of savings include ongoing digitization of our businesses along with system technology improvements in our operations, such as our call centers; real estate changes including our decision to reduce office space by about 30%, resulting from COVID-19 and workforce management changes and how we are working; as well as productivity and operational efficiency initiatives within each segment. We expect consolidated full year adjusted operating income to be in the range of $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion with consolidated total revenues in the range of $276.1 billion to $280.6 billion, up 3% to 4.5%. We are maintaining our shareholder dividend of $2 per share. 
Moving on to our segments. As a result of continued strength in Medicare products, we expect HCB total revenues to be in the range of $79.4 billion to $80.7 billion. Medical membership is expected to be between 23.2 million and 23.6 million medical members at the end of 2021, fueled by growth in each of our Medicare lines of business. 
Partially offsetting the growth in Medicare is the transition of 2 large Medicaid contracts. Our guidance includes an expectation that state redeterminations do not return in 2021. We believe the strength of our unmatched benefit plan designs that utilize our enterprise assets positions us well for 2021 and beyond. 
Within health care benefits, we expect adjusted operating income in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. Our outlook reflects the negative impact of COVID-19 of approximately $450 million to $550 million, largely attributable to the Medicare risk adjuster impacts and the recent regulatory changes from the consolidated appropriations act. The removal of the HIF insurance fee, which we expect to decrease 2021 adjusted operating income by approximately $175 million and strong growth in Medicare membership. 
Our full year MBR is expected to be approximately 84.7%, plus or minus 60 basis points, which reflects the return to more normal levels of utilization, the removal of the HIF, lower risk-adjusted revenue and mix shifts in our business. 
In Pharmacy Services, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $144.5 billion to $147 billion driven by strong net new business of $3.3 billion, continued growth in specialty pharmacy and brand drug inflation in the mid single-digit range. 
The 2021 selling season is largely complete and we maintained a strong 98% retention rate with gross wins of $4.9 billion. Adjusted operating income is expected to be within the range of $6 billion to $6.1 billion,driven by continued growth in specialty and our ability to drive further improvements to purchasing economics, partially offset by industry-wide price compression. 
Turning to Retail/Long-term Care. We expect revenue of $93.8 billion to $95.1 billion. We expect strong adjusted script growth in the range of 7.25 to 9.25 driven by the continued successful execution of our patient care programs, expected return of provider visits and COVID-19 vaccinations. We expect front store traffic will increase as we move throughout the year. 
We expect adjusted operating income to be in the range of $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion, benefiting from continued pharmacy volume growth and approximately [ $400 million to $500 million ] from COVID-19. The benefit from COVID-19 reflects the positive impact of vaccines and testing-related revenues, net costs associated with these programs, partially offset by the adverse impacts of front store and pharmacy, and our continued investments in COVID-19-related protocols. Operating income growth also continues to be unfavorably affected by reimbursement pressure. 
Moving to other income statement items. We expect interest expense of about $2.6 billion, benefiting from the pay down of our debt and our liability management actions, and our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 25% and reflecting the repeal of the HIF. 
Finally, we expect quarterly earnings cadence to be fluid over the course of the year, but let me share some perspectives on Q1. Q1 is expected to be the lowest earnings quarter for the year. In Retail/Long-term Care, lower traffic in the front store and lower script volume has persisted into January in part due to the weaker flu season. Q1 is also impacted by investments to advance our vaccine program. Health care benefits is expected to have higher earnings in the first half of the year and the lowest in the fourth quarter. Cost savings initiatives across our segments are expected to ramp over the course of the year. 
In summary, we continue to deliver on our financial expectations and are confident in our ability to achieve the 2021 guidance we outlined today. We are making progress toward driving sustainable long-term growth. As Karen mentioned, we are accelerating aspects of our consumer-focused strategy to meet the consumers' health needs of the future.

We expect diagnostic testing will continue. As you think about it as vaccines ramp up, the testing will ramp down. And normal returns in the front store as we move toward the second half of the year. Reimbursement pressure is an offset to that. It continued at consistent levels as we've seen in the past as well as our cost reduction initiatives. Overall, I think about gross margins as flattish, given the mix change in the business, particularly as you think about the COVID-19 vaccination and the revenues not reflecting the product cost owning the administrative fee."

He set a bold path for CVS Health to change the health care industry in this country. Larry did an incredible job bringing together our unique assets and establishing the foundation for our future.  
Our transformation over the last decade has enabled us to become the nation's leading diversified health services company. As one of the most trusted brands in America, our presence in communities across the country allows us to meet consumers where they are and become a bigger part of their everyday health. Our unparalleled capabilities, reach and relationship with over 100 million people uniquely positions us to support them for every meaningful moment of health throughout their lifetime. 
These are unprecedented times, and our purpose to help people on their path to better health has never been more important. CVS colleagues are on the front lines every day helping millions of Americans with COVID testing and vaccines, in-home and virtual care services and face-to-face care in our CVS locations. We understand our responsibility to support our customers, members and communities during these difficult times, and we are delivering. I am proud of the nearly 300,000 colleagues on the CVS Health team and all that we've achieved in this past year.
Turning to performance. Our strong results in 2020 show that both our strategy and business model are working. We exceeded our earnings commitments while delivering 6% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth. We grew revenue growth 4.5% to achieve adjusted revenues of $268 billion. We delivered continued strong growth in our PBM and Government Services business, once again achieving solid results in Medicare Advantage. We generated strong cash flow from operations of nearly $16 billion as we continue to delever while investing in our business for future growth. We served a prominent role in supporting our customers, providers and communities during one of the biggest public health crisis in our nation's history. We continue to progress against our strategic road map, and we set 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of $7.39 to $7.55, with mid-single-digit growth from our baseline. Eva will go into much more detail about our performance and our outlook. 
Turning to our 3 business segments. We delivered strong results in 2020 in the Health Care Benefits segment. We grew total revenue by 8% for the year with increases in our Government businesses, partially offset by declines in our commercial business. In the fourth quarter, we saw utilization of total health care services in the aggregate return to more near-normal seasonal levels as higher COVID-related costs were partially offset by somewhat lower levels of traditional services. Adjusted operating income was in line with expectations. As we head into 2021, we demonstrated growth within each of our Medicare product lines in January. Overall, we are on track for another very strong year of Medicare growth. 
For years, we've used our voice to advocate for policies, programs and regulations at the local, state and national levels that support access to affordable care for all Americans. After careful consideration, we have decided to reenter the individual public exchange market as of January 1, 2022. As the ACA has evolved, there is evidence of market stabilization and remedies to earlier issues. It is now time for us to participate in these markets. We will show that we can bring great value to those who seek coverage. You can expect to hear more about our exchange reentry plans in future updates.  
Turning to our PBM. Our Pharmacy Services segment has been resilient through the pandemic. We demonstrated the value we bring to our customers and our members. We achieved strong retention rates and positive momentum in winning new business in 2021. 
And finally, in our Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we continue to advance our clinical programs which improved medication adherence and health outcomes. We increased the level of engagement with our loyalty and subscription customers, and we also achieved high customer satisfaction results. 
During the last year, we delivered new market solutions, and we strengthened our role as a personal and trusted health care partner in response to COVID 19. We pivoted and rapidly innovated to meet customer needs for COVID testing in the community. We also advanced our digital capabilities to create a seamless experience across CVS Health touch points. Today, we remain the largest community testing organization in the U.S. We've administered approximately 15 million tests at our more than 4,800 testing locations nationwide. Over 50% of these tests have been administered in communities with significant need for support according to the CDC Social Vulnerability Index. 
Additionally, we launched our Return Ready solution to help employers and universities as they execute their return to work and school strategies. To date, 100 clients have enrolled, representing over 1.5 million individuals with interest continuing to grow. Such leadership enabled us to establish new relationships with approximately 8 million consumers through our COVID testing efforts. These are people who are new to CVS Health. 
Turning to vaccines. We've been working with the federal government on vaccine distribution readiness for several months. We were selected as 1 of the partners for vaccine administration and long-term care facilities. We've administered more than 3 million vaccine doses to the patients and staff in over 40,000 long-term care facilities across the country. We completed the first doses of vaccine administration in all skilled nursing facilities and we'll complete the second doses by the end of the month as planned. We are on track to complete both doses of vaccine administration for assisted living facilities by mid-March. This will fulfill our commitment to administer vaccines in long-term care facilities. 
We've also been selected as one of the national partners for the federal Pharmacy Partnership program. This is the linchpin of the Biden administration's plan to vaccinate 300 million Americans by the end of the summer. As part of this program, we are administering approximately 250,000 COVID immunizations across 11 states and in over 350 CVS locations each week. Early feedback from customers has been very positive on their overall experience across both our in-person and digital channels. We will continue to add stores as the vaccine supply increases. With the commitment and hard work of our employees, we have the capacity to administer 20 million to 25 million doses per month depending on supply availability. 
Millions of new customers will engage with CVS Health for the first time through testing and vaccine administration services. We will use this opportunity to shape a health experience that demonstrates the value we bring. It will create the opportunity to expand our customer base while deepening relationships with current customers. 
We have made measurable and important progress with our strategy as a health services company that utilizes all our assets, that integrates them for a superior consumer experience and firmly addresses the total cost of care. For example, we are creating health platforms that combine local points of care, remote biometric monitoring and access to health care professionals, all within a personalized consumer-centric model. 
Our new diabetes program is an example of this. We have approximately 1.4 million members in this new program, with about 50% representing integrated Caremark-Aetna plan members. We've had strong reception to our fully integrated plan, the Aetna Connected Plan, and expect to add 15 markets in 2021. Key features include $0 co-pays at MinuteClinic locations, standard formulary and use of our Coram infusion services. 
We deepened our pharmacy penetration in the Health Care Benefits segment through increased cross-sell of medical and pharmacy plans. This is expected to result in approximately $350 million in incremental revenue in 2021. 
We are bringing dialysis services into the home to better manage chronic kidney disease. This program offers a simpler, more patient-centered approach. It delays the onset of end-stage renal disease, reduces hospital admissions and supports people with treatment options. Our kidney program will engage a targeted cohort across businesses currently available to over 7.5 million eligible members. 
And finally, our oncology program helps patients start on the best treatment and matches eligible patients to clinical trials. Our goal is to improve patient outcomes and lower overall costs at every point of the cancer care journey. Our program has expanded to more than 125 provider systems across 28 states, covering over 30% of Aetna's insured oncology population. 
As we engage consumers in addressing their most prevalent, costly and complex health conditions impacting their lives, we are also concentrating on expanding access to affordable, quality care. We launched new medical benefit plans designed with low co-pay or no co-pay at MinuteClinics to offer broader access to care. We have approximately 6 million commercial and Medicare members enrolled to date. In our small group product, which was the first to adopt, we achieved 25% greater use of MinuteClinics, and CVS Pharmacy retail scripts increased from 30% to 65%. This continues to strongly demonstrate the value of bringing CVS assets together to support across their health care needs. 
We continue to expand access through our integrated care delivery approach. We ended 2020 with just over 650 HealthHUBs nationwide, including locations in underserved communities. HealthHUBs are one of many channels we have to engage with consumers for their health, that also complement the traditional health care system. 
We continue to expand our virtual care capabilities. We launched our e-clinic service in our MinuteClinic across 33 states and in the district of Columbia. Consumers are now able to interact with nurse practitioners for comprehensive virtual care in a convenient way. Through this offering, we can help customers with both episodic care and provide a longitudinal integrated care experience. 
We launched our virtual-first primary care program. Members engage with providers virtually. They are then directed to lower-cost, high-quality sites of care, such as MinuteClinic, or other face-to-face in-network provider care settings as needed. We are delivering value by creating a superior system that is centered around the consumer, where they want and need health care. 
In closing, we are starting 2021 with strong momentum. We are accelerating our pace of progress to drive our consumer-centric strategy, a strategy built upon the fundamental belief that solving consumer health needs will create value for all: Our customers, our communities, our people and our shareholders. 
We will further develop and refine our strategy to leverage the rapid shift in health care underway in the U.S., trends that we are not only on top of, but in many places, driving. As we move forward with this work, the touchstones of our strategy will remain focused in the following areas. We will demonstrate the integrated value of CVS Health's unique portfolio of products and assets. We will enhance the consumer experience through the expansion of digital services and platforms that seamlessly connect to in-person channels. We will expand our portfolio with new, innovative consumer-oriented solutions that improve health, lower medical costs while creating better health outcomes. We will continue to build a high-performing organization that is passionate about our purpose that reflects the diverse populations we serve and is empowered to do the right thing the right way for consumers' health and well-being. 
I am confident in our future and our ability to help people on their path to better help. CVS Health will lower costs, improve customer experience, enhance access and be their trusted health care partner.  
Now I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Eva Boratto."

As Karen stated, our strong performance across the enterprise continued in the fourth quarter as we executed on our strategy during this challenging time. For the full year, we delivered $7.50 adjusted earnings p",1854,"Thanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. As Karen stated, our strong performance across the enterprise continued in the fourth quarter as we executed on our strategy during this challenging time. For the full year, we delivered $7.50 adjusted earnings per share, and importantly, achieved over $900 million of integration synergies, above the high end of our expectations. We've hit the 2021 run rate and the synergies are fully embedded in the business. 
During the quarter, we generated $3.6 billion of cash from operations, bringing our full year to $15.9 billion, which is above the high end of our expectations. And we paid down $2.5 billion of net debt in the quarter, exiting the year at a low 4x leverage ratio. Since the close of the Aetna transaction, we have paid down more than $12.2 billion in net debt and remain on track with our low 3x leverage ratio goal in 2022. We maintained our dividend while we also invested in our enterprise to support our colleagues and customers during the pandemic and to accelerate future growth. 
Looking at our fourth quarter results by segment. Our Health Care Benefits segment's total adjusted revenues increased 9.6% year-over-year driven by membership growth in our government products and the reinstatement of the HIF. Adjusted revenues exclude the ACA risk corridor payment received during the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income was $153 million, in line with our expectations, largely reflecting the planned COVID-19-related investments benefiting customers, testing and treatment costs and the divestitures of the Aetna PDP and our Workers Comp business. 
Total membership increased about 140,000 sequentially, with Medicaid membership of about 90,000 as states continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by suspending eligibility redeterminations. Additionally, our Medicare portfolio continues to show growth with strong Medicare Advantage and MedSup membership growth increasing sequentially about 90,000, up over 2%. These increases were partially offset by a modest sequential decrease in commercial membership of about 35,000 members driven by additional membership attrition due to COVID-19. 
Our adjusted MBR for the quarter, excluding the ACA payment, was 88.3% and in line with our expectations, representing an increase of 260 basis points compared to the prior year. The higher MBR was driven by COVID-19-related investments, testing and treatment costs, the divestiture of the PDP business, partially offset by the reinstatement of the HIF. Overall, fourth quarter utilization was generally in line with our baseline, including higher COVID-19-related costs. Days claims payable were 48 days for Q4 2020, consistent with our Q4 '19 and a day lower than Q3 2020, largely driven by pharmacy payments. We remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. 
Moving to Pharmacy Services. Total revenues declined approximately 2% versus last year primarily driven by the previously disclosed client losses and continued price compression. The decline in revenue was partially offset by growth in specialty pharmacy of approximately 4% and brand drug price inflation. Total pharmacy claims grew 0.7% in Q4 compared to last year driven by net new business. 
Momentum in Pharmacy Services continues, with adjusted operating income increasing 7.9% compared to the fourth quarter last year. Improvements in purchasing economics and the ongoing benefit to our clients and CVS Health from several generic launches and our continued success with customers in managing specialty pharmacy continues to fuel the growth. The quarter also reflected higher investments to support our successful 2021 welcome season. 
And finally, Retail/Long-Term Care total revenues grew 6.6% year-over-year driven by a 2% increase in prescription volume, including strong flu immunizations as well as benefits from our diagnostic testing and brand inflation, partially offset by a 1.6% decline in front store sales. Our COVID-19 diagnostic testing program contributed nearly $400 million in the quarter. Prescription growth was driven in part by continued adoption of our patient care programs. Offsetting the growth was lower incidence of flu and flu-like illness, which reduced flu-related scripts nearly 40% and affected cough and cold sales in the front store by approximately 30%. Gross margins for the segment declined 140 basis points versus 2019 driven by continued reimbursement pressure and mix, partially offset by testing. Adjusted operating income declined 12.6% year-over-year, reflecting the items I have discussed as well as costs related to COVID-19. 
Moving to other items on the income statement. We incurred lower interest expense as a result of our continued debt paydown. And the adjusted tax rate was higher in Q4 compared to Q4 '19 primarily due to the return of the HIF. 
Transitioning to 2021 guidance. Full year adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.39 to $7.55, an increase of approximately 4% to 6% from our 2020 baseline of about $7.11 and in line with our mid-single-digit growth expectation. Consistent with our practice, net realized capital gains or losses and prior year's development are excluded from our outlook. 
We expect to generate between $12 billion and $12.5 billion of cash flow from operations in 2021. This includes the impact of timing of certain payables and receivables that contributed to our 2020 outperformance. Our gross capital expenditure expectations of $2.7 billion to $3 billion is above historical levels as we expand our investments in technology and digital, enhancing our app and systems workflow, and we continue to invest in our HealthHUBs. 
As noted over the course of 2020, there were positive and negative impacts from COVID-19, many that offset across our segments, stemming from changes in consumer behavior. We are pleased with our ability to pivot, to deliver the products and services in demand to drive continued growth at our enterprise as we create a better way to deliver health care. In 2021, COVID-19 is expected to have an immaterial impact on our adjusted earnings per share. As we have highlighted in our slides, COVID-19 is expected to have a benefit to the Retail/Long-Term Care segment and have an unfavorable temporal impact to the Health Care Benefits segment. 
Importantly, we will continue to drive our enterprise cost savings initiatives, which we expect to deliver between $900 million and $1.1 billion and will ramp as we move throughout the year. Key drivers of savings include: Ongoing digitization of our businesses along with system technology improvements in our operations, such as our call centers; real estate changes, including our decision to reduce office space by about 30% resulting from COVID-19 and workforce management changes in how we are working; as well as productivity and operational efficiency initiatives within each segment. We expect consolidated full year adjusted operating income to be in the range of $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion with consolidated total revenues in the range of $276.1 billion to $280.6 billion, up 3% to 4.5%. We are maintaining our shareholder dividend of $2 per share. 
Moving on to our segments. As a result of continued strength in Medicare products, we expect HCB total revenues to be in the range of $79.4 billion to $80.7 billion. Medical membership is expected to be between 23.2 million and 23.6 million medical members at the end of 2021, fueled by growth in each of our Medicare lines of business. Partially offsetting the growth in Medicare is the transition of 2 large Medicaid contracts. Our guidance includes an expectation that state redeterminations do not return in 2021. We believe the strength of our unmatched benefit plan designs that utilize our enterprise assets positions us well for 2021 and beyond. 
Within Health Care Benefits, we expect adjusted operating income in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. Our outlook reflects the negative impact of COVID-19 of approximately $450 million to $550 million, largely attributable to the Medicare risk adjuster impacts and the recent regulatory changes from the Consolidated Appropriations Act; the removal of the HIF insurance fee, which we expect to decrease 2021 adjusted operating income by approximately $175 million; and strong growth in Medicare membership. Our full year MBR is expected to be approximately 84.7%, plus or minus 60 basis points, which reflects the return to more normal levels of utilization, the removal of the HIF, lower risk-adjusted revenue and mix shifts in our business. 
In Pharmacy Services, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $144.5 billion to $147 billion driven by strong net new business of $3.3 billion, continued growth in specialty pharmacy and brand drug inflation in the mid single-digit range. The 2021 selling season is largely complete and we maintained a strong 98% retention rate with gross wins of $4.9 billion. Adjusted operating income is expected to be within the range of $6 billion to $6.1 billion, driven by continued growth in specialty and our ability to drive further improvements to purchasing economics, partially offset by industry-wide price compression. 
Turning to Retail/Long-term Care. We expect revenue of $93.8 billion to $95.1 billion. We expect strong adjusted script growth in the range of 7.25% to 9.25% driven by the continued successful execution of our patient care programs, expected return of provider visits and COVID-19 vaccinations. We expect front store traffic will increase as we move throughout the year. We expect adjusted operating income to be in the range of $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion, benefiting from continued pharmacy volume growth and approximately $400 million to $500 million from COVID-19. The benefit from COVID-19 reflects the positive impact of vaccines and testing-related revenues, net cost associated with these programs, partially offset by the adverse impacts of front store and pharmacy, and our continued investments in COVID-19-related protocols. Operating income growth also continues to be unfavorably affected by reimbursement pressure. 
Moving to other income statement items. We expect interest expense of about $2.6 billion, benefiting from the paydown of our debt and our liability management actions. And our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 25%, reflecting the repeal of the HIF. 
Finally, we expect quarterly earnings cadence to be fluid over the course of the year, but let me share some perspectives on Q1. Q1 is expected to be the lowest earnings quarter for the year. In Retail/Long-term Care, lower traffic in the front store and lower script volume has persisted into January in part due to the weaker flu season. Q1 is also impacted by investments to advance our vaccine program. Health Care Benefits is expected to have higher earnings in the first half of the year and the lowest in the fourth quarter. Cost savings initiatives across our segments are expected to ramp over the course of the year. 
In summary, we continue to deliver on our financial expectations and are confident in our ability to achieve the 2021 guidance we outlined today. We are making progress toward driving sustainable long-term growth. As Karen mentioned, we are accelerating aspects of our consumer-focused strategy to meet the consumers' health needs of the future. 
Before opening it up for questions, I would like to take a moment to thank Valerie for her work here in Investor Relations. I'm disappointed to see Valerie leave over the next month, but I'm grateful for the advancements that Valerie made during the time she was with CVS Health. I wish Valerie the best of luck in her next venture.

Obviously, it's fluidly, so it will depend on supply availability and the selection of  CVS Health. But as Karen said, we're ready to do 20 million to 25 million per month. 
As you think about the profitability of the vaccine, Lisa, I would say, for the vaccinations that we'll administer in our stores, the EBIT contribution's similar to a flu vaccination. And as we work through long-term care, the profit contribution from that program is pretty de minimis as it was a complex process requiring multiple visits to the site and with lower individuals there to vaccinate. Overall, the costs were higher. So I would think about that as de minimis."

I would also tell you that we have spent a lot of time this year reaching out to our members to close gaps in care. So we have been very specifically targeting individuals that have diabetes, pregnant moms. So that we are reaching out to them so that we were connecting them virtually, that we were connecting them to services so that we could not sort of have that acuity occur over the long periods of time. Obviously, we probably didn't catch everyone. But if there's a huge pent-up demand, that could have an impact. But I think the system will constrain it, obviously."

We are trying to make the seamless connection across the consumer experience.

We did a thorough kind of review of our technology and decided to accelerate in a few areas. And it is all about improving the customer experience while reducing costs. So I'll highlight a couple of examples for you. 
First, we're deploying Intelligent Agents across our call centers. And we utilize technology at the outset for our COVID vaccine scheduling. And what we've been able to see is the deployment of this technology took 70% to 80% of the calls out of our stores and the call center. So real meaningful impact in a very short period of time. 
Another area that we're really focused on is how we utilize machine learning for greater personalization across all aspects of our business to increase the returns there.

In what continues to be an unprecedented environment, CVS has delivered strong first quarter results. For all of us, the past year has been defined by the pandemic. and our response to it. In the first quarter, CVS Health orchestrated an all-out effort to vaccinate Americans against COVID-19. I am proud to say we have helped achieve the President's accelerated 100-day goal of 200 million vaccines. This would not have been possible without the dedication and effort of our approximately 300,000 colleagues who worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic and delivered when they were needed the most. 
Our results show we are providing superior value by creating an integrated health care model that is centered around the consumer. Our unparalleled capabilities, reach and relationship with customers uniquely positions us to support them throughout their lifetime. 
Our strong first quarter delivered revenue growth of 3.5%. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $2.04, up nearly 7% versus first quarter of 2020. As a result, today, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $7.56 to $7.68 to reflect the momentum across our business. 
Importantly, our performance reflects both growth in new and current markets. Eva will provide more details on our outlook and our results. 
Before turning to our 3 business segments, I'd like to underscore our ability to anticipate, deliver and exceed customers' health care expectations. Today, we will share where we are seeing momentum and highlight several important achievements. It is clear that consumers want convenience, transparency, choice and control over their health care. That is why we are engaging consumers in new and different ways by working to meet their health needs in the community, in the home and virtually. 
Each of our businesses performed at or better than our expectations this quarter. 
We delivered strong results in the Health Care Benefits segment, fueled by continued growth in Government Services. During the first quarter, utilization approached near normal baseline levels. We have continued momentum in our Government Services business. We increased membership across all Medicare business lines in the first quarter. We outperformed with dual eligible members, delivering over 30% growth. And we significantly expanded our reach, adding 14 new states. 
Finally, as we announced last quarter, we will reenter the public exchanges in 2022. We expect to enter up to 8 states where we believe we can make a meaningful impact and maximize returns with our first ever Aetna-CVS branded offerings. We are committed to helping provide access to affordable care for all Americans. 
We also achieved strong revenue and operating income growth in Pharmacy Services, building on the foundation of our specialty management capabilities and overall service excellence. As we announced last week, we delivered market-leading results in controlling drug costs for commercial clients with only a 2.9% overall drug trend, with 34% of clients experiencing negative trend in 2020. 
Specialty Pharmacy revenue was up 7.2% year-over-year. This reflects new net wins due to our success in our trend management programs, which continued to resonate in the marketplace and drive more customers into our channels. Specialty Pharmacy spend management also remains a steady growth engine and key differentiator in the market. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2022. 
Our Retail segment continues to play a vital role in the delivery care and wellness, is an integral part of our customer and community strategy. Since we began, we successfully administered over 23 million COVID tests and over 17 million vaccines through April. We are currently administering vaccines in 49 states and the more than 8,300 CVS locations. 1/3 of vaccinations have been administered to members of underrepresented communities. 
Our strong second dose compliance of over 90% is the result of our consumer-centric digital approach. We schedule round trip visits, looking both appointments at once. And we also provide appointments for second doses only. 
We are successfully driving health services engagement among customers who are new to CVS Health through COVID testing and vaccines. This has helped somewhat offset the impact of a weak flu, cough and cold season. Although early, we have seen improvement in April, as vaccinated customers are more actively shopping in CVS location part of a nationwide trend. 
For those customers that are new to us through COVID testing, we have realized about a 9% conversion in filling a new prescription at CVS Pharmacy. We continue to attract consumers to our CarePass subscription program, with approximately 4.5 million members in total, up approximately 18% from 2020. 
Building on the success of our employer and university program, we recently expanded our Return Ready offering to include vaccinations. We have already administered 40,000 doses, and client interest in this new service is strong and growing. 
Overall, we have successfully navigated through a challenging retail environment while capturing additional benefits from new customers we are bringing into CVS Health. 
As the nation's leading diversified health services company, we're advancing our technology and using CVS Health assets to connect consumers across the health care ecosystem. We're addressing the most prevalent, costly and complex health conditions by expanding our platform to deliver more integrated care. Our approach combines both face-to-face and virtual points of care that are personalized to the individual. We prioritize the most valuable interventions, the next best action a member can take, that will lead to a positive impact on their health and on medical costs. For example, early results in our Transform Diabetes program show an 8% improvement in changing Medicare members behaviors. This program is on track to exceed its projected medical cost savings and return on investment of 2 to 1. With approximately 1.5 million members having access to this program today, we expect to add an additional 1.3 million members this year. 
Our new medical benefit plans are designed with low co-pay or no co-pay at MinuteClinic. We have approximately 7 million Aetna members enrolled, up from about 2 million members or 350% member growth year-over-year. These plans offer broad access to affordable and convenient care with many CVS Health assets. First quarter results show Aetna commercial members are substantially more likely to use a MinuteClinic when enrolled in this type of plan compared to those without the benefit. In fact, these members are approximately 50% more likely to visit a MinuteClinic for an acute medical need, immunization or COVID test. We also expanded our HealthHUB offerings to include new services around behavioral health, an increasingly important component of care, especially during the pandemic. 
Our strategy is to deliver a single integrated experience that connects individuals to a CVS care team, virtually and face-to-face, by navigating consumers to the best site of care. 
We are a company focused on delivering the most convenient connected experiences for our customers across our CVS Health digital assets. Our ability to redefine the health experience in an increasingly digital and hybrid world, combined with our vast health assets and understanding of consumers' health, uniquely positions us for growth. 
There are 3 areas where I want to specifically highlight some of our achievements in the last quarter. They include: using our digital assets to expand engagement with our members; expanding into new services and offerings; and leveraging digital capabilities to enhance the customer experience and improve our cost structure. 
Starting with engagement. We saw a more than 80% increase in visits to our flagship digital properties year-over-year. Growth was primarily driven by engagement in our expanded set of digital health services, such as COVID testing, vaccinations and omnichannel pharmacy. 
Next, we are expanding access to care through our digital and virtual channels. We launched a digital-first primary care model that helps consumers navigate the best site of care for their health needs. 
And lastly, we are also harnessing technology such as AI, machine learning services and natural language processing to simplify our process and optimize our cost structure. We recently announced the launch of our CVS Health Ventures fund that gives us insight into new digital health innovations. This approach allows us to invest in and partner with high-potential early-stage companies to drive technology-enabled innovation and digital health care. 
Rising to meet the challenge of COVID-19 has advanced the transformation of the health care industry. For CVS Health, the chance to serve our nation at such a critical time has further proven the value of our strategy. We have made significant progress in the expansion of our vaccine and diagnostics businesses. We are focused on building broader capabilities in home health, virtual care and health services. Our investments in these areas as well as our digital transformation have allowed us to be there for every meaningful moment of health and will enable us to capture the lifetime value of each of our customers. 
And finally, we are exploring every avenue for growth and increased returns. Accordingly, we will hold our 2021 Investor Day on December 9, hopefully, in New York, conditions permitting, where the management team and I will more fully outline our longer-term strategic priorities and our financial road map for sustainable, profitable growth. 
In closing, our results this quarter show that our strong brand and national presence is allowing us to meet individuals where they are. It makes us an increasingly integral part of their everyday health. 
Now I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Eva Boratto."
93625,711984200,2268032,"CVS Health Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","CVS Health Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. As Karen stated, our strong performance across the enterprise continued in the first quarter. We delivered solid revenue growth of 3.5%, as a result of strong net new business, plus the expansion of our success",1384,"Thanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. 
As Karen stated, our strong performance across the enterprise continued in the first quarter. We delivered solid revenue growth of 3.5%, as a result of strong net new business, plus the expansion of our successful COVID-19 testing and vaccine programs. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.04 increased 6.8% and exceeded our expectations. Our cash flows remain strong, generating $2.9 billion of cash from operations. We paid down over $3 billion of long-term debt in the quarter, while returning $656 million to shareholders through dividends. Since the close of the Aetna transaction, we have paid down a net of more than $15 billion in long-term debt, and we remain on track with our low 3x leverage goal in 2022. 
We are maintaining our discipline of capital allocation strategy and managing our balance sheet to generate additional cash flows. Across the company, we are executing on our modernization and cost savings initiatives, for which technology is at the core. As mentioned last quarter, we implemented an AI-enabled capability to efficiently address COVID-related calls. This intelligent agent addressed over 8 million calls for frequently asked questions. And we are expanding this technology to call centers across the enterprise. We are also using AI and other technologies to simplify our prior authorization processes. We are decreasing the workload on providers and shortening the time it takes to get patients on appropriate therapy. This improves the overall patient experience while maintaining the clinical rigor, quality improvements and safety programs that are vital to our clients. We have taken advantage of the increasing virtualization of work to rethink our infrastructure and are on track to close 63 non-retail facilities, resulting in a 2.5 million square foot reduction in office space by the end of Q2. We're pleased with our progress to date on these initiatives, and significant opportunity remains. 
Now let's take a look at our results by segment. 
Our Health Care Benefits segment total revenues increased 6.7% year-over-year, driven by continued growth in our Government Services business. The repeal of the HIF and Medicare risk-adjusted revenue pressured that result. Total membership increased about 215,000 sequentially, with Medicaid membership up about 100,000 or 4%, driven by the continued suspension of eligibility redetermination and the new business win of Kentucky Foster's program effective January 1. 
Our Medicare portfolio continues to grow, with Medicare Advantage and Med Sup membership increasing sequentially about 230,000, up over 6%. Within our PDP, membership increased nearly 4% sequentially. Converting existing commercial and PDP members to Medicare Advantage is one of our core growth strategies in Government Services. 
Included in these results are a sequential decline in commercial membership of about 120,000 members, driven by continued in-group attrition as well as the successful conversion of commercial to Medicare Advantage. 
Our MBR for the quarter of 83.2% represents an increase of 80 basis points compared to prior year. While medical costs in the quarter were generally consistent with historical baseline levels in aggregate, the MBR was negatively impacted by the repeal of the HIF by approximately 140 basis points and lower Medicare risk-adjusted revenue. Offsetting these factors were the benefits from improved performance in Medicaid, which was pressured in Q1 of 2020, and prior year's development. Of note, given the lower MBRs in 2020, portions of the prior year's development will be returned to clients and plan sponsors for contractual and regulatory requirements. 
Bringing these factors together, along with the impact of our cost reduction initiatives, adjusted operating income was $1.8 billion, up 19.5% year-over-year. 
We are increasing our Health Care Benefits segment full year adjusted operating income guidance to $5.25 billion to $5.35 billion as a result of our performance to date and our current assumptions, including the extension of sequestration. Our guidance includes our best estimate of medical costs for the remainder of the year, with medical costs modestly elevated. This assumes non-COVID utilization returning towards normal baseline levels and continuing COVID costs, largely related to testing and the administration of the vaccine. 
Now I'll move on to Pharmacy Services. 
Total revenues increased nearly 4% versus last year, primarily driven by net new business wins, specialty pharmacy growth and product mix. Brand drug price inflation of mid-single digits was in line with our expectations. Revenue continues to be negatively affected by price compression, as well as the weak cough, cold and flu season, which affected claims growth by approximately 230 basis points. We are through just over 65% of renewals for the 2022 selling season, with strong retention, including the retention of the retail and mail contracts with FEP and the return of FEP for specialty. 
Adjusted operating income in Pharmacy Services increased 27.7% compared to the first quarter last year. This growth was fueled by improvements in purchasing economics, the ongoing benefits to our clients and CVS Health from the ramp of several specialty generic launches and our specialty trend management programs, which continue to drive value in the marketplace. 
We are increasing our adjusted operating income guidance to $6.15 billion to $6.25 billion to reflect our performance to date and trends in the business, partially offset by the required investments to prepare to onboard the FEP specialty business in 2022. 
And now let's review Retail/Long-Term Care. 
Before I get into the components of the P&L, let me start by discussing the effects of the weak cough, cold and flu season, which led to script and front store declines of approximately 300 basis points and 425 basis points, respectively. Overall, it drove about 40% of the adjusted operating income decline for the quarter. 
Moving on to the P&L. Total revenues grew 2.3%, with scripts essentially flat year-over-year. COVID diagnostic testing and vaccine administration were accretive. The year-over-year revenue comparison includes the headwind from the acceleration of prescriptions and front store demand in March of 2020 as we served our customers and members at the start of the pandemic. During the quarter, we continued to gain share with an increase of 42 basis points. Gross margins in the segment declined 30 basis points versus Q1 of 2020, driven by continued reimbursement pressure, mix of front and pharmacy revenues, partially offset by COVID-19 testing. Adjusted operating income declined 26.7% year-over-year, reflecting the items I have discussed as well as costs related to COVID-19 testing and long-term care vaccination program and severe weather-related costs in Q1 of 2021. 
At this time, we are not changing our Retail/Long-Term Care segment guidance, as the benefit from the higher COVID-19 vaccine administration fee is offset by a slower than anticipated return of front store traffic and many unknowns such as urban market recovery and vaccine hesitancy. 
Bringing all of the pieces together, we are increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $7.56 to $7.68, up from our prior guidance of $7.39 to $7.55. 
Consistent with our prior guidance, COVID-19 is expected to have a minimal impact on consolidated financial results for the year. 
You can see further details of our changes in the slide presentation we posted to our website. 
We continue to expect strong cash from operations between $12 billion and $12.5 billion. And our gross capital expenditure expectations remain at $2.7 billion to $3 billion to fund organic growth initiatives. We continue to expand our investments in technology and digital as we work on creating a seamless omnichannel consumer experience, bringing health care services to meet consumers' needs at the most appropriate time and place. 
Our enterprise cost savings initiatives are on track to generate $900 million to $1.1 billion, and these savings are expected to ramp as we move throughout the year. 
Consistent with what we spoke about in February, we continue to expect our earnings cadence to be somewhat fluid over the course of the year. Based on our current estimates, which includes COVID-19 vaccines more heavily weighted to the front half of the year, we expect approximately 54% of our annual earnings per share in the front half. 
In summary, we continue to meet the needs of our clients and consumers. This allows us to generate substantial cash, to deliver on our financial commitments, to invest in our company and to return value to shareholders. We've executed against our growth commitments and are well positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth.

Then there, successfully executing against programs that take advantage of the generics that launched late last year were also critically important, right? So we were able to drive generic dispensing rates to levels that we -- a little bit higher than I think we initially thought. And that both benefits us as well as our clients. Those are the principal drivers of the economics within specialty. And then as Karen and Eva mentioned in their remarks, continuing to drive outstanding specialty trend is what allows customers to continue to choose us to manage their specialty spend as FEP did. So again, it becomes a self-reinforcing cycle."

What we've done is we have put licensed clinical social workers in a certain number of our HealthHUBs. And what we are trying to do is really connect the physical health with the mental health. In every single MinuteClinic, we do behavioral health screenings. They then will be referred to our licensed clinical worker that is in the facility in the HealthHUB. And then we can connect with them digitally as well through our e-clinic capabilities. And we are actually seeing very strong results in this program. We're seeing 3 visits in a month from those individuals that have already engaged with us. So clearly, there's a need to make those connections. It is a differentiator for us and something that I believe is important as you think about mental health and physical health combining to take care of the holistic person and then meeting them where they want to be met.

So whether it's our home dialysis program, which is in process, our quorum or new virtual care products that support specific populations, that's how we're thinking about home. But it's about meeting the customer need or the member need first rather than focusing especially on the channel and how do we integrate across all of the touch points we have, whether they're digital, virtual, physical in the home or local."

In what continues to be an unprecedented environment, CVS Health has delivered strong first quarter results. For all of us, the past year has been defined by the pandemic and our response to it. In the first quarter, CVS Health orchestrated an all-out effort to vaccinate Americans against COVID-19. I am proud to say we have helped achieve the President's accelerated 100-day goal of 200 million vaccines. This would not have been possible without the dedication and effort of our approximately 300,000 colleagues who worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic and delivered when they were needed the most.
Our results show we are providing superior value by creating an integrated health care model that is centered around the consumer. Our unparalleled capabilities, reach and relationship with customers uniquely positions us to support them throughout their lifetime.
Our strong first quarter delivered revenue growth of 3.5%. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $2.04, up nearly 7% versus first quarter of 2020. As a result, today, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $7.56 to $7.68 to reflect the momentum across our business. Importantly, our performance reflects both growth in new and current markets. Eva will provide more details on our outlook and our results.
Before turning to our 3 business segments, I'd like to underscore our ability to anticipate, deliver and exceed customers' health care expectations. Today, we will share where we are seeing momentum and highlight several important achievements. It is clear that consumers want convenience, transparency, choice and control over their health care. That is why we are engaging consumers in new and different ways by working to meet their health needs in the community, in the home and virtually.
Each of our businesses performed at or better than our expectations this quarter. We delivered strong results in the Health Care Benefits segment, fueled by continued growth in Government Services. During the first quarter, utilization approached near normal baseline levels. We have continued momentum in our Government Services business. We increased membership across all Medicare business lines in the first quarter. We outperformed with dual eligible members, delivering over 30% growth. And we significantly expanded our reach, adding 14 new states.
Finally, as we announced last quarter, we will reenter the public exchanges in 2022. We expect to enter up to 8 states where we believe we can make a meaningful impact and maximize returns with our first ever Aetna-CVS branded offerings. We are committed to helping provide access to affordable care for all Americans.
We also achieved strong revenue and operating income growth in Pharmacy Services, building on the foundation of our specialty management capabilities and overall service excellence. As we announced last week, we delivered market-leading results in controlling drug costs for commercial clients with only a 2.9% overall drug trend, with 34% of clients experiencing negative trend in 2020.
Specialty pharmacy revenue was up 7.2% year-over-year. This reflects new net wins due to our success in our trend management programs, which continued to resonate in the marketplace and drive more customers into our channels. Specialty pharmacy spend management also remains a steady growth engine and key differentiator in the market. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2022.
Our Retail segment continues to play a vital role in the delivery care and wellness, is an integral part of our customer and community strategy. Since we began, we successfully administered over 23 million COVID tests and over 17 million vaccines through April. We are currently administering vaccines in 49 states and in more than 8,300 CVS locations. 1/3 of vaccinations have been administered to members of underrepresented communities.
Our strong second dose compliance of over 90% is the result of our consumer-centric digital approach. We schedule round trip visits, booking both appointments at once. And we also provide appointments for second doses only. We are successfully driving health services engagement among customers who are new to CVS Health through COVID testing and vaccines. This has helped somewhat offset the impact of a weak flu, cough and cold season. Although early, we have seen improvement in April, as vaccinated customers are more actively shopping in CVS locations, part of a nationwide trend.
For those customers that are new to us through COVID testing, we have realized about a 9% conversion in filling a new prescription at CVS Pharmacy. We continue to attract consumers to our CarePass subscription program, with approximately 4.5 million members in total, up approximately 18% from 2020.
Building on the success of our employer and university program, we recently expanded our Return Ready offering to include vaccinations. We have already administered 40,000 doses, and client interest in this new service is strong and growing. Overall, we have successfully navigated through a challenging retail environment while capturing additional benefits from new customers we are bringing into CVS Health.
As the nation's leading diversified health services company, we're advancing our technology and using CVS Health assets to connect consumers across the health care ecosystem. We're addressing the most prevalent, costly and complex health conditions by expanding our platform to deliver more integrated care. Our approach combines both face-to-face and virtual points of care that are personalized to the individual. We prioritize the most valuable interventions, the next best action a member can take, that will lead to a positive impact on their health and on medical costs.
For example, early results in our Transform Diabetes program show an 8% improvement in changing Medicare members' behaviors. This program is on track to exceed its projected medical cost savings and return on investment of 2 to 1. With approximately 1.5 million members having access to this program today, we expect to add an additional 1.3 million members this year.
Our new medical benefit plans are designed with low co-pay or no co-pay at MinuteClinics. We have approximately 7 million Aetna members enrolled, up from about 2 million members or 350% member growth year-over-year. These plans offer broad access to affordable and convenient care with many CVS Health assets. First quarter results show Aetna commercial members are substantially more likely to use a MinuteClinic when enrolled in this type of plan compared to those without the benefit. In fact, these members are approximately 50% more likely to visit a MinuteClinic for an acute medical need, immunization or COVID test.
We also expanded our HealthHUB offerings to include new services around behavioral health, an increasingly important component of care, especially during the pandemic. Our strategy is to deliver a single integrated experience that connects individuals to a CVS care team, virtually and face-to-face, by navigating consumers to the best site of care.
We are a company focused on delivering the most convenient, connected experiences for our customers across our CVS Health digital assets. Our ability to redefine the health experience in an increasingly digital and hybrid world, combined with our vast health assets and understanding of consumers' health, uniquely positions us for growth.
There are 3 areas where I want to specifically highlight some of our achievements in the last quarter. They include: using our digital assets to expand engagement with our members; expanding into new services and offerings; and leveraging digital capabilities to enhance the customer experience and improve our cost structure.
Starting with engagement. We saw a more than 80% increase in visits to our flagship digital properties year-over-year. Growth was primarily driven by engagement in our expanded set of digital health services, such as COVID testing, vaccinations and omnichannel pharmacy.
Next, we are expanding access to care through our digital and virtual channels. We launched a digital-first primary care model that helps consumers navigate the best site of care for their health needs.
And lastly, we are also harnessing technology such as AI, machine learning services and natural language processing to simplify our process and optimize our cost structure. We recently announced the launch of our CVS Health venture fund that gives us insight into new digital health innovations. This approach allows us to invest in and partner with high-potential early-stage companies to drive technology-enabled innovation and digital health care.
Rising to meet the challenge of COVID-19 has advanced the transformation of the health care industry. For CVS Health, the chance to serve our nation at such a critical time has further proven the value of our strategy. We have made significant progress in the expansion of our vaccine and diagnostics businesses.
We are focused on building broader capabilities in home health, virtual care and health services. Our investments in these areas as well as our digital transformation have allowed us to be there for every meaningful moment of health and will enable us to capture the lifetime value of each of our customers.
And finally, we are exploring every avenue for growth and increased returns. Accordingly, we will hold our 2021 Investor Day on December 9, hopefully, in New York, conditions permitting, where the management team and I will more fully outline our longer-term strategic priorities and our financial road map for sustainable, profitable growth.
In closing, our results this quarter show that our strong brand and national presence is allowing us to meet individuals where they are. It makes us an increasingly integral part of their everyday health.
Now I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Eva Boratto."

As Karen stated, our strong performance across the enterprise continued in the first quarter. We delivered solid revenue growth of 3.5%, as a result of strong net new business plus the expansion of our successful COVID-19 testing and vaccine programs. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.04 increased 6.8% and exceeded our expectations.
Our cash flows remain strong, generating $2.9 billion of cash from operations. We paid down over $3 billion of long-term debt in the quarter, while returning $656 million to shareholders through dividends. Since the close of the Aetna transaction, we have paid down a net of more than $15 billion in long-term debt, and we remain on track with our low 3x leverage goal in 2022.
We are maintaining our discipline of capital allocation strategy and managing our balance sheet to generate additional cash flows. Across the company, we are executing on our modernization and cost savings initiatives, for which technology is at the core. As mentioned last quarter, we implemented an AI-enabled capability to efficiently address COVID-related calls. This intelligent agent addressed over 8 million calls for frequently asked questions. And we are expanding this technology to call centers across the enterprise.
We are also using AI and other technologies to simplify our prior authorization processes. We are decreasing the workload on providers and shortening the time it takes to get patients on appropriate therapy. This improves the overall patient experience while maintaining the clinical rigor, quality improvements and safety programs that are vital to our clients.
We have taken advantage of the increasing virtualization of work to rethink our infrastructure and are on track to close 63 non-retail facilities, resulting in a 2.5 million square foot reduction in office space by the end of Q2. We're pleased with our progress to date on these initiatives, and significant opportunity remains.
Now let's take a look at our results by segment. Our Health Care Benefits segment total revenues increased 6.7% year-over-year, driven by continued growth in our Government Services business. The repeal of the HIF and Medicare risk-adjusted revenue pressured that result. Total membership increased about 215,000 sequentially, with Medicaid membership up about 100,000 or 4%, driven by the continued suspension of eligibility redetermination and the new business win of Kentucky Foster's program effective January 1.
Our Medicare portfolio continues to grow, with Medicare Advantage and Med Supp membership increasing sequentially about 230,000, up over 6%. Within our PDP, membership increased nearly 4% sequentially. Converting existing commercial and PDP members to Medicare Advantage is one of our core growth strategies in Government Services. Included in these results are a sequential decline in commercial membership of about 120,000 members, driven by continued in-group attrition as well as the successful conversion of commercial to Medicare Advantage.
Our MBR for the quarter of 83.2% represents an increase of 80 basis points compared to prior year. While medical costs in the quarter were generally consistent with historical baseline levels in aggregate, the MBR was negatively impacted by the repeal of the HIF by approximately 140 basis points and lower Medicare risk-adjusted revenue. Offsetting these factors were the benefits from improved performance in Medicaid, which was pressured in Q1 of 2020, and prior year's development.
Of note, given the lower MBRs in 2020, portions of the prior year's development will be returned to clients and plan sponsors for contractual and regulatory requirements. Bringing these factors together, along with the impact of our cost reduction initiatives, adjusted operating income was $1.8 billion, up 19.5% year-over-year.
We are increasing our Health Care Benefits segment full year adjusted operating income guidance to $5.25 billion to $5.35 billion as a result of our performance to date and our current assumptions, including the extension of sequestration. Our guidance includes our best estimate of medical costs for the remainder of the year, with medical costs modestly elevated. This assumes non-COVID utilization returning towards normal baseline levels and continuing COVID costs, largely related to testing and the administration of the vaccine.
Now I'll move on to Pharmacy Services. Total revenues increased nearly 4% versus last year, primarily driven by net new business wins, specialty pharmacy growth and product mix. Brand drug price inflation of mid-single digits was in line with our expectations. Revenue continues to be negatively affected by price compression, as well as the weak cough, cold and flu season, which affected claims growth by approximately 230 basis points. We are through just over 65% of renewals for the 2022 selling season, with strong retention, including the retention of the retail and mail contracts with FEP and the return of FEP for specialty.
Adjusted operating income in Pharmacy Services increased 27.7% compared to the first quarter last year. This growth was fueled by improvements in purchasing economics, the ongoing benefits to our clients and CVS Health from the wrap of several specialty generic launches and our specialty trend management programs, which continue to drive value in the marketplace.
We are increasing our adjusted operating income guidance to $6.15 billion to $6.25 billion to reflect our performance to date and trends in the business, partially offset by the required investments to prepare to onboard the FEP specialty business in 2022.
And now let's review Retail/Long-Term Care. Before I get into the components of the P&L, let me start by discussing the effects of the weak cough, cold and flu season, which led to script and front store declines of approximately 300 basis points and 425 basis points, respectively. Overall, it drove about 40% of the adjusted operating income decline for the quarter.
Moving on to the P&L. Total revenues grew 2.3%, with scripts essentially flat year-over-year. COVID diagnostic testing and vaccine administration were accretive. The year-over-year revenue comparison includes the headwind from the acceleration of prescriptions and front store demand in March of 2020 as we served our customers and members at the start of the pandemic. During the quarter, we continued to gain share with an increase of 42 basis points.
Gross margins in the segment declined 30 basis points versus Q1 of 2020, driven by continued reimbursement pressure, mix of front and pharmacy revenues, partially offset by COVID-19 testing. Adjusted operating income declined 26.7% year-over-year, reflecting the items I have discussed as well as cost related to COVID-19 testing and long-term care vaccination program and severe weather-related cost in Q1 of 2021.
At this time, we are not changing our Retail/Long-Term Care segment guidance, as the benefit from the higher COVID-19 vaccine administration fee is offset by a slower than anticipated return of front store traffic and many unknowns such as urban market recovery and vaccine hesitancy.
Bringing all of the pieces together, we are increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $7.56 to $7.68, up from our prior guidance of $7.39 to $7.55. Consistent with our prior guidance, COVID-19 is expected to have a minimal impact on consolidated financial results for the year. You can see further details of our changes in the slide presentation we posted to our website.
We continue to expect strong cash from operations between $12 billion and $12.5 billion. And our gross capital expenditure expectations remain at $2.7 billion to $3 billion to fund organic growth initiatives. We continue to expand our investments in technology and digital as we work on creating a seamless omnichannel consumer experience, bringing health care services to meet consumers' needs at the most appropriate time and place. Our enterprise cost savings initiatives are on track to generate $900 million to $1.1 billion, and these savings are expected to ramp as we move throughout the year.
Consistent with what we spoke about in February, we continue to expect our earnings cadence to be somewhat fluid over the course of the year. Based on our current estimates, which includes COVID-19 vaccines more heavily weighted to the front half of the year, we expect approximately 54% of our annual earnings per share in the front half.
In summary, we continue to meet the needs of our clients and consumers. This allows us to generate substantial cash to deliver on our financial commitments, to invest in our company and to return value to shareholders. We've executed against our growth commitments and are well positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth.

So we were able to drive generic dispensing rates to levels that we -- a little bit higher than I think we initially thought. And that both benefits us as well as our clients. Those are the principal drivers of the economics within specialty. And then as Karen and Eva mentioned in their remarks, continuing to drive outstanding specialty trend is what allows customers to continue to choose us to manage their specialty spend as FEP did. So again, it becomes a self-reinforcing cycle."

The pandemic has increased the number of behavioral health interactions. And I think what we've seen in the -- with individuals, we've seen increases in substance abuse. We've seen increases in domestic violence. We've seen increases in depression and anxiety.
What we've done is we have put licensed clinical social workers in a certain number of our HealthHUBs. And what we are trying to do is really connect the physical health with the mental health. In every single MinuteClinic, we do behavioral health screenings. They then will be referred to our licensed clinical worker that is in the facility in the HealthHUB. And then we can connect with them digitally as well through our e-clinic capabilities.
And we are actually seeing very strong results in this program. We're seeing 3 visits in a month from those individuals that have already engaged with us. So clearly, there's a need to make those connections. It is a differentiator for us and something that I believe is important as you think about mental health and physical health combining to take care of the holistic person and then meeting them where they want to be met.
Quick customer story, Lisa. We had an individual reach out to us. She was trying to get into see behavioral health provider, she couldn't. And when she -- took her a month, and then after a month, they told that it would take another month for her to get an appointment. She learned about CVS Health, and we got her in the same day.

The -- I think the key drivers here are paying really close attention to creating competition, right, to driving more value for our customers, which enables us to bring on more volume. I think one of the things that we should also talk -- let's talk about 2 things, right? So first is the purchasing and the performance around generics and specialty agents. The second is, we have a good portion of our business is what we would call open market where there's choice. We're very aggressive in talking about the benefits to members and patients from an experience perspective of both Specialty Connect and Specialty Expedite.
And -- so that's, again, an example of how we use the entire enterprise to create better experiences and ultimately more value because it drives volume. So it's a combination of volume. It's a combination of attention to detail and performance on the generic side.

This was another strong quarter for CVS Health. We are playing an integral role in connecting experiences across the health care system to deliver better health outcomes. This is what truly",1719,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. This was another strong quarter for CVS Health. We are playing an integral role in connecting experiences across the health care system to deliver better health outcomes. This is what truly differentiates us and generates our growth. In the rapidly changing U.S. health care environment, we have proven that we can bring solutions at scale to meet individual health needs however they evolve. 
Our COVID-19 testing and vaccination campaigns for millions of Americans are just one example. We meet customers where they are. We are there when and how they want to access care. That is what's driving growth across our company, and it's where we'll continue to focus our innovation and investments. 
During the second quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 11%. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $2.42 and strong cash flow from operations of $5.8 billion. We are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $7.70 to $7.80. This reflects the continued positive momentum across our business with growth both in new and current markets. 
Today, we announced an important investment in our employees. We will raise the minimum wage for our colleagues to [ $15 ] an hour by July 2022. This wage increase will boost our competitive edge in a tight retail labor market. We estimate it creates an incremental $600 million in labor costs over 3 years. Approximately $125 million of that impact will be in the final 4 months of this year. 
Increasing our minimum wage for hourly employees will help attract and retain the talent needed for our customer-centric business approach. Just as critical, it aligns with our values and our purpose and builds on a history of our investment in our people. 
Each of our businesses delivered strong performance, highlighted by overall sales and earnings outperformance and sequential margin improvement. Customers realize the value we are providing across our CVS Health assets, which results in increased customer retention rates and new wins. In health care benefits, results were powered by growth in our government business. Our medical benefit ratio of 84.1% was modestly above expectations, driven by COVID-related costs. Underlying non-COVID costs emerged favorably. We continue to believe aggregate medical costs will modestly exceed baseline levels during the second half of the year. 
In addition to strong performance in our core business, we are leveraging our broad and unique portfolio of assets with our first CVS-Aetna co-branded offerings. We have submitted our exchange regulatory filings for a January 2022 entrant in 8 states outlined in our supplemental earnings materials. 
With Aetna's strong networks and CVS's significant local presence, we believe we are creating a compelling new offering that combines health insurance, pharmacy, our retail presence and behavioral health services. This is something that no one else can deliver. The 2022 national account selling season in health care benefits has been marked by a somewhat compressed industry-wide pipeline. Employers have been focused on developing strategies for vaccinations and other return to work activities. As a result, we concentrated on client retention, delivering a strong result of 97%. 
For those cases that were out to bid for 2022, we have been successful in securing new business and introducing new differentiated products. For example, our virtual first primary care product is the only nationwide program to offer long-term dedicated virtual primary care and a traditional in-person national network, including MinuteClinics and HealthHUB. 
Turning to Pharmacy Services. We outperformed expectations, delivering 9.8% revenue growth and very strong operating income growth. We continue to build momentum in specialty pharmacy with revenue up 8.9% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we have maintained an impressive 98% retention rate with more than 80% of renewals complete. We have also driven strong new business results, winning over $8 billion in new gross sales for next year. We remain well positioned for continued specialty and pharmacy growth in 2022. 
The differentiation we offer is particularly important. It reflects our integrated offering with in-store, mail order and specialty services. We added nearly 1 million new integrated pharmacy and medical members through the 2021 and 2022 selling seasons alone. This is a testament of our success in the marketplace from the aligned interest and value we bring to our customers. 
Our retail segment continues to play a crucial role as part of our community-focused strategy. We are a vital local health destination for millions of Americans who are resuming more normal activities and fueling macro improvements in the economy. Our second quarter results for retail outperformed our expectations and the market. 
In our pharmacies, we grew prescription market share to over 26%. Importantly, our customer-centric programs continue to improve adherence for our patients. At the same time, we saw a solid rebound in front store sales, which increased nearly 13% in the quarter, with strength across all categories. Nearly 2/3 of that growth was driven by health and wellness products. Similarly, pharmacy script growth in the quarter was strong, up more than 14% year-over-year, 1/3 of which is attributable to COVID vaccines. 
We now administered 30 million vaccines and 29 million tests through the inception of the program. Approximately 40% of vaccines we administered over the past 2 months were to members of underrepresented communities, a rate at or higher than the benchmark population. Our effort to make the vaccine accessible and convenient for all Americans continues. However, vaccination rates are slowing from a peak in April despite the impact of new variants. 
Our COVID work is a powerful example of the trust and relationships we are building with consumers, augmented by our local presence and digital tools. For customers introduced to us through COVID testing, approximately 12% have subsequently chosen to fill new prescriptions or get their COVID vaccine at CVS Health. This helped drive overall strong script growth in the quarter. The COVID testing outlook remains strong. As public health recommendations evolve, we are prepared and continue to play a critical role in helping Americans prevail against the pandemic. I'm grateful for the continued dedication and tireless efforts of the nearly 300,000 colleagues. 
We are making considerable progress across key drivers of our growth. The first is our role in care delivery. We continue to focus on our integrated platform to expand access to care that is local, affordable and connected. HealthHUBs represent one of many channels and lower cost sites of care that allows us to address individual health needs. Aetna commercial members in the no co-pay, low co-pay product are utilizing our MinuteClinics in our health hubs more frequently, more than twice as often as members without these benefits. 
We expanded the spectrum of health services we offer to include common services usually done in primary care settings such as chronic care management like diabetes and behavioral health, a critical area of need that will continue beyond the pandemic. We expanded our care concierge program to support our Medicare members, rolling out as planned, the HealthHUB Stars program designed to close gaps in the quality of care. Early intervention results are promising as they are demonstrating strong reach and a high engagement rate of 67% for a variety of health screenings such as diabetes and cancer. 
The second key area is technology. We are using the power of our digital capabilities to reinvent how consumers experience their care by creating choice, expanding access and reducing complexity. And we are creating new sources of value while accelerating the speed, flexibility and launch of new health solutions. Today, we regularly serve more than 35 million unique digital customers across our CVS Health assets. Our digital customers are important. Digital retail customers spend 2.5x more in our front store, manage 1.5x more scripts and remain customers longer than other pharmacy patients. And customers who engage with us digitally have lower medical costs related to personalized data insights that guide health behaviors. 
This quarter, we also saw more than 37% of specialty prescriptions initiated digitally from the 85% of our pharmacy specialty members who have opted into our digital program. Building these trusted digital relationships with customers generates new growth opportunities across all of our businesses. At the same time, we are reengineering our cost structure by simplifying operations to benefit both customers and our own colleagues. 
Our technology-driven programs are leveraging blockchain, driving cloud migration and intelligent automation and streamlining processes to accelerate results and generate greater impact. One example is a specialty pharmacy script automation program that uses AI to yield better results more quickly while eliminating more than 30 manual steps, such as benefit verification and prior authorization. 
Our commitment to shareholders, customers and communities we serve does not stop at commercial product offering. CVS Health plays an important role in the health and vitality of the communities where we live, work and serve. Our long-standing commitment to corporate social responsibility focuses on 4 areas: healthy people, healthy business, healthy communities and a healthy planet. Together, these efforts create our sustainability road map known as Transform Health 2030. 
It represents an ambitious but achievable agenda that aligns with 8 of the UN sustainable development goals. CVS Health is investing in inclusive wellness, economic development and advancement opportunities for our colleagues and our suppliers. We are also making social impact investments that will improve health outcomes nationwide, which is already making a critical difference in our pandemic work. In addition, we have set science-based targets to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 67% by 2030 from a 2014 baseline. 
I am proud of what we've achieved, but there is much more to do and I'll provide regular updates about our continued progress. In closing, CVS Health is the leading health solutions company with a broad and unique set of assets. We are accelerating our pace of progress to drive value for our customers, our communities, our people and our shareholders. Our unparalleled capabilities, reach and enduring relationship with the consumer uniquely positions us to support them throughout their lifetime, while also providing multiple avenues for sustained growth for our company. 
I'll turn now to Shawn Guertin, who recently joined CVS Health as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer in late May and has already made an impact. His deep health care expertise, financial acumen and strategic mindset will be instrumental to the successful execution of our strategy. Shawn?"

I'm very excited to be at CVS Health, particularly at such a dynamic and important time, not only for our company but for our health care system as a whole. Our differentiated portfolio of capabilities and local community presence creates a compelling competitive advantage that improves health care access and outcomes across a broad population while generating strong cash flow and value for all our stakeholders. I look forward to executing on our growth strategy and reshaping the health care experience for the people we serve. 
I'll first discuss our second quarter financial results. As Karen stated, we delivered another quarter of outperformance across each of our businesses, exceeding our expectations and further demonstrating the strength of our combined enterprise. Total revenues of $72.6 billion grew 11% year-over-year and reflected strong contributions from each of our segments. We reported adjusted operating income of $4.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $2.42. 
We continue to generate excellent cash flow in the second quarter with year-to-date cash flow from operations now exceeding $8.7 billion. Further, we have repaid $5.4 billion in debt during the first half of the year. All our cash flow metrics exceeded our internal forecast during the quarter. 
Moving to the segments. Health care benefits total revenue increased 11% year-over-year driven by our continued growth in our Government Services business, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurance fee or HIF. Our Medicare franchise continues to perform very well, with quarterly sequential membership growth across all products. Medicare Advantage membership is slightly exceeding our prior expectations and is now on track to be up 9% to 10% for the full year. Dual Special Needs Plans membership grew by double digits sequentially and has more than doubled year-over-year, reflecting our strategic focus in this business. 
Medicare supplement and prescription drug plan membership also increased in the quarter, providing a sustained strong pipeline of opportunities for future conversions to Medicare Advantage. Our midyear Medicare risk-adjusted revenue settlement was in line with our expectations. Finally, for our prescription drug plan business, we are pleased with our bid position below the 2022 low-income benchmark in all our targeted regions. 
Health Care Benefits adjusted operating income exceeded our projections for the quarter but was down materially on a year-over-year basis due to the depressed levels of utilization observed in the second quarter of 2020 at the start of the pandemic. The medical benefit ratio for the quarter of 84.1% was slightly higher than our forecast, driven by higher-than-expected COVID-related costs, which, while materially lower than the first quarter, did not fall off as much as we had forecast. 
Underlying non-COVID utilization continued its return towards normal baseline levels and was slightly favorable versus our expectations. The combined result was an MBR slightly higher than our forecast for the quarter. We remain comfortable with the adequacy of our reserves, recording a modest amount of favorable prior year development in the quarter while days claims payable of 48 is consistent with both the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Turning to Pharmacy Services. We continue to deliver exceptional value for our customers by producing industry-leading low single-digit drug trends. This value proposition allowed us to produce strong revenue growth of nearly 10% versus last year, primarily driven by network volume and specialty pharmacy growth. Total pharmacy claims process increased by more than 11% versus last year, with approximately 1/2 attributable to net new business wins from our 2021 selling season and another one quarter due to COVID vaccine administration. 
Our specialty network and Maintenance Choice business lines all delivered sequential claims growth in the quarter. Pharmacy Services adjusted operating income exceeded expectations in the second quarter, up more than $400 million or 32% year-over-year. The 3 major drivers of this increase are improved purchasing economics, reflecting the products and services of our group purchasing organization launched in the second quarter of 2020, specialty pharmacy, including our 340B claims administration business, and increased pharmacy claim volumes. These favorable items were partially tempered by ongoing client pricing pressure. 
Lastly, it's important to note that the initiation of our group purchasing organization and certain generic specialty launches in the second quarter and second half of 2020, respectively, created relatively low comparisons in the first half of 2021 that will increase significantly in the second half of the year. Therefore, we expect a much smaller incremental year-over-year improvement in operating income in the second half of this year. 
Retail also delivered strong results this quarter, exceeding expectations. Total revenue of nearly $25 billion increased by $3 billion or 14% year-over-year. This improvement is driven by 3 main components: one, approximately 1/3 or $1 billion is attributable to the nearly 17 million COVID vaccines and more than 6 million COVID tests administered during the second quarter; two, an additional 1/3 or another $1 billion is due to the broad quarantine restrictions and civil unrest experienced last year that depressed results in the second quarter of 2020; three, the final 1/3 or remaining $1 billion was driven by a combination of improved pharmacy growth and mix during the second quarter as well as broad strength in front store trends. 
Front store revenue increased by nearly 13%, while pharmacy prescription volume was up 14%, including COVID vaccines. This strong revenue growth, combined with a 340 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin, produced adjusted operating income well ahead of our forecast and an increase of nearly $1 billion year-over-year. 
COVID testing and vaccines, which were immaterial in Q2 2020, represent approximately half of the operating income increase. Second quarter 2021 results also reflect a gain from a legal settlement related to an antitrust matter worth $125 million, which is included in both our GAAP and non-GAAP results. 
Turning to cash flows and the balance sheet. Cash from operations remained strong at $5.8 billion for the quarter and $8.7 billion year-to-date. We paid down $2.4 billion of long-term debt in the quarter, while returning $650 million to shareholders through dividends. Since the close of the Aetna transaction, we have paid down a net $17.6 billion in long-term debt. Our commitment and discipline in this area was recognized during the quarter as S&P raised our credit outlook from stable to positive. 
Let me now turn to our updated guidance for 2021 and share some preliminary thoughts regarding 2022. But first, I want to provide a framework of the pandemic-related dynamics that will impact our business over the remainder of the year in the interplay between the retail segment and the Health Care Benefits segment. 
As mentioned, our retail segment benefited from strong COVID testing and vaccine administration services in the second quarter but began to see vaccines fall below expectations in May and June. As a result, we have reduced our forecast for vaccine earnings to below the midpoint of our original range for the full year. In health care benefits, given the ongoing fluidity of the current environment, we have incorporated a higher estimate of COVID-related costs in the second half of the year. As a result, our full year MBR, while still well within our range, is approximately 20 to 30 basis points higher than our previous forecast. 
Overall, we believe the combined impact of a reduced outlook for vaccines in retail and a slightly higher MBR and health care benefits now make the pandemic a modest negative for 2021. Despite this, given our strong performance in the quarter and solid outlook, we are increasing our guidance. 
We are raising full year 2021 total revenue guidance to a range of $280.7 billion to $285.2 billion, representing year-over-year adjusted revenue growth of 4.5% to 6.25%. We are also raising adjusted EPS guidance to $7.70 to $7.80 per share. The significant earnings outperformance in the second quarter is reflected in our updated full year guidance but is partially offset by 3 key headwinds during the second half of 2021. 
The first is expectations for full year COVID-19 vaccine volumes to be below the midpoint of our original guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we saw vaccinations peak in April, then begin to decline in May and June. Although the recent rise in COVID-19 cases has caused a reacceleration in first dose trend, we believe it to be prudent to adjust our full year outlook for vaccines to a range of 32 million to 36 million. This includes a limited contribution from the administration of pediatric vaccines but does not assume any contribution from booster shots. 
Overall, despite the slowdown in vaccine administration, we continue to be pleased with our expanded and strengthened customer relationships stemming from our local presence and see ongoing customer connectivity from the significant role we play in combating the pandemic in our local communities. 
The second item is the investment in wages that Karen highlighted. Our work to retain and attract talent includes an additional $600 million investment in wages over 3 years, primarily for our retail colleagues and pharmacy technicians, with approximately $125 million impacting the last 4 months of 2021. Finally, the third item is increased investments in the second half of 2021, reflecting our efforts to drive and support growth, enhance our consumer experience and improve our cost structure in 2022 and beyond. In aggregate, these 3 items are expected to negatively impact second half adjusted EPS by approximately $0.25 per share. 
In addition to increasing our EPS guidance, we are also raising our expectations for cash flow from operations by $500 million to a range of $12.5 billion to $13 billion. Our expectations for gross capital expenditures remain in a range of $2.7 billion to $3 billion to fund organic growth initiatives and our expanded investments in technology and digital. We remain committed to ongoing deleveraging and our investment-grade rating target. 
By segment, for health care benefits, we are maintaining our full year adjusted operating income guidance of $5.25 billion to $5.35 billion. As discussed, our outlook assumes a slightly higher full year MBR by 20 to 30 basis points to reflect the higher COVID costs observed in the second quarter and our expectation that slightly higher COVID costs will continue into the second half. 
Our forecast assumes that non-COVID utilization will return to normal baseline levels by the fourth quarter. This MBR pressure is largely being offset by an improved revenue outlook and operating expense management. It's also worth recalling the natural seasonality of the Health Care Benefits segment with fourth quarter operating income typically the lowest of the year. We believe that our forecast is appropriately positioned given that there remains a high degree of uncertainty in terms of how COVID will play out during the second half of the year. 
For Pharmacy Services, given the strength in the quarter and visibility to the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2021 adjusted operating income guidance to $6.45 billion to $6.55 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 13.5% to 15.25%. While we expect the factors driving second quarter performance to continue to benefit the second half of 2021 due to the timing elements I discussed earlier, we do not anticipate the same level of year-over-year growth observed in the first half of 2021. 
For retail, we are maintaining our full year 2021 segment guidance for adjusted operating income in a range of $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion. Given the dynamic environment relative to the pandemic and its impact on vaccines, testing and front store sales, we have taken what we believe to be a prudent posture in our outlook and have not fully pulled through the favorability we observed in the second quarter to the full year. This full year guidance also reflects the reduced outlook for vaccines and the impact of the wage investment, approximately 80% of which is experienced in the retail segment. You will find further details in the slide presentation we posted to our website this morning. 
Moving on to 2022. While it is premature to provide forward year guidance at this time, I want to share some preliminary thinking on some of the more visible puts and takes we are considering for 2022. Starting with tailwinds. It is reasonable to expect benefits from: one, strong selling seasons in the Pharmacy Services segment and in commercial national accounts in the Health Care Benefits segment; two, anticipated lower COVID-related costs and improved Medicare risk-adjusted revenue reimbursement in the Health Care Benefits business; and three, continued contributions from our ongoing cost savings initiatives. 
For headwinds, we anticipate: first, consistent pressure in Pharmacy Services from client price improvements and reimbursement pressure in retail, both of which are consistent industry headwinds, which we seek to mitigate through improved purchasing economics; second, the impact of annualizing the increase to minimum wage across the company; and third, uncertainty regarding the expected revenue from COVID vaccines and testing in our retail operations. Lastly, I'd remind you that our standard practice is not to include any estimates of prior year development or realized capital gains in our forward-looking guidance. On a year-to-date basis, these 2 items comprise approximately $0.15 per share. Again, this is not a comprehensive outlook for 2022 but represents some of the key items likely to influence performance next year. 
To conclude. CVS Health continues to produce strong results as we execute on our differentiated strategy putting the consumer at the center of what we do and redefining the integrated delivery of health care. I look forward to updating longer-term financial targets at our Investor Day event this December in detailing our key priorities, positioning CVS Health to deliver sustainable, long-term profitable growth and to return to a more balanced and strategic program of capital deployment.

I think I'd be careful on the specific math there because to some extent, as I mentioned, for example, about vaccines and testing revenue, there's just an uncertainty about the level of those things. And I'd also not add back the full $0.25 as an example, because the minimum wage impact and that is only for 4 months. And obviously, that will annualize next year. So there's some moving pieces sort of in there. But honestly, some of these things, I think we can see are going to be factors, but we don't have completely quantified at this point. 
But I do think when we talk about 2022, if it's worth talking about a couple of things. I would say at the outset, we remain very well positioned in our core businesses, and our operating performance is very strong as evidenced by the last couple of quarters of results. And as I mentioned in my remarks, I don't want to provide 2022 guidance today, but I do recognize that there's previous targets out there for a low double-digit earnings growth for 2022. And what I would say is, make no mistake, double-digit adjusted EPS growth remains the benchmark that we're always trying to achieve and frankly, the benchmark that we're using in considering the strategic choices that we'll make. But an awful lot has changed since 2019 when that target was out there and stated. 
And it's not just the composition of our earnings, but sort of to the point of your question, Lisa, what's the visibility that we have into how those components are going to trend forward. Again, the vaccines and testing and COVID treatment costs are just 2 good examples of factors, but the direction and the degree is a bit hard to see. So a lot of this will come down to thinking about what baseline we're measuring from and how we see these factors playing out here. But as I sit here today, if I consider a starting point of $7.70 to $7.80, I would say at this point, no, that from this forecast baseline, I wouldn't reiterate the double-digit sort of growth target for 2022. 
But again, as I mentioned, this says more about the shifting factors. It does not have anything really to do with the core performance of our business, which has been really outstanding. Obviously, we hope to talk in much more detail about 2022 at our Investor Day as well as some of the longer-term financial targets and the earnings power of the business."

So what I would say is in the HCB business, obviously, there's a lag in sort of what we see and any real time. So we don't have great insight necessarily into July.

But what I would say, there certainly has been -- I've seen a number of media reports about various facilities beginning to cancel elective procedures again. And so it does feel like there's certainly some push in the system on the deferred utilization side again, but again, premature to conclude for HCB. 
I would say, though, that what we do see on the retail side is pretty strong momentum continuing in testing, in particular. And again, while vaccines are still down in July versus the prior month, they've probably had a bit of an uptick, as I mentioned in my remarks. So I think clearly, you could reasonably infer that there's sort of the ongoing kind of COVID treatment costs are persisting, certainly into early July here. And again, thus, why we thought it made sense to be a bit more cautious in our MBR outlook for HCB."

We also have the opportunity to expand our home service and delivery. As you know, we are in Corum today. We have kidney care, but I do think that there's more expansive opportunities. It's a $100 billion-plus market that I think we have more opportunities to penetrate and really enhance our overall care delivery. 
So I would point to those 2 as ones. And then I think there's more that we can do with just the fundamental core business through integration through selling more of our products, capturing more share of wallet, driving benefit designs across to support lower sites of care like MinuteClinic and the HealthHUB. So those would be a few I would comment on. Thanks for the question, A.J."

So if I thought about the near term being sort of the rest of this year, but primarily 2022, we have $4 billion of debt or thereabouts, a little more than that maturing, and it would be our intention to continue to delever by paying that off. However, if you think about the level of our cash flows in '21, if we achieved a similar level of cash flow next year, even with the dividend, that would still leave a lot of room for other capital deployment, potentially M&A, potentially dividend increase and potentially share repurchase. 
So I think 2022 is a year where we begin to do that in a potentially more limited way but still meaningful. What I would say is longer term, as I think about this, and as you've heard me say before, my first use of that and my most preferred use of that capital all the time is to grow the business. And undoubtedly, that there are capabilities that we will need over the next few years to sort of affect our strategy as efficiently as we can. And so M&A is a part of that. But I've also found that balanced deployment of capital tends to produce sort of the best long-term results. And so that is a combination of M&A, a dividend that moves up as EPS moves up and share repurchase that's accretive to your EPS growth on sort of a steady basis."

And then the follow-up question would be to Shawn. So Shawn, when you talked about second half guidance, you mentioned investments in future growth is a headwind.

And so we do think that is a big opportunity for growth on an ongoing basis. As we think about care delivery and you think about Star's performance, the health hubs will play a critical role. But as I said, we have to have a broad expansive approach to care delivery, particularly as it relates to the Medicare patients. So the health hub will play a role. As you know, we have the $0 copay, low copay now asking -- demonstrating that we can have follow-up visits at our health hubs, but we need to expand our capabilities in the home, and we need to make sure that we're staying digitally connected to them. 
But this new program that we had just recently introduced as part of our planned rollout in the HealthHUB is really intended to close gaps in care. And the more that we close gaps in care, the better Stars performance we get, the better revenue we get. So you can see that cycle. And that really is a big opportunity for us. But I really want you to think about Medicare care delivery and a broader role with health hubs being part of that care delivery strategy. Shawn, let me turn it over to you."

So part of your question is how you feel about, in essence, '23 growth that we'll achieve in 2022. And I think broadly, there's -- I would not run rate the whole thing, but I do think there are pieces that tend to run rate forward in the business, whether they're ongoing investments we make in Medicare distribution. And as I mentioned, in staffing up for customers. So as I sit here today, I wouldn't run rate the whole thing. A lot of this is still to be determined, but there probably is a piece that kind of continues if we continue on the trajectory that we're on. 
The other element I would say about second half guidance with some of this is some of the spending gets sort of pushed back into the year, more towards the end. I think you sort of take that with the natural seasonality of the health care benefits business, and that would tend to get sort of a slope of earnings for the rest of the year where Q4 is likely less than Q3."

So when you look at the Caremark selling season and the Caremark kind of array of clients, it is a, I would say, relatively normal distribution of clients. We won, obviously, the federal Employee Program specialty, but we won in the health plan segment. We've won in the employer segment, and we're winning in the coalition segment. So across the board, we continue to win. And I think the key drivers there are: one, delivering on what is most important to our clients, which is controlling their drug trend; number two, providing kind of an outstanding level of service, so avoiding all -- not just avoiding service issues, but proactively addressing our clients' needs; and the third sort of related to the first is innovating, particularly around new programs in specialty like our oncology program, medical benefit management program. So it's really -- there isn't a specific segment that's overperforming other than specialty, obviously, because of the FEP one."

And then like Alan, with our innovative solutions, we're targeting some new capabilities for chronic disease that use the breadth of the assets of CVS like transform diabetes and transform oncology, which are resonating as well as our new access point products like our virtual primary care. And so that's really what's leading to a strong and improved national account selling season."

So I think we've been a bit cautious with that and tried to make sure that we have the capacity if things go in a different direction. This is kind of an important role that we play, even more important now without as many large-scale sites up. And so we want to make sure we have the capacity. So as you think -- the thing I think that kind of comes off of that is, as you think now about sort of vaccine volume up and down, the marginal impact, right, of those vaccines is probably greater than average. So it is something that we're paying very close attention to, but a balance."

And how should we think about that benefit for the full year net-net? And I guess the question really is how to think about what that headwind could be for next year? Like what can we anticipate are the economics of the vaccine change in your opinion? That's the first one. 
And then the second one1 is, do you think you can still get the same purchasing synergies that you're seeing this year, next year in the PBM? It sounds like you're getting massive new growth there. I'm just wondering if you can continue to see the sort of year-over-year kind of growth, which I'm guessing is driven by the purchasing synergies next year."

But what I would say is recall that some of these initiatives, as I mentioned in my comments, were launched sort of midway or in the second half of last year. So the effect we're seeing year-over-year is probably more -- is more pronounced than sort of the first half of the year than we'll see in the second half of the year. But Alan can comment on the longer-term potential. 
On the vaccine and the testing economics, as we mentioned, $1 billion of the revenue increase is attributable to those 2 things in our full year outlook. The full year revenue is probably double that. The margin dynamics are probably a little high just in this quarter just because of some of the timing issues. But to date, I don't have any insight into sort of changing reimbursement or changing kind of the labor model we're using to sort of deliver those. So I think that's as reasonable sort of the baseline to begin to work off of as we can -- as we think about next year. 
And again, I mean, as you think about the dynamics here, as you have FDA approval mandates, booster shot, there's a lot of things. And listen, you could make a bull case if you wanted to on this, certainly, with what's going on now. And I wouldn't dispute that, and I'd acknowledge that if our guidance has some upside, this could be a place depending on how things play out. The only kind of caution I would put there, though, is to think about some of the interplay of just looking at this in isolation. 
So even in sort of inside retail, if we do see an uptick and it does see increased activity, well, what does this mean for cough, cold and flu for this? What does it mean for front of store? And then obviously, the HCB ripple. So again, I'd acknowledge that there is a bull case that you could make here, but I'd also say this has changed rapidly over the last couple of months. And I'd just ask you to sort of think about it in a broader context."

So when I think about the drivers of purchasing economics on the manufacturer side and the sustainability, and the first thing I'd acknowledge is, as Shawn has said, when you launch something new, there's always going to be an outsized step-up. Having said that, I think the future viewpoint on the ability to create more competition through whether it's biosimilars and biosimilar to changeability as we saw recently through generics, particularly in the specialty area, we see that as we're at the beginning of the specialty -- the generic era, biosimilar era specialty. So I think that's sustainable and a good opportunity longer term. 
I think the growth of our value creation will grow as volume growth. So as we continue to win new business, we'll continue to grow there. And the last is we built this platform as a platform for a series of services. So we've just launched our first set of services. We think there's a number of other ones that we can continue to launch into the market within the GPO that will create meaningful value for both us and for our customers."

This was another strong quarter for CVS Health. We are playing an integral role in connecting experiences across the health care system to deliver better health outcomes. This is what tru",1712,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. 
This was another strong quarter for CVS Health. We are playing an integral role in connecting experiences across the health care system to deliver better health outcomes. This is what truly differentiates us and generates our growth. 
In the rapidly changing U.S. health care environment, we have proven that we can bring solutions at scale to meet individual health needs however they evolve. Our COVID-19 testing and vaccination campaigns for millions of Americans are just one example. We meet customers where they are. We are there when and how they want to access care. That is what's driving growth across our company, and it's where we'll continue to focus our innovation and investments.  
During the second quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 11%. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $2.42 and strong cash flow from operations of $5.8 billion. We are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $7.70 to $7.80. This reflects the continued positive momentum across our business with growth both in new and current markets.  
Today, we announced an important investment in our employees. We will raise the minimum wage for our colleagues to $15 an hour by July 2022. This wage increase will boost our competitive edge in a tight retail labor market. We estimate it creates an incremental $600 million in labor costs over 3 years. Approximately $125 million of that impact will be in the final 4 months of this year.  
Increasing our minimum wage for hourly employees will help attract and retain the talent needed for our customer-centric business approach. Just as critical, it aligns with our values and our purpose and builds on a history of our investment in our people.  
Each of our businesses delivered strong performance, highlighted by overall sales and earnings outperformance and sequential margin improvement. Customers realize the value we are providing across our CVS Health assets, which results in increased customer retention rates and new wins. In Health Care Benefits, results were powered by growth in our Government business. Our medical benefit ratio of 84.1% was modestly above expectations driven by COVID-related costs. Underlying non-COVID costs emerged favorably. We continue to believe aggregate medical costs will modestly exceed baseline levels during the second half of the year.  
In addition to strong performance in our core business, we are leveraging our broad and unique portfolio of assets with our first CVS-Aetna co-branded offerings. We have submitted our exchange regulatory filings for a January 2022 entrance in 8 states outlined in our supplemental earnings materials.  
With Aetna's strong networks and CVS's significant local presence, we believe we are creating a compelling new offering that combines health insurance, pharmacy, our retail presence and behavioral health services. This is something that no one else can deliver. 
The 2022 national account selling season in Health Care Benefits has been marked by a somewhat compressed industry-wide pipeline. Employers have been focused on developing strategies for vaccinations and other return-to-work activities. As a result, we concentrated on client retention, delivering a strong result of 97%.  
For those cases that were out to bid for 2022, we have been successful in securing new business and introducing new, differentiated products. For example, our virtual-first primary care product is the only nationwide program to offer long-term dedicated virtual primary care and a traditional in-person national network, including MinuteClinics and HealthHUBs.  
Turning to Pharmacy Services. We outperformed expectations, delivering 9.8% revenue growth and very strong operating income growth. We continue to build momentum in specialty pharmacy with revenue up 8.9% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we have maintained an impressive 98% retention rate with more than 80% of renewals complete. We have also driven strong new business results, winning over $8 billion in new gross sales for next year. We remain well positioned for continued specialty and pharmacy growth in 2022.  
The differentiation we offer is particularly important. It reflects our integrated offering with in-store, mail order and specialty services. We added nearly 1 million new integrated pharmacy and medical members through the 2021 and 2022 selling seasons alone. This is a testament of our success in the marketplace from the aligned interest and value we bring to our customers.  
Our retail segment continues to play a crucial role as part of our community-focused strategy. We are a vital local health destination for millions of Americans who are resuming more normal activities and fueling macro improvements in the economy. 
Our second quarter results for retail outperformed our expectations and the market. In our pharmacies, we grew prescription market share to over 26%. Importantly, our customer-centric programs continue to improve adherence for our patients. At the same time, we saw a solid rebound in front store sales, which increased nearly 13% in the quarter, with strength across all categories. Nearly 2/3 of that growth was driven by health and wellness products. Similarly, pharmacy script growth in the quarter was strong, up more than 14% year-over-year, 1/3 of which is attributable to COVID vaccines.  
We now administered 30 million vaccines and 29 million tests through the inception of the program. Approximately 40% of vaccines we administered over the past 2 months were to members of underrepresented communities, a rate at or higher than the benchmark population. 
Our effort to make the vaccine accessible and convenient for all Americans continues. However, vaccination rates are slowing from a peak in April despite the impact of new variants.  
Our COVID work is a powerful example of the trust and relationships we are building with consumers, augmented by our local presence and digital tools. For customers introduced to us through COVID testing, approximately 12% have subsequently chosen to fill new prescriptions or get their COVID vaccine at CVS Health. This helped drive overall strong script growth in the quarter. 
The COVID testing outlook remains strong. As public health recommendations evolve, we are prepared and continue to play a critical role in helping Americans prevail against the pandemic. I'm grateful for the continued dedication and tireless efforts of the nearly 300,000 colleagues.  
We are making considerable progress across key drivers of our growth. The first is our role in care delivery. We continue to focus on our integrated platform to expand access to care that is local, affordable and connected. HealthHUBs represent one of many channels and lower-cost sites of care that allows us to address individual health needs. Aetna Commercial members in the no copay/low copay product are utilizing our MinuteClinics in our HealthHUBs more frequently, more than twice as often as members without these benefits.  
We expanded the spectrum of health services we offer to include common services usually done in primary care settings such as chronic care management like diabetes and behavioral health, a critical area of need that will continue beyond the pandemic. We expanded our Care Concierge program to support our Medicare members, rolling out, as planned, the HealthHUB stars program designed to close gaps in the quality of care. Early intervention results are promising as they are demonstrating strong reach and a high engagement rate of 67% for a variety of health screenings such as diabetes and cancer.  
The second key area is technology. We are using the power of our digital capabilities to reinvent how consumers experience their care by creating choice, expanding access and reducing complexity. And we are creating new sources of value while accelerating the speed, flexibility and launch of new health solutions. Today, we regularly serve more than 35 million unique digital customers across our CVS Health assets.  
Our digital customers are important. Digital retail customers spend 2.5x more in our front store, manage 1.5x more scripts and remain customers longer than other pharmacy patients. And customers who engage with us digitally have lower medical costs related to personalized data insights that guide health behaviors. This quarter, we also saw more than 37% of specialty prescriptions initiated digitally from the 85% of our pharmacy specialty members who have opted into our digital program. Building these trusted digital relationships with customers generates new growth opportunities across all of our businesses. 
At the same time, we are reengineering our cost structure by simplifying operations to benefit both customers and our own colleagues. Our technology-driven programs are leveraging blockchain, driving cloud migration and intelligent automation and streamlining processes to accelerate results and generate greater impact. One example is a specialty pharmacy script automation program that uses AI to yield better results more quickly while eliminating more than 30 manual steps such as benefit verification and prior authorization.  
Our commitment to shareholders, customers and communities we serve does not stop at commercial product offering. CVS Health plays an important role in the health and vitality of the communities where we live, work and serve. Our long-standing commitment to corporate social responsibility focuses on 4 areas: healthy people, healthy business, healthy communities and a healthy planet. Together, these efforts create our sustainability road map known as Transform Health 2030. It represents an ambitious but achievable agenda that aligns with 8 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 
CVS Health is investing in inclusive wellness, economic development and advancement opportunities for our colleagues and our suppliers. We are also making social impact investments that will improve health outcomes nationwide, which is already making a critical difference in our pandemic work. In addition, we have set science-based targets to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 67% by 2030 from a 2014 baseline. I am proud of what we have achieved, but there is much more to do, and I'll provide regular updates about our continued progress. 
In closing, CVS Health is the leading health solutions company with a broad and unique set of assets. We are accelerating our pace of progress to drive value for our customers, our communities, our people and our shareholders. Our unparalleled capabilities, reach and enduring relationship with the consumer uniquely positions us to support them throughout their lifetime while also providing multiple avenues for sustained growth for our company.  
I'll turn now to Shawn Guertin, who recently joined CVS Health as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer in late May and has already made an impact. His deep health care expertise, financial acumen and strategic mindset will be instrumental to the successful execution of our strategy. Shawn?"

I'm very excited to be at CVS Health, particularly at such a dynamic and important time not only for our company but for our health care system as a whole. Our differentiated portfolio of capabilities and local community presence creates a compelling competitive advantage that improves health care access and outcomes across a broad population while generating strong cash flow and value for all our stakeholders. I look forward to executing on our growth strategy and reshaping the health care experience for the people we serve.  
I'll first discuss our second quarter financial results. As Karen stated, we delivered another quarter of outperformance across each of our businesses, exceeding our expectations and further demonstrating the strength of our combined enterprise. Total revenues of $72.6 billion grew 11% year-over-year and reflected strong contributions from each of our segments. We reported adjusted operating income of $4.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $2.42.  
We continue to generate excellent cash flow in the second quarter with year-to-date cash flow from operations now exceeding $8.7 billion. Further, we have repaid $5.4 billion in debt during the first half of the year. All our cash flow metrics exceeded our internal forecast during the quarter.  
Moving to the segments. Health Care Benefits total revenue increased 11% year-over-year driven by our continued growth in our Government Services business, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurance fee or HIF. 
Our Medicare franchise continues to perform very well with quarterly sequential membership growth across all products. Medicare Advantage membership is slightly exceeding our prior expectations and is now on track to be up 9% to 10% for the full year. 
Dual special needs plans membership grew by double digits sequentially and has more than doubled year-over-year, reflecting our strategic focus in this business. Medicare supplement and prescription drug plan membership also increased in the quarter, providing a sustained, strong pipeline of opportunities for future conversions to Medicare Advantage. 
Our midyear Medicare risk-adjusted revenue settlement was in line with our expectations. Finally, for our prescription drug plan business, we are pleased with our bid position below the 2022 low-income benchmark in all our targeted regions.  
Health Care Benefits adjusted operating income exceeded our projections for the quarter but was down materially on a year-over-year basis due to the depressed levels of utilization observed in the second quarter of 2020 at the start of the pandemic. The medical benefit ratio for the quarter of 84.1% was slightly higher than our forecast driven by higher-than-expected COVID-related costs, which, while materially lower than the first quarter, did not fall off as much as we had forecast. Underlying non-COVID utilization continued its return toward normal baseline levels and was slightly favorable versus our expectations. The combined result was an MBR slightly higher than our forecast for the quarter. 
We remain comfortable with the adequacy of our reserves, recording a modest amount of favorable prior year development in the quarter, while days claims payable of 48 is consistent with both the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of 2020.  
Turning to Pharmacy Services. We continue to deliver exceptional value for our customers by producing industry-leading low single-digit drug trends. This value proposition allowed us to produce strong revenue growth of nearly 10% versus last year primarily driven by network volume and specialty pharmacy growth. 
Total pharmacy claims process increased by more than 11% versus last year, with approximately 1/2 attributable to net new business wins from our 2021 selling season and another 1/4 due to COVID vaccine administration. Our specialty network and Maintenance Choice business lines all delivered sequential claims growth in the quarter. 
Pharmacy Services adjusted operating income exceeded expectations in the second quarter, up more than $400 million or 32% year-over-year. The 3 major drivers of this increase are: improved purchasing economics, reflecting the products and services of our group purchasing organization launched in the second quarter of 2020; specialty pharmacy, including our 340B claims administration business; and increased pharmacy claim volumes. These favorable items were partially tempered by ongoing client pricing pressure.  
Lastly, it's important to note that the initiation of our group purchasing organization and certain generic specialty launches in the second quarter and second half of 2020, respectively, created relatively low comparisons in the first half of 2021 that will increase significantly in the second half of the year. Therefore, we expect a much smaller incremental year-over-year improvement in operating income in the second half of this year.  
Retail also delivered strong results this quarter, exceeding expectations. Total revenue of nearly $25 billion increased by $3 billion or 14% year-over-year. This improvement is driven by 3 main components: one, approximately 1/3 or $1 billion is attributable to the nearly 17 million COVID vaccines and more than 6 million COVID tests administered during the second quarter; two, an additional 1/3 or another $1 billion is due to the broad quarantine restrictions and civil unrest experienced last year that depressed results in the second quarter of 2020; three, the final 1/3 or remaining $1 billion was driven by a combination of improved pharmacy growth and mix during the second quarter as well as broad strength in front store trends.  
Front store revenue increased by nearly 13%, while pharmacy prescription volume was up 14%, including COVID vaccines. This strong revenue growth, combined with a 340 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin, produced adjusted operating income well ahead of our forecast and an increase of nearly $1 billion year-over-year.  
COVID testing and vaccines, which were immaterial in Q2 2020, represent approximately half of the operating income increase. Second quarter 2021 results also reflect a gain from a legal settlement related to an antitrust matter worth $125 million, which is included in both our GAAP and non-GAAP results.  
Turning to cash flows and the balance sheet. Cash from operations remained strong at $5.8 billion for the quarter and $8.7 billion year-to-date. We paid down $2.4 billion of long-term debt in the quarter while returning $650 million to shareholders through dividends. Since the close of the Aetna transaction, we have paid down a net $17.6 billion in long-term debt. Our commitment and discipline in this area was recognized during the quarter as S&P raised our credit outlook from stable to positive.  
Let me now turn to our updated guidance for 2021 and share some preliminary thoughts regarding 2022. But first, I want to provide a framework of the pandemic-related dynamics that will impact our business over the remainder of the year in the interplay between the retail segment and the Health Care Benefits segment.  
As mentioned, our retail segment benefited from strong COVID testing and vaccine administration services in the second quarter but began to see vaccines fall below expectations in May and June. As a result, we have reduced our forecast for vaccine earnings to below the midpoint of our original range for the full year. In Health Care Benefits, given the ongoing fluidity of the current environment, we have incorporated a higher estimate of COVID-related costs in the second half of the year. As a result, our full year MBR, while still well within our range, is approximately 20 to 30 basis points higher than our previous forecast.  
Overall, we believe the combined impact of a reduced outlook for vaccines in retail and a slightly higher MBR in Health Care Benefits now make the pandemic a modest negative for 2021. Despite this, given our strong performance in the quarter and solid outlook, we are increasing our guidance.  
We are raising full year 2021 total revenue guidance to a range of $280.7 billion to $285.2 billion, representing year-over-year adjusted revenue growth of 4.5% to 6.25%. We are also raising adjusted EPS guidance to $7.70 to $7.80 per share. 
The significant earnings outperformance in the second quarter is reflected in our updated full year guidance but is partially offset by 3 key headwinds during the second half of 2021. 
The first is expectations for full year COVID-19 vaccine volumes to be below the midpoint of our original guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we saw vaccinations peak in April, then begin to decline in May and June. Although the recent rise in COVID-19 cases has caused a reacceleration in first dose trend, we believe it to be prudent to adjust our full year outlook for vaccines to a range of 32 million to 36 million. This includes a limited contribution from the administration of pediatric vaccines but does not assume any contribution from booster shots. 
Overall, despite the slowdown in vaccine administration, we continue to be pleased with our expanded and strengthened customer relationships stemming from our local presence and see ongoing customer connectivity from the significant role we play in combating the pandemic in our local communities. 
The second item is the investment in wages that Karen highlighted. Our work to retain and attract talent includes an additional $600 million investment in wages over 3 years, primarily for our retail colleagues and pharmacy technicians, with approximately $125 million impacting the last 4 months of 2021. 
Finally, the third item is increased investments in the second half of 2021, reflecting our efforts to drive and support growth, enhance our consumer experience and improve our cost structure in 2022 and beyond. 
In aggregate, these 3 items are expected to negatively impact second half adjusted EPS by approximately $0.25 per share. 
In addition to increasing our EPS guidance, we are also raising our expectations for cash flow from operations by $500 million to a range of $12.5 billion to $13 billion. Our expectations for gross capital expenditures remain in a range of $2.7 billion to $3 billion to fund organic growth initiatives and our expanded investments in technology and digital. We remain committed to ongoing deleveraging and our investment-grade rating target. 
By segment, for Health Care Benefits, we are maintaining our full year adjusted operating income guidance of $5.25 billion to $5.35 billion. As discussed, our outlook assumes a slightly higher full year MBR by 20 to 30 basis points to reflect the higher COVID costs observed in the second quarter and our expectation that slightly higher COVID costs will continue into the second half. Our forecast assumes that non-COVID utilization will return to normal baseline levels by the fourth quarter. This MBR pressure is largely being offset by an improved revenue outlook and operating expense management. 
It's also worth recalling the natural seasonality of the Health Care Benefits segment with fourth quarter operating income typically the lowest of the year. We believe that our forecast is appropriately positioned given that there remains a high degree of uncertainty in terms of how COVID will play out during the second half of the year. 
For Pharmacy Services, given the strength in the quarter and visibility to the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2021 adjusted operating income guidance to $6.45 billion to $6.55 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 13.5% to 15.25%. While we expect the factors driving second quarter performance to continue to benefit the second half of 2021, due to the timing elements I discussed earlier, we do not anticipate the same level of year-over-year growth observed in the first half of 2021. 
For retail, we are maintaining our full year 2021 segment guidance for adjusted operating income in a range of $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion. Given the dynamic environment relative to the pandemic and its impact on vaccines, testing and front store sales, we have taken what we believe to be a prudent posture in our outlook and have not fully pulled through the favorability we observed in the second quarter to the full year. This full year guidance also reflects the reduced outlook for vaccines and the impact of the wage investment, approximately 80% of which is experienced in the retail segment. You will find further details in the slide presentation we posted to our website this morning. 
Moving on to 2022. While it is premature to provide forward year guidance at this time, I want to share some preliminary thinking on some of the more visible puts and takes we are considering for 2022. 
Starting with tailwinds. It is reasonable to expect benefits from: one, strong selling seasons in the Pharmacy Services segment and in commercial national accounts in the Health Care Benefits segment; two, anticipated lower COVID-related costs and improved Medicare risk-adjusted revenue reimbursement in the Health Care Benefits business; and three, continued contributions from our ongoing cost savings initiatives. 
For headwinds, we anticipate: first, consistent pressure in Pharmacy Services from client price improvements and reimbursement pressure in retail, both of which are consistent industry headwinds, which we seek to mitigate through improved purchasing economics; second, the impact of annualizing the increase to minimum wage across the company; and third, uncertainty regarding the expected revenue from COVID vaccines and testing in our retail operations. Lastly, I'd remind you that our standard practice is not to include any estimates of prior year development or realized capital gains in our forward-looking guidance. On a year-to-date basis, these 2 items comprise approximately $0.15 per share. 
Again, this is not a comprehensive outlook for 2022 but represents some of the key items likely to influence performance next year. 
To conclude, CVS Health continues to produce strong results as we execute on our differentiated strategy, putting the consumer at the center of what we do and redefining the integrated delivery of health care. I look forward to updating longer-term financial targets at our Investor Day event this December in detailing our key priorities: positioning CVS Health to deliver sustainable, long-term profitable growth and to return to a more balanced and strategic program of capital deployment.

And I'd also not add back the full $0.25, as an example, because the minimum wage impact -- and that is only for 4 months, and obviously that will annualize next year. So there are some moving pieces sort of in there. But honestly, some of these things, I think, we can see are going to be factors, but we don't have completely quantified at this point. 
But I do think, when we talk about 2022, if it's worth talking about a couple of things, I would say at the outset we remain very well positioned in our core businesses, and our operating performance is very strong as evidenced by the last couple of quarters of results. 
And as I mentioned in my remarks, I don't want to provide 2022 guidance today, but I do recognize that there's previous targets out there for a low double-digit earnings growth for 2022. And what I would say is, make no mistake, double-digit adjusted EPS growth remains the benchmark that we're always trying to achieve and frankly the benchmark that we're using in considering the strategic choices that we'll make. But an awful lot has changed since 2019 when that target was out there and stated. 
And it's not just the composition of our earnings, but, sort of to the point of your question, Lisa, what's the visibility that we have into how those components are going to trend forward. Again, the vaccines and testing and COVID treatment costs are just 2 good examples of factors, but the direction and the degree is a bit hard to see. 
So a lot of this will come down to thinking about what baseline we're measuring from and how we see these factors playing out here. But as I sit here today, if I consider a starting point of $7.70 to $7.80, I would say at this point, no, that from this forecast baseline, I wouldn't reiterate the double-digit sort of growth target for 2022. But again, as I mentioned, this says more about the shifting factors. It does not have anything really to do with the core performance of our business, which has been really outstanding. 
Obviously, we hope to talk in much more detail about 2022 at our Investor Day as well as some of the longer-term financial targets and the earnings power of the business."

And so it does feel like there's certainly some push in the system on the deferred utilization side again. But again, premature to conclude for HCB. 
I would say, though, that what we do see on the retail side is pretty strong momentum continuing in testing in particular. And again, while vaccines are still down in July versus the prior month, they've probably had a bit of an uptick, as I mentioned in my remarks. So I think clearly, you could reasonably infer that there -- sort of the ongoing kind of COVID treatment costs are persisting certainly into early July here and, again, thus why we thought it made sense to be a bit more cautious in our MBR outlook for HCB."

It's a $100 billion-plus market that I think we have more opportunities to penetrate and really enhance our overall care delivery. So I would point to those 2 as ones. 
And then I think there's more that we can do with just the fundamental core business through integration through selling more of our products, capturing more share of wallet, driving benefit designs across to support lower sites of care like MinuteClinic and the HealthHUB. So those would be a few I would comment on. Thanks for the question, A.J."

Thanks, A.J. It's good to hear from you again as well. 
So if I thought about the near term being sort of the rest of this year but primarily 2022, we have $4 billion of debt or thereabouts, a little more than that, maturing, and it would be our intention to continue to delever by paying that off. However, if you think about the level of our cash flows in '21, if we achieved a similar level of cash flow next year even with the dividend, that would still leave a lot of room for other capital deployment, potentially M&A, potentially dividend increase and potentially share repurchase. So I think 2022 is a year where we begin to -- can begin to do that in a potentially more limited way but still meaningful. 
What I would say is longer term, as I think about this and as you've heard me say before, my first use of that and my most preferred use of that capital all the time is to grow the business. And undoubtedly, that -- there are capabilities that we will need over the next few years to sort of effect our strategy as efficiently as we can. And so M&A is a part of that. But I've always -- also found that balanced deployment of capital tends to produce sort of the best long-term results. And so that is a combination of M&A, a dividend that moves up as EPS moves up and share repurchase that's accretive to your EPS growth on sort of a steady basis."

As we think about care delivery and you think about stars performance, the HealthHUBs will play a critical role. But as I said, we have to have a broad, expansive approach to care delivery, particularly as it relates to the Medicare patients. So the HealthHUB will play a role. As you know, we have the $0 copay/low copay now asking -- demonstrating that we can have follow-up visits at our HealthHUBs, but we need to expand our capabilities in the home, and we need to make sure that we're staying digitally connected to them. 
But this new program that we had just recently introduced as part of our planned rollout in the HealthHUB is really intended to close gaps in care. And the more that we close gaps in care, the better stars performance we get, the better revenue we get. So you can see that cycle. And that really is a big opportunity for us.

So I -- to -- as I sit here today, I wouldn't run rate the whole thing. A lot of this is still to be determined, but there probably is a piece that kind of continues if we continue on the trajectory that we're on. 
The other element I'd say about second half guidance with some of this is some of the spending gets sort of pushed back into the year, more towards the end. I think you sort of take that with the natural seasonality of the Health Care Benefits business.

We won, obviously, the Federal Employee Program in specialty, but we won in the health plan segment, we've won in the employer segment, and we're winning in the coalition segment. 
So across the board, we continue to win, and I think the key drivers there are: one, delivering on what is most important to our clients, which is controlling their drug trend; number two, providing kind of an outstanding level of service, so avoiding all -- not just avoiding service issues but proactively addressing our clients' needs; and the third, sort of related to the first, is innovating, particularly around new programs in specialty like our oncology program, medical benefit management program.

And then like Alan, with our innovative solutions, we're targeting some new capabilities for chronic disease that use the breadth of the assets of CVS like transform diabetes and transform oncology, which are resonating, as well as our new access point products like our virtual primary care. And so that's really what's leading to a strong and improved national account selling season."

So I think we've been a bit cautious with that and tried to make sure that we have the capacity if things go in a different direction. This is kind of an important role that we play, even more important now without as many large-scale sites up. And so we want to make sure we have the capacity. 
So as you think -- the thing, I think, that kind of comes off of that is, as you think now about sort of vaccine volume up and down, the marginal impacts, right, of those vaccines is probably greater than average. So it is something that we're paying very close attention to, but a balance."

And I guess the question really is how to think about what that headwind could be for next year. Like what can we anticipate? Or do the economics of the vaccine change in your opinion? That's the first one. 
And then the second one is, do you think you can still get the same purchasing synergies that you're seeing this year or next year in the PBM? It sounds like you're getting massive new growth there. I'm just wondering if you can continue to see the sort of year-over-year kind of growth, which I'm guessing is driven by the purchasing synergies next year."

So the effect we're seeing year-over-year is probably more -- is more pronounced than sort of the first half of the year than we'll see in the second half of the year. But Alan can kind of comment on the longer-term potential. 
On the vaccine and the testing economics, as we mentioned, $1 billion of the revenue increase is attributable to those 2 things in our full year outlook. The full year revenue is probably double that. The margin dynamics are probably a little high just in this quarter just because of some of the timing issues. But to date, I don't have any insight into sort of changing reimbursements or changing kind of the labor model we're using to sort of deliver those. So I think that's as reasonable sort of the baseline to begin to work off of as we can and as we think about next year. And again, I mean, as you think about the dynamics here, as you have FDA approval mandates, booster shot, there's a lot of things. 
And listen, you could make a bull case, if you wanted to, on this, certainly, with what's going on now, and I wouldn't dispute that. And I'd acknowledge that if our guidance has some upside, this could be a place depending on how things play out. 
The only kind of caution I would put there, though, is to think about some of the interplay of just looking at this in isolation. So even in sort of inside retail, if we do see an uptick and it does see increased activity, well, what does this mean for cough, cold and flu for this? What does it mean for front of store? And then, obviously, the HCB ripple. 
So again, I'd acknowledge that there is a bull case that you could make here, but I'd also say this has changed rapidly over the last couple of months. And I'd just ask you to sort of think about it in a broader context."

So when I think about the drivers of purchasing economics on the manufacturer's side and the sustainability, the first thing I'd acknowledge is, as Shawn has said, when you launch something new, there's always going to be an outsized step-up. Having said that, I think the future viewpoint on the ability to create more competition through -- whether it's biosimilars and biosimilar interchangeability, as we saw recently through generics, particularly in the specialty area, we see that as a -- as we're at the beginning of the specialty era -- or the generic era, biosimilar era of specialty. So I think that's sustainable and a good opportunity longer term. I think the growth of our value creation will grow as volume growth. So as we continue to win new business, we'll continue to grow there. 
And the last is we built our -- this platform as a platform for a series of services. So we've just launched our first set of services. We think there's a number of other ones that we can continue to launch into the market within the GPO that will create meaningful value for both us and for our customers."

For the third quarter in a row, we are raising adjusted EPS guidance. 
Throughout 2021, we have made progress executing our strategy to deliver an integrated health care experience centered around the consumer. We sustained strong revenue growth in each of our core businesses helped improve health outcomes and reduce costs by broadening access to quality care. We help fight the pandemic and reach millions of consumers with convenient, accessible care in communities across America. 
During the third quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 10%. This double-digit growth was led by membership gains in both health care benefits and pharmacy services as well as higher volume in retail. We grew adjusted operating income by 12.5%. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.97 and strong cash flow from operations of $5.5 billion. Given these results and our outlook, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $7.90 to $8. 
This higher guidance reflects the quarter's outperformance and continued positive momentum, which Sean will discuss shortly. Third quarter results again demonstrate that our customers value how we bring together our unique portfolio of assets our deep health care expertise and vast consumer touch points to meet health needs. There is strong demand for our integrated solutions across the health care continuum, including health management programs for chronic conditions, mental health support, pharmacy services and health and wellness products. 
We added over 1.3 million new integrated pharmacy and medical members through the 2021 and 2022 selling season. More customers are seeking complementary health services that work together, such as virtual care. Earlier this year, CVS Health launched the first national Virtual Primary Care program. This market-leading solution offers a national network of physicians virtually and access to convenient face-to-face care in our MinuteClinic locations when needed, often with 0 co-pay. 
Our program has grown to 30 customer accounts with over 750,000 eligible members as of January 1, 2022. This is an indication of our ability to scale nationally and bring innovative products to the marketplace. Our customers recognize the importance of CVS Health Care Solutions and the ease of access we now provide in the community, the home and virtually. 
Our high customer retention rates and new business wins are a testament to the strength of our business model. Health care benefits revenue increased 9.5% year-over-year. Strength in government services helped drive an adjusted operating income increase of 2.4% versus prior year despite higher costs related to COVID-19, net of deferred care primarily within our commercial book. We generated sequential membership growth across all 3 product lines in the quarter: commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. Our medical benefit ratio of 85.8% was above our expectations, driven by COVID-related costs, primarily driven by commercial. Underlying non-COVID costs emerged in line with our expectations. 
We believe aggregate medical costs will slightly exceed baseline levels for the full year. We produced strong results in our Medicare business and grew membership both sequentially and year-over-year across all Medicare products. This reflects our strong product portfolio, star performance and reputation for service excellence. 
Year-to-date, Medicare Advantage membership has grown 9.2%. In 2022, we anticipate we will achieve double-digit growth in individual Medicare and generate strong momentum in dual eligibles. Our strong performance in Stars continues, as you saw for 2022, with 87% of our members in Star plans rated 4 and higher, up from 83% in 2021. 
In our commercial business, we expect moderate growth in 2022 for national accounts, driven by both increased sales, which are up approximately 50% year-over-year, and a 95% client retention rate. As we mentioned earlier this year, we are reentering the individual exchanges in 8 states as of January 2022. 
Enrollment began on Monday, and we anticipate our co-branded CVS Aetna offering and benefit design focused on consumer choice will result in gains of at least 100,000 new members in 2022. 
Turning to Pharmacy Services. We delivered third quarter revenue growth of 9.3% and adjusted operating income growth of 9.5% year-over-year. For the 2022 selling season, we achieved a 98% retention rate. We drove $10.4 billion of gross new business, resulting in $8.9 billion of net new business wins, providing evidence of our market-leading trend management, transparency customer service and integrated offerings. 
We continue to be a leader in specialty pharmacy with programs that drive value in the marketplace provide substantive savings to customers and differentiate us as we pay our programs with digital assets. We maintained a strong momentum this quarter with specialty revenue up 8.7% versus prior year. our service excellence and top-tier execution are key areas of differentiation. Our Retail segment continues to play a critical role as a local health destination for millions of Americans. 
Retail outperformed both expectations and the industry in the third quarter. We delivered 10% revenue growth and 22% adjusted operating income growth year-over-year. Pharmacy sales and prescriptions filled both increased 8% year-over-year, largely driven by COVID-19 vaccine administration and core pharmacy services. 
Our patient satisfaction scores remain high with approximately 90% satisfied with their experience in our CVS Health locations. We continue to support millions of Americans for COVID-19 testing and vaccine administration. We administered 11.6 million COVID-19 vaccines and 8.5 million COVID-19 tests in the quarter. 
Since our program began, we have administered 43 million vaccines and approximately 38 million tests. We also expanded our digital capabilities to provide universal access to CVS Health vaccination records to the millions of adults we have vaccinated. This new capability has driven over 1 million visits per month to vaccination records on cbs.com. This provides another opportunity for us to build deeper engagement with our customers while simplifying and connecting their health experience. 
Front store sales momentum also continued with revenue growth of 13% versus prior year. Front store sales were led by consumer demand for COVID-19 home testing kits, as well as cough and cold products with year-over-year volume increases across most front store categories. 
Our CVS Health retail presence consistently serves as a strong channel for capturing new lives. In fact, this year, 12.5% of new COVID-19 testing customers chose to fill new prescriptions or receive a COVID-19 vaccination with CVS Health. Finally, we anticipate a benefit from administering boosters and pediatric doses to eligible consumers will occur largely in the fourth quarter of this year. 
We continue to make measurable progress with our strategy to deliver a superior customer experience and address the total cost of care. We have focused on several important areas. First, with our unique portfolio of businesses, we continue to expand our role in care delivery designed around the customer. We are taking a proactive approach to meeting the emerging needs of customers, clients and communities. We are improving access, lowering costs and combining local points of care to simplify the consumer health experience. 
We have one of the country's largest network of physician extenders and are able to deliver care locally with our national footprint. We will continue to drive higher engagement with customers as we evolve the format of select CVS locations, creating community health destinations, and shifting into 3 distinct models: sites dedicated to offering primary care services, an enhanced version of health hubs with products and services designed for everyday health and wellness needs. 
Our traditional CVS Pharmacy store model that provides prescription services and health and wellness and other convenient retail offerings. Our unique combination of businesses and our presence in communities nationwide enable us to meet consumers where they are to enhance their well-being and to be a bigger part of their wellness. 
Next, we are further strengthening the consumer experience through the expansion of digital services and platforms that connect to health services and in-person channels for our more than 35 million unique digital customers. For example, more than 70% of CVS Pharmacy customers are enrolled in our text messaging programs today. Within that group this quarter, adherence outreach drove 10% growth in prescriptions filled. Greater adherence leads to improved health outcomes and lower costs. 
In today's hyper-connected digital consumer-driven world, the demand for omnichannel pharmacy is greater than ever. We continue to modernize our operating systems and enhance the integration of pharmacy model simplifying consumer interactions and driving further engagement with our customers. Finally, we continue to invest in our employees as part of our workforce strategy. 
Last quarter, we announced the phased increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour by July 2022. We invested in modernizing our training programs and technology for our frontline and clinical colleagues. Despite the tight labor market and anticipation of the higher demand for health services, we strengthened our workforce in every business. We hired a record number of people in the third quarter to advance open enrollment and customer service as well as enhance technology and clinical capabilities. 
Nearly 20,000 pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and nurses recently joined the CVS Health team supporting flu season as well as COVID-19 vaccinations and testing. Our pharmacists and pharmacy technicians are an integral part of our overall workforce strategy. We are committed to investing in our pharmacists, awarding immunization bonuses in the second half of this year. We look forward to sharing more about our strategy to improve access, quality and customer engagement in Investor Day on December 9. 
Our commitment to shareholders, customers and communities remain steadfast. Health equity is critical as the pandemic continues to disproportionately impact certain communities. In addition to targeted vaccine and booster education efforts, we provided 31 million meals this year to people suffering from food insecurity and invested in 2,800 affordable housing units in 30 cities. 
By helping address the social determinants of health, permanent housing can reduce health care costs by 59%. We recently hired our first-ever Chief Health Equity Officer; Dr. Jon Kalon, to build upon our efforts to advance health equity and better support underserved communities, and our increased wages and bonuses support our employees, their families and their communities. 
For the third quarter in a row, we executed on and exceeded our plan and raised adjusted EPS guidance. We continue to enhance our diverse portfolio of assets to serve the customer. We are guiding to a strong year-end, all possible due to the leadership and commitment of our over 300,000 CVS Health colleagues that bring their heart to every moment of our customers' health. 
With that, let me turn it over to Shawn."

Our third quarter results reflect a continuation of the strong performance observed in the first half of 2021 and as we exceeded our expectations from both a revenue, cash flow and adjusted earnings per share",2302,"Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect a continuation of the strong performance observed in the first half of 2021 and as we exceeded our expectations from both a revenue, cash flow and adjusted earnings per share basis. These results ensue from our differentiated portfolio of capabilities and keen focus on operational execution. This momentum in our performance enables us once again to raise our outlook for 2021. 
Starting with the enterprise as a whole. Total revenues of $73.8 billion increased 10% year-over-year with robust growth in all 3 segments. We reported adjusted operating income of $4.1 billion, a 12.5% increase versus the prior year. This growth in adjusted operating income was also reflected in the strong cash flow generation in the third quarter with year-to-date cash flow from operations now exceeding $14 billion. 
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.97 represent a nearly 19% year-over-year increase, generated by our adjusted operating income growth and lower interest expense resulting from our ongoing deleveraging efforts. 
Moving to the segments. Health care benefits revenue increased by 9.5% year-over-year, driven by sustained growth in our Government Services business, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurance fee. In the third quarter, we saw Medicaid membership grow sequentially by 67,000 members across multiple geographies. 
Medicare Advantage membership also continued to grow in the quarter, increasing by 42,000 members sequentially and representing year-over-year growth of 9.8%. Our Medicare Advantage franchise continues to be a powerful growth engine with Medicare Advantage membership more than doubling since the third quarter of 2015, representing a 15% compound annual growth rate. 
Our attention has now turned to ensuring a successful 2022 annual enrollment period for Medicare, which began on October 1. While still quite early in that process, we are pleased with what we have seen to date. Health Care Benefits adjusted operating income grew modestly year-over-year, but fell below our expectations for the quarter due to higher-than-expected COVID-related medical costs in our commercial business. 
With the surge in nationwide COVID cases emanating from the Delta variant, we experienced higher-than-expected COVID-related medical costs in August and September. Three key factors drove this difference versus our expectations. First, commercial COVID inpatient admissions in August and September were in line with the peak levels experienced in January 2021 and were nearly 3x the average of the second quarter of 2021. 
Second, COVID testing costs, which we had expected to moderate during the third quarter, also approached January 2021 levels and were more than 1.5x the average we experienced in the second quarter. 
It is critical to recognize the outsized impact of COVID testing on overall claim costs as testing costs represented approximately 35% of gross COVID costs in the quarter. And finally, while non-COVID deferred care was better than we had forecast, it was not enough to entirely offset these higher COVID costs in commercial. The resultant medical benefit ratio for the quarter of 85.8% was above our forecast and driven almost entirely by the higher-than-expected commercial COVID testing and treatment costs. 
There are 2 important aspects of HCB's third quarter performance to note. One, absent these COVID dynamics, underlying performance in our commercial book of business continues to be in line with our expectations. Two, in our government services business, we also saw an increase in COVID treatment and testing costs, but far less pronounced than in commercial. This lower level of increase was fully offset by better-than-expected deferred care. 
As a result, the overall performance of our Government Services business was in line with expectations. Wrapping up HCB, we experienced favorable prior period development in the quarter on both commercial and government products. Days claims payable of 51 at the end of the third quarter is 3 days higher sequentially and 2 days above prior year. 
While influenced by many factors with the anticipated abatement and COVID-related claims in the fourth quarter, we would expect DCP to return to a more typical results in Q4. 
Overall, we remain comfortable with the adequacy of our reserves. Turning to pharmacy services. Our ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth remains clear. 2021 is expected to be the second year of adjusted operating income growth in excess of 10%. 
This sustained growth has been driven by our track record of delivering industry-leading drug trend on behalf of our clients, our proven industry-leading capabilities, particularly in the specialty pharmacy arena our outstanding customer service, as reflected by our over 98% renewal rate for 2022. 
During the third quarter, pharmacy revenues increased by 9.3% year-over-year, driven by increased pharmacy claims volume, growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation. Total pharmacy membership increased by 1.6 million lives sequentially, and primarily reflecting growth in government programs. Total pharmacy claims processed grew nearly 7% above the prior year. Nearly half of this growth was attributable to net new 2021 business with COVID vaccine administration and new therapy prescriptions also contributing to the year-over-year growth. 
Note that new therapy prescriptions were adversely impacted in the third quarter 2020 due to the pandemic. Pharmacy adjusted operating income exceeded expectations in the quarter, up more than $150 million or 9.5% year-over-year. The 3 major drivers of this increase remain consistent with the second quarter. 
Improved purchasing economics reflecting the products and services of our group purchasing organization launched in the second quarter of 2020; continued strength in our specialty pharmacy business driven by 340B administration and increased pharmacy claims volumes, both of which were partially tempered by ongoing but stable client pricing pressure. 
Our retail business delivered strong results this quarter, again exceeding expectations. Total revenue of just under $25 billion increased by $2.3 billion or 10% year-over-year. There are 2 main components to this increase. Approximately half or $1.2 billion is attributable to the contributions from the more than 11 million COVID vaccines and over 8 million COVID tests we administered combined with strong front store sales driven by demand for over-the-counter COVID test kits and related treatment categories. 
With this quarter's results, we are now on pace to deliver about 44 million to 49 million COVID vaccines and 28 million to 33 million COVID tests for full year 2021. The remaining half or 1.1 billion was driven by a combination of sustained pharmacy growth and broad strength in front store trends across a range of categories partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure. This strong revenue growth, combined with a 70 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin, produced adjusted operating income that exceeded our forecast and drove a year-over-year increase of $300 million. This adjusted operating income growth driven by COVID testing vaccines and front store sales was partially tempered by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure, business investments, including the minimum wage increase and other performance incentives, and increased staffing to provide expanded levels of service. 
Turning to cash flows and the balance sheet. Our liquidity and capital position remained excellent at the end of the third quarter with cash from operations of $5.5 billion for the quarter and $14.3 billion year-to-date. Through our proactive liability management transaction in August, we paid down $1.1 billion in net long-term debt in the quarter. 
As of the end of the third quarter 2021, we have repaid a net total of $18.7 billion in long-term debt since the close of the Aetna transaction. In addition, we returned over $650 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend. 
Let me now discuss our updated 2021 guidance. As Karen noted earlier, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range this morning by $0.20 to $7.90 to $8 per share. This increase reflects the strong performance in pharmacy services and retail, partially offset by expected COVID pressure in our health care benefits business, specifically in the commercial block. 
We are raising our total revenue outlook to $286.5 billion to $290.3 billion and adjusted operating income outlook to $16.4 billion to $16.6 billion. We are also increasing expected full year cash flow from operations to a range of $13 billion to $13.5 billion. Note that this increased cash flow forecast is actually lower than our September year-to-date figure, reflecting expected payments in the fourth quarter that were accrued in 2020, including FICA taxes and increased minimum loss ratio rebates as well as the timing of receipts and payments between the third and fourth quarters. 
I'll now highlight some key items related to the segments and full year guidance. For the Health Care Benefits segment, we are lowering our full year adjusted operating income guidance from $5.25 billion to $5.35 billion to $4.9 billion to $5 billion. 
We expect the full year medical benefit ratio to be in a range of 84.4% to 85.6%, or an increase of 30 basis points from our prior range. This reflects the higher-than-expected commercial COVID medical costs observed in the third quarter and our expectation that these will continue, although at a lower level into the fourth quarter. 
Emerging October operational data indicate that COVID inpatient admissions are tracking at approximately half the levels of September. Again, it is important to remember the degree to which testing costs are driving expenses. So while we expect Q4 testing expenses to be lower than Q3, we do not anticipate they will decline as much as inpatient expense. 
Finally, recall the normal seasonality of the Health Care Benefits segment with fourth quarter operating income typically the lowest of the year driven by deductible satisfaction producing the highest quarterly medical costs. For pharmacy services, given the continued strength in the quarter and our visibility to the remainder of the year, we are increasing full year 2021 adjusted operating income guidance to $6.85 billion to $6.94 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 20.5% to 22%. 
We anticipate that the strength in third quarter pharmacy services results will largely continue into the fourth quarter. In the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we are also increasing our full year 2021 adjusted operating income guidance to $6.98 billion to $7.07 billion. 
As you consider the fourth quarter, I would note that we currently expect vaccinations to continue, although at a lower rate than the third quarter. We have also contemplated the impact of the CDC's COVID booster recommendations as well as a modest impact from pediatric vaccinations. We expect testing to decline modestly in comparison with the levels experienced during the third quarter. 
Given Retail's Q3 outperformance and Q4 outlook, we now expect the full year 2021 COVID impact to be neutral. This compares to our prior guidance in August for an overall modest negative net impact. You will find further details regarding our updated guidance in the slide presentation we posted to our website this morning. 
As we closed the third quarter, we are very pleased with the performance of our businesses, which provides us with a strong foundation as we now look ahead to 2022. While we plan to share more details with you at our upcoming Investor Day in early December in New York, I want to update you on our thoughts regarding the 2022 outlook. 
While there are still many factors to play out, we believe that current analyst estimates for 2022 adjusted EPS of approximately $8.20 are within our anticipated initial guidance range. As we discussed last quarter, there are some significant moving pieces to keep in mind in determining an appropriate baseline for 2021. 
First, consistent with our standard practice, we exclude prior year's development net of profits returned to customers and net realized capital gains from our forward-looking guidance. 
Second, in 2022, we will incur a full year of expense related to our minimum wage increase announced last quarter. We estimate these factors combined represent approximately $0.40 per share. Using the midpoint of our updated 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range, which is $7.95, these adjustments create a 2021 baseline of $7.55. The other significant factor in considering 2022 performance is the effect that COVID will have on our retail and health care benefits businesses. 
For retail, we expect that COVID-19 vaccine and testing volume, which is expected to generate over $3 billion of revenue in 2021, will decline significantly in 2022 to 30% to 40% of the volume we administered in 2021. In addition, we expect COVID-driven front store sales to decline in 2022. 
For HCB, we expect to see a significant improvement in results in 2022, as treatment and testing costs decline with COVID cost estimates and improved risk-adjusted revenue reflected in our pricing. 
Overall, we estimate the COVID-driven impact in HCB will largely be offset by the expected decline in COVID-related retail performance. It is important to note that forecasts of future COVID impacts to our business remain extremely difficult and are subject to change as circumstances dictate. 
Beyond these considerations, Other factors affecting our growth for 2022 remain consistent with the commentary we provided last quarter regarding headwinds and tailwinds. With all of this in mind, the current consensus of analyst estimates of approximately $8.20 for adjusted EPS would represent about an 8% increase over the 2021 baseline. 
To conclude, the strong performance of CVS Health in the first half of 2021 continued in the third quarter, producing strong revenue, adjusted operating income and cash flow results, and we are pleased to again raise our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance. 
During the pandemic, we have solidified our opportunity to become a national leader in health care delivery, which at its core, starts and ends with lowering the cost of care, improving access and convenience, ultimately enabling people to live healthier and more fulfilling lives. 
During our Investor Day in a few weeks, we look forward to sharing with you more about our path over the coming years to deliver on this ambition and to position CVS Health to generate sustainable, low double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We will now open the call to your questions. Operator?"

I just want to better understand how do we think about the rollout of this in combination with the virtual 360 that you'll offer going into 2022. My first question would be, did you see the opportunity to really lower the cost trend when we think about those members that utilize, for example, the MinuteClinic and retail pharmacy of CVS? And is that being masked because of COVID that we're not really seeing that trend come through? 
And then secondly, as we think about plan design going into next year, can you maybe just spend a minute and talk about where you see the biggest opportunities? And do you feel the need to own or now employ primary care physicians?"

And we actually really look forward to sharing much more of our strategy when we meet in December, but let me just give you kind of a brief overview. I would start with, as we kind of look at the consumer, obviously, the consumer has been incredibly challenged by the complexity of the health care system. 
Our overall strategy is to make sure that we can provide them access points with lower cost, higher quality with convenience and overall engagement. And we think those factors will help us with the long-term strategy of driving down health care costs. 
As we think about our you mentioned our MinuteClinics and our trends. We have now 7.5 million people that have this 0 co-pay or low-cost co-pay. We have started to see the Aetna members utilizing those services. Obviously, that's a lower site of care. It is convenient. 
We've also expanded the services, as I mentioned earlier, adding behavioral health care. We've seen repeat customers coming there. So Obviously, we're starting to get traction with the Aetna members with these planned designs and we feel quite good about it. 
Now your question around primary care and what we think we need to do here is primary care is a small component of overall medical costs. I think we all recognize that, but it wields significant influence on the total medical cost picture. So as you think about us managing and navigating care for our patients, we really believe that we need to kind of push into the primary care, so we can influence the overall cost of care. And by doing that, we think that we can have better engagement help customers better navigate and obviously have higher quality, lower cost of care. And so that's the intent here of really pushing into primary care. And we expect to see continued evolution of our plan designs. 
If you think about our overall care strategy, it's virtual care, it's in the community and it's in the home. If you look at what we did this year with our virtual primary care offering, clearly, we were able to be in the market early. We have 750,000 people now that are eligible for that virtual primary care. We've connected that virtual primary care with an in-person connection with our MinuteClinics and also in the home with diagnostic biometric monitoring. So you can see that we're innovating around the consumer, and that's how we think we're going to really change the game in health care is innovating around the consumer."

We won in health plans. We won in Medicaid. We won in pretty much all segments that we participate in. And I think we win for 3 reasons. 
We win primarily because we have the best demonstrated ability to manage drug spend, particularly in specialty pharmacy, where you know it's critically important.

And I'll answer the second one because it's fairly quickly in terms of my long-term kind of to get to the low double-digit EPS. What I'd say is that includes capital deployment. That capital deployment in some years can take the form of accretive share repurchase. Some years, it can take more of a form of M&A. And as Karen mentioned, our strategy will require the development of new capabilities. 
And I think while it's likely some of those we can do ourselves, I think there are some of those that will make more sense for us to acquire along the way. But it is a good and timely question around capital and long term. We're nearing the end of a sort of 3- or 4-year deleverage cycle. 
And I think the next 3 years are going to look different than the last 3 years. While we remain committed to our investment grade target and we will always sort of manage leverage responsibility. My first priority always with capital is to grow the business. And we mentioned that our strategy might require that. 
So from year to year, that can sort of move between, as I mentioned, share repurchase, dividend, M&A, but my experience is that a balanced deployment over time has tended to work best. And that might look like something with the M&A aspect a dividend that grows with EPS and some level of accretive share repurchase."

We have a partner, but it's -- I would say, it's mostly the CVS volume. 
With respect to 340B, there are a few things that drive the growth. So think about 340B in 2 ways, right? One is we provide third-party administrative services to covered entities. So as we grow the number of covered entities, we grow the size of the contribution. 
The second area is dispensing margin. We get paid a fixed fee for dispensing the drugs on behalf of the covered entities. So as volume grows, both because specialty is growing as an example, as our book of business grows from new wins and as our covered entity book of business grows, all 3 of those contribute to volume growth. 
Sorry, I would just add one last point was that, that volume growth substantially benefits the covered entities. And as you know, many of the covered entities are dependent upon the 340B program for their financial health."

So the increase is clearly COVID. As I mentioned, we do expect that we will see deferred utilization in the fourth quarter, but we're only assuming half the level that we experienced in. And you could think about that a little bit from kind of where we are today, taking half the step back to kind of 0 deferred utilization. Where this is, is very similar to my commentary last time. Commercial has the least amount of deferred utilization right now in the system. And government also government probably has the most with Medicare having a little less than Medicaid at this stage. But we see all of those moving back towards normal in the fourth quarter and as we think about next year."

For the third quarter in a row, we are raising adjusted EPS guidance. . 
Throughout 2021, we have made progress executing our strategy to deliver an integrated health care experience centered around the consumer. We sustained strong revenue growth in each of our core businesses helped improve health outcomes and reduce costs by broadening access to quality care. We help fight the pandemic and reach millions of consumers with convenient, accessible care in communities across America.  
During the third quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 10%. This double-digit growth was led by membership gains in both health care benefits and pharmacy services as well as higher volume in retail. We grew adjusted operating income by 12.5%. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.97 and strong cash flow from operations of $5.5 billion. Given these results and our outlook, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $7.90 to $8.  
This higher guidance reflects the quarter's out performance and continued positive momentum, which Shawn will discuss shortly. Third quarter results again demonstrate that our customers value how we bring together our unique portfolio of assets our deep health care expertise and vast consumer touch points to meet health needs. There is strong demand for our integrated solutions across the health care continuum, including health management programs for chronic conditions, mental health support, pharmacy services and health and wellness products.  
We added over 1.3 million new integrated pharmacy and medical members through the 2021 and 2022 selling season. More customers are seeking complementary health services that work together, such as virtual care. Earlier this year, CVS Health launched the first national Virtual Primary Care program. This market-leading solution offers a national network of physicians virtually and access to convenient face-to-face care in our MinuteClinic locations when needed, often with 0 co-pay.  
Our program has grown to 30 customer accounts with over 750,000 eligible members as of January 1, 2022. This is an indication of our ability to scale nationally and bring innovative products to the marketplace. Our customers recognize the importance of CVS Health Care Solutions and the ease of access we now provide in the community, the home and virtually.  
Our high customer retention rates and new business wins are a testament to the strength of our business model. Health care benefits revenue increased 9.5% year-over-year. Strength in government services helped drive an adjusted operating income increase of 2.4% versus prior year despite higher costs related to COVID-19, net of deferred care primarily within our commercial book. We generated sequential membership growth across all 3 product lines in the quarter: commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. Our medical benefit ratio of 85.8% was above our expectations, driven by COVID-related costs, primarily driven by commercial. Underlying non-COVID costs emerged in line with our expectations.  
We believe aggregate medical costs will slightly exceed baseline levels for the full year. We produced strong results in our Medicare business and grew membership both sequentially and year-over-year across all Medicare products. This reflects our strong product portfolio, Stars performance and reputation for service excellence.  
Year-to-date, Medicare Advantage membership has grown 9.2%. In 2022, we anticipate we will achieve double-digit growth in individual Medicare and generate strong momentum in dual eligibles. Our strong performance in Stars continues, as you saw for 2022, with 87% of our members in Star plans rated 4 and higher, up from 83% in 2021.  
In our commercial business, we expect moderate growth in 2022 for national accounts, driven by both increased sales, which are up approximately 50% year-over-year, and a 95% client retention rate. As we mentioned earlier this year, we are reentering the individual exchanges in 8 states as of January 2022.  
Enrollment began on Monday, and we anticipate our co-branded CVS Aetna offering and benefit design focused on consumer choice will result in gains of at least 100,000 new members in 2022.  
Turning to Pharmacy Services. We delivered third quarter revenue growth of 9.3% and adjusted operating income growth of 9.5% year-over-year. For the 2022 selling season, we achieved a 98% retention rate. We drove $10.4 billion of growth new business, resulting in $8.9 billion of net new business wins, providing evidence of our market-leading trend management, transparency customer service and integrated offerings.  
We continue to be a leader in specialty pharmacy with programs that drive value in the marketplace provide substantive savings to customers and differentiate us as we pay our programs with digital assets. We maintained a strong momentum this quarter with specialty revenue up 8.7% versus prior year. our service excellence and top-tier execution are key areas of differentiation. Our Retail segment continues to play a critical role as a local health destination for millions of Americans.  
Retail outperformed both expectations and the industry in the third quarter. We delivered 10% revenue growth and 22% adjusted operating income growth year-over-year. Pharmacy sales and prescriptions filled both increased 8% year-over-year, largely driven by COVID-19 vaccine administration and core pharmacy services.  
Our patient satisfaction scores remain high with approximately 90% satisfied with their experience in our CVS Health locations. We continue to support millions of Americans for COVID-19 testing and vaccine administration. We administered 11.6 million COVID-19 vaccines and 8.5 million COVID-19 tests in the quarter.  
Since our program began, we have administered 43 million vaccines and approximately 38 million tests. We also expanded our digital capabilities to provide universal access to CVS Health vaccination records to the millions of adults we have vaccinated. This new capability has driven over 1 million visits per month to vaccination records on cbs.com. This provides another opportunity for us to build deeper engagement with our customers while simplifying and connecting their health experience.  
Front store sales momentum also continued with revenue growth of 13% versus prior year. Front store sales were led by consumer demand for COVID-19 home testing kits, as well as cough and cold products with year-over-year volume increases across most front store categories.  
Our CVS Health retail presence consistently serves as a strong channel for capturing new lives. In fact, this year, 12.5% of new COVID-19 testing customers chose to fill new prescriptions or receive a COVID-19 vaccination with CVS Health. Finally, we anticipate a benefit from administering boosters and pediatric doses to eligible consumers will occur largely in the fourth quarter of this year.  
We continue to make measurable progress with our strategy to deliver a superior customer experience and address the total cost of care. We have focused on several important areas. First, with our unique portfolio of businesses, we continue to expand our role in care delivery designed around the customer. We are taking a proactive approach to meeting the emerging needs of customers, clients and communities. We are improving access, lowering costs and combining local points of care to simplify the consumer health experience.  
We have one of the country's largest network of physician extenders and are able to deliver care locally with our national footprint. We will continue to drive higher engagement with customers as we evolve the format of select CVS locations, creating community health destinations, and shifting into 3 distinct models: sites dedicated to offering primary care services, an enhanced version of health hubs with products and services designed for everyday health and wellness needs.  
Our traditional CVS Pharmacy store model that provides prescription services and health and wellness and other convenient retail offerings. Our unique combination of businesses and our presence in communities nationwide enable us to meet consumers where they are to enhance their well-being and to be a bigger part of their wellness.  
Next, we are further strengthening the consumer experience through the expansion of digital services and platforms that connect to health services and in-person channels for our more than 35 million unique digital customers. For example, more than 70% of CVS Pharmacy customers are enrolled in our text messaging programs today. Within that group this quarter, adherence outreach drove 10% growth in prescriptions filled. Greater adherence leads to improved health outcomes and lower costs.  
In today's hyper-connected digital consumer-driven world, the demand for omni-channel pharmacy is greater than ever. We continue to modernize our operating systems and enhance the integration of pharmacy model simplifying consumer interactions and driving further engagement with our customers. Finally, we continue to invest in our employees as part of our workforce strategy.  
Last quarter, we announced the phased increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour by July 2022. We invested in modernizing our training programs and technology for our frontline and clinical colleagues. Despite the tight labor market and anticipation of the higher demand for health services, we strengthened our workforce in every business. We hired a record number of people in the third quarter to advance open enrollment and customer service as well as enhance technology and clinical capabilities.  
Nearly 20,000 pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and nurses recently joined the CVS Health team supporting flu season as well as COVID-19 vaccinations and testing. Our pharmacists and pharmacy technicians are an integral part of our overall workforce strategy. We are committed to investing in our pharmacists, awarding immunization bonuses in the second half of this year. We look forward to sharing more about our strategy to improve access, quality and customer engagement in Investor Day on December 9.  
Our commitment to shareholders, customers and communities remain steadfast. Health equity is critical as the pandemic continues to disproportionately impact certain communities. In addition to targeted vaccine and booster education efforts, we provided 31 million meals this year to people suffering from food insecurity and invested in 2,800 affordable housing units in 30 cities.  
By helping address the social determinants of health, permanent housing can reduce health care costs by 59%. We recently hired our first-ever Chief Health Equity Officer; Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, to build upon our efforts to advance health equity and better support underserved communities, and our increased wages and bonuses support our employees, their families and their communities.  
For the third quarter in a row, we executed on and exceeded our plan and raised adjusted EPS guidance. We continue to enhance our diverse portfolio of assets to serve the customer. We are guiding to a strong year-end, all possible due to the leadership and commitment of our over 300,000 CVS Health colleagues that bring their heart to every moment of our customers' health.  
With that, let me turn it over to Shawn."

Our third quarter results reflect a continuation of the strong performance observed in the first half of 2021 and as we exceeded our expectations from both a revenue, cash flow and adjusted earnings per share",2302,"Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect a continuation of the strong performance observed in the first half of 2021 and as we exceeded our expectations from both a revenue, cash flow and adjusted earnings per share basis. These results ensue from our differentiated portfolio of capabilities and keen focus on operational execution. This momentum in our performance enables us once again to raise our outlook for 2021.  
Starting with the enterprise as a whole. Total revenues of $73.8 billion increased 10% year-over-year with robust growth in all 3 segments. We reported adjusted operating income of $4.1 billion, a 12.5% increase versus the prior year. This growth in adjusted operating income was also reflected in the strong cash flow generation in the third quarter. with year-to-date cash flow from operations now exceeding $14 billion.  
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.97 represent a nearly 19% year-over-year increase, generated by our adjusted operating income growth and lower interest expense resulting from our ongoing de-leveraging efforts.  
Moving to the segments. Health care benefits revenue increased by 9.5% year-over-year, driven by sustained growth in our Government Services business, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurance fee. In the third quarter, we saw Medicaid membership grow sequentially by 67,000 members across multiple geographies.  
Medicare Advantage membership also continued to grow in the quarter, increasing by 42,000 members sequentially and representing year-over-year growth of 9.8%. Our Medicare Advantage franchise continues to be a powerful growth engine with Medicare Advantage membership more than doubling since the third quarter of 2015, representing a 15% compound annual growth rate.  
Our attention has now turned to ensuring a successful 2022 annual enrollment period for Medicare, which began on October 1. While still quite early in that process, we are pleased with what we have seen to date. Health Care Benefits adjusted operating income grew modestly year-over-year, but fell below our expectations for the quarter due to higher-than-expected COVID-related medical costs in our commercial business.  
With the surge in nationwide COVID cases emanating from the Delta variant, we experienced higher-than-expected COVID-related medical costs in August and September. Three key factors drove this difference versus our expectations. First, commercial COVID inpatient admissions in August and September. Were in line with the peak levels experienced in January 2021 and were nearly 3x the average of the second quarter of 2021. Second, COVID testing costs, which we had expected to moderate during the third quarter, also approached January 2021 levels and were more than 1.5x the average we experienced in the second quarter. It is critical to recognize the outsized impact of COVID testing on overall claim costs as testing costs represented approximately 35% of gross COVID costs in the quarter. And finally, while non-COVID deferred care was better than we had forecast, it was not enough to entirely offset these higher COVID costs in commercial. The resultant medical benefit ratio for the quarter of 85.8% was above our forecast and driven almost entirely by the higher-than-expected commercial COVID testing and treatment costs.  
There are 2 important aspects of HCB's third quarter performance to note. One, absent these COVID dynamics, underlying performance in our commercial book of business continues to be in line with our expectations. Two, in our government services business, we also saw an increase in COVID treatment and testing costs, but far less pronounced than in commercial. This lower level of increase was fully offset by better-than-expected deferred care.  
As a result, the overall performance of our Government Services business was in line with expectations. Wrapping up HCB -- We experienced favorable prior period development in the quarter on both commercial and government products. Days claims payable of 51 at the end of the third quarter is 3 days higher sequentially and 2 days above prior year.  
While influenced by many factors with the anticipated abatement and COVID-related claims in the fourth quarter, we would expect DCP to return to a more typical results in Q4.  
Overall, we remain comfortable with the adequacy of our reserves. Turning to pharmacy services. Our ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth remains clear. 2021 is expected to be the second year of adjusted operating  income growth in excess of 10%.  
This sustained growth has been driven by our track record of delivering industry-leading drug trend on behalf of our clients, our proven industry-leading capabilities, particularly in the specialty pharmacy arena our outstanding customer service, as reflected by our over 98% renewal rate for 2022.  
During the third quarter, pharmacy revenues increased by 9.3% year-over-year, driven by increased pharmacy claims volume, growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation. Total pharmacy membership increased by 1.6 million lives sequentially,  primarily reflecting growth in government programs. Total pharmacy claims processed grew nearly 7% above the prior year. Nearly half of this growth was attributable to net new 2021 business with COVID vaccine administration and new therapy prescriptions also contributing to the year-over-year growth.  
Note that new therapy prescriptions were adversely impacted in the third quarter 2020 due to the pandemic. Pharmacy adjusted operating income exceeded expectations in the quarter, up more than $150 million or 9.5% year-over-year. The 3 major drivers of this increase remain consistent with the second quarter.  
Improved purchasing economics reflecting the products and services of our group purchasing organization launched in the second quarter of 2020; continued strength in our specialty pharmacy business driven by 340B administration and increased pharmacy claims volumes, both of which were partially tempered by ongoing but stable client pricing pressure.  
Our retail business delivered strong results this quarter, again exceeding expectations. Total revenue of just under $25 billion increased by $2.3 billion or 10% year-over-year. There are 2 main components to this increase. Approximately half or $1.2 billion is attributable to the contributions from the more than 11 million COVID vaccines and over 8 million COVID tests we administered combined with strong front store sales driven by demand for over-the-counter COVID test kits and related treatment categories.  
With this quarter's results, we are now on pace to deliver about 44 million to 49 million COVID vaccines and 28 million to 33 million COVID tests for full year 2021. The remaining half or 1.1 billion was driven by a combination of sustained pharmacy growth and broad strength in front store trends across a range of categories partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure. This strong revenue growth, combined with a 70 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin, produced adjusted operating income that exceeded our forecast and drove a year-over-year increase of $300 million. This adjusted operating income growth driven by COVID testing vaccines and front store sales was partially tempered by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure, business investments, including the minimum wage increase and other performance incentives, and increased staffing to provide expanded levels of service.  
Turning to cash flows and the balance sheet. Our liquidity and capital position remained excellent at the end of the third quarter with cash from operations of $5.5 billion for the quarter and $14.3 billion year-to-date. Through our proactive liability management transaction in August, we paid down $1.1 billion in net long-term debt in the quarter.  
As of the end of the third quarter 2021, we have repaid a net total of $18.7 billion in long-term debt since the close of the Aetna transaction. In addition, we returned over $650 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend.  
Let me now discuss our updated 2021 guidance. As Karen noted earlier, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range this morning by $0.20 to $7.90 to $8 per share. This increase reflects the strong performance in pharmacy services and retail, partially offset by expected COVID pressure in our health care benefits business, specifically in the commercial block.  
We are raising our total revenue outlook to $286.5 billion to $290.3 billion and adjusted operating income outlook to $16.4 billion to $16.6 billion. We are also increasing expected full year cash flow from operations to a range of $13 billion to $13.5 billion. Note that this increased cash flow forecast is actually lower than our September year-to-date figure, reflecting expected payments in the fourth quarter that were accrued in 2020, including FICA taxes and increased minimum loss ratio rebates as well as the timing of receipts and payments between the third and fourth quarters.  
I'll now highlight some key items related to the segments and full year guidance. For the Health Care Benefits segment, we are lowering our full year adjusted operating income guidance from $5.25 billion to $5.35 billion to $4.9 billion to $5 billion. We expect the full year medical benefit ratio to be in a range of 84.4% to 85.6%, or an increase of 30 basis points from our prior range. This reflects the higher-than-expected commercial COVID medical costs observed in the third quarter and our expectation that these will continue, although at a lower level into the fourth quarter.  
Emerging October operational data indicate that COVID inpatient admissions are tracking at approximately half the levels of September. Again, it is important to remember the degree to which testing costs are driving expenses. So while we expect Q4 testing expenses to be lower than Q3, we do not anticipate they will decline as much as inpatient expense.  
Finally, recall the normal seasonality of the Health Care Benefits segment with fourth quarter operating income typically the lowest of the year driven by deductible satisfaction producing the highest quarterly medical costs. For pharmacy services, given the continued strength in the quarter and our visibility to the remainder of the year, we are increasing full year 2021 adjusted operating income guidance to $6.85 billion to $6.94 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 20.5% to 22%.  
We anticipate that the strength in third quarter pharmacy services results will largely continue into the fourth quarter. In the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we are also increasing our full year 2021 adjusted operating income guidance to $6.98 billion to $7.07 billion.  
As you consider the fourth quarter, I would note that we currently expect vaccinations to continue, although at a lower rate than the third quarter. We have also contemplated the impact of the CDC's COVID booster recommendations as well as a modest impact from pediatric vaccinations. We expect testing to decline modestly in comparison with the levels experienced during the third quarter.  
Given Retail's Q3 out-performance and Q4 outlook, we now expect the full year 2021 COVID impact to be neutral. This compares to our prior guidance in August for an overall modest negative net impact. You will find further details regarding our updated guidance in the slide presentation we posted to our website this morning.  
As we closed the third quarter, we are very pleased with the performance of our businesses, which provides us with a strong foundation as we now look ahead to 2022. While we plan to share more details with you at our upcoming Investor Day in early December in New York, I want to update you on our thoughts regarding the 2022 outlook.  
While there are still many factors to play out, we believe that current analyst estimates for 2022 adjusted EPS  of approximately $8.20 are within our anticipated initial guidance range. As we discussed last quarter, there are some significant moving pieces to keep in mind in determining an appropriate baseline for 2021.  
First, consistent with our standard practice, we exclude prior year's development net of profits returned to customers and net realized capital gains from our forward-looking guidance.  
Second, in 2022, we will incur a full year of expense related to our minimum wage increase announced last quarter. We estimate these factors combined represent approximately $0.40 per share. Using the midpoint of our updated 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range, which is $7.95, these adjustments create a 2021 baseline of $7.55. The other significant factor in considering 2022 performance is the effect that COVID will have on our retail and health care benefits businesses.  
For retail, we expect that COVID-19 vaccine and testing volume, which is expected to generate over $3 billion of revenue in 2021, will decline significantly in 2022 to 30% to 40% of the volume we administered in 2021. In addition, we expect COVID-driven front store sales to decline in 2022.  
For HCB, we expect to see a significant improvement in results in 2022, as treatment and testing costs decline with COVID cost estimates and improved risk-adjusted revenue reflected in our pricing.  
Overall, we estimate the COVID-driven impact in HCB will largely be offset by the expected decline in COVID-related retail performance. It is important to note that forecasts of future COVID impacts to our business remain extremely difficult and are subject to change as circumstances dictate.  
Beyond these considerations, Other factors affecting our growth for 2022 remain consistent with the commentary we provided last quarter regarding headwinds and tailwinds. With all of this in mind, the current consensus of analyst estimates of approximately $8.20 for adjusted EPS would represent about an 8% increase over the 2021 baseline.  
To conclude, the strong performance of CVS Health in the first half of 2021 continued in the third quarter, producing strong revenue, adjusted operating income and cash flow results, and we are pleased to again raise our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance.  
During the pandemic, we have solidified our opportunity to become a national leader in health care delivery, which at its core, starts and ends with lowering the cost of care, improving access and convenience, ultimately enabling people to live healthier and more fulfilling lives.  
During our Investor Day in a few weeks, we look forward to sharing with you more about our path over the coming years to deliver on this ambition and to position CVS Health to generate sustainable, low double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We will now open the call to your questions. Operator?"

As you think about that, either as an example for your network approach or just getting back to what's hopefully steady-state performance, how is the overall trend going relative to network participation, preferred network participation and what that means for CVS' ability to offset some of those COVID headwinds with sustained script growth and share gains."

I just want to better understand how do we think about the rollout of this in combination with the virtual 360 that you'll offer going into 2022. My first question would be, did you see the opportunity to really lower the cost trend when we think about those members that utilize, for example, the MinuteClinic and retail pharmacy of CVS? And is that being masked because of COVID that we're not really seeing that trend come through? 
And then secondly, as we think about plan design going into next year, can you maybe just spend a minute and talk about where you see the biggest opportunities? And do you feel the need to own or now employ primary care physicians?"

And we actually really look forward to sharing much more of our strategy when we meet in December, but let me just give you kind of a brief overview. I would start with, as we kind of look at the consumer, obviously, the consumer has been incredibly challenged by the complexity of the health care system. 
Our overall strategy is to make sure that we can provide them access points with lower cost, higher quality with convenience and overall engagement. And we think those factors will help us with the long-term strategy of driving down health care costs. 
As we think about our you mentioned our MinuteClinics and our trends. We have now 7.5 million people that have this 0 co-pay or low-cost co-pay. We have started to see the Aetna members utilizing those services. Obviously, that's a lower site of care. It is convenient. 
We've also expanded the services, as I mentioned earlier, adding behavioral health care. We've seen repeat customers coming there. So Obviously, we're starting to get traction with the Aetna members with these planned designs and we feel quite good about it. 
Now your question around primary care and what we think we need to do here is primary care is a small component of overall medical costs. I think we all recognize that, but it wields significant influence on the total medical cost picture. So as you think about us managing and navigating care for our patients, we really believe that we need to kind of push into the primary care, so we can influence the overall cost of care. And by doing that, we think that we can have better engagement help customers better navigate and obviously have higher quality, lower cost of care. And so that's the intent here of really pushing into primary care. And we expect to see continued evolution of our plan designs. 
If you think about our overall care strategy, it's virtual care, it's in the community and it's in the home. If you look at what we did this year with our virtual primary care offering, clearly, we were able to be in the market early. We have 750,000 people now that are eligible for that virtual primary care. We've connected that virtual primary care with an in-person connection with our MinuteClinics and also in the home with diagnostic biometric monitoring. So you can see that we're innovating around the consumer, and that's how we think we're going to really change the game in health care is innovating around the consumer."

When I think about why our sales -- why and where our sales came, it was in all segments of the market, right? We won in health plans. We won in Medicaid. We won in pretty much all segments that we participate in. And I think we win for 3 reasons. 
We win primarily because we have the best demonstrated ability to manage drug spend, particularly in specialty pharmacy, where you know it's critically important. We've maintained extraordinarily high levels of service and built on that service with a culture of transparency and building trust with our clients and aligning our incentives, and finally, on innovation and bringing new tools to market largely in the specialty area to help our clients better manage trend and create better experiences for both providers and patients."

And I'll answer the second one because it's fairly quickly in terms of my long-term kind of to get to the low double-digit EPS. What I'd say is that includes capital deployment. That capital deployment in some years can take the form of accretive share repurchase. Some years, it can take more of a form of M&A. And as Karen mentioned, our strategy will require the development of new capabilities. 
And I think while it's likely some of those we can do ourselves, I think there are some of those that will make more sense for us to acquire along the way. But it is a good and timely question around capital and long term. We're nearing the end of a sort of 3- or 4-year deleverage cycle. 
And I think the next 3 years are going to look different than the last 3 years. While we remain committed to our investment grade target and we will always sort of manage leverage responsibility. My first priority always with capital is to grow the business. And we mentioned that our strategy might require that. 
So from year to year, that can sort of move between, as I mentioned, share repurchase, dividend, M&A, but my experience is that a balanced deployment over time has tended to work best. And that might look like something with the M&A aspect a dividend that grows with EPS and some level of accretive share repurchase."

We have a partner, but it's -- I would say, it's mostly the CVS volume. 
With respect to 340B, there are a few things that drive the growth. So think about 340B in 2 ways, right? One is we provide third-party administrative services to covered entities. So as we grow the number of covered entities, we grow the size of the contribution. 
The second area is dispensing margin. We get paid a fixed fee for dispensing the drugs on behalf of the covered entities. So as volume grows, both because specialty is growing as an example, as our book of business grows from new wins and as our covered entity book of business grows, all 3 of those contribute to volume growth. 
Sorry, I would just add one last point was that, that volume growth substantially benefits the covered entities. And as you know, many of the covered entities are dependent upon the 340B program for their financial health."

So the increase is clearly COVID. As I mentioned, we do expect that we will see deferred utilization in the fourth quarter, but we're only assuming half the level that we experienced in Q3. And you could think about that a little bit from kind of where we are today, taking half the step back to kind of 0 deferred utilization. Where this is, is very similar to my commentary last time. Commercial has the least amount of deferred utilization right now in the system. And government also -- government probably has the most with Medicare having a little less than Medicaid at this stage. But we see all of those moving back towards normal in the fourth quarter and as we think about next year."

For the third quarter in a row, we are raising adjusted EPS guidance. Throughout 2021, we have made progress executing our strategy to deliver an integrated health care experience centered around the consumer. We sustained strong revenue growth in each of our core businesses, helped improve health outcomes and reduced costs by broadening access to quality care. We help fight the pandemic and reach millions of consumers with convenient, accessible care in communities across America. 
During the third quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 10%. This double-digit growth was led by membership gains in both Health Care Benefits and Pharmacy Services as well as higher volumes in retail. We grew adjusted operating income by 12.5%. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.97 and strong cash flow from operations of $5.5 billion. Given these results and our outlook, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $7.90 to $8. This higher guidance reflects the quarter's outperformance and continued positive momentum, which Shawn will discuss shortly. 
Third quarter results again demonstrate that our customers value how we bring together our unique portfolio of assets, our deep health care expertise and vast consumer touch points to meet health needs. There is strong demand for our integrated solutions across the health care continuum, including health management programs for chronic conditions, mental health support, pharmacy services and health and wellness products. 
We added over 1.3 million new integrated pharmacy and medical members through the 2021 and 2022 selling season. More customers are seeking complementary health services that work together, such as virtual care. Earlier this year, CVS Health launched the first national virtual primary care program. This market-leading solution offers a national network of physicians virtually and access to convenient face-to-face care in our MinuteClinic locations when needed, often with 0 co-pays. Our program has grown to 30 customer accounts with over 750,000 eligible members as of January 1, 2022. This is an indication of our ability to scale nationally and bring innovative products to the marketplace. 
Our customers recognize the importance of CVS Health's care solutions and the ease of access we now provide in the community, the home and virtually. Our high customer retention rates and new business wins are a testament to the strength of our business model. 
Health Care Benefits revenue increased 9.5% year-over-year. Strength in Government Services helped drive an adjusted operating income increase of 2.4% versus prior year despite higher costs related to COVID-19, net of deferred care primarily within our commercial book. We generated sequential membership growth across all 3 product lines in the quarter: Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. Our medical benefit ratio of 85.8% was above our expectations, driven by COVID-related costs, primarily driven by Commercial. Underlying non-COVID costs emerged in line with our expectations. We believe aggregate medical costs will slightly exceed baseline levels for the full year. 
We produced strong results in our Medicare business and grew membership both sequentially and year-over-year across all Medicare products. This reflects our strong product portfolio, STARs performance and reputation for service excellence. Year-to-date, Medicare Advantage membership has grown 9.2%. In 2022, we anticipate we will achieve double-digit growth in individual Medicare and generate strong momentum in dual eligibles. Our strong performance in STARs continues, as you saw for 2022, with 87% of our members in STAR plans rated 4 and higher, up from 83% in 2021.  
In our Commercial business, we expect moderate growth in 2022 for national accounts, driven by both increased sales, which are up approximately 50% year-over-year, and a 95% client retention rate. As we mentioned earlier this year, we are reentering the individual exchanges in 8 states as of January 2022. Enrollment began on Monday, and we anticipate our co-branded CVS/Aetna offering and benefit design focused on consumer choice will result in gains of at least 100,000 new members in 2022. 
Turning to Pharmacy Services. We delivered third quarter revenue growth of 9.3% and adjusted operating income growth of 9.5% year-over-year. For the 2022 selling season, we achieved a 98% retention rate. We drove $10.4 billion of gross new business, resulting in $8.9 billion of net new business wins, providing evidence of our market-leading trend management, transparency, customer service and integrated offerings. 
We continue to be a leader in specialty pharmacy with programs that drive value in the marketplace, provide substantive savings to customers and differentiate us as we pair programs with digital assets. We maintained a strong momentum this quarter with specialty revenue up 8.7% versus prior year. Our service excellence and top-tier execution are key areas of differentiation. 
Our Retail segment continues to play a critical role as a local health destination for millions of Americans. Retail outperformed both expectations and the industry in the third quarter. We delivered 10% revenue growth and 22% adjusted operating income growth year-over-year. Pharmacy sales and prescriptions filled both increased 8% year-over-year, largely driven by COVID-19 vaccine administration and core Pharmacy Services. Our patient satisfaction scores remained high with approximately 90% satisfied with their experience in our CVS Health locations. 
We continue to support millions of Americans for COVID-19 testing and vaccine administration. We administered 11.6 million COVID-19 vaccines and 8.5 million COVID-19 tests in the quarter. Since our program began, we have administered 43 million vaccines and approximately 38 million tests. We also expanded our digital capabilities to provide universal access to CVS Health vaccination records to the millions of adults we have vaccinated. This new capability has driven over 1 million visits per month to vaccination records on cvs.com. This provides another opportunity for us to build deeper engagement with our customers while simplifying and connecting their health experience. 
Front store sales momentum also continued with revenue growth of 13% versus prior year. Front store sales were led by consumer demand for COVID-19 home testing kits as well as cough and cold products with year-over-year volume increases across most front store categories. 
Our CVS Health Retail presence consistently serves as a strong channel for capturing new lives. In fact, this year, 12.5% of new COVID-19 testing customers chose to fill new prescriptions or receive a COVID-19 vaccination with CVS Health. Finally, we anticipate a benefit from administering boosters, and pediatric doses to eligible consumers will occur largely in the fourth quarter of this year. 
We continue to make measurable progress with our strategy to deliver a superior customer experience and address the total cost of care. We have focused on several important areas. First, with our unique portfolio of businesses, we continue to expand our role in care delivery designed around the customer. We are taking a proactive approach to meeting the emerging needs of customers, clients and communities. We are improving access, lowering costs and combining local points of care to simplify the consumer health experience. 
We have one of the country's largest network of physician extenders and are able to deliver care locally with our national footprint. We will continue to drive higher engagement with customers as we evolve the format of select CVS locations, creating community health destinations and shifting into 3 distinct models: sites dedicated to offering primary care services, an enhanced version of HealthHUBs with products and services designed for everyday health and wellness needs, our traditional CVS Pharmacy store model that provides prescription services and health and wellness and other convenient retail offerings. Our unique combination of businesses and our presence in communities nationwide enable us to meet consumers where they are to enhance their well-being and to be a bigger part of their wellness. 
Next, we are further strengthening the consumer experience through the expansion of digital services and platforms that connect to health services and in-person channels for our more than 35 million unique digital customers. For example, more than 70% of CVS Pharmacy customers are enrolled in our text messaging program today. Within that group this quarter, adherence outreach drove 10% growth in prescriptions filled. Greater adherence leads to improved health outcomes and lower costs. 
In today's hyper-connected, digital consumer-driven world, the demand for omnichannel pharmacy is greater than ever. We continue to modernize our operating systems and enhance the integration of pharmacy models, simplifying consumer interactions and driving further engagement with our customers. 
Finally, we continue to invest in our employees as part of our workforce strategy. Last quarter, we announced a phased increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour by July 2022. We invested in modernizing our training programs and technology for our frontline and clinical colleagues. Despite the tight labor market and anticipation of the higher demand for health services, we strengthened our workforce in every business. We hired a record number of people in the third quarter to advance open enrollment and customer service as well as enhance technology and clinical capabilities. Nearly 20,000 pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and nurses recently joined the CVS Health team, supporting flu season as well as COVID-19 vaccinations and testing. Our pharmacists and pharmacy technicians are an integral part of our overall workforce strategy. We are committed to investing in our pharmacists, awarding immunization bonuses in the second half of this year. We look forward to sharing more about our strategy to improve access, quality and customer engagement at Investor Day on December 9.  
Our commitment to shareholders, customers and communities remain steadfast. Health equity is critical as the pandemic continues to disproportionately impact certain communities. In addition to targeted vaccine and booster education efforts, we provided 31 million meals this year to people suffering from food insecurity and invested in 2,800 affordable housing units in 30 cities. By helping address the social determinants of health, permanent housing can reduce health care costs by 59%. We recently hired our first-ever Chief Health Equity Officer, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, to build upon our efforts to advance health equity and better support underserved communities. And our increased wages and bonuses support our employees, their families and their communities.  
For the third quarter in a row, we executed on and exceeded our plan and raised adjusted EPS guidance. We continue to enhance our diverse portfolio of assets to serve the customer. We are guiding to a strong year-end, all possible due to the leadership and commitment of our over 300,000 CVS Health colleagues that bring their heart to every moment of our customers' health. 
With that, let me turn it over to Shawn."

Our third quarter results reflect a continuation of the strong performance observed in the first half of 2021 as we exceeded our expectations from both a revenue, cash flow and adjusted earnings per share basi",2302,"Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect a continuation of the strong performance observed in the first half of 2021 as we exceeded our expectations from both a revenue, cash flow and adjusted earnings per share basis. These results ensue from our differentiated portfolio of capabilities and keen focus on operational execution. This momentum in our performance enables us once again to raise our outlook for 2021. 
Starting with the enterprise as a whole. Total revenues of $73.8 billion increased 10% year-over-year with robust growth in all 3 segments. We reported adjusted operating income of $4.1 billion, a 12.5% increase versus the prior year. This growth in adjusted operating income was also reflected in the strong cash flow generation in the third quarter, with year-to-date cash flow from operations now exceeding $14 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.97 represent a nearly 19% year-over-year increase, generated by our adjusted operating income growth and lower interest expense resulting from our ongoing deleveraging efforts. 
Moving to the segments. Health Care Benefits revenue increased by 9.5% year-over-year, driven by sustained growth in our Government Services business, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurance fee. In the third quarter, we saw Medicaid membership grow sequentially by 67,000 members across multiple geographies. Medicare Advantage membership also continued to grow in the quarter, increasing by 42,000 members sequentially and representing year-over-year growth of 9.8%. Our Medicare Advantage franchise continues to be a powerful growth engine with Medicare Advantage membership more than doubling since the third quarter of 2015, representing a 15% compound annual growth rate. Our attention has now turned to ensuring a successful 2022 annual enrollment period for Medicare, which began on October 1. While still quite early in that process, we are pleased with what we have seen to date. 
Health Care Benefits adjusted operating income grew modestly year-over-year but fell below our expectations for the quarter due to higher-than-expected COVID-related medical costs in our Commercial business. With the surge in nationwide COVID cases emanating from the Delta variant, we experienced higher-than-expected COVID-related medical costs in August and September. Three key factors drove this difference versus our expectations. First, commercial COVID inpatient admissions in August and September were in line with the peak levels experienced in January 2021 and were nearly 3x the average of the second quarter of 2021. 
Second, COVID testing costs, which we had expected to moderate during the third quarter, also approached to January 2021 levels and were more than 1.5x the average we experienced in the second quarter. It is critical to recognize the outsized impact of COVID testing on overall claim costs as testing costs represented approximately 35% of gross COVID costs in the quarter. 
And finally, while non-COVID deferred care was better than we had forecast, it was not enough to entirely offset these higher COVID costs in Commercial. The resultant medical benefit ratio for the quarter of 85.8% was above our forecast and driven almost entirely by the higher-than-expected commercial COVID testing and treatment costs. 
There are 2 important aspects of HCB's third quarter performance to note. One, absent these COVID dynamics, underlying performance in our Commercial book of business continues to be in line with our expectations. Two, in our Government Services business, we also saw an increase in COVID treatment and testing costs but far less pronounced than in Commercial. This lower level of increase was fully offset by better-than-expected deferred care. As a result, the overall performance of our Government Services businesses was in line with expectations. 
Wrapping up HCB. We experienced favorable prior period development in the quarter on both Commercial and Government products. Days claims payable of 51 at the end of the third quarter is 3 days higher sequentially and 2 days above prior year. While influenced by many factors, with the anticipated abatement in COVID-related claims in the fourth quarter, we would expect DCP to return to a more typical result in Q4. Overall, we remain comfortable with the adequacy of our reserves. 
Turning to Pharmacy Services. Our ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth remains clear. 2021 is expected to be the second year of adjusted operating income growth in excess of 10%. This sustained growth has been driven by our track record of delivering industry-leading drug trend on behalf of our clients; our proven industry-leading capabilities, particularly in the specialty pharmacy arena; and our outstanding customer service, as reflected by our over 98% renewal rate for 2022. 
During the third quarter, pharmacy revenues increased by 9.3% year-over-year, driven by increased pharmacy claims volume, growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation. Total pharmacy membership increased by 1.6 million lives sequentially, primarily reflecting growth in government programs. Total pharmacy claims processed grew nearly 7% above the prior year. Nearly half of this growth was attributable to net new 2021 business, with COVID vaccine administration and new therapy prescriptions also contributing to the year-over-year growth. Note that new therapy prescriptions were adversely impacted in the third quarter 2020 due to the pandemic. 
Pharmacy adjusted operating income exceeded expectations in the quarter, up more than $150 million or 9.5% year-over-year. The 3 major drivers of this increase remain consistent with the second quarter: improved purchasing economics, reflecting the products and services of our group purchasing organization launched in the second quarter of 2020; continued strength in our specialty pharmacy business, driven by 340B administration and increased pharmacy claims volumes, both of which were partially tempered by ongoing but stable client pricing pressure. 
Our retail business delivered strong results this quarter, again exceeding expectations. Total revenue of just under $25 billion increased by $2.3 billion or 10% year-over-year. There are 2 main components to this increase. Approximately half or $1.2 billion is attributable to the contributions from the more than 11 million COVID vaccines and over 8 million COVID tests we administered, combined with strong front store sales driven by demand for over-the-counter COVID test kits and related treatment categories. With this quarter's results, we are now on pace to deliver about 44 million to 49 million COVID vaccines and 28 million to 33 million COVID tests for full year 2021. 
The remaining half or $1.1 billion was driven by a combination of sustained pharmacy growth and broad strength in front store trends across a range of categories, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure. This strong revenue growth, combined with a 70 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin, produced adjusted operating income that exceeded our forecast and drove a year-over-year increase of $300 million. This adjusted operating income growth, driven by COVID testing, vaccines and front store sales, was partially tempered by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure; business investments, including the minimum wage increase and other performance incentives; and increased staffing to provide expanded levels of service. 
Turning to cash flows and the balance sheet. Our liquidity and capital position remained excellent at the end of the third quarter with cash from operations of $5.5 billion for the quarter and $14.3 billion year-to-date. Through our proactive liability management transaction in August, we paid down $1.1 billion in net long-term debt in the quarter. As of the end of the third quarter 2021, we have repaid a net total of $18.7 billion in long-term debt since the close of the Aetna transaction. In addition, we returned over $650 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend. 
Let me now discuss our updated 2021 guidance. As Karen noted earlier, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range this morning by $0.20 to $7.90 to $8 per share. This increase reflects the strong performance in Pharmacy Services and Retail, partially offset by expected COVID pressure in our Health Care Benefits business, specifically in the Commercial block. 
We are raising our total revenue outlook to $286.5 billion to $290.3 billion and adjusted operating income outlook to $16.4 billion to $16.6 billion. We are also increasing expected full year cash flow from operations to a range of $13 billion to $13.5 billion. Note that this increased cash flow forecast is actually lower than our September year-to-date figure, reflecting expected payments in the fourth quarter that were accrued in 2020, including FICA taxes and increased minimum loss ratio rebates as well as the timing of receipts and payments between the third and fourth quarters. 
I'll now highlight some key items related to the segments and full year guidance. For the Health Care Benefits segment, we are lowering our full year adjusted operating income guidance from $5.25 billion to $5.35 billion to $4.9 billion to $5 billion. We expect the full year medical benefit ratio to be in a range of 84.4% to 85.6% or an increase of 30 basis points from our prior range. This reflects the higher-than-expected commercial COVID medical costs observed in the third quarter and our expectation that these will continue, although at a lower level, into the fourth quarter. 
Emerging October operational data indicate that COVID inpatient admissions are tracking at approximately half the levels of September. Again, it is important to remember the degree to which testing costs are driving expenses. So while we expect Q4 testing expenses to be lower than Q3, we do not anticipate they will decline as much as inpatient expense. Finally, recall the normal seasonality of the Health Care Benefits segment with fourth quarter operating income typically the lowest of the year driven by deductible satisfaction producing the highest quarterly medical costs. 
For Pharmacy Services, given the continued strength in the quarter and our visibility to the remainder of the year, we are increasing full year 2021 adjusted operating income guidance to $6.85 billion to $6.94 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 20.5% to 22%. We anticipate that the strength in third quarter Pharmacy Services results will largely continue into the fourth quarter. 
In the Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we are also increasing our full year 2021 adjusted operating income guidance to $6.98 billion to $7.07 billion. As you consider the fourth quarter, I would note that we currently expect vaccinations to continue, although at a lower rate than the third quarter. We have also contemplated the impact of the CDC's COVID booster recommendations as well as a modest impact from pediatric vaccinations. We expect testing to decline modestly in comparison with the levels experienced during the third quarter. 
Given Retail's Q3 outperformance and Q4 outlook, we now expect the full year 2021 COVID impact to be neutral. This compares to our prior guidance in August for an overall modest negative net impact. You will find further details regarding our updated guidance in the slide presentation we posted to our website this morning. 
As we closed the third quarter, we are very pleased with the performance of our businesses, which provides us with a strong foundation as we now look ahead to 2022. While we plan to share more details with you at our upcoming Investor Day in early December in New York, I want to update you on our thoughts regarding the 2022 outlook. While there are still many factors to play out, we believe that current analyst estimates for 2022 adjusted EPS of approximately $8.20 are within our anticipated initial guidance range. 
As we discussed last quarter, there are some significant moving pieces to keep in mind in determining an appropriate baseline for 2021. First, consistent with our standard practice, we exclude prior year's development net of profits returned to customers and net realized capital gains from our forward-looking guidance. Second, in 2022, we will incur a full year of expense related to our minimum wage increase announced last quarter. We estimate these factors combined represent approximately $0.40 per share. Using the midpoint of our updated 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range, which is $7.95, these adjustments create a 2021 baseline of $7.55. 
The other significant factor in considering 2022 performance is the effect that COVID will have on our Retail and Health Care Benefits businesses. For Retail, we expect that COVID-19 vaccine and testing volume, which is expected to generate over $3 billion of revenue in 2021, will decline significantly in 2022 to 30% to 40% of the volume we administered in 2021. In addition, we expect COVID-driven front store sales to decline in 2022. 
For HCB, we expect to see a significant improvement in results in 2022, as treatment and testing costs decline with COVID cost estimates and improved risk-adjusted revenue reflected in our pricing. Overall, we estimate the COVID-driven impact in HCB will largely be offset by the expected decline in COVID-related Retail performance. 
It is important to note that forecasts of future COVID impacts to our business remain extremely difficult and are subject to change as circumstances dictate. Beyond these considerations, other factors affecting our growth for 2022 remain consistent with the commentary we provided last quarter regarding headwinds and tailwinds. With all of this in mind, the current consensus of analyst estimates of approximately $8.20 for adjusted EPS would represent about an 8% increase over the 2021 baseline. 
To conclude, the strong performance of CVS Health in the first half of 2021 continued in the third quarter, producing strong revenue, adjusted operating income and cash flow results. And we are pleased to again raise our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance. During the pandemic, we have solidified our opportunity to become a national leader in health care delivery, which, at its core, starts and ends with lowering the cost of care, improving access and convenience, ultimately enabling people to live healthier and more fulfilling lives. During our Investor Day in a few weeks, we look forward to sharing with you more about our path over the coming years to deliver on this ambition and to position CVS Health to generate sustainable, low double-digit adjusted EPS growth.

I just want to better understand, how do we think about the rollout of this in combination with the virtual 360 that you'll offer going into 2022? My first question would be, did you see the opportunity to really lower the cost trend when we think about those members that utilized, for example, the MinuteClinic and the retail pharmacy of CVS? And is that being masked because of COVID that we're not really seeing that trend come through? 
And then secondly, as we think about plan design going into next year, can you maybe just spend a minute and talk about where you see the biggest opportunities? And do you feel the need to own or now employ primary care physicians?"

And we actually really look forward to sharing much more of our strategy when we meet in December, but let me just give you kind of a brief overview. I would start with, as we kind of look at the consumer, obviously, the consumer has been incredibly challenged by the complexity of the health care system. And our overall strategy is to make sure that we can provide them access points with lower costs, higher quality, with convenience and overall engagement. And we think those factors will help us with the long-term strategy of driving down health care costs. 
As we think about our -- you mentioned our MinuteClinics and our trends. We have now 7.5 million people that have this 0 co-pay or low-cost co-pay. We have started to see the Aetna members utilizing those services. Obviously, that's a lower site of care. It is convenient. We've also expanded the services, as I mentioned earlier, adding behavioral health care. We've seen repeat customers coming there. So obviously, we're starting to get traction with the Aetna members, with these plan designs, and we feel quite good about it. 
Now your question around primary care and what we think we need to do here is primary care is a small component of overall medical costs, I think we all recognize that. But it wields significant influence on the total medical cost picture. So as you think about us managing and navigating care for our patients, we really believe that we need to kind of push into the primary care so that we can influence the overall cost of care. And by doing that, we think that we can have better engagement, help customers better navigate and obviously have higher quality, lower cost of care. And so that's the intent here of really pushing into primary care. And we expect to see continued evolution of our plan designs. 
If you think about our overall care strategy, it's virtual care, it's in the community, and it's in the home. If you look at what we did this year with our virtual primary care offering, clearly, we were able to be in the market early. We have 750,000 people now that are eligible for that virtual primary care. We've connected that virtual primary care with an in-person connection with our MinuteClinics and also in the home with diagnostic biometric monitoring. So you can see that we're innovating around the consumer, and that's how we think we're going to really change the game in health care is innovating around the consumer."

But many of those were active, competitive RFPs. 
When I think about why our sales -- why and where our sales came, it was in all segments of the market, right? We won in health plans. We won in Medicaid. We won in pretty much all segments that we participate in, and I think we win for 3 reasons. We win primarily because we have the best demonstrated ability to manage drug spend, particularly in specialty pharmacy, where you know it's critically important. We've maintained extraordinarily high levels of service and built on that service with a culture of transparency and building trust with our clients and aligning our incentives. And finally, on innovation and bringing new tools to market largely in the specialty area to help our clients better manage trend and create better experiences for both providers and patients."

But as you think about managing around the consumer, we have a tremendous amount of assets in our portfolio today, which we can build off on. However, there will be additional capabilities that we think we need to either partner or buy. So that will be part of our overall strategy, and I'll ask Shawn to comment on your other questions."

And I'll answer the second one because it's fairly quickly in terms of my long-term kind of goal to get to the low double-digit EPS. That -- what I'd say is that includes capital deployment. That capital deployment in some years can take the form of accretive share repurchase. Some years, it can take more of a form of M&A. And as Karen mentioned, our strategy will require the development of new capabilities. And I think while it's likely some of those we can do ourselves, I think there are some of those that will make more sense for us to acquire along the way. 
But it is a good and timely question around capital and long term. We're nearing the end of a sort of 3- or 4-year deleverage cycle. And I think the next 3 years are going to look different than the last 3 years. The -- while we remain committed to our investment-grade target and we will always sort of manage leverage responsibility, my first priority always with capital is to grow the business. And we mentioned that our strategy might require that. 
So from year to year, that can sort of move between, as I mentioned, share repurchase, dividend, M&A. But my experience is that a balanced deployment over time has tended to work best. And that might look like something with the M&A aspect, a dividend that grows with EPS and some level of accretive share repurchase."

Relative to expansion of PBM profit per script, I think kind of 2 items I'd like to focus in on here. One, with the GPO benefits, is this primarily CVS or is Zinc benefiting from added partners and their scale? And then on 340B, is this development of new strategies to serve covered entities? Or is it natural growth in the program? What's the driver in that piece?"

We have a partner, but it's -- I would say, it's mostly the CVS volume. 
With respect to 340B, there are a few things that drive the growth. So think about 340B in 2 ways, right? One is we provide third-party administrative services to covered entities. So as we grow the number of covered entities, we grow the size of the contribution. The second area is dispensing margin. We get paid a fixed fee for dispensing the drugs on behalf of the covered entities. So as volume grows, both because specialty is growing as an example, as our book of business grows from new wins and as our covered entity book of business grows, all 3 of those contribute to volume growth. 
Sorry, I would just add last point was that, that volume growth substantially benefits the covered entities. And as you know, many of the covered entities are dependent upon the 340B program for their financial health."

It creates a really tremendous administrative burden for everyone in the system. I think at this point, when you think about transparency and rebates, essentially all large clients or even midsized clients now have a 100% pass-through of rebates. Many of them have extensive audit rights. So to some extent, I think this is, quite frankly, solving a problem that's already been solved commercially."

Fairly consistently over the last couple of quarters, the non-COVID utilization has been at and even better in some places than expected. So the underlying business continues to look strong from that regard. So the increase is clearly COVID. 
As I mentioned, we do expect that we will see deferred utilization in the fourth quarter, but we're only assuming half the level that we experienced in Q3. And you could think about that a little bit from kind of where we are today, taking half the step back to kind of 0 deferred utilization. Where this is, is very similar to my commentary last time. Commercial has the least amount of deferred utilization right now in the system. And government also -- government probably has the most with Medicare having a little less than Medicaid at this stage. But we see all of those moving back towards normal in the fourth quarter and as we think about next year."
