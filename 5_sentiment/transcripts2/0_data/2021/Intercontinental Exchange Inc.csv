I'll begin on slide 4 with some key highlights from 2020 and a summary of our strong fourth quarter results. Earnings per share of $4.51 were up 16% year-over-year on record revenues of over $6 billion. Free cash flow totaled a record $2.4 billion and we returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We also use some of that cash and our strong credit profile to make the important strategic acquisition of Ellie Mae in September. An acquisition that was nearly 3% accretive to our full year 2020 earnings per share. Our fourth quarter results were an exclamation point on a great year. Our earnings per share totaled $1.13, up   19%   year-over-year. Net revenue totaled approximately $1.7 billion, a 14% increase on a pro forma basis. While we've now transitioned to new segment reporting, I'll mention that fourth quarter data services revenues totaled $595 million, which was at the high end of our guidance range and up 6% year-over-year. For the full year, despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic, our data sales teams focused on serving our customers deliver data services revenues that grew 5% over the prior year, and were near the top of our guidance entering the year. 
Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $712 million. We were above the high end of our guidance, largely driven by lower levels of capitalized labor as our technology teams who delivered near flawless execution, while largely working from home for most of 2020, took some well-deserved vacation to recharge from an extraordinary year. 
Now let's move to slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled $871 million, up 6% year-over-year. Transaction revenues increased 7%, driven by 6% growth in our Energy business and 21% growth in cash equities and options trading. Importantly, through the end of January, our energy open interest, which we believe is the best indicator of long-term growth was up 4% versus a year ago, including 11% growth in our global natural gas business and 5% growth in our environmental complex. Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data and listing services, increased 3% year-over-year. These results were driven by the NYSE share of strong year-over-year growth in industry ship revenues. Looking to the first quarter, we expect recurring revenues in the Exchange segment to be between $310 million and $315 million. 
Turning now to slide 6. I'll discuss our fixed income and data services segment. Fourth quarter revenues for the segment grew 3% year-over-year. While transaction revenues declined   16%  , recurring revenues, which account for nearly 90% of total segment revenues grew 6% year-over-year. Fixed income Data & Analytics, which includes our leading pricing and reference data and index business increased by 7%, an acceleration from 6% growth in the third quarter. Other data and network services grew 5% in the fourth quarter, driven by continued growth in customer demand for both ICE global network and consolidated feeds. 
Looking to 2021, we expect recurring revenues in this segment to grow 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis for the full year, including $395 million to $400 million in the first quarter. These expectations are supported by ASV growth of 5.7% exiting 2020. 
Please flip to slide 7, where I'll discuss the results in our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. Mortgage Technology revenues grew 65% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 56% for the full year. Fourth quarter transaction revenues increased 92% year-over-year. Favorable financing conditions, accelerating millennial homeownership trends and demand for digital workflow tools, such as our Network, Closing solutions and analytics all contributed to our strong results. Recurring revenues increased 29% versus the prior year as increased utilization and new customer adoption of both our Origination technology and Analytics continue to expand our subscription base. We expect recurring revenues in the first quarter to range between   $122 million   and $127 million, representing around 30% growth versus last year on a pro forma basis. 
I'll conclude my remarks on slide 8 with some additional guidance. We expect 2021 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $2.83 billion to $2.88 billion. We expect the spinout of that to reduce expenses versus last year by $50 million. And as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we expect roughly $20 million of additional D&A expense in our Mortgage segment. In addition, we plan to invest $25 million to $30 million to enhance our Mortgage Technology platforms to support the significant growth in customers and volumes that we've seen over the past few years and which we expect to continue. With those items roughly netting out, our year-over-year expense growth will be largely consistent with prior years, including investments in our people and tied to revenue growth. We expect compensation expense across ICE to increase by $40 million to $50 million. Expenses tied to revenue growth are expected to increase $15 million to $25 million, and FX, based on current spot rates, will add $10 million to $15 million, which will be more than offset by a positive impact to revenues. 
For the first quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $720 million to $730 million, including roughly $23 million related to Bakkt. 
In summary, we delivered a very strong finish to another record year. We once again grew revenues, operating income, free cash flow and earnings per share. We grew our dividend and returned nearly   $2 billion   to our shareholders. At the same time, we invested in our business to meet the needs of our customers while also expanding our Mortgage Technology network through the acquisition of Ellie Mae. As a result, we've set the stage for continued top and bottom line growth and enhance shareholder returns into 2021 and beyond. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll hand it to Ben to discuss some additional business highlights and key growth initiatives."

Please turn to slide 9, where I'll begin with some of the highlights and key initiatives across our Global Energy business. While inflation, economic growth, and geopolitics will always influence volume trends in a particular quarter or year. We are focusing on investing in the structural growth opportunities that exist across global energy markets. Investments that have been critical to the 7% average annual revenue growth we have generated across our energy and environmental network over the last 5 years. In our oil markets, we soon plan to launch ICE futures Abu dhabi or IFAD. This is a launch in partnership with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, or ADNOC, and 9 of the world's largest energy trading firms. For the first time, this new exchange will offer futures on Murban crude oil, an important price benchmark for crude flowing through to Asia. And by leveraging the existing breadth of our energy network, we will launch an array of related differentials, cracks and intercommodity spreads against our Brent, WTI, gas oil and naphtha benchmarks. In our natural gas markets, the demand centers of Europe and Asia are increasingly at the forefront of global price formation. We began investing in the globalization of gas markets over a decade ago, at a time when exchange-traded volume in our TTF contract was less than 10% of total trading activity. Today, exchange-traded volume is approaching 50%, with open interest in TTF, growing at an average annual rate of nearly 40% since 2015. 
This growing network also plays an important role in the growth of our global environmental markets, where the number of market participants has grown by 40% since 2017 as customers increasingly seek solutions to help navigate the long tail and the complex evolution of global energy markets. 
Turning to slide 10. ICE Mortgage Technology is at the center of an analog-to-digital conversion as customers demand greater workflow automation. In addition, an acceleration of millennial home buying and attractive refinancing conditions continue to provide a tailwind to our robust results. Pro forma Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $1.2 billion in 2020, ahead of the high end of the range we expected for all of 2021 and when we announced the acquisition of Ellie Mae back in August. As we execute against this   $10 billion   addressable market, our approach has been and will be similar to the blueprint we apply across our other networks. 
We will invest behind secular growth, both organically and through acquisition. By adding new tools and content to enhance the value proposition of our network. As a recent example, during the fourth quarter, we launched our credit analyzer. A product that leverages our artificial intelligence engine, or AIQ, to reduce the time it takes to perform a credit review by up to 80%. In 2021, we plan to begin rolling out new eClose solutions, an initiative that we believe has a   $1 billion   addressable market. And we continue to see strong customer uptake across our network and our data and analytics offerings as we execute our strategy of relieving the pain points and inefficiencies that exist across the workflow. 
Turning to slide 11. Our proprietary price evaluation serves as the cornerstone of a network that is uniquely positioned to capture growth opportunities across the fixed income ecosystem. As an example, we are a leading solutions provider to the fixed income ETF industry, which, as many of you know, has seen assets under management grow at an average annual rate of 25% over the last 5 years. Our decades-long position as a leading provider of price information and reference data has served as the foundation for what is today the second largest provider of fixed income indices globally. While critical, our price information and our indices are only a part of what we offer to this growing industry. 
In late 2019, we launched our ETF Hub, a network we designed to reduce the workflow inefficiencies that exist within the ETF create redeem process. Late last year, we integrated ICE Chat, a platform that we acquired in 2008 and have since grown to over 100,000 users. We also linked ETF Hub to our ice fixed income Select platform, providing access to our fixed income data and analytics as well as seamless connectivity to our trading venues. 
As a leading provider of these proprietary data services, we have also developed an expertise in the gathering and cleansing of unstructured data, essentially, a skill in building the databases that serve as the foundation for developing actionable insights and identifying opportunities, not only in the fixed income markets, but across many other asset classes as well. This is an expertise we are leveraging through new product development, such as our suite of ESG data services and some early mortgage data initiatives, which will leverage our growing mortgage technology network. This also applies to new partnerships, such as our announcement to apply our data services expertise to ADP's unstructured workforce data to help bring additional insights into the municipal bond markets. 
As we move into 2021, we are excited about the many opportunities for growth that lie ahead, opportunities that we're able to capture because of the investments we've made in the past and the strategic investments we will continue to make across our networks into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

Please turn to slide 12. Over 2 years ago and in collaboration with Starbucks and Microsoft, among others, we seeded a venture within ICE called Bakkt. Our vision was to leverage our collective core competencies to build a regulated ecosystem that would support the full life cycle of a digital asset, and through efficiency gains and greater transparency, a platform that would have strong network effects within a nascent but rapidly growing asset class. Since launching Bakkt in 2018, we've applied our blueprint. We've invested in organic product development by building a consumer wallet and launching futures and options contracts. And we've made inorganic investments by purchasing Bridge2 solutions and adding digital custody services. In January, Bakkt announced that it will merge with a sPac, managed by Victory Park capital. The transaction valued Bakkt at an enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion, of which we will retain a 65% economic interest. Our decision to merge Bakkt was threefold. First, the combination will provide significant incremental capital, enabling Bakkt to maximize its future growth potential. Second, by listing as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange, Bakkt will benefit from elevated consumer brand recognition. And third, we believe this transaction will unlock value for ICE shareholders. Value that we believe was not fully recognized within the ICE share price. And as you've often heard us say, I believe 1 of the most important parts of my job and the job of the management team here at ICE is to leverage our infrastructure and our expertise to create value for our shareholders. In that vein and shifting to what was another successful year, 2020 marked our 15th consecutive year of record adjusted earnings per share, a track record of growth that began with our initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005 and has compounded at an average annualized rate of 17% ever since. 
Our strategic approach to delivering this growth and building shareholder value has been consistent since our inception. Through the application of our world-class technology, leading operating expertise and our unique position both as a creator and distributor of proprietary data services, we create workflow efficiencies that add transparency and that drives powerful network effects across the asset classes that we operate. And as we've expanded into new asset classes, we've grown our addressable market, broadened our expertise and further solidified a foundation for growth well into the future. 2020 was a year of incredible global challenges. Our customers needed to find ways to protect their employees while continuing to do business as they procured and accessed our products. Our ICE colleagues responded with extraordinary resourcefulness to meet our customer needs. So thank you to our customers for their business and their trust. And thank you to my colleagues at ICE for their remarkable contribution to the best fourth quarter in our company's history, resulting in another consecutive record year of revenues and earnings. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Kate, and we'll conduct an question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern time."

We did want to continue to give transparency in our guidance on those elements of our business that are recurring and a little easier to predict in some of the volume-based business. And you're exactly right that if you add up the total of the recurring guides, it's around midpoint $830 million of revenue, which is just less than half of the overall business. If you look at, we've given you that detail on a pro forma basis, historically, and if you do the math on the guide in the first quarter, those recurring revenues are growing 7% to 9%. So very strong performance on a very stable part of our business right out of the gate, obviously, led by a strong performance in the Mortgage business, which has picked up customers picked up volume from existing customers, but then also the Data business, which, again, despite the pandemic, as I said in my remarks, sales team did a remarkable job and put us in a position where ASV was nearly 6% entering this year. So we feel very good about those recurring businesses, and we intend to continue to give you each quarter, our perspective on what we expect of those revenues to be. 
You asked specifically about the recurring nature of the mortgage business. I'll let Ben give you a little color on what's driving that great performance."

So the first thing to start with is on the mortgage side of the business, when someone subscribes to come on to our network, they're getting our full platform and our network services as part of that. So there's a base level of subscription fee that someone's paying to be a part of that, and that's really what that recurring revenue piece is. And when we analyze the deal, 1 of the exciting things that we saw under the covers here and that I've talked about in terms of the different TAMs that we can go after here with this business, out of that $10 billion TAM,   $4 billion   of it alone is just in the origination side. And automating that whole origination process. And we had seen that Ellie Mae had increased market share from 38% to 44% in a pretty short period of time, and we had conviction that they're going to continue to grow market share in that space. And I'm pleased to say that under the covers, what we've seen in terms of sales performance, and I even highlighted this on the last quarterly earnings call, back in October that the sales results have been phenomenal in terms of selling new versions of our loan origination system into new customers and then also cross-sells of our products into the customer base. And to go into that even a little bit further in Q3 and Q4 the company set all-time records in terms of bookings on the encompass loan origination system. So Q3 and Q4 were the 2 highest quarters ever in the company's history. Q4 across the entire Ellie Mae product set was the largest bookings quarter ever in the company's history. So all of that are real tailwinds, and Scott gave the guide to the Q1 recurring revenue for the business as well and why we feel really strong about the business' ability to grow that recurring revenue base regardless of volume environments."

And then we are convinced that on an annual basis, we can grow this business, and this business will grow 8% to 10% per year on average over 10 years. And underneath the covers, as I just referenced in the answer I gave to Rich. If you look under the covers of what's happened with that business since we've acquired it, sales strength has been very strong. So I mentioned a couple of the encompass records that we saw over the last couple of quarters. Also -- and that's $4 billion of the $10 billion TAM, another $4 billion of that $10 billion TAM is around data and analytics. And we also saw record sales of our AIQ platform, so record bookings of the analyzers that are automating that origination workflow in the fourth quarter. We continue to see strength across encompass as well as AIQ in January, and we're ahead in January than where we thought we were going to be in terms of our model. What this means is that as we're hitting these types of sales results and sales records for the company, it obviously means there's going to be more recurring revenue into the business. It means there's going to be more customers on the business. There's going to be more loans that are on the platform that are now on our network, loans that we did not interact with before. And more loans on our network interact with the third parties on the network that we have. And for the efficiencies that we provide to people ordering services like a flood report or a credit report off that network. We monetize that and charge a service fee for the efficiency that we're providing. So all of these we see as significant tailwinds into the business that give us confidence that we can grow regardless of a volume environment over a long period of time with that 8% to 10% guide."

We're in conversations about changes they've discussed. But right now, we haven't seen any impact. We don't anticipate any impact. I'll tell you what I think is consistent with what we've said for probably the last 2 or 3 years, which is that's not a line we expect to generate a lot of growth for us. It's not a line that we expect it's going to go down much. It's just kind of be stable. And again, we've given you some history on the recurring revenue and if you look 3Q, 4Q, the guide to 1Q, they're all right in that same number. So there is no expectation on our end that there are any changes that are likely to impact revenue this year. We've also said in the past, and I think it's still true that any changes that did come will likely come in over the course of 2, 3, 5 years, not immediately. So the net-net answer is that no real impact is expected on that bucket of revenue for us this year."

And when we we're looking at and analyzing doing the acquisition of Ellie Mae. It's 1 of the areas we were absolutely most excited about. And the area of this business under Data & Analytics is really that AIQ business. That's an acquisition that Ellie May had done a few years ago. And if you look at the heart of what that business is all about and investments that have been made, it's all about automating the very manual part of the origination workflow. And we've used statistics in the past of costing around $8,000 to -- per mortgage to manufacturing. And out of that $8,000,  $5,200 of it is just associated to manual processing. And at a minimum, we believe through our AI offerings, there is a great opportunity to chip away at a minimum half of that. So $2,600 in savings is ripe for automation. And this is things like I mentioned in the script, around credit analyzers. And last quarter, I talked about our income analyzers. This is taking all the stare and compare work that happens. And when you get a credit report to see what was the date of it? What was the score? You compare the score on the credit report to the information that we have in our old rigs business around what are the underwriting requirements for the particular product that this customer has applied for. And we're able to automate a ton of the process right now that is done manually, and it's 1 of the highest growth sales items we've seen. And as I said in answer to a prior question that we hit a record in Q4 of new sales of this product. And in terms of the $4 billion TAM, it's a pretty easy number to get to. And if you look at the efficiencies that we provide and assume conservatively, it's $2,600 in savings per loan that we can provide to customers. If we monetize a part of that, say, some subset of that, and you use a round number of around 10 million loans being done per year, which is way down from what it was last year, you do the math on $10 million loans, we roughly have almost 50% market share and loan flow that's going through times 1 subset of that save, and you get to a very big number very quickly. And as our customers are seeing that benefit, we're obviously monetizing it. We're providing that to them."

So that 1 question, I think, had 3 parts. Let me see back and hit. First of all, I don't know that   $5   million  wide on an over $100 million guide is that why and it's simply a matter of customers that we've onboarded and that we expect to continue on for. I mean that's the thing -- again, if you look at the history that we've provided on that line, our recurring Mortgage Technology revenues in fourth quarter of '19 were $92 million. They were $95 million, $100 million, $108 million, $119. So we've seen that consistent growth on a sequential quarterly basis because of everything Ben talked about, more customers, customers that had a certain number of seats signed up for more seat and so we expect growth to go through the quarter and exactly whether or not that growth is going to add $1 million or $3 million, again, on an over $120 million guide, plus or minus a little bit, it doesn't seem like that's that wide guide because it's not   $5 million  . It's actually plus or minus [$2.5 million   but so we feel good about it. What I said on the data business, and to be specific, the fixed income recurring revenues was that based on a 5.7% ASV. We fully expect the business to again grow right around that at 5% to 6% for the year. As you know, that ASV figure now is effectively 100% of the revenue in that segment. And so we're able to tell you that plus or minus a little bit, given the ASV is at 5.7%, we think 5% to 6% growth is the right view in terms of thinking about the full year for that fixed income recurring revenue. 
With regards to the data piece on mortgages and how they're working with the sales teams-- or sorry, the lens team to do that, I'll hand that to Ben. See if he's got any thoughts."

As I mentioned in the script, we have identified some early opportunities on the data side, as you can imagine, there is an absolute treasure trove of information in data sets that are within the Mortgage Technology business segment across all the businesses that are in there. So you have the merged business in there, you have simple file. And you have the Encompass system and the Ellie Mae business in there. Some of the areas that we're looking to leverage the data sets and the power of the data sets in there are simple things like when you're going through a mortgage origination process, 1 of the most common areas where you'll see errors is very late in the process when you get to the closing. And what happens at the closing is that you have to compare the original estimates of what your closing fees were going to be at the closing table from what the original estimates were that were provided 60-plus days ago. And if those numbers are off by any amount, and it's not even a material amount. It could be 0 tolerance to 10% tolerance, you have to go back through the entire origination process again. What we found is that Simplifile has all of that information. They know exactly what the closing requirements are, what the fees are in every jurisdiction around the U.S. as we manage all of that reference data for our clients in the closing process. Pulling that type of information all the way upfront to the origination process, and then combining that with our Artificial Intelligence expertise and automation expertise that we have in our AI tools is able to create a significant amount more efficiency and a higher quality loan asset that's going to be less subject to errors as you get to the closing table. And a lot of these capabilities in the Artificial Intelligence area and how to leverage this type of information and data is directly coming from the expertise that we have on the data side of the business."

And the Ellie Mae business that we acquired was really turns out has been a really great business since we've owned it. But don't underestimate that a lot of the acceleration of the growth that we've seen comes from the vision that we're articulating of an end-to-end platform managed by ICE. We live in a society today where many of the platforms that we interact with, you have to ask yourself, am I actually their customer, they're providing a service to me, but am I actually the customer because is the customer, the person who's buying the data off of that platform? Or is the customer the person that's giving up the data in exchange for free usage? And we're seeing a lot of examples right now in our society of people that believe that these free services are -- that they are actually customers. And in reality, they're not providing any revenue to them. The revenue is coming from a different source. And so as we're out selling our vision we're having that conversation with people in the mortgage industry, and it is resonating. The very data that you asked been about and the way that artificial intelligence will interact with that data. Is an area that ICE has built decades of trust in the financial services industry about how we manage that data, who owns it, where it's going to go and how we're going to protect it. And I think that, that bodes well for us as we continue to have a broader conversation in our society about data privacy and data rights."

I guess I'll remind you that when we bought the New York Stock Exchange, we were pretty vocal about the fact that we thought that the market structure in the U.S. equity space was flawed and that it needed a holistic review. And in fact, we tried to come up with a grand bargain that we talked to many, many people across the industry about that would have resulted in some major change. We were unsuccessful and the last SEC seem to spend an inordinate amount of time on governance of industry consortiums basically that manage infrastructure and didn't really step back and look at the totality of the infrastructure and whether or not it operates properly. And I think as you've heard through the guidance that Scott gave, fortunately or unfortunately, that infrastructure paralyzes the industry somewhat and stifles innovation in my view. And so we're going to have a new SEC chair. And if Germane Ginsler is confirmed and actually takes that seat, he's a person that worked in the derivative space and part of his career, worked in the regulated commodities and derivatives space for part of his career and has a deep interest in and knowledge of market structure. The SEC has got a dual role into a sense that it's an enforcement agency and a consumer protection agency as well as a market structure agency. And historically, the people that have chaired the agency have been lawyers by training, who are much more comfortable on the on the enforcement and compliance side of things. And I think there's an opportunity, and we'll see if it results, but there's an opportunity with a new chair and a new vision inside the SEC to potentially talk about a grand bargain again, which we would welcome. And by that, I mean, we would give up some unique positioning that we have, if others did the same thing and try to get back to a more innovative, transparent regulated market where we could see innovation as it's unique to the United States, continue to grow our capital markets."

Yes, I'll go through it. How we see the business' ability to grow through various volume cycles I'll answer your direct question around volumes. So if you think about this business, this business and what really excited about us and just the results",571,"Ari. Yes, I'll go through it. How we see the business' ability to grow through various volume cycles I'll answer your direct question around volumes. So if you think about this business, this business and what really excited about us and just the results that we've seen in the few months that we've owned it now have just further confirmed the business's ability to grow through volume environments are that: one, it's continuing to gain market share. I've shared the sales results, so you can see that. Number two, more customers equals more loan flow. And when you have more loan flow going onto that network, on average, a loan that's going through our network with customers of ours on the platform, we see that, that loan interacts around 7x with various third parties on the network. So each new loan that comes on to that network, there are several different times that it's interacting with third-party service providers and services that we provide on that network and for third-party service providers, we get a fee for the efficiency that we provide for somebody interacting with that loan. The third area is just -- it's a process that's ripe for automation. And I touched upon the opportunity there. Around 10 million loans and at least   $2,600   in efficiency and some subset of that, you do the math, and it's a big number. And then the fourth area is the electronification of the close that we are in a very unique position with the MERS and simplifile assets and the network that we have on the closing side that's extremely unique, integrating that with our origination network through encompass by connecting that into an eClose room, and we have several big deliveries this year, 1 in Q2 of our hybrid eClose offering and then followed shortly after in the second half of the year, a full eClose offering, we see that's going to be an area of growth for 2022 and beyond. When it comes to volumes itself, we do have a bit of a unique insight because we are an origination platform, we see almost 50% of loans that are originated in the U.S. We do see that the loans very early on in the process. So we see them when the original applications coming through for a refinance or a purchase, which gives us a 60 to 90-day preview of what the market is going to look like. 
You also -- when you look at industry analysts, you see the estimates that are out there, if you go beyond a quarter or 2, anyone that follows these estimates know that they're subject to revision and significant revision. It's very hard to predict mortgage origination volumes out beyond a couple of quarters, just like it's hard to predict U.S. equity market volumes and oil volumes going out a few quarters to a year. What I would say is based on the data that we see in our platform, if you take the estimates like Fannie and Freddie for the next quarter to maximum 2 quarters, those are as close to what we see in the data on our platform as being indicative of what we expect volumes to be. But beyond that, it's difficult to forecast but underneath the covers, with all the other growth areas that we have, regardless of volume environment, we are very optimistic this business can grow."

So we're seeing growth literally across every segment of customer in our platform. So yes, independent mortgage bankers, we are seeing their share of the market. It'd be very strong, in particular, on the purchase side of the market. With refinances, you do tend to see some refinance volume to go to some of the large banks, just because that's where you have a lot of your banking relationship with people tend to go there. But in the purchase market, we are seeing that independent banks are continuing to grow. That said, we're growing in each segment. So we service the large banks. We service the independent mortgage banks. We service correspondent banks, wholesale banks, you name it. And we looking at that sales strength that I referenced earlier, we're seeing that strength across the entire portfolio. And 1 of the thing I'd just highlight on the volume front. We we tend to -- if you look at our share and our strengths, a lot of it is balanced in the purchase market, albeit we do interact a lot with the refinance market as well. When we look at the trends of what happened in 2020 and going into this year, we're seeing application volumes up significantly in refi. They are up as well, is significantly in purchase, but not as much as refi. And on the refinance side, if you look at estimates that Fannie and Freddie have, for example, for 30-year mortgages of 2.7% to 2.9% right now for calendar year 2021, that puts up to 20 million units significantly in the money for refinancing, which is a higher number than what we said when we actually announced this deal. So we still see a tail in refinance volumes. We're seeing underneath the covers, 1 of the things on purchase. We are seeing pent-up demand on the purchase side. There's just not a lot of inventory out there. So as vaccines rollout, as the economy starts rolling, as people are willing to move and actually sell, I think you have a decent amount of purchase demand pent-up there as well. Which given that our market shares tend to be a little bit more tilted towards purchase and refi is another tailwind for us."

And it's -- and obviously, that company has been phenomenally successful. And I'm sure the value of our stake has increased. And our investment was just almost insignificant, honestly so -- in terms of a monetary number. The -- I would also say, we have obviously, a similar kind of investment in Baktt, which, again, was driven by us trying to understand blockchain. And as you may recall, 3 years ago, 2 and 3 years ago, a lot of people were asking us whether blockchain was going to be used for clearing, whether it was going to disrupt the traditional financial services industry, and we wanted to be on top of that technology and have that knowledge. And so we also invested and helped stand up back which, again, I think, is a company that we have a small basis or a basis that has dramatically increased, say it that way. We also made an investment in Euroclear, which is European custody solution that, again, we have adjacency to. Company is doing very, very well.

What's amazing when we -- as we've -- over the last decade, looked at the mortgage space, you've got an area of the marketplace that you can't emphasize enough how analog it is. When you look at that market share that I had mentioned and you say, well, what's second behind that? What's second behind that is a lot of either homegrown systems, excel spreadsheets or stitched together systems. And that's what gave us a ton of confidence in doing this transaction that there is a long way to go in terms of market share just on the origination side. But the other piece that that I can't emphasize enough is that we are in a very unique position where not only do we have this very strong origination network that's helping to write a ton of benefit to our customers in automating this manual workflow. We're in a unique position where we also have the significant network in the electronification of the close in that closing process. And where the magic we see is really going to happen in this deal is not only in the automation of the origination front, but by standing up, which we have done, an eClosing room, that for the first time, will link your underwriter of your loans, the bank or independent mortgage company and the underwriter that's underwriting your loan to your attorney, your settlement agent, your title insurance provider, et cetera, all into a digital closing room, to be able to quantify that transaction, close it electronically, register it on MERS, both the note as well as the loan, be able to electronically vault all the documentation associated to it and file it in the local county courthouse electronically by a simple file. That is an incredible capability that we're introducing to the market. We already have several key strategic pieces of it launched because we had a partnership with Ellie Mae prior to doing the transaction. And as I mentioned earlier, we have some very key pieces of functionality that are in the pilot phase and rolling out in Q2 on our eClose solution. And then we have another a big set of functionality coming out in the second half of this year. That's all going to lead to long-term 2022, 2023, additional tailwinds for this business."

The real opportunity for us is to take the loan origination customers that were on Ellie Mae and get them to use the other services on our network. That we find that the customers that use the entire network have a multiple of revenues for us beyond those that are simply using the loan origination platform. So the market share, if you are, that we're looking at internally is the bigger TAM of end-to-end services that Ben just described. And we have seen, and I've been involved and Ben has been involved, and Scott's been involved. Actually, all of the 3 of us here have all been involved in helping Elli close some LOS deals where we've been able to articulate the end-to-end vision, and that's brought the new customer to the platform for the loan origination system. But but it is that full vision, I think, that is helping to increase the market share if you solely look at loan origination. But the bigger addressable market for us is taking those already loan origination customers and them getting to use the end-to-end network."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on slide 4 with some key highlights from 2020 and a summary of our strong fourth quarter results.

I'll begin on slide 4 with some key highlights from 2020 and a summary of our strong fourth quarter results. Earnings per share of $4.51 were up 16% year-over-year on record revenues of over $6 billion. Free cash flow totaled a record $2.4 billion and we returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We also use some of that cash and our strong credit profile to make the important strategic acquisition of Ellie Mae in September. An acquisition that was nearly 3% accretive to our full year 2020 earnings per share. 
Our fourth quarter results were an exclamation point on a great year.  Earnings per share totaled $1.13, up 19% year-over-year. Net revenue totaled approximately $1.7 billion, a 14% increase on a pro forma basis. While we've now transitioned to new segment reporting, I'll mention that fourth quarter Data Services revenues totaled $595 million, which was at the high end of our guidance range and up 6% year-over-year. For the full year, despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic, our data sales teams focused on serving our customers deliver Data Services revenues that grew 5% over the prior year, and were near the top of our guidance entering the year. 
Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $712 million. We were above the high end of our guidance, largely driven by lower levels of capitalized labor as our technology teams who delivered near flawless execution, while largely working from home for most of 2020, took some well-deserved vacation to recharge from an extraordinary year. 
Now let's move to slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled $871 million, up 6% year-over-year. Transaction revenues increased 7%, driven by 6% growth in our Energy business and 21% growth in cash equities and options trading. Importantly, through the end of January, our energy open interest, which we believe is the best indicator of long-term growth was up 4% versus a year ago, including 11% growth in our global natural gas business and 5% growth in our environmental complex. 
Recurring revenues, which include our Exchange data and listing services, increased 3% year-over-year. These results were driven by the NYSE share of strong year-over-year growth in industry SIP revenues. Looking to the first quarter, we expect recurring revenues in the Exchange segment to be between $310 million and $315 million. 
Turning now to slide 6. I'll discuss our fixed income and data services segment. Fourth quarter revenues for the segment grew 3% year-over-year. While transaction revenues declined 16%, recurring revenues, which account for nearly 90% of total segment revenues grew 6% year-over-year. Fixed income data & analytics, which includes our leading pricing and reference data and index business increased by 7%, an acceleration from 6% growth in the third quarter. Other data and network services grew 5% in the fourth quarter, driven by continued growth in customer demand for both ICE Global Network and consolidated feeds. 
Looking to 2021, we expect recurring revenues in this segment to grow 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis for the full year, including $395 million to $400 million in the first quarter. These expectations are supported by ASV growth of 5.7% exiting 2020. 
Please flip to slide 7, where I'll discuss the results in our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. Mortgage Technology revenues grew 65% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 56% for the full year. Fourth quarter transaction revenues increased 92% year-over-year. Favorable financing conditions, accelerating millennial homeownership trends and demand for digital workflow tools, such as our network, closing solutions and analytics all contributed to our strong results. 
Recurring revenues increased 29% versus the prior year as increased utilization and new customer adoption of both our origination technology and analytics continue to expand our subscription base. We expect recurring revenues in the first quarter to range between $122 million and $127 million, representing around 30% growth versus last year on a pro forma basis. 
I'll conclude my remarks on slide 8 with some additional guidance. We expect 2021 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $2.83 billion to $2.88 billion. We expect the spinout of that to reduce expenses versus last year by $50 million. And as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we expect roughly $20 million of additional D&A expense in our Mortgage segment. 
In addition, we plan to invest $25 million to $30 million to enhance our Mortgage Technology platforms to support the significant growth in customers and volumes that we've seen over the past few years and which we expect to continue. With those items roughly netting out, our year-over-year expense growth will be largely consistent with prior years, including investments in our people and tied to revenue growth. 
We expect compensation expense across ICE to increase by $40 million to $50 million. Expenses tied to revenue growth are expected to increase $15 million to $25 million, and FX, based on current spot rates, will add $10 million to $15 million, which will be more than offset by a positive impact to revenues. 
For the first quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $720 million to $730 million, including roughly $23 million related to Bakkt. 
In summary, we delivered a very strong finish to another record year. We once again grew revenues, operating income, free cash flow and earnings per share. We grew our dividend and returned nearly $2 billion to our shareholders. At the same time, we invested in our business to meet the needs of our customers while also expanding our Mortgage Technology network through the acquisition of Ellie Mae. As a result, we've set the stage for continued top and bottom line growth and enhance shareholder returns into 2021 and beyond. 
I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll hand it to Ben to discuss some additional business highlights and key growth initiatives."

Please turn to slide 9, where I'll begin with some of the highlights and key initiatives across our Global Energy business. While inflation, economic growth, and geopolitics will always influence volume trends in a particular quarter or year. We are focusing on investing in the structural growth opportunities that exist across global energy markets. Investments that have been critical to the 7% average annual revenue growth we have generated across our energy and environmental network over the last 5 years. 
In our oil markets, we soon plan to launch ICE Futures Abu Dhabi or IFAD. This is a launch in partnership with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, or ADNOC, and 9 of the world's largest energy trading firms. For the first time, this new exchange will offer futures on Murban crude oil, an important price benchmark for crude flowing through to Asia. 
And by leveraging the existing breadth of our energy network, we will launch an array of related differentials, cracks and intercommodity spreads against our Brent, WTI, gas oil and Naphtha benchmarks. 
In our natural gas markets, the demand centers of Europe and Asia are increasingly at the forefront of global price formation. We began investing in the globalization of gas markets over a decade ago, at a time when exchange-traded volume in our TTF contract was less than 10% of total trading activity. Today, exchange-traded volume is approaching 50%, with open interest in TTF, growing at an average annual rate of nearly 40% since 2015. 
This growing network also plays an important role in the growth of our global environmental markets, where the number of market participants has grown by 40% since 2017 as customers increasingly seek solutions to help navigate the long tail and the complex evolution of Global Energy Markets. 
Turning to slide 10. ICE Mortgage Technology is at the center of an analog-to-digital conversion as customers demand greater workflow automation. In addition, an acceleration of millennial home buying and attractive refinancing conditions continue to provide a tailwind to our robust results. Pro forma Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $1.2 billion in 2020, ahead of the high end of the range we expected for all of 2021 when we announced the acquisition of Ellie Mae back in August. As we execute against this $10 billion addressable market, our approach has been and will be similar to the blueprint we apply across our other networks. 
We will invest behind secular growth, both organically and through acquisition. By adding new tools and content to enhance the value proposition of our network. As a recent example, during the fourth quarter, we launched our credit analyzer. A product that leverages our artificial intelligence engine, or AIQ, to reduce the time it takes to perform a credit review by up to 80%. 
In 2021, we plan to begin rolling out new eClose solutions, an initiative that we believe has a $1 billion addressable market. And we continue to see strong customer uptake across our network and our data and analytics offerings as we execute our strategy of relieving the pain points and inefficiencies that exist across the workflow. 
Turning to slide 11. Our proprietary price evaluation serves as the cornerstone of a network that is uniquely positioned to capture growth opportunities across the fixed income ecosystem. As an example, we are a leading solutions provider to the fixed income ETF industry, which, as many of you know, has seen assets under management grow at an average annual rate of 25% over the last 5 years. Our decades-long position as a leading provider of price information and reference data has served as the foundation for what is today the second largest provider of fixed income indices globally. While critical, our price information and our indices are only a part of what we offer to this growing industry. 
In late 2019, we launched our ETF Hub, a network we designed to reduce the workflow inefficiencies that exist within the ETF create/redeem process. Late last year, we integrated ICE Chat, a platform that we acquired in 2008 and have since grown to over 100,000 users. We also linked ETF Hub to our ICE fixed income Select platform, providing access to our fixed income data and analytics as well as seamless connectivity to our trading venues. 
As a leading provider of these proprietary data services, we have also developed an expertise in the gathering and cleansing of unstructured data, essentially, a skill in building the databases that serve as the foundation for developing actionable insights and identifying opportunities, not only in the fixed income markets but across many other asset classes as well. This is an expertise we are leveraging through new product development, such as our suite of ESG Data Services and some early mortgage data initiatives, which will leverage our growing mortgage technology network. This also applies to new partnerships, such as our announcement to apply our Data Services expertise to ADP's unstructured workforce data to help bring additional insights into the municipal bond markets. 
As we move into 2021, we are excited about the many opportunities for growth that lie ahead, opportunities that we're able to capture because of the investments we've made in the past and the strategic investments we will continue to make across our networks into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

Please turn to slide 12. Over 2 years ago and in collaboration with Starbucks and Microsoft, among others, we seeded a venture within ICE called Bakkt. Our vision was to leverage our collective core competencies to build a regulated ecosystem that would support the full life cycle of a digital asset, and through efficiency gains and greater transparency, a platform that would have strong network effects within a nascent but rapidly growing asset class. 
Since launching Bakkt in 2018, we've applied our blueprint. We've invested in organic product development by building a consumer wallet and launching futures and options contracts. And we've made inorganic investments by purchasing Bridge2 Solutions and adding digital custody services. In January, Bakkt announced that it will merge with a SPAC, managed by Victory Park capital. The transaction valued Bakkt at an enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion, of which we will retain a 65% economic interest. 
Our decision to merge Bakkt was threefold. First, the combination will provide significant incremental capital, enabling Bakkt to maximize its future growth potential. Second, by listing as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange, Bakkt will benefit from elevated consumer brand recognition. And third, we believe this transaction will unlock value for ICE shareholders. Value that we believe was not fully recognized within the ICE share price. And as you've often heard us say, I believe 1 of the most important parts of my job and the job of the management team here at ICE is to leverage our infrastructure and our expertise to create value for our shareholders. 
In that vein and shifting to what was another successful year, 2020 marked our 15th consecutive year of record adjusted earnings per share, a track record of growth that began with our initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005 and has compounded at an average annualized rate of 17% ever since. 
Our strategic approach to delivering this growth and building shareholder value has been consistent since our inception. Through the application of our world-class technology, leading operating expertise and our unique position both as a creator and distributor of proprietary data services, we create workflow efficiencies that add transparency and that drives powerful network effects across the asset classes that we operate. And as we've expanded into new asset classes, we've grown our addressable market, broadened our expertise and further solidified a foundation for growth well into the future. 
2020 was a year of incredible global challenges. Our customers needed to find ways to protect their employees while continuing to do business as they procured and accessed our products. Our ICE colleagues responded with extraordinary resourcefulness to meet our customer needs. So thank you to our customers for their business and their trust. And thank you to my colleagues at ICE for their remarkable contribution to the best fourth quarter in our company's history, resulting in another consecutive record year of revenues and earnings. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Kate, and we'll conduct an question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern time."

We did want to continue to give transparency in our guidance on those elements of our business that are recurring and a little easier to predict in some of the volume-based business.

If you look at, we've given you that detail on a pro forma basis, historically, and if you do the math on the guide in the first quarter, those recurring revenues are growing 7% to 9%. 
So very strong performance on a very stable part of our business right out of the gate, obviously, led by a strong performance in the Mortgage business, which has picked up customers, picked up volume from existing customers, but then also the Data business, which, again, despite the pandemic, as I said in my remarks, sales team did a remarkable job and put us in a position where ASV was nearly 6% entering this year. So we feel very good about those recurring businesses, and we intend to continue to give you each quarter, our perspective on what we expect of those revenues to be. 
You asked specifically about the recurring nature of the Mortgage business. I'll let Ben give you a little color on what's driving that great performance."

So there's a base level of subscription fee that someone's paying to be a part of that, and that's really what that recurring revenue piece is. 
And when we analyze the deal, one of the exciting things that we saw under the covers here and that I've talked about in terms of the different TAMs that we can go after here with this business, out of that $10 billion TAM, $4 billion of it alone is just in the origination side. And automating that whole origination process. And we had seen that Ellie Mae had increased market share from 38% to 44% in a pretty short period of time, and we had conviction that they're going to continue to grow market share in that space. 
And I'm pleased to say that under the covers, what we've seen in terms of sales performance, and I even highlighted this on the last quarterly earnings call, back in October, that the sales results have been phenomenal in terms of selling new versions of our loan origination system into new customers and then also cross-sells of our products into the customer base. 
And to go into that even a little bit further in Q3 and Q4 the company set all-time records in terms of bookings on the encompass loan origination system. So Q3 and Q4 were the 2 highest quarters ever in the company's history. Q4 across the entire Ellie Mae product set was the largest bookings quarter ever in the company's history. So all of that are real tailwinds, and Scott gave the guide to the Q1 recurring revenue for the business as well and why we feel really strong about the business' ability to grow that recurring revenue base regardless of volume environments."

Also -- and that's $4 billion of the $10 billion TAM, another $4 billion of that $10 billion TAM is around data and analytics. And we also saw record sales of our AIQ platform, so record bookings of the analyzers that are automating that origination workflow in the fourth quarter. 
We continue to see strength across Encompass as well as AIQ in January, and we're ahead in January than where we thought we were going to be in terms of our model. What this means is that as we're hitting these types of sales results and sales records for the company, it obviously means there's going to be more recurring revenue into the business. It means there's going to be more customers on the business. There's going to be more loans that are on the platform that are now on our network, loans that we did not interact with before. And more loans on our network interact with the third parties on the network that we have. And for the efficiencies that we provide to people ordering services like a flood report or a credit report of that network. We monetize that and charge a service fee for the efficiency that we're providing. 
So all of these we see as significant tailwinds into the business that give us confidence that we can grow regardless of volume environment over a long period of time with that 8% to 10% guide."

I'll take this and then if Jeff wants to jump in, he can. I think your question, as I understood it, was looking at kind of the recurring revenues in the Exchange business and specifically Exchange data what are our expectations in terms of any revenue impacts from ongoing dialogue with the SEC, and the answer is none. 
We're in conversations about changes they've discussed. But right now, we haven't seen any impact. We don't anticipate any impact. I'll tell you what I think is consistent with what we've said for probably the last 2 or 3 years, which is that's not a line we expect to generate a lot of growth for us. It's not a line that we expect it's going to go down much. It's just kind of be stable. 
And again, we've given you some history on the recurring revenue and if you look 3Q, 4Q, the guide to 1Q, they're all kind of right in that same number. So there is no expectation on our end that there are any changes that are likely to impact revenue this year. We've also said in the past, and I think it's still true that any changes that did come will likely come in over the course of 2, 3, 5 years, not immediately. So the net-net answer is that no real impact is expected on that bucket of revenue for us this year."

And when we're looking at and analyzing doing the acquisition of Ellie Mae. It's one of the areas we were absolutely most excited about. And the area of this business under data  and analytics is really that AIQ business. That's an acquisition that Ellie May had done a few years ago. 
And if you look at the heart of what that business is all about and investments that have been made, it's all about automating the very manual part of the origination workflow. And we've used statistics in the past costing around $8,000 to -- per mortgage to manufacturing. And out of that $8,000,  $5,200 of it is just associated to manual processing. And at a minimum, we believe through our AI offerings, there is a great opportunity to chip away at a minimum half of that. So $2,600 in savings is ripe for automation. 
And this is things like I mentioned in the script, around credit analyzers. And last quarter, I talked about our income analyzers. This is taking all the stare and compare work that happens. And when you get a credit report to see what was the date of it? What was the score? You compare the score on the credit report to the information that we have in our oil rigs business around what are the underwriting requirements for the particular product that this customer has applied for. And we're able to automate a tonne of the process right now that is done manually, and it's one of the highest growth sales items we've seen. And as I said in answer to a prior question that we hit a record in Q4 of new sales of this product. 
And in terms of the $4 billion TAM, it's a pretty easy number to get to. And if you look at the efficiencies that we provide and assume conservatively, it's $2,600 in savings per loan that we can provide to customers. If we monetize a part of that, say, some subset of that, and you use a round number of around 10 million loans being done per year, which is way down from what it was last year, you do the math on 10 million loans, we roughly have almost 50% market share and loan flow that's going through times 1 subset of that save, and you get to a very big number very quickly. And as our customers are seeing that benefit, we're obviously monetizing it for providing that to them."

First of all, I don't know that $5 million wide on an over $100 million guide is that wide and it's simply a matter of customers that we've onboarded and that we expect to continue on for. I mean that's the thing -- again, if you look at the history that we've provided on that line, our recurring Mortgage Technology revenues in fourth quarter of '19 were $92 million. They were $95 million, $100 million, $108 million, $119 million. 
So we've seen that consistent growth on a sequential quarterly basis because of everything Ben talked about, more customers, customers that has a certain number of seats signed up for more seat and so we expect growth to go through the quarter and exactly whether or not that growth is going to add $1 million or $3 million, again, on an over $120 million guide, plus or minus a little bit, it doesn't seem like that wide a gap. Because it's not $5 million wide, it's actually plus or minus $2.5 million but -- so we feel good about it. 
What I said on the data business, and to be specific, the fixed income recurring revenues was that based on a 5.7% ASV, we fully expect the business to again grow right around that at 5% to 6% for the year. As you know, that ASV figure now is effectively 100% of the revenue in that segment. And so we're able to tell you that plus or minus a little bit, given that ASV is at 5.7%, we think 5% to 6% growth is the right view in terms of thinking about the full year for that fixed income recurring revenue.

As I mentioned in the script, we have identified some early opportunities on the data side, as you can imagine, there is an absolute treasure trove of information in data sets that are within the Mortgage Technology business segment across all the businesses that are in there. So you have the merged business in there, you have Simplifile. And you have the Encompass system and the Ellie Mae business in there. 
Some of the areas that we're looking to leverage the data sets and the power of the data sets in there are simple things like when you're going through a mortgage origination process, one of the most common areas where you'll see errors is very late in the process when you get to the closing. And what happens at the closing is that you have to compare the original estimates of what your closing fees were going to be at the closing table from what the original estimates were that were provided 60-plus days ago. 
And if those numbers are off by any amount, and it's not even a material amount. It could be 0 tolerance to 10% tolerance, you have to go back through the entire origination process again. What we found is that Simplifile has all of that information. They know exactly what the closing requirements are, what the fees are in every jurisdiction around the U.S. as we manage all of that reference data for our clients in the closing process. Pulling that type of information all the way upfront to the origination process, and then combining that with our Artificial Intelligence expertise and automation expertise that we have in our AI tools is able to create a significant amount more efficiency and a higher quality loan asset that's going to be less subject to errors as you get to the closing table. And a lot of these capabilities in the Artificial Intelligence area and how to leverage this type of information and data is directly coming from the expertise that we have on the data side of the business."

And the Ellie Mae business that we acquired was really turns out has been a really great business since we've owned it. But don't underestimate that a lot of the acceleration of the growth that we've seen comes from the vision that we're articulating of an end-to-end platform managed by ICE. 
We live in a society today where many of the platforms that we interact with, you have to ask yourself, am I actually their customer, they're providing a service to me, but am I actually the customer because is the customer, the person who's buying the data off of that platform? Or is the customer the person that's giving up the data in exchange for free usage? And we're seeing a lot of examples right now in our society of people that believe that these free services are -- that they are actually customers. And in reality, they're not providing any revenue to them. The revenue is coming from a different source. 
And so as we're out selling our vision we're having that conversation with people in the mortgage industry, and it is resonating. The very data that you asked them about and the way that artificial intelligence will interact with that data. Is an area that ICE has built decades of trust in the financial services industry about how we manage that data, who owns it, where it's going to go and how we're going to protect it. And I think that, that bodes well for us as we continue to have a broader conversation in our society about data privacy and data rights."

I guess I'll remind you that when we bought the New York Stock Exchange, we were pretty vocal about the fact that we thought that the market structure in the U.S. equity space was flawed and that it needed a holistic review. And in fact, we tried to come up with a grand bargain that we talked to many, many people across the industry about that would have resulted in some major change. 
We were unsuccessful and the last SEC seem to spend an inordinate amount of time on governance of industry consortiums basically that manage infrastructure and didn't really step back and look at the totality of the infrastructure and whether or not it operates properly. And I think as you've heard through the guidance that Scott gave, fortunately or unfortunately, that infrastructure paralyzes the industry somewhat and stifles innovation in my view. And so we're going to have a new SEC chair. And if chairman Gensler is confirmed and actually takes that seat, he's a person that worked in the derivative space for part of his career, worked in the regulated commodities and derivatives space for part of his career and has a deep interest in and knowledge of market structure. 
The SEC has got a dual role into a sense that it's an enforcement agency and a consumer protection agency as well as a market structure agency. And historically, the people that have chaired the agency have been lawyers by training, who are much more comfortable on the enforcement and compliance side of things. And I think there's an opportunity, and we'll see if it results, but there's an opportunity with a new chair and a new vision inside the SEC to potentially talk about a grand bargain again, which we would welcome. 
And by that, I mean, we would give up some unique positioning that we have, if others did the same thing and try to get back to a more innovative, transparent regulated market where we could see innovation as it's unique to the United States, continue to grow our capital markets."

How we see the business' ability to grow through various volume cycles then I'll answer your direct question around volumes. So if you think about this business, this business and what really excited about us and just the results that we've seen in the few months that we've owned it now have just further confirmed the business's ability to grow through volume environments are that: one, it's continuing to gain market share. I've shared the sales results, so you can see that. Number two, more customers equals more loan flow. And when you have more loan flow going onto that network, on average, a loan that's going through our network with customers of ours on the platform, we see that, that loan interacts around 7x with various third parties on the network. 
So each new loan that comes onto that network, there are 7 different times that it's interacting with third-party service providers and services that we provide on that network and for third-party service providers, we get a fee for the efficiency that we provide for somebody interacting with that loan. 
The third area is just -- it's a process that's ripe for automation. And I touched upon the opportunity there. Around 10 million loans and at least $2,600 in efficiency and some subset of that, you do the math, and it's a big number. And then the fourth area is the electronification of the close that we are in a very unique position with the MERS and Simplifile assets and the network that we have on the closing side that's extremely unique, integrating that with our origination network through Encompass by connecting that into an eClose room, and we have several big deliveries this year, one in Q2 of our hybrid eClose offering and then followed shortly after in the second half of the year, a full eClose offering, we see that's going to be an area of growth for 2022 and beyond. 
When it comes to volumes itself, we do have a bit of a unique insight because we are an origination platform, we see almost 50% of loans that are originated in the U.S. We do see that the loans very early on in the process. So we see them when the original application's coming through for a refinance or a purchase, which gives us a 60- to 90-day preview of what the market is going to look like. 
You also -- when you look at industry analysts, you see the estimates that are out there, if you go beyond a quarter or 2, anyone that follows these estimates know that they're subject to revision and significant revision. It's very hard to predict mortgage origination volumes out beyond a couple of quarters, just like it's hard to predict U.S. equity market volumes and oil volumes going out a few quarters to a year. 
What I would say is based on the data that we see in our platform, if you take the estimates like Fannie and Freddie for the next quarter to maximum 2 quarters, those are as close to what we see in the data on our platform as being indicative of what we expect volumes to be. But beyond that, it's difficult to forecast but underneath the covers, with all the other growth areas that we have, regardless of volume environment, we are very optimistic this business can grow."

So we're seeing growth literally across every segment of customer in our platform. So yes, independent mortgage bankers, we are seeing their share of the market. It'd be very strong, in particular, on the purchase side of the market. With refinances, you do tend to see some refinance volume to go to some of the large banks, just because that's where you have a lot of your banking relationship, people tend to go there. But in the purchase market, we are seeing that independent banks are continuing to grow. 
That said, we're growing in each segment. So we service the large banks. We service the independent mortgage banks. We service correspondent banks, wholesale banks, you name it. And we -- looking at that sales strength that I referenced earlier, we're seeing that strength across the entire portfolio. And one of the thing I'd just highlight on the volume front. We tend to -- if you look at our share and our strengths, a lot of it is balanced in the purchase market, albeit we do interact a lot with the refinance market as well. 
When we look at the trends of what happened in 2020 and going into this year, we're seeing application volumes up significantly in refi. They are up as well, significantly in purchase, but not as much as refi. And on the refinance side, if you look at estimates that Fannie and Freddie have, for example, for 30-year mortgages of 2.7% to 2.9% right now for calendar year 2021, that puts up to 20 million units significantly in the money for refinancing, which is a higher number than what we said when we actually announced this deal. 
So we still see a tail in refinance volumes. We're seeing underneath the covers, one of the things on purchase. We are seeing pent-up demand on the purchase side. There's just not a lot of inventory out there. So as vaccines rollout, as the economy starts rolling, as people are willing to move and actually sell, I think you have a decent amount of purchase demand pent-up there as well. Which given that our market shares tend to be a little bit more tilted towards purchase and refi is another tailwind for us."

And so we invested in Coinbase in its early rounds because we were trying to understand the blockchain and the significance of digital currencies in payments. And it's -- and obviously, that company has been phenomenally successful. And I'm sure the value of our stake has increased. And our investment was just almost insignificant, honestly so -- in terms of a monetary number. 
The -- I would also say, we have obviously, a similar kind of investment in Baktt, which, again, was driven by us trying to understand blockchain. And as you may recall, 3 years ago, 2 and 3 years ago, a lot of people were asking us whether blockchain was going to be used for clearing, whether it was going to disrupt the traditional financial services industry, and we wanted to be on top of that technology and have that knowledge. And so we also invested and helped stand up Baktt which, again, I think, as a company that we have a small basis or a basis that has dramatically increased, say it that way. 
We also made an investment in Euroclear, which is European custody solution that, again, we have adjacency to. Company is doing very, very well. And so we do have, as your question, I think, is trying to allude to, a number of very, very interesting assets that have value that I think over time, we'll try to unlock for our shareholders as those partnerships and knowledge transfers come to some fruition."

And I use that number roughly, but it's somewhat how we think of the business. They're intertwined a virtuous circle of risk management along with the data and information that it takes to manage a portfolio of risk. 
And so it's not surprising to us that others are making moves in that space. With respect to all the companies actually that you mentioned, we have some relationships with them. And in both -- at times, we use some of their platforms, at times, they use some of our platforms and data and indices. And so you've seen a movement of large exchange and data information groups, advancing their own businesses, but also somewhat collaborating across the industry where necessary. So we have a good relationship with the managers of all of those companies, even though in some areas, we're fierce competitors. And in other areas we cooperate for the betterment of the industry."

What's amazing when we -- as we've -- over the last decade, looked at the Mortgage space, you've got an area of the marketplace that you can't emphasize enough how analog it is. When you look at that market share that I had mentioned and you say, well, what's second behind that? What's second behind that is a lot of either homegrown systems, excel spreadsheets or stitched together systems. And that's what gave us a tonne of confidence in doing this transaction that there is a long way to go in terms of market share just on the origination side. 
But the other piece that I can't emphasize enough is that we are in a very unique position where not only do we have this very strong origination network that's helping to write a tonne of benefit to our customers in automating this manual workflow. We're in a unique position where we also have the significant network in the electronification of the close in that closing process. 
And where the magic we see is really going to happen in this deal is not only in the automation of the origination front, but by standing up, which we have done, an eClosing room, that for the first time, will link your underwriter of your loans, the bank or independent mortgage company and the underwriter that's underwriting your loan to your attorney, your settlement agent, your title insurance provider, et cetera, all into a digital closing room, to be able to quantify that transaction, close it electronically, register it on MERS, both the note as well as the loan, be able to electronically vault all the documentation associated to it and file it in the local county courthouse electronically by a simple file. 
That is an incredible capability that we're introducing to the market. We already have several key strategic pieces of it launched because we had a partnership with Ellie Mae prior to doing the transaction. And as I mentioned earlier, we have some very key pieces of functionality that are in the pilot phase and rolling out in Q2 on our eClose solution. And then we have another a big set of functionality coming out in the second half of this year. That's all going to lead to long-term 2022, 2023, additional tailwinds for this business."

So the market share, if you are, that we're looking at internally is the bigger TAM of end-to-end services that Ben just described. 
And we have seen, and I've been involved and Ben's been involved, and Scott's been involved. Actually, all of the 3 of us here have all been involved in helping Ellie close some LOS deals where we've been able to articulate the end-to-end vision, and that's brought the new customer to the platform for the loan origination system. But it is that full vision, I think, that is helping to increase the market share if you solely look at loan origination.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on slide 4 with some key highlights from 2020 and a summary of our strong fourth quarter results.

I'll begin on slide 4 with some key highlights from 2020 and a summary of our strong fourth quarter results. Earnings per share of $4.51 were up 16% year-over-year on record revenues of over $6 billion. Free cash flow totaled a record $2.4 billion and we returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We also use some of that cash and our strong credit profile to make the important strategic acquisition of Ellie Mae in September. An acquisition that was nearly 3% accretive to our full year 2020 earnings per share. 
Our fourth quarter results were an exclamation point on a great year. Earnings per share totaled $1.13, up 19% year-over-year. Net revenue totaled approximately $1.7 billion, a 14% increase on a pro forma basis. While we've now transitioned to new segment reporting, I'll mention that fourth quarter Data Services revenues totaled $595 million, which was at the high end of our guidance range and up 6% year-over-year. For the full year, despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic, our data sales teams focused on serving our customers deliver Data Services revenues that grew 5% over the prior year, and were near the top of our guidance entering the year. 
Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $712 million. We were above the high end of our guidance, largely driven by lower levels of capitalized labor as our technology teams who delivered near flawless execution, while largely working from home for most of 2020, took some well-deserved vacation to recharge from an extraordinary year. 
Now let's move to slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled $871 million, up 6% year-over-year. Transaction revenues increased 7%, driven by 6% growth in our Energy business and 21% growth in cash equities and options trading. Importantly, through the end of January, our energy open interest, which we believe is the best indicator of long-term growth was up 4% versus a year ago, including 11% growth in our global natural gas business and 5% growth in our environmental complex. 
Recurring revenues, which include our Exchange data and listing services, increased 3% year-over-year. These results were driven by the NYSE share of strong year-over-year growth in industry SIP revenues. Looking to the first quarter, we expect recurring revenues in the Exchange segment to be between $310 million and $315 million. 
Turning now to slide 6. I'll discuss our fixed income and data services segment. Fourth quarter revenues for the segment grew 3% year-over-year. While transaction revenues declined 16%, recurring revenues, which account for nearly 90% of total segment revenues grew 6% year-over-year. Fixed income data & analytics, which includes our leading pricing and reference data and index business increased by 7%, an acceleration from 6% growth in the third quarter. Other data and network services grew 5% in the fourth quarter, driven by continued growth in customer demand for both ICE Global Network and consolidated feeds. 
Looking to 2021, we expect recurring revenues in this segment to grow 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis for the full year, including $395 million to $400 million in the first quarter. These expectations are supported by ASV growth of 5.7% exiting 2020. 
Please flip to slide 7, where I'll discuss the results in our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. Mortgage Technology revenues grew 65% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 56% for the full year. Fourth quarter transaction revenues increased 92% year-over-year. Favorable financing conditions, accelerating millennial homeownership trends and demand for digital workflow tools, such as our network, closing solutions and analytics all contributed to our strong results. 
Recurring revenues increased 29% versus the prior year as increased utilization and new customer adoption of both our origination technology and analytics continue to expand our subscription base. We expect recurring revenues in the first quarter to range between $122 million and $127 million, representing around 30% growth versus last year on a pro forma basis. 
I'll conclude my remarks on slide 8 with some additional guidance. We expect 2021 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $2.83 billion to $2.88 billion. We expect the spinout of that to reduce expenses versus last year by $50 million. And as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we expect roughly $20 million of additional D&A expense in our Mortgage segment. 
In addition, we plan to invest $25 million to $30 million to enhance our Mortgage Technology platforms to support the significant growth in customers and volumes that we've seen over the past few years and which we expect to continue. With those items roughly netting out, our year-over-year expense growth will be largely consistent with prior years, including investments in our people and tied to revenue growth. 
We expect compensation expense across ICE to increase by $40 million to $50 million. Expenses tied to revenue growth are expected to increase $15 million to $25 million, and FX, based on current spot rates, will add $10 million to $15 million, which will be more than offset by a positive impact to revenues. 
For the first quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $720 million to $730 million, including roughly $23 million related to Bakkt. 
In summary, we delivered a very strong finish to another record year. We once again grew revenues, operating income, free cash flow and earnings per share. We grew our dividend and returned nearly $2 billion to our shareholders. At the same time, we invested in our business to meet the needs of our customers while also expanding our Mortgage Technology network through the acquisition of Ellie Mae. As a result, we've set the stage for continued top and bottom line growth and enhance shareholder returns into 2021 and beyond. 
I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll hand it to Ben to discuss some additional business highlights and key growth initiatives."

Please turn to slide 9, where I'll begin with some of the highlights and key initiatives across our Global Energy business. While inflation, economic growth, and geopolitics will always influence volume trends in a particular quarter or year. We are focusing on investing in the structural growth opportunities that exist across global energy markets. Investments that have been critical to the 7% average annual revenue growth we have generated across our energy and environmental network over the last 5 years. 
In our oil markets, we soon plan to launch ICE Futures Abu Dhabi or IFAD. This is a launch in partnership with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, or ADNOC, and 9 of the world's largest energy trading firms. For the first time, this new exchange will offer futures on Murban crude oil, an important price benchmark for crude flowing through to Asia. 
And by leveraging the existing breadth of our energy network, we will launch an array of related differentials, cracks and intercommodity spreads against our Brent, WTI, gas oil and Naphtha benchmarks. 
In our natural gas markets, the demand centers of Europe and Asia are increasingly at the forefront of global price formation. We began investing in the globalization of gas markets over a decade ago, at a time when exchange-traded volume in our TTF contract was less than 10% of total trading activity. Today, exchange-traded volume is approaching 50%, with open interest in TTF, growing at an average annual rate of nearly 40% since 2015. 
This growing network also plays an important role in the growth of our global environmental markets, where the number of market participants has grown by 40% since 2017 as customers increasingly seek solutions to help navigate the long tail and the complex evolution of Global Energy Markets. 
Turning to slide 10. ICE Mortgage Technology is at the center of an analog-to-digital conversion as customers demand greater workflow automation. In addition, an acceleration of millennial home buying and attractive refinancing conditions continue to provide a tailwind to our robust results. Pro forma Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $1.2 billion in 2020, ahead of the high end of the range we expected for all of 2021 when we announced the acquisition of Ellie Mae back in August. As we execute against this $10 billion addressable market, our approach has been and will be similar to the blueprint we apply across our other networks. 
We will invest behind secular growth, both organically and through acquisition. By adding new tools and content to enhance the value proposition of our network. As a recent example, during the fourth quarter, we launched our credit analyzer. A product that leverages our artificial intelligence engine, or AIQ, to reduce the time it takes to perform a credit review by up to 80%. 
In 2021, we plan to begin rolling out new eClose solutions, an initiative that we believe has a $1 billion addressable market. And we continue to see strong customer uptake across our network and our data and analytics offerings as we execute our strategy of relieving the pain points and inefficiencies that exist across the workflow. 
Turning to slide 11. Our proprietary price evaluation serves as the cornerstone of a network that is uniquely positioned to capture growth opportunities across the fixed income ecosystem. As an example, we are a leading solutions provider to the fixed income ETF industry, which, as many of you know, has seen assets under management grow at an average annual rate of 25% over the last 5 years. Our decades-long position as a leading provider of price information and reference data has served as the foundation for what is today the second largest provider of fixed income indices globally. While critical, our price information and our indices are only a part of what we offer to this growing industry. 
In late 2019, we launched our ETF Hub, a network we designed to reduce the workflow inefficiencies that exist within the ETF create/redeem process. Late last year, we integrated ICE Chat, a platform that we acquired in 2008 and have since grown to over 100,000 users. We also linked ETF Hub to our ICE fixed income Select platform, providing access to our fixed income data and analytics as well as seamless connectivity to our trading venues. 
As a leading provider of these proprietary data services, we have also developed an expertise in the gathering and cleansing of unstructured data, essentially, a skill in building the databases that serve as the foundation for developing actionable insights and identifying opportunities, not only in the fixed income markets but across many other asset classes as well. This is an expertise we are leveraging through new product development, such as our suite of ESG Data Services and some early mortgage data initiatives, which will leverage our growing mortgage technology network. This also applies to new partnerships, such as our announcement to apply our Data Services expertise to ADP's unstructured workforce data to help bring additional insights into the municipal bond markets. 
As we move into 2021, we are excited about the many opportunities for growth that lie ahead, opportunities that we're able to capture because of the investments we've made in the past and the strategic investments we will continue to make across our networks into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

Please turn to slide 12. Over 2 years ago and in collaboration with Starbucks and Microsoft, among others, we seeded a venture within ICE called Bakkt. Our vision was to leverage our collective core competencies to build a regulated ecosystem that would support the full life cycle of a digital asset, and through efficiency gains and greater transparency, a platform that would have strong network effects within a nascent but rapidly growing asset class. 
Since launching Bakkt in 2018, we've applied our blueprint. We've invested in organic product development by building a consumer wallet and launching futures and options contracts. And we've made inorganic investments by purchasing Bridge2 Solutions and adding digital custody services. In January, Bakkt announced that it will merge with a SPAC, managed by Victory Park capital. The transaction valued Bakkt at an enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion, of which we will retain a 65% economic interest. 
Our decision to merge Bakkt was threefold. First, the combination will provide significant incremental capital, enabling Bakkt to maximize its future growth potential. Second, by listing as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange, Bakkt will benefit from elevated consumer brand recognition. And third, we believe this transaction will unlock value for ICE shareholders. Value that we believe was not fully recognized within the ICE share price. And as you've often heard us say, I believe 1 of the most important parts of my job and the job of the management team here at ICE is to leverage our infrastructure and our expertise to create value for our shareholders. 
In that vein and shifting to what was another successful year, 2020 marked our 15th consecutive year of record adjusted earnings per share, a track record of growth that began with our initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005 and has compounded at an average annualized rate of 17% ever since. 
Our strategic approach to delivering this growth and building shareholder value has been consistent since our inception. Through the application of our world-class technology, leading operating expertise and our unique position both as a creator and distributor of proprietary data services, we create workflow efficiencies that add transparency and that drives powerful network effects across the asset classes that we operate. And as we've expanded into new asset classes, we've grown our addressable market, broadened our expertise and further solidified a foundation for growth well into the future. 
2020 was a year of incredible global challenges. Our customers needed to find ways to protect their employees while continuing to do business as they procured and accessed our products. Our ICE colleagues responded with extraordinary resourcefulness to meet our customer needs. So thank you to our customers for their business and their trust. And thank you to my colleagues at ICE for their remarkable contribution to the best fourth quarter in our company's history, resulting in another consecutive record year of revenues and earnings. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Kate, and we'll conduct an question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern time."

So very strong performance on a very stable part of our business right out of the gate, obviously, led by a strong performance in the Mortgage business, which has picked up customers, picked up volume from existing customers, but then also the Data business, which, again, despite the pandemic, as I said in my remarks, sales team did a remarkable job and put us in a position where ASV was nearly 6% entering this year. So we feel very good about those recurring businesses, and we intend to continue to give you each quarter, our perspective on what we expect of those revenues to be. 
You asked specifically about the recurring nature of the Mortgage business. I'll let Ben give you a little color on what's driving that great performance."

So the first thing to start with is on the Mortgage side of the business, when someone subscribes to come on to our network, they're getting our full platform and our network services as part of that. So there's a base level of subscription fee that someone's paying to be a part of that, and that's really what that recurring revenue piece is. 
And when we analyze the deal, one of the exciting things that we saw under the covers here and that I've talked about in terms of the different TAMs that we can go after here with this business, out of that $10 billion TAM, $4 billion of it alone is just in the origination side. And automating that whole origination process. And we had seen that Ellie Mae had increased market share from 38% to 44% in a pretty short period of time, and we had conviction that they're going to continue to grow market share in that space. 
And I'm pleased to say that under the covers, what we've seen in terms of sales performance, and I even highlighted this on the last quarterly earnings call, back in October, that the sales results have been phenomenal in terms of selling new versions of our loan origination system into new customers and then also cross-sells of our products into the customer base. 
And to go into that even a little bit further in Q3 and Q4 the company set all-time records in terms of bookings on the encompass loan origination system. So Q3 and Q4 were the 2 highest quarters ever in the company's history. Q4 across the entire Ellie Mae product set was the largest bookings quarter ever in the company's history. So all of that are real tailwinds, and Scott gave the guide to the Q1 recurring revenue for the business as well and why we feel really strong about the business' ability to grow that recurring revenue base regardless of volume environments."

And then we are convinced that on an annual basis, we can grow this business, and this business will grow 8% to 10% per year on average over 10 years. 
And underneath the covers, as I just referenced in the answer I gave to Rich. If you look under the covers of what's happened with that business since we've acquired it, sales strength has been very strong. So I mentioned a couple of the Encompass records that we saw over the last couple of quarters. Also -- and that's $4 billion of the $10 billion TAM, another $4 billion of that $10 billion TAM is around data and analytics. And we also saw record sales of our AIQ platform, so record bookings of the analyzers that are automating that origination workflow in the fourth quarter. 
We continue to see strength across Encompass as well as AIQ in January, and we're ahead in January than where we thought we were going to be in terms of our model. What this means is that as we're hitting these types of sales results and sales records for the company, it obviously means there's going to be more recurring revenue into the business. It means there's going to be more customers on the business. There's going to be more loans that are on the platform that are now on our network, loans that we did not interact with before. And more loans on our network interact with the third parties on the network that we have. And for the efficiencies that we provide to people ordering services like a flood report or a credit report of that network. We monetize that and charge a service fee for the efficiency that we're providing. 
So all of these we see as significant tailwinds into the business that give us confidence that we can grow regardless of volume environment over a long period of time with that 8% to 10% guide."

I think your question, as I understood it, was looking at kind of the recurring revenues in the Exchange business and specifically Exchange data what are our expectations in terms of any revenue impacts from ongoing dialogue with the SEC, and the answer is none. 
We're in conversations about changes they've discussed. But right now, we haven't seen any impact. We don't anticipate any impact. I'll tell you what I think is consistent with what we've said for probably the last 2 or 3 years, which is that's not a line we expect to generate a lot of growth for us. It's not a line that we expect it's going to go down much. It's just kind of be stable. 
And again, we've given you some history on the recurring revenue and if you look 3Q, 4Q, the guide to 1Q, they're all kind of right in that same number. So there is no expectation on our end that there are any changes that are likely to impact revenue this year. We've also said in the past, and I think it's still true that any changes that did come will likely come in over the course of 2, 3, 5 years, not immediately. So the net-net answer is that no real impact is expected on that bucket of revenue for us this year."

And when we're looking at and analyzing doing the acquisition of Ellie Mae. It's one of the areas we were absolutely most excited about. And the area of this business under data and analytics is really that AIQ business. That's an acquisition that Ellie May had done a few years ago. 
And if you look at the heart of what that business is all about and investments that have been made, it's all about automating the very manual part of the origination workflow. And we've used statistics in the past of it costing around $8,000 to -- per mortgage to manufacture one. And out of that $8,000, $5,200 of it is just associated to manual processing. And at a minimum, we believe through our AI offerings, there is a great opportunity to chip away at a minimum half of that. So $2,600 in savings is ripe for automation. 
And this is things like I mentioned in the script, around credit analyzers. And last quarter, I talked about our income analyzers. This is taking all the stare and compare work that happens. And when you get a credit report to see what was the date of it? What was the score? You compare the score on the credit report to the information that we have in our oil rigs business around what are the underwriting requirements for the particular product that this customer has applied for. And we're able to automate a ton of the process right now that is done manually, and it's one of the highest growth sales items we've seen. And as I said in answer to a prior question that we hit a record in Q4 of new sales of this product. 
And in terms of the $4 billion TAM, it's a pretty easy number to get to. And if you look at the efficiencies that we provide and assume conservatively, it's $2,600 in savings per loan that we can provide to customers. If we monetize a part of that, say, some subset of that, and you use a round number of around 10 million loans being done per year, which is way down from what it was last year, you do the math on 10 million loans, we roughly have almost 50% market share and loan flow that's going through times 1 subset of that save, and you get to a very big number very quickly. And as our customers are seeing that benefit, we're obviously monetizing it for providing that to them."

First of all, I don't know that $5 million wide on an over $100 million guide is that wide and it's simply a matter of customers that we've onboarded and that we expect to continue onboard. I mean that's the thing -- again, if you look at the history that we've provided on that line, our recurring Mortgage Technology revenues in fourth quarter of '19 were $92 million. They were $95 million, $100 million, $108 million, $119 million. 
So we've seen that consistent growth on a sequential quarterly basis because of everything Ben talked about, more customers, customers that has a certain number of seats signed up for more seat and so we expect growth to go through the quarter and exactly whether or not that growth is going to add $1 million or $3 million, again, on an over $120 million guide, plus or minus a little bit, it doesn't seem like that wide a gap. Because it's not $5 million wide, it's actually plus or minus $2.5 million but -- so we feel good about it. 
What I said on the data business, and to be specific, the fixed income recurring revenues was that based on a 5.7% ASV, we fully expect the business to again grow right around that at 5% to 6% for the year. As you know, that ASV figure now is effectively 100% of the revenue in that segment. And so we're able to tell you that plus or minus a little bit, given that ASV is at 5.7%, we think 5% to 6% growth is the right view in terms of thinking about the full year for that fixed income recurring revenue.

So you have the merged business in there, you have Simplifile. And you have the Encompass system and the Ellie Mae business in there. 
Some of the areas that we're looking to leverage the data sets and the power of the data sets in there are simple things like when you're going through a mortgage origination process, one of the most common areas where you'll see errors is very late in the process when you get to the closing. And what happens at the closing is that you have to compare the original estimates of what your closing fees were going to be at the closing table from what the original estimates were that were provided 60-plus days ago. 
And if those numbers are off by any amount, and it's not even a material amount. It could be 0 tolerance to 10% tolerance, you have to go back through the entire origination process again. What we found is that Simplifile has all of that information. They know exactly what the closing requirements are, what the fees are in every jurisdiction around the U.S. as we manage all of that reference data for our clients in the closing process. Pulling that type of information all the way upfront to the origination process, and then combining that with our Artificial Intelligence expertise and automation expertise that we have in our AI tools is able to create a significant amount more efficiency and a higher quality loan asset that's going to be less subject to errors as you get to the closing table. And a lot of these capabilities in the Artificial Intelligence area and how to leverage this type of information and data is directly coming from the expertise that we have on the data side of the business."

And the Ellie Mae business that we acquired was -- really turns out has been a really great business since we've owned it. But don't underestimate that a lot of the acceleration of the growth that we've seen comes from the vision that we're articulating of an end-to-end platform managed by ICE. 
We live in a society today where many of the platforms that we interact with, you have to ask yourself, am I actually their customer, they're providing a service to me, but am I actually the customer because is the customer, the person who's buying the data off of that platform? Or is the customer the person that's giving up the data in exchange for free usage? And we're seeing a lot of examples right now in our society of people that believe that these free services are -- that they are actually customers. And in reality, they're not providing any revenue to them. The revenue is coming from a different source. 
And so as we're out selling our vision, we're having that conversation with people in the mortgage industry, and it is resonating. The very data that you asked Ben about and the way that artificial intelligence will interact with that data. Is an area that ICE has built decades of trust in the financial services industry about how we manage that data, who owns it, where it's going to go and how we're going to protect it. And I think that, that bodes well for us as we continue to have a broader conversation in our society about data privacy and data rights."

I guess I'll remind you that when we bought the New York Stock Exchange, we were pretty vocal about the fact that we thought that the market structure in the U.S. equity space was flawed and that it needed a holistic review. And in fact, we tried to come up with a grand bargain that we talked to many, many people across the industry about that would have resulted in some major change. 
We were unsuccessful and the last SEC seem to spend an inordinate amount of time on governance of industry consortiums basically that manage infrastructure and didn't really step back and look at the totality of the infrastructure and whether or not it operates properly. And I think as you've heard through the guidance that Scott gave, fortunately or unfortunately, that infrastructure paralyzes the industry somewhat and stifles innovation in my view. And so we're going to have a new SEC chair. And if chairman Gensler is confirmed and actually takes that seat, he's a person that worked in the derivative space for part of his career, worked in the regulated commodities and derivatives space for part of his career and has a deep interest in and knowledge of market structure. 
The SEC has got a dual role, and to a sense, it's an enforcement agency and a consumer protection agency as well as a market structure agency. And historically, the people that have chaired the agency have been lawyers by training, who are much more comfortable on the enforcement and compliance side of things. And I think there's an opportunity, and we'll see if it results, but there's an opportunity with a new chair and a new vision inside the SEC to potentially talk about a grand bargain again, which we would welcome. 
And by that, I mean, we would give up some unique positioning that we have, if others did the same thing and try to get back to a more innovative, transparent regulated market where we could see innovation as it's unique to the United States, continue to grow our capital markets."

How we see the business' ability to grow through various volume cycles then I'll answer your direct question around volumes. So if you think about this business, this business and what really excited about us and just the results that we've seen in the few months that we've owned it now have just further confirmed the business's ability to grow through volume environments are that: one, it's continuing to gain market share. I've shared the sales results, so you can see that. Number two, more customers equals more loan flow. And when you have more loan flow going onto that network, on average, a loan that's going through our network with customers of ours on the platform, we see that, that loan interacts around 7x with various third parties on the network. 
So each new loan that comes onto that network, there are 7 different times that it's interacting with third-party service providers and services that we provide on that network and for third-party service providers, we get a fee for the efficiency that we provide for somebody interacting with that loan. 
The third area is just -- it's a process that's ripe for automation. And I touched upon the opportunity there. Around 10 million loans and at least $2,600 in efficiency and some subset of that, you do the math, and it's a big number. And then the fourth area is the electronification of the close that we are in a very unique position with the MERS and Simplifile assets and the network that we have on the closing side that's extremely unique, integrating that with our origination network through Encompass by connecting that into an eClose room, and we have several big deliveries this year, one in Q2 of our hybrid eClose offering and then followed shortly after in the second half of the year, a full eClose offering, we see that's going to be an area of growth for 2022 and beyond. 
When it comes to volumes itself, we do have a bit of a unique insight because we are an origination platform, we see almost 50% of loans that are originated in the U.S. We do see that the loans very early on in the process. So we see them when the original application's coming through for a refinance or a purchase, which gives us a 60- to 90-day preview of what the market is going to look like. 
You also -- when you look at industry analysts, you see the estimates that are out there, if you go beyond a quarter or 2, anyone that follows these estimates know that they're subject to revision and significant revision. It's very hard to predict mortgage origination volumes out beyond a couple of quarters, just like it's hard to predict U.S. equity market volumes and oil volumes going out a few quarters to a year. 
What I would say is based on the data that we see in our platform, if you take the estimates like Fannie and Freddie for the next quarter to maximum 2 quarters, those are as close to what we see in the data on our platform as being indicative of what we expect volumes to be. But beyond that, it's difficult to forecast but underneath the covers, with all the other growth areas that we have, regardless of volume environment, we are very optimistic this business can grow."

So we're seeing growth literally across every segment of customer in our platform. So yes, independent mortgage bankers, we are seeing their share of the market. It'd be very strong, in particular, on the purchase side of the market. With refinances, you do tend to see some refinance volume to go to some of the large banks, just because that's where you have a lot of your banking relationship, people tend to go there. But in the purchase market, we are seeing that independent banks are continuing to grow. 
That said, we're growing in each segment. So we service the large banks. We service the independent mortgage banks. We service correspondent banks, wholesale banks, you name it. And we -- looking at that sales strength that I referenced earlier, we're seeing that strength across the entire portfolio. And one of the thing I'd just highlight on the volume front. We tend to -- if you look at our share and our strengths, a lot of it is balanced in the purchase market, albeit we do interact a lot with the refinance market as well. 
When we look at the trends of what happened in 2020 and going into this year, we're seeing application volumes up significantly in refi. They are up as well, significantly in purchase, but not as much as refi. And on the refinance side, if you look at estimates that Fannie and Freddie have, for example, for 30-year mortgages of 2.7% to 2.9% right now for calendar year 2021, that puts up to 20 million units significantly in the money for refinancing, which is a higher number than what we said when we actually announced this deal. 
So we still see a tail in refinance volumes. We're seeing underneath the covers, one of the things on purchase. We are seeing pent-up demand on the purchase side. There's just not a lot of inventory out there. So as vaccines rollout, as the economy starts rolling, as people are willing to move and actually sell, I think you have a decent amount of purchase demand pent-up there as well. Which given that our market shares tend to be a little bit more tilted towards purchase and refi is another tailwind for us."

First of all, as a company, we've never thought that we were a private equity firm or a venture firm and that we should be stewards of our shareholders' money in that regard. We've always thought that excess capital should be returned. But we have made investments in a number of businesses that are adjacent to us where we thought there was some strategic advantage by having a relationship with the company, either by partnering with them or by knowledge transfer and what have you. 
And so we invested in Coinbase in its early rounds because we were trying to understand the blockchain and the significance of digital currencies in payments. And it's -- and obviously, that company has been phenomenally successful. And I'm sure the value of our stake has increased. And our investment was just almost insignificant, honestly so -- in terms of a monetary number. 
The -- I would also say, we have obviously, a similar kind of investment in Bakkt, which, again, was driven by us trying to understand blockchain. And as you may recall, 3 years ago, 2 and 3 years ago, a lot of people were asking us whether blockchain was going to be used for clearing, whether it was going to disrupt the traditional financial services industry, and we wanted to be on top of that technology and have that knowledge. And so we also invested and helped stand up Bakkt which, again, I think, as a company that we have a small basis or a basis that has dramatically increased, say it that way. 
We also made an investment in Euroclear, which is European custody solution that, again, we have adjacency to. Company is doing very, very well. And so we do have, as your question, I think, is trying to allude to, a number of very, very interesting assets that have value that I think over time, we'll try to unlock for our shareholders as those partnerships and knowledge transfers come to some fruition."

And I use that number roughly, but it's somewhat how we think of the business. They're intertwined a virtuous circle of risk management along with the data and information that it takes to manage a portfolio of risk. 
And so it's not surprising to us that others are making moves in that space. With respect to all the companies actually that you mentioned, we have some relationships with them. And in both -- at times, we use some of their platforms, at times, they use some of our platforms and data and indices. And so you've seen a movement of large exchange and data information groups, advancing their own businesses, but also somewhat collaborating across the industry where necessary. So we have a good relationship with the managers of all of those companies, even though in some areas, we're fierce competitors. And in other areas we cooperate for the betterment of the industry."

What's amazing when we -- as we've -- over the last decade, looked at the Mortgage space, you've got an area of the marketplace that you can't emphasize enough how analog it is. When you look at that market share that I had mentioned and you say, well, what's second behind that? What's second behind that is a lot of either homegrown systems, excel spreadsheets or stitched together systems. And that's what gave us a ton of confidence in doing this transaction that there is a long way to go in terms of market share just on the origination side. 
But the other piece that I can't emphasize enough is that we are in a very unique position where not only do we have this very strong origination network that's helping to provide a ton of benefit to our customers in automating this manual workflow. We're in a unique position where we also have the significant network in the electronification of the close in that closing process. 
And where the magic we see is really going to happen in this deal is not only in the automation of the origination front, but by standing up, which we have done, an eClosing room, that for the first time, will link your underwriter of your loans, the bank or independent mortgage company and the underwriter that's underwriting your loan to your attorney, your settlement agent, your title insurance provider, et cetera, all into a digital closing room, to be able to codify that transaction, close it electronically, register it on MERS, both the note as well as the loan, be able to electronically vault all the documentation associated to it and file it in the local county courthouse electronically via Simplifile. 
That is an incredible capability that we're introducing to the market. We already have several key strategic pieces of it launched because we had a partnership with Ellie Mae prior to doing the transaction. And as I mentioned earlier, we have some very key pieces of functionality that are in the pilot phase and rolling out in Q2 on our eClose solution. And then we have another a big set of functionality coming out in the second half of this year. That's all going to lead to long-term 2022, 2023, additional tailwinds for this business."

So the market share, if you are, that we're looking at internally is the bigger TAM of end-to-end services that Ben just described. 
And we have seen, and I've been involved and Ben's been involved, and Scott's been involved. Actually, all of the 3 of us here have all been involved in helping Ellie close some LOS deals where we've been able to articulate the end-to-end vision, and that's brought the new customer to the platform for the loan origination system. But it is that full vision, I think, that is helping to increase the market share if you solely look at loan origination.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on slide 4 with some key highlights from 2020 and a summary of our strong fourth quarter results.

I'll begin on slide 4 with some key highlights from 2020 and a summary of our strong fourth quarter results. Earnings per share of $4.51 were up 16% year-over-year on record revenues of over $6 billion. Free cash flow totaled a record $2.4 billion and we returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We also use some of that cash and our strong credit profile to make the important strategic acquisition of Ellie Mae in September. An acquisition that was nearly 3% accretive to our full year 2020 earnings per share. 
Our fourth quarter results were an exclamation point on a great year. Earnings per share totaled $1.13, up 19% year-over-year. Net revenue totaled approximately $1.7 billion, a 14% increase on a pro forma basis. While we've now transitioned to new segment reporting, I'll mention that fourth quarter Data Services revenues totaled $595 million, which was at the high end of our guidance range and up 6% year-over-year. For the full year, despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic, our data sales teams focused on serving our customers deliver Data Services revenues that grew 5% over the prior year, and were near the top of our guidance entering the year. 
Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $712 million. We were above the high end of our guidance, largely driven by lower levels of capitalized labor as our technology teams who delivered near flawless execution, while largely working from home for most of 2020, took some well-deserved vacation to recharge from an extraordinary year. 
Now let's move to slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled $871 million, up 6% year-over-year. Transaction revenues increased 7%, driven by 6% growth in our Energy business and 21% growth in cash equities and options trading. Importantly, through the end of January, our energy open interest, which we believe is the best indicator of long-term growth was up 4% versus a year ago, including 11% growth in our global natural gas business and 5% growth in our environmental complex. 
Recurring revenues, which include our Exchange data and listing services, increased 3% year-over-year. These results were driven by the NYSE share of strong year-over-year growth in industry SIP revenues. Looking to the first quarter, we expect recurring revenues in the Exchange segment to be between $310 million and $315 million. 
Turning now to slide 6. I'll discuss our fixed income and data services segment. Fourth quarter revenues for the segment grew 3% year-over-year. While transaction revenues declined 16%, recurring revenues, which account for nearly 90% of total segment revenues grew 6% year-over-year. Fixed income data & analytics, which includes our leading pricing and reference data and index business increased by 7%, an acceleration from 6% growth in the third quarter. Other data and network services grew 5% in the fourth quarter, driven by continued growth in customer demand for both ICE Global Network and consolidated feeds. 
Looking to 2021, we expect recurring revenues in this segment to grow 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis for the full year, including $395 million to $400 million in the first quarter. These expectations are supported by ASV growth of 5.7% exiting 2020. 
Please flip to slide 7, where I'll discuss the results in our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. Mortgage Technology revenues grew 65% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 56% for the full year. Fourth quarter transaction revenues increased 92% year-over-year. Favorable financing conditions, accelerating millennial homeownership trends and demand for digital workflow tools, such as our network, closing solutions and analytics all contributed to our strong results. 
Recurring revenues increased 29% versus the prior year as increased utilization and new customer adoption of both our origination technology and analytics continue to expand our subscription base. We expect recurring revenues in the first quarter to range between $122 million and $127 million, representing around 30% growth versus last year on a pro forma basis. 
I'll conclude my remarks on slide 8 with some additional guidance. We expect 2021 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $2.83 billion to $2.88 billion. We expect the spinout of that to reduce expenses versus last year by $50 million. And as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we expect roughly $20 million of additional D&A expense in our Mortgage segment. 
In addition, we plan to invest $25 million to $30 million to enhance our Mortgage Technology platforms to support the significant growth in customers and volumes that we've seen over the past few years and which we expect to continue. With those items roughly netting out, our year-over-year expense growth will be largely consistent with prior years, including investments in our people and tied to revenue growth. 
We expect compensation expense across ICE to increase by $40 million to $50 million. Expenses tied to revenue growth are expected to increase $15 million to $25 million, and FX, based on current spot rates, will add $10 million to $15 million, which will be more than offset by a positive impact to revenues. 
For the first quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $720 million to $730 million, including roughly $23 million related to Bakkt. 
In summary, we delivered a very strong finish to another record year. We once again grew revenues, operating income, free cash flow and earnings per share. We grew our dividend and returned nearly $2 billion to our shareholders. At the same time, we invested in our business to meet the needs of our customers while also expanding our Mortgage Technology network through the acquisition of Ellie Mae. As a result, we've set the stage for continued top and bottom line growth and enhance shareholder returns into 2021 and beyond. 
I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll hand it to Ben to discuss some additional business highlights and key growth initiatives."

Please turn to slide 9, where I'll begin with some of the highlights and key initiatives across our Global Energy business. While inflation, economic growth, and geopolitics will always influence volume trends in a particular quarter or year. We are focusing on investing in the structural growth opportunities that exist across global energy markets. Investments that have been critical to the 7% average annual revenue growth we have generated across our energy and environmental network over the last 5 years. 
In our oil markets, we soon plan to launch ICE Futures Abu Dhabi or IFAD. This is a launch in partnership with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, or ADNOC, and 9 of the world's largest energy trading firms. For the first time, this new exchange will offer futures on Murban crude oil, an important price benchmark for crude flowing through to Asia. 
And by leveraging the existing breadth of our energy network, we will launch an array of related differentials, cracks and intercommodity spreads against our Brent, WTI, gas oil and Naphtha benchmarks. 
In our natural gas markets, the demand centers of Europe and Asia are increasingly at the forefront of global price formation. We began investing in the globalization of gas markets over a decade ago, at a time when exchange-traded volume in our TTF contract was less than 10% of total trading activity. Today, exchange-traded volume is approaching 50%, with open interest in TTF, growing at an average annual rate of nearly 40% since 2015. 
This growing network also plays an important role in the growth of our global environmental markets, where the number of market participants has grown by 40% since 2017 as customers increasingly seek solutions to help navigate the long tail and the complex evolution of Global Energy Markets. 
Turning to slide 10. ICE Mortgage Technology is at the center of an analog-to-digital conversion as customers demand greater workflow automation. In addition, an acceleration of millennial home buying and attractive refinancing conditions continue to provide a tailwind to our robust results. Pro forma Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $1.2 billion in 2020, ahead of the high end of the range we expected for all of 2021 when we announced the acquisition of Ellie Mae back in August. As we execute against this $10 billion addressable market, our approach has been and will be similar to the blueprint we apply across our other networks. 
We will invest behind secular growth, both organically and through acquisition. By adding new tools and content to enhance the value proposition of our network. As a recent example, during the fourth quarter, we launched our credit analyzer. A product that leverages our artificial intelligence engine, or AIQ, to reduce the time it takes to perform a credit review by up to 80%. 
In 2021, we plan to begin rolling out new eClose solutions, an initiative that we believe has a $1 billion addressable market. And we continue to see strong customer uptake across our network and our data and analytics offerings as we execute our strategy of relieving the pain points and inefficiencies that exist across the workflow. 
Turning to slide 11. Our proprietary price evaluation serves as the cornerstone of a network that is uniquely positioned to capture growth opportunities across the fixed income ecosystem. As an example, we are a leading solutions provider to the fixed income ETF industry, which, as many of you know, has seen assets under management grow at an average annual rate of 25% over the last 5 years. Our decades-long position as a leading provider of price information and reference data has served as the foundation for what is today the second largest provider of fixed income indices globally. While critical, our price information and our indices are only a part of what we offer to this growing industry. 
In late 2019, we launched our ETF Hub, a network we designed to reduce the workflow inefficiencies that exist within the ETF create/redeem process. Late last year, we integrated ICE Chat, a platform that we acquired in 2008 and have since grown to over 100,000 users. We also linked ETF Hub to our ICE fixed income Select platform, providing access to our fixed income data and analytics as well as seamless connectivity to our trading venues. 
As a leading provider of these proprietary data services, we have also developed an expertise in the gathering and cleansing of unstructured data, essentially, a skill in building the databases that serve as the foundation for developing actionable insights and identifying opportunities, not only in the fixed income markets but across many other asset classes as well. This is an expertise we are leveraging through new product development, such as our suite of ESG Data Services and some early mortgage data initiatives, which will leverage our growing mortgage technology network. This also applies to new partnerships, such as our announcement to apply our Data Services expertise to ADP's unstructured workforce data to help bring additional insights into the municipal bond markets. 
As we move into 2021, we are excited about the many opportunities for growth that lie ahead, opportunities that we're able to capture because of the investments we've made in the past and the strategic investments we will continue to make across our networks into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."

Please turn to slide 12. Over 2 years ago and in collaboration with Starbucks and Microsoft, among others, we seeded a venture within ICE called Bakkt. Our vision was to leverage our collective core competencies to build a regulated ecosystem that would support the full life cycle of a digital asset, and through efficiency gains and greater transparency, a platform that would have strong network effects within a nascent but rapidly growing asset class. 
Since launching Bakkt in 2018, we've applied our blueprint. We've invested in organic product development by building a consumer wallet and launching futures and options contracts. And we've made inorganic investments by purchasing Bridge2 Solutions and adding digital custody services. In January, Bakkt announced that it will merge with a SPAC, managed by Victory Park capital. The transaction valued Bakkt at an enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion, of which we will retain a 65% economic interest. 
Our decision to merge Bakkt was threefold. First, the combination will provide significant incremental capital, enabling Bakkt to maximize its future growth potential. Second, by listing as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange, Bakkt will benefit from elevated consumer brand recognition. And third, we believe this transaction will unlock value for ICE shareholders. Value that we believe was not fully recognized within the ICE share price. And as you've often heard us say, I believe 1 of the most important parts of my job and the job of the management team here at ICE is to leverage our infrastructure and our expertise to create value for our shareholders. 
In that vein and shifting to what was another successful year, 2020 marked our 15th consecutive year of record adjusted earnings per share, a track record of growth that began with our initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005 and has compounded at an average annualized rate of 17% ever since. 
Our strategic approach to delivering this growth and building shareholder value has been consistent since our inception. Through the application of our world-class technology, leading operating expertise and our unique position both as a creator and distributor of proprietary data services, we create workflow efficiencies that add transparency and that drives powerful network effects across the asset classes that we operate. And as we've expanded into new asset classes, we've grown our addressable market, broadened our expertise and further solidified a foundation for growth well into the future. 
2020 was a year of incredible global challenges. Our customers needed to find ways to protect their employees while continuing to do business as they procured and accessed our products. Our ICE colleagues responded with extraordinary resourcefulness to meet our customer needs. So thank you to our customers for their business and their trust. And thank you to my colleagues at ICE for their remarkable contribution to the best fourth quarter in our company's history, resulting in another consecutive record year of revenues and earnings. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Kate, and we'll conduct an question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern time."

We did want to continue to give transparency in our guidance on those elements of our business that are recurring and a little easier to predict in some of the volume-based business. And you're exactly right that if you add up the total of the recurring guides, it's around midpoint $830 million of revenue, which is just less than half of the overall business. If you look at, we've given you that detail on a pro forma basis, historically, and if you do the math on the guide in the first quarter, those recurring revenues are growing 7% to 9%. 
So very strong performance on a very stable part of our business right out of the gate, obviously, led by a strong performance in the Mortgage business, which has picked up customers, picked up volume from existing customers, but then also the Data business, which, again, despite the pandemic, as I said in my remarks, sales team did a remarkable job and put us in a position where ASV was nearly 6% entering this year. So we feel very good about those recurring businesses, and we intend to continue to give you each quarter, our perspective on what we expect of those revenues to be. 
You asked specifically about the recurring nature of the Mortgage business. I'll let Ben give you a little color on what's driving that great performance."

So the first thing to start with is on the Mortgage side of the business, when someone subscribes to come on to our network, they're getting our full platform and our network services as part of that. So there's a base level of subscription fee that someone's paying to be a part of that, and that's really what that recurring revenue piece is. 
And when we analyze the deal, one of the exciting things that we saw under the covers here and that I've talked about in terms of the different TAMs that we can go after here with this business, out of that $10 billion TAM, $4 billion of it alone is just in the origination side. And automating that whole origination process. And we had seen that Ellie Mae had increased market share from 38% to 44% in a pretty short period of time, and we had conviction that they're going to continue to grow market share in that space. 
And I'm pleased to say that under the covers, what we've seen in terms of sales performance, and I even highlighted this on the last quarterly earnings call, back in October, that the sales results have been phenomenal in terms of selling new versions of our loan origination system into new customers and then also cross-sells of our products into the customer base. 
And to go into that even a little bit further in Q3 and Q4 the company set all-time records in terms of bookings on the encompass loan origination system. So Q3 and Q4 were the 2 highest quarters ever in the company's history. Q4 across the entire Ellie Mae product set was the largest bookings quarter ever in the company's history. So all of that are real tailwinds, and Scott gave the guide to the Q1 recurring revenue for the business as well and why we feel really strong about the business' ability to grow that recurring revenue base regardless of volume environments."

And then we are convinced that on an annual basis, we can grow this business, and this business will grow 8% to 10% per year on average over 10 years. 
And underneath the covers, as I just referenced in the answer I gave to Rich. If you look under the covers of what's happened with that business since we've acquired it, sales strength has been very strong. So I mentioned a couple of the Encompass records that we saw over the last couple of quarters. Also -- and that's $4 billion of the $10 billion TAM, another $4 billion of that $10 billion TAM is around data and analytics. And we also saw record sales of our AIQ platform, so record bookings of the analyzers that are automating that origination workflow in the fourth quarter. 
We continue to see strength across Encompass as well as AIQ in January, and we're ahead in January than where we thought we were going to be in terms of our model. What this means is that as we're hitting these types of sales results and sales records for the company, it obviously means there's going to be more recurring revenue into the business. It means there's going to be more customers on the business. There's going to be more loans that are on the platform that are now on our network, loans that we did not interact with before. And more loans on our network interact with the third parties on the network that we have. And for the efficiencies that we provide to people ordering services like a flood report or a credit report of that network. We monetize that and charge a service fee for the efficiency that we're providing. 
So all of these we see as significant tailwinds into the business that give us confidence that we can grow regardless of volume environment over a long period of time with that 8% to 10% guide."

I think your question, as I understood it, was looking at kind of the recurring revenues in the Exchange business and specifically Exchange data what are our expectations in terms of any revenue impacts from ongoing dialogue with the SEC, and the answer is none. 
We're in conversations about changes they've discussed. But right now, we haven't seen any impact. We don't anticipate any impact. I'll tell you what I think is consistent with what we've said for probably the last 2 or 3 years, which is that's not a line we expect to generate a lot of growth for us. It's not a line that we expect it's going to go down much. It's just kind of be stable. 
And again, we've given you some history on the recurring revenue and if you look 3Q, 4Q, the guide to 1Q, they're all kind of right in that same number. So there is no expectation on our end that there are any changes that are likely to impact revenue this year. We've also said in the past, and I think it's still true that any changes that did come will likely come in over the course of 2, 3, 5 years, not immediately. So the net-net answer is that no real impact is expected on that bucket of revenue for us this year."

And when we're looking at and analyzing doing the acquisition of Ellie Mae. It's one of the areas we were absolutely most excited about. And the area of this business under data and analytics is really that AIQ business. That's an acquisition that Ellie May had done a few years ago. 
And if you look at the heart of what that business is all about and investments that have been made, it's all about automating the very manual part of the origination workflow. And we've used statistics in the past of it costing around $8,000 to -- per mortgage to manufacture one. And out of that $8,000, $5,200 of it is just associated to manual processing. And at a minimum, we believe through our AI offerings, there is a great opportunity to chip away at a minimum half of that. So $2,600 in savings is ripe for automation. 
And this is things like I mentioned in the script, around credit analyzers. And last quarter, I talked about our income analyzers. This is taking all the stare and compare work that happens. And when you get a credit report to see what was the date of it? What was the score? You compare the score on the credit report to the information that we have in our oil rigs business around what are the underwriting requirements for the particular product that this customer has applied for. And we're able to automate a ton of the process right now that is done manually, and it's one of the highest growth sales items we've seen. And as I said in answer to a prior question that we hit a record in Q4 of new sales of this product. 
And in terms of the $4 billion TAM, it's a pretty easy number to get to. And if you look at the efficiencies that we provide and assume conservatively, it's $2,600 in savings per loan that we can provide to customers. If we monetize a part of that, say, some subset of that, and you use a round number of around 10 million loans being done per year, which is way down from what it was last year, you do the math on 10 million loans, we roughly have almost 50% market share and loan flow that's going through times 1 subset of that save, and you get to a very big number very quickly. And as our customers are seeing that benefit, we're obviously monetizing it for providing that to them."

First of all, I don't know that $5 million wide on an over $100 million guide is that wide and it's simply a matter of customers that we've onboarded and that we expect to continue onboard. I mean that's the thing -- again, if you look at the history that we've provided on that line, our recurring Mortgage Technology revenues in fourth quarter of '19 were $92 million. They were $95 million, $100 million, $108 million, $119 million. 
So we've seen that consistent growth on a sequential quarterly basis because of everything Ben talked about, more customers, customers that has a certain number of seats signed up for more seat and so we expect growth to go through the quarter and exactly whether or not that growth is going to add $1 million or $3 million, again, on an over $120 million guide, plus or minus a little bit, it doesn't seem like that wide a gap. Because it's not $5 million wide, it's actually plus or minus $2.5 million but -- so we feel good about it. 
What I said on the data business, and to be specific, the fixed income recurring revenues was that based on a 5.7% ASV, we fully expect the business to again grow right around that at 5% to 6% for the year. As you know, that ASV figure now is effectively 100% of the revenue in that segment. And so we're able to tell you that plus or minus a little bit, given that ASV is at 5.7%, we think 5% to 6% growth is the right view in terms of thinking about the full year for that fixed income recurring revenue.

So you have the merged business in there, you have Simplifile. And you have the Encompass system and the Ellie Mae business in there. 
Some of the areas that we're looking to leverage the data sets and the power of the data sets in there are simple things like when you're going through a mortgage origination process, one of the most common areas where you'll see errors is very late in the process when you get to the closing. And what happens at the closing is that you have to compare the original estimates of what your closing fees were going to be at the closing table from what the original estimates were that were provided 60-plus days ago. 
And if those numbers are off by any amount, and it's not even a material amount. It could be 0 tolerance to 10% tolerance, you have to go back through the entire origination process again. What we found is that Simplifile has all of that information. They know exactly what the closing requirements are, what the fees are in every jurisdiction around the U.S. as we manage all of that reference data for our clients in the closing process. Pulling that type of information all the way upfront to the origination process, and then combining that with our Artificial Intelligence expertise and automation expertise that we have in our AI tools is able to create a significant amount more efficiency and a higher quality loan asset that's going to be less subject to errors as you get to the closing table. And a lot of these capabilities in the Artificial Intelligence area and how to leverage this type of information and data is directly coming from the expertise that we have on the data side of the business."

And the Ellie Mae business that we acquired was -- really turns out has been a really great business since we've owned it. But don't underestimate that a lot of the acceleration of the growth that we've seen comes from the vision that we're articulating of an end-to-end platform managed by ICE. 
We live in a society today where many of the platforms that we interact with, you have to ask yourself, am I actually their customer, they're providing a service to me, but am I actually the customer because is the customer, the person who's buying the data off of that platform? Or is the customer the person that's giving up the data in exchange for free usage? And we're seeing a lot of examples right now in our society of people that believe that these free services are -- that they are actually customers. And in reality, they're not providing any revenue to them. The revenue is coming from a different source. 
And so as we're out selling our vision, we're having that conversation with people in the mortgage industry, and it is resonating. The very data that you asked Ben about and the way that artificial intelligence will interact with that data. Is an area that ICE has built decades of trust in the financial services industry about how we manage that data, who owns it, where it's going to go and how we're going to protect it. And I think that, that bodes well for us as we continue to have a broader conversation in our society about data privacy and data rights."

And I think as you've heard through the guidance that Scott gave, fortunately or unfortunately, that infrastructure paralyzes the industry somewhat and stifles innovation in my view. And so we're going to have a new SEC chair. And if chairman Gensler is confirmed and actually takes that seat, he's a person that worked in the derivative space for part of his career, worked in the regulated commodities and derivatives space for part of his career and has a deep interest in and knowledge of market structure. 
The SEC has got a dual role, and to a sense, it's an enforcement agency and a consumer protection agency as well as a market structure agency. And historically, the people that have chaired the agency have been lawyers by training, who are much more comfortable on the enforcement and compliance side of things. And I think there's an opportunity, and we'll see if it results, but there's an opportunity with a new chair and a new vision inside the SEC to potentially talk about a grand bargain again, which we would welcome. 
And by that, I mean, we would give up some unique positioning that we have, if others did the same thing and try to get back to a more innovative, transparent regulated market where we could see innovation as it's unique to the United States, continue to grow our capital markets."

So if you think about this business, this business and what really excited about us and just the res",571,"Ari. Yes, I'll go through it. How we see the business' ability to grow through various volume cycles then I'll answer your direct question around volumes. So if you think about this business, this business and what really excited about us and just the results that we've seen in the few months that we've owned it now have just further confirmed the business's ability to grow through volume environments are that: one, it's continuing to gain market share. I've shared the sales results, so you can see that. Number two, more customers equals more loan flow. And when you have more loan flow going onto that network, on average, a loan that's going through our network with customers of ours on the platform, we see that, that loan interacts around 7x with various third parties on the network. 
So each new loan that comes onto that network, there are 7 different times that it's interacting with third-party service providers and services that we provide on that network and for third-party service providers, we get a fee for the efficiency that we provide for somebody interacting with that loan. 
The third area is just -- it's a process that's ripe for automation. And I touched upon the opportunity there. Around 10 million loans and at least $2,600 in efficiency and some subset of that, you do the math, and it's a big number. And then the fourth area is the electronification of the close that we are in a very unique position with the MERS and Simplifile assets and the network that we have on the closing side that's extremely unique, integrating that with our origination network through Encompass by connecting that into an eClose room, and we have several big deliveries this year, one in Q2 of our hybrid eClose offering and then followed shortly after in the second half of the year, a full eClose offering, we see that's going to be an area of growth for 2022 and beyond. 
When it comes to volumes itself, we do have a bit of a unique insight because we are an origination platform, we see almost 50% of loans that are originated in the U.S. We do see that the loans very early on in the process. So we see them when the original application's coming through for a refinance or a purchase, which gives us a 60- to 90-day preview of what the market is going to look like. 
You also -- when you look at industry analysts, you see the estimates that are out there, if you go beyond a quarter or 2, anyone that follows these estimates know that they're subject to revision and significant revision. It's very hard to predict mortgage origination volumes out beyond a couple of quarters, just like it's hard to predict U.S. equity market volumes and oil volumes going out a few quarters to a year. 
What I would say is based on the data that we see in our platform, if you take the estimates like Fannie and Freddie for the next quarter to maximum 2 quarters, those are as close to what we see in the data on our platform as being indicative of what we expect volumes to be. But beyond that, it's difficult to forecast but underneath the covers, with all the other growth areas that we have, regardless of volume environment, we are very optimistic this business can grow."

So we're seeing growth literally across every segment of customer in our platform. So yes, independent mortgage bankers, we are seeing their share of the market. It'd be very strong, in particular, on the purchase side of the market. With refinances, you do tend to see some refinance volume to go to some of the large banks, just because that's where you have a lot of your banking relationship, people tend to go there. But in the purchase market, we are seeing that independent banks are continuing to grow. 
That said, we're growing in each segment. So we service the large banks. We service the independent mortgage banks. We service correspondent banks, wholesale banks, you name it. And we -- looking at that sales strength that I referenced earlier, we're seeing that strength across the entire portfolio. And one of the thing I'd just highlight on the volume front. We tend to -- if you look at our share and our strengths, a lot of it is balanced in the purchase market, albeit we do interact a lot with the refinance market as well. 
When we look at the trends of what happened in 2020 and going into this year, we're seeing application volumes up significantly in refi. They are up as well, significantly in purchase, but not as much as refi. And on the refinance side, if you look at estimates that Fannie and Freddie have, for example, for 30-year mortgages of 2.7% to 2.9% right now for calendar year 2021, that puts up to 20 million units significantly in the money for refinancing, which is a higher number than what we said when we actually announced this deal. 
So we still see a tail in refinance volumes. We're seeing underneath the covers, one of the things on purchase. We are seeing pent-up demand on the purchase side. There's just not a lot of inventory out there. So as vaccines rollout, as the economy starts rolling, as people are willing to move and actually sell, I think you have a decent amount of purchase demand pent-up there as well. Which given that our market shares tend to be a little bit more tilted towards purchase and refi is another tailwind for us."

First of all, as a company, we've never thought that we were a private equity firm or a venture firm and that we should be stewards of our shareholders' money in that regard. We've always thought that excess capital should be returned. But we have made investments in a number of businesses that are adjacent to us where we thought there was some strategic advantage by having a relationship with the company, either by partnering with them or by knowledge transfer and what have you. 
And so we invested in Coinbase in its early rounds because we were trying to understand the blockchain and the significance of digital currencies in payments. And it's -- and obviously, that company has been phenomenally successful. And I'm sure the value of our stake has increased. And our investment was just almost insignificant, honestly so -- in terms of a monetary number. 
The -- I would also say, we have obviously, a similar kind of investment in Bakkt, which, again, was driven by us trying to understand blockchain. And as you may recall, 3 years ago, 2 and 3 years ago, a lot of people were asking us whether blockchain was going to be used for clearing, whether it was going to disrupt the traditional financial services industry, and we wanted to be on top of that technology and have that knowledge. And so we also invested and helped stand up Bakkt which, again, I think, as a company that we have a small basis or a basis that has dramatically increased, say it that way. 
We also made an investment in Euroclear, which is European custody solution that, again, we have adjacency to. Company is doing very, very well. And so we do have, as your question, I think, is trying to allude to, a number of very, very interesting assets that have value that I think over time, we'll try to unlock for our shareholders as those partnerships and knowledge transfers come to some fruition."

They're intertwined a virtuous circle of risk management along with the data and information that it takes to manage a portfolio of risk. 
And so it's not surprising to us that others are making moves in that space. With respect to all the companies actually that you mentioned, we have some relationships with them. And in both -- at times, we use some of their platforms, at times, they use some of our platforms and data and indices. And so you've seen a movement of large exchange and data information groups, advancing their own businesses, but also somewhat collaborating across the industry where necessary.

When you look at that market share that I had mentioned and you say, well, what's second behind that? What's second behind that is a lot of either homegrown systems, excel spreadsheets or stitched together systems. And that's what gave us a ton of confidence in doing this transaction that there is a long way to go in terms of market share just on the origination side. 
But the other piece that I can't emphasize enough is that we are in a very unique position where not only do we have this very strong origination network that's helping to provide a ton of benefit to our customers in automating this manual workflow. We're in a unique position where we also have the significant network in the electronification of the close in that closing process. 
And where the magic we see is really going to happen in this deal is not only in the automation of the origination front, but by standing up, which we have done, an eClosing room, that for the first time, will link your underwriter of your loans, the bank or independent mortgage company and the underwriter that's underwriting your loan to your attorney, your settlement agent, your title insurance provider, et cetera, all into a digital closing room, to be able to codify that transaction, close it electronically, register it on MERS, both the note as well as the loan, be able to electronically vault all the documentation associated to it and file it in the local county courthouse electronically via Simplifile. 
That is an incredible capability that we're introducing to the market. We already have several key strategic pieces of it launched because we had a partnership with Ellie Mae prior to doing the transaction. And as I mentioned earlier, we have some very key pieces of functionality that are in the pilot phase and rolling out in Q2 on our eClose solution. And then we have another a big set of functionality coming out in the second half of this year. That's all going to lead to long-term 2022, 2023, additional tailwinds for this business."

So the market share, if you are, that we're looking at internally is the bigger TAM of end-to-end services that Ben just described. 
And we have seen, and I've been involved and Ben's been involved, and Scott's been involved. Actually, all of the 3 of us here have all been involved in helping Ellie close some LOS deals where we've been able to articulate the end-to-end vision, and that's brought the new customer to the platform for the loan origination system. But it is that full vision, I think, that is helping to increase the market share if you solely look at loan origination.

First quarter revenues, operating inco",1038,"Thanks, Mary Caroline. Congratulations on your new role, truly well deserved. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some key highlights from our first quarter results. First quarter revenues, operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share were all the best in the history of our company. 
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.34 increased 7% compared to our previous record of $1.25, which we achieved in last year's first quarter. Record total first quarter revenues of $1.8 billion were up 4% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Total transaction revenues declined slightly versus an unprecedented backdrop a year ago. Importantly though, total recurring revenues, which represent about half our business, increased by 9% with all 3 of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth. 
First quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $729 million, including $30 million related to Bakkt. Without the additional $7 million of Bakkt investments, we would have been toward the lower end of our original guidance. We expect that Bakkt's merger with Victory Park Spac will be completed toward the end of this quarter. We expect second quarter adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $742 million to $752 million, including approximately $35 million of additional expense related to Bakkt. 
Incorporating the additional Bakkt expenses into our full year guidance as well as slightly higher-than-expected FX, which will be more than offset by higher revenues, we now expect full year adjusted expenses to be in the range of $2.88  billion to $2.93 billion. 
First quarter free cash flow totaled over $700 million. We used this strong cash generation to grow our dividend payout by 12% even as we reduced our leverage to 3.8x EBITDA by quarter's end. In addition, during April, we elected to sell our 1.4% stake in Coinbase, which generated over $1.2 billion in gross proceeds and approximately $900 million net of taxes. 
Assuming those proceeds have been used to reduce debt at the end of the first quarter, our pro forma leverage would have been closer to 3.6x compared to 4.2x when we acquired Ellie Mae just over 6 months ago. Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. First quarter revenues totaled $974 million, including transaction revenues of $653 million, the second best quarter in our company's history. 
This strong performance was driven by our energy, interest rate and cash equities businesses. Importantly, open interest, which we believe is the best indicator of long-term growth is up 13% versus the end of 2020, including 5% growth in our energy open interest and 26% growth across our financial futures and options complex. Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and NYSE listings, increased 5% year-over-year, driven by continued strong equity capital market trends and NYSE share of industry SIP revenues. 
Looking to the second quarter, we expect recurring revenues in our Exchange segment to be between $315 million and $320 million. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. First quarter revenues totaled $468 million, 6.5% growth in our recurring revenues, which account for nearly 90% of total segment revenues more than offset a year-over-year decline in transaction revenues. 
Fixed Income data and analytics, which includes both our leading pricing and reference data and index businesses, increased by 7%. Other data and network services grew 6%, driven by continued customer demand for additional network capacity. Looking to the second quarter, we expect recurring revenues to improve sequentially and to be in a range of $401 million to $406 million. 
This outlook is supported by ASV entering the second quarter at $1.6 billion, up over 5% year-over-year. Looking to the balance of 2021 and consistent with the guidance provided during our fourth quarter earnings call, we continue to expect recurring revenues in our Fixed Income and Data Services business to grow 5% to 6% for the full year. 
Let's go next to Slide 7, where I'll discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. Mortgage Technology revenues grew 61% year-over-year in the first quarter. First quarter transaction revenues increased 84% year-over-year. Favorable financing conditions, accelerating millennial homeownership trends and demand for digital workflow tools, such as our origination technology, closing solutions and analytics, all contributed to our strong results. 
Recurring revenues once again improved sequentially and increased 32% versus the prior year. Increased adoption in new customers of both our origination technology and analytics continued to expand our subscription base. We expect recurring revenues in the second quarter to again increase sequentially to a range between $128 million and $133 million, representing around 30% growth versus the prior year. As a note, in an effort to improve transparency and better align our reporting with our targeted addressable markets, we are now reporting closing solutions as a single business line. 
These revenues will include both our eClose initiatives and revenues from merge registrations. Our closing solutions today already represent over 20% of a $1 billion addressable market. In addition, we've moved our network revenues into our origination technology business line. This business today represents around 20% of the $4 billion underwriting and processing TAM that we highlighted during the Ellie Mae deal call. 
In summary, 2021 is off to a strong start. We once again grew revenues, operating income, free cash flow and adjusted earnings per share. At the same time, we continue to invest in our business to meet the needs of our customers. As a result, we've set the stage for continued top and bottom line growth and enhance shareholder returns in 2021 and beyond. Warren and the team will handle Q&A today. But before I hand it to Ben, I want to congratulate Warren on his new role and wish him great success. I also want to thank Jeff for the opportunity. He gave me 14 years ago to help build this great business that he started. And finally, I want to thank all my ICE colleagues. It's been an honor and a privilege to work alongside you as a part of the ice team. Ben, over to you."

Thank you, and good morning to everyone on the call. Please turn to Slide 8. As we begin to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic and the highly volatile environment we experienced in 2020 and our customers continue to rely on our global energy markets to navigate uncertainty and manage risk. And importantly, it's our network expertise and investment in technology that enables us to deliver innovative customer solutions and capture the growth opportunities provided by secular trends, such as the growing complexity of energy markets alongside the energy transition. 
In our oil markets, Brent crude serves as the cornerstone of a global network that includes key benchmarks such as WTI, gas oil, [indiscernible] Gas and most recently, Murban crude oil. By leveraging our global network, the launch of ICE Futures Abu Dhabi, or IFAD, has enabled for the first time participants to come together and contribute to the price formation of Murban, an important benchmark for oil flowing through to Asia. In just its first month, Murban, along with related derivatives has traded over 150,000 contracts across 49 firms with growing open interest now over 45,000 lots making it one of the most successful futures launches in our industry's history. 
Natural gas continues to globalize, a trend we began investing in nearly a decade ago through our acquisition of Index. Today, our European TTF and Asian JKM gas complexes continue to grow and reach important milestones as they evolve into global gas benchmarks. In the first quarter, the number of participants in each market grew double digits year-over-year and TTF futures reached record volumes. 
In addition, open interest trends remained strong, up 18% and 14% year-over-year for TTF Futures and JKM, respectively. This strength along with growing exchange market share and new product development continues to underscore the significance of our contracts to the price formation of global natural gas. In our environmental markets, price appreciation in European emissions drove the ICE global carbon index to record levels in the first quarter. 
Market-based mechanisms, such as our cap and trade offering, are critical to enabling the price transparency that is required to properly attribute a cost to pollution and ultimately help our customers reach their emissions goals in a cost-effective manner. We recognize the importance of carbon price transparency over 10 years ago, acquiring the Climate Exchange in 2010. And we have seen our environmental volumes and open interest grow nearly double digits on average every year since. 
By combining the network and liquidity of our global energy complex with our leading environmental complex we are well positioned to help our customers navigate this evolution across global energy markets. Moving to our Fixed Income business. As fixed income markets electronify and passive investing grows, our comprehensive Fixed Income data platform continues to deliver compounding revenue growth. 
Our quality end-of-day and real-time evaluated prices provide mission-critical price transparency for nearly 3 million securities per day. Additionally, our flexible delivery solutions enable customers to consume data in a variety of ways, which they are increasingly demanding as they seek more efficient workflow solutions. Our proprietary price evaluations, along with our broad suite of data, serve as the foundation for many innovative solutions such as our rapidly growing index franchise, a business we built through both organic and inorganic investment, including our acquisitions of IDC and the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Index platform. 
In the first quarter, we not only saw multiple ETF sponsors switch their benchmark provider to ICE Data Indices, but we also saw growth in the use of our custom index solutions across the U.S., Europe, in Asia Pacific. This strength, once again, drove double-digit revenue growth in our Index business and is a testament to the value of our comprehensive index and broader Fixed Income data and analytics offering. 
Similar to the playbook, we operate across our global energy and Fixed Income businesses, in Mortgages, we are leveraging technology, data and our network expertise to build innovative solutions that drive workflow efficiencies. With the touch point to nearly every market participant, we have connectivity to a customer base in need of the automation that our digital solutions provide. As customers increasingly seek these efficiencies across the very manual loan origination process, our leading origination technology, known as Encompass, provides valuable digital solutions that can reduce both the time and cost required to originate a loan. 
Combined with our unique network of proprietary and third-party services, we are well positioned to lead the transformation of an industry that is moving analog to digital, an opportunity that we think has an addressable market of $4 billion in the origination and processing space alone. In the second quarter, we launched our Encompass eClose offering, a product we were able to rapidly bring to market by quickly integrating Simplifile's closing solutions into our leading origination platform. 
Our new eClose offering is a leading-edge solution that will provide a true end-to-end electronic closing for U.S. mortgages by decreasing operational costs for lenders, creating additional efficiencies for settlement agents, streamlining the sale of loan to investors and importantly, greatly improving the overall borrower experience. We are encouraged by the early demand and remain focused on building out our closing solutions within this $1 billion addressable market. 
Another example of innovation that we are delivering to the mortgage industry is within our data and analytics business. We know from our experience across futures, equities and fixed income networks that data fuels automation. And the mortgage origination process is no different. Through our AIQ offering, customers can leverage our artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to drive significant efficiency gains. Analytics such as our credit analyzers and income analyzers, leverage automated document recognition and data extraction technology to reduce the manual staring compare work that exists across the mortgage workflow today. 
And at less than $100 million in revenue, in our mortgage data and analytics business, is well positioned to increasingly capture share of what we believe is a $4 billion addressable market. Importantly, the demand we are seeing for solutions like our eClose and our data and analytics gives us confidence that we can grow through business cycles, and as a result, grow a business that at $1.2 billion today in revenue is only a fraction of the $10 billion addressable market that is in the early days of an analog to digital conversion. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff."

Please turn now to Slide 9. In the first quarter, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share, delivering the best quarter in our company's history. And remarkably, we did this against last year's record-breaking volumes and volatility, which was largely driven by the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic. 
Our results are a testament to the value of our data, technology and the strength of our strategic business model. The compounding growth of our subscription based services, combined with our diverse transaction-based businesses means that our growth is not tied to one economic cycle, to one geography or to one asset class. Rather, it means growth on top of growth through all rate environments, across asset classes and around the world. 
Over the past 20 years, ICE has continually evolved to meet the needs of our customers and provide value for our stockholders. And for the past 14 years, I've had the privilege of working alongside Scott Hill as our growth story has unfolded. ICE has completed dozens of deals and made thousands of strategic decisions that have been rooted in the information and the quality metrics that were ingrained in our culture by Scott. 
Scott not only provided financial leadership for the company but he's played a vital role in providing strategic vision. He championed our unique culture, and he's mentored younger generations of leaders. And so I want to thank Scott for his contribution, for his dedication and for his leadership. And I want to wish him our best as he moves on to tackle the difficult life of branching in Texas. Scott will officially transition next month, and he'll remain an adviser and a mentor to ensure a smooth transition as Warren Gardner assumes the duties of CFO. 
Warren's has worked closely with Scott over the last 4 years and covered our sector as a senior research analyst for many years prior to this. Warren's knowledge of our business and our industry will help us to continue to build on the foundation that's been established by Scott, and continue a track record of growth. I also want to welcome MC as our new Investor Relations Head. Let me say thank you to our customers for their business and their trust in the quarter. And I want to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to delivering the best quarter in our company's history. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to our moderator, Chad, to conduct the question-and-answer session, which will run until 9:30 Eastern time."

And thanks for observing what we've seen in the marketplace in terms of a downturn in transaction volumes. As I can confirm, we saw a downturn in closed loans on our Encompass platform, when you look at Q1 closed loan volume versus Q4. And as our results are testament to, we were able to grow through it. And what I'd point to is what we said when we originally announced the deal back in September, in that we see, just like we saw in the commodities markets 2 decades ago, just like we've seen in the fixed income markets that the mortgage space is an industry that's going through a significant analog to digital transition. 
And we knew by combining the closing network that we have with the unique customer originator and investor network that Ellie Mae has that we can do something really special here for our customers in providing a digital future and a lot of efficiencies. And that's how we got conviction that we can grow through long-term cycles. And that's how we put out a guide, a 10-year guide of roughly doubling revenue. When you look at that 8% to 10% guide over a 10-year period. That's roughly doubling revenue. 
And what we've seen in the platform has done nothing but strengthen our conviction over the last 8 months in our ability to do that. Last quarter, I mentioned that Q3 and Q4 sales expectations well exceeded our model that we put together last summer when we did the deal. And Q1 continued this trend. And what we get -- tactically, what you get when you're increasing your penetration into new sales, you're getting new subscription revenue when you implement and then as you ramp the customers up, you're getting more loans that you're interacting with that you were never interacting with before. Those loans than interactive services are our network. So you have a flywheel effect, you have a compounding effect. 
But I think more importantly, this is what I was trying to get through in the script, is that when a customer is choosing our solution set, they're choosing to fundamentally change their business. They're fundamentally choosing to remove manual processing and adopt digital ways to automate. And when they select us, they're selecting us to be the heart and lungs there. To be their network that's interconnecting them to every player that we interact with from our front-to-back network. And as they realize those benefits from being part of our ecosystem, it enables us to cross-sell our other services that I also mentioned in the script, such as our AIQ offering, which is that automation of the underwrite, as well as eClose. So that's what gives us conviction on the ability to grow this business sequentially, quarter-over-quarter on subscription revenue growth and to grow through downturns or to outperform downturns in terms of volumes just as we did Q1 versus Q4."

And when you look at our futures markets and how we've developed them versus any of our peers, we have been stayed very close to the commercial customer base since our inception. And that's what's enabled us to develop literally hundreds of oil contracts around the world because it helps our customers not only manage the risk in a benchmark contract, but also help them manage their risk at the point of consumption or the point of production of where they have real risk. 
And we're the only truly global platform that enables customers with deep liquid markets and hundreds and hundreds of marketplaces to be able to manage that risk. And with the backdrop of COVID going on the past year, we didn't stop moving. We continue to partner with our commercial customers around the world, and that's what led to the launch of ICE Futures Abu Dhabi, just in the last few weeks here. 
And in the early days, it looks like one of the to be -- one of the most successful future launches in history. And what I'd point to with that is not only the volume growth but also the -- importantly, the significant open interest growth and the fact that there's 49 major players that are in there utilizing the contracts, establishing positions to manage risk. And I look at that compared to other parts of our oil business, that across the board are doing very well. If you compare our overall oil open interest right now in April versus the fourth quarter, we're up in almost every major product category. 
You compare April oil open interest versus April 2019, we're up in almost every category. If you look at under the covers from a year-over-year basis, while there's some tough compares, in there. We have significant product sets, such as our Asia refined product set, gas oil and Dubai that are up year-over-year. So we believe we have a great foundation we've already been in Asia, have a number of significant products out there that enable customers to hedge and manage risk, and we're going to stay very close to our commercial customer base to look for more opportunities to do so."

I wanted to go back to the Mortgage business for a second. So clearly, organic growth remains really strong. Ben, great to hear the sales momentum continues to be above projections in the first quarter. But the market clearly seems to be overly concerned about the refi cliff, so to speak, in the market, which would hit your transaction revenue. So can you help us maybe unpack how much of the $230 million related to transaction revenues is refi versus new purchases? 
I think legacy LMA was about 50-50, but that mis has probably evolved here. And I guess, how would you frame the downside risk to this revenue bucket, assuming current industry refinance expectations come through?

I'll start, and then I'll hand it to Warren on the expense side. So when you look at the -- you had a number of different questions in there, so I'll try to unpack a couple of different things that we're seeing. So first, the answer that I had for Rich's question is important to go back to. So we're not looking at this as a quarter-over-quarter business and really worry or read about volumes that are changing each quarter because we see that there's just a long-term change that's happening towards digitization, we see substantial TAMs that are out there that when you look at our presence in each of those TAMs have not only a long runway, but we have a lot of opportunity for growth in each of them. 
The core being that encompass and the network set that we have, where we have a little over 20% look at the trailing 12 months, roughly 20% of that TAM is a starting place that we have. And as we continue to sign new customers, as we continue to onboard those customers on. We're interacting with new loans. We're getting to more subscription revenue. We're getting more transaction volume, and those loans are interacting with more services on our network. We believe we're very well positioned to go after that. 
The other thing I can't emphasize enough is the other 2 TAMs are really a cross-sell opportunity. We are already touching at some point in our network from our customer acquisition and the point-of-sale systems that we have to the loan origination network that we have that's now interconnected to our closing network. We're touching just about every player in the mortgage ecosystem. So our ability to sell these new services is a cross-sell. 
So we feel very, very good about our position to grow in the closing -- against the closing TAM, which we have roughly a 20% of that TAM today. But we're very uniquely positioned with the new e close offering that we've launched to go after a significant amount more of that. And then on the AIQ, that's the automation of the actual underwrite process itself. We're seeing -- we continue to see record sales volumes of that product, which, again, is a cross-sell to core encompass customers. When it comes to mix on our platform, because if you look at just the loan origination side, there is a little bit of a tilt towards nonbank originators and nonbank originators tend to have a slight tilt towards purchase market versus refi. 
A lot of people do their refis with banks that they -- large banks that they have their established banking relationships with. We tend to benefit more from a market that's moving more towards purchase. But that said, it's on the edges there. And when you look at our entire network, we're working with just about every player in the industry is utilizing one of our services around one point of our network."

So -- and that's what I would point to the first the answer that I gave to Rich, pleased with the new sales results that we've seen as well as cross-sell results that we've seen on the platform. And the way to think about that recurring revenue",364,"Yes. Sure. So -- and that's what I would point to the first the answer that I gave to Rich, pleased with the new sales results that we've seen as well as cross-sell results that we've seen on the platform. And the way to think about that recurring revenue and what gives us confidence in the fact that, that recurring revenue do will grow sequentially quarter-over-quarter, and we're guiding to growth next quarter is that we continue to see -- and there's a mix in that recurring revenue line of customers that are expanding their footprint with us. 
And expanding their footprint with us can mean that they're adding new loan officers, they have more volume on their platform, so they go ahead and expand their footprint with us. And when they do that, that falls to the subscription line item very quickly. The second thing that you see is that we have cross-sells of other products to our customer base so they expand and buy other services that we have. 
It could be our AllRegs business, our Maven business, very importantly, our AIQ services. So we're seeing that as a very high cross-sell into our customer base. Some of those services require a short implementation time frame after we sell it, there may be a lag before the subscription revenue comes. But that's the other element. And then new customers, we're seeing new customer acquisition. 
As I mentioned last quarter, a record Q3 and Q4 in terms of gathering new customers. And then Q1 well exceeded our expectations, both in our original model as well as our budget in terms of signing new customers onto the platform. And when we sign those new customers onto the platform, they do need to be implemented. It's a cloud-based platform, so the implementation isn't that long, but there is some lag between when we sell it, and then that drops to the subscription line. 
And then once the customer is implemented, they start to ramp, and that's when we start to see the loan transaction volume and then those loans interacting with our network, then build and then we see more transaction volume building on that."

So this is an area when you look at just the raw numbers versus the TAM. We're obviously very early stages here. So we have 2% to 3% of the TAM, is what we have if you look at our current revenues versus a $4 billion opportunity here. And this we see as a near-term TAM that we are executing against. That's why we had it in the script. That's why we've highlighted in the last couple of calls that this AIQ offering is really seeing some good pickup across our customer base. We had record sales of it in the third and fourth quarter. And this is another area where we've well exceeded our expectations into Q1 of really cross-selling the service into our encompass customer base. 
And what this enables is it's really the core of where you're able to take out a ton of the manual processing. We've mentioned that our estimates are -- that it cost $8,000 to manufacture a loan today. And out of that, about $5,200 of that is just manual processing. And by first applying our automated document recognition and extraction technology, but then also putting our mortgage expertise on top of that to say, okay, as we extract this data out of the documents as we automate it, we are able to take that information, put it into a database, and compare it to what the income qualification and credit qualifications are for a particular product set because we have that whole -- in our AllRegs business, we have the entire reference data set of, depending on the product, the customers applying for, we know exactly what the qualification criteria are of that. 
So we're able to take a lot of the manual steering compare work of comparing information that came in on original customer application versus what's coming in as we're getting documents that we can verify and also cross-reference against what the criteria are to apply for that particular product. So we feel great about it. It's early, but we're seeing business really as customers are starting to adopt it, they're getting the benefit of it. 
We're seeing other customers are catching from word-of-mouth in the industry that this is providing real benefits from their peers, and we're seeing our funnel just continue to strengthen in this area. And again, for the most part, it's a cross-sell into our existing base."

One of the sort of historical roots of the commodity exchange business has been that commodity tend to be priced at their near the source. In other words, it was grain price at grain elevators that were located near the fields.",433,"Yes, it's a good question. One of the sort of historical roots of the commodity exchange business has been that commodity tend to be priced at their near the source. In other words, it was grain price at grain elevators that were located near the fields. And in the case of energy, it's oil, natural gas or electricity price somewhere locationally near where it's produced. And then from a hedging standpoint, as a hedger would buy a contract on an exchange they would then need to add to that hedge a transportation or movement hedge on top of the commodity hedge. 
And so we -- and as we got into organizing these commodities on futures exchanges that have clearing houses, the clearers price the risk, the credit risk of their customers. And so the commodity price that is determined on the exchange, if you will, doesn't have the customer credit risk in it, and it doesn't have the delivery risk in it. So in a sense, it's a pure commodity near where it's produced. And so one of the tensions that's going on in the market, particularly with the growth of Asia, China and more broadly, all of Asia is exchanges that we're forming up and pricing their product at the point of delivery. 
And so that's a different paradigm, if you will, for traditional commodities. And so one of the reasons that the state oil company of Abu Dhabi, began to work with us was a recognition of the fact that they had a strong desire to continue to control pricing of the commodity or have the -- actually the market control pricing of the commodity at its point of production, and that the risk of delivery not be transferred back to the producer by having a delivery price contract. 
And so that was really the motivation, along with the continued growth of the Middle East and modernization of the infrastructure in the Middle East. And so it's a really good location, if you will, because of the energy footprint there and also just the growing economies of the Middle East and the interplay between the Middle East and Asia just seem like a very good place for us to have a geographic reference. 
And it's not surprising. We've done a lot of work underneath this launch, as you can imagine. And really, because of our global footprint, we're able to talk to commercial users around the world. But it's not fully surprising to us that this is working because of that historical dynamic was actually playing in our favor than you."

First quarter revenues, operating inco",1038,"Thanks, Mary Caroline. Congratulations on your new role, truly well deserved. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some key highlights from our first quarter results. First quarter revenues, operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share were all the best in the history of our company.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.34 increased 7% compared to our previous record of $1.25, which we achieved in last year's first quarter. Record total first quarter revenues of $1.8 billion were up 4% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Total transaction revenues declined slightly versus an unprecedented backdrop a year ago. Importantly though, total recurring revenues, which represent about half our business, increased by 9% with all 3 of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth.
First quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $729 million, including $30 million related to Bakkt. Without the additional $7 million of Bakkt investments, we would have been toward the lower end of our original guidance. We expect that Bakkt's merger with Victory Park SPAC will be completed toward the end of this quarter. We expect second quarter adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $742 million to $752 million, including approximately $35 million of additional expense related to Bakkt.
Incorporating the additional Bakkt expenses into our full year guidance as well as slightly higher-than-expected FX, which will be more than offset by higher revenues, we now expect full year adjusted expenses to be in the range of $2.88  billion to $2.93 billion.
First quarter free cash flow totaled over $700 million. We used this strong cash generation to grow our dividend payout by 12% even as we reduced our leverage to 3.8x EBITDA by quarter's end. In addition, during April, we elected to sell our 1.4% stake in Coinbase, which generated over $1.2 billion in gross proceeds and approximately $900 million net of taxes.
Assuming those proceeds have been used to reduce debt at the end of the first quarter, our pro forma leverage would have been closer to 3.6x compared to 4.2x when we acquired Ellie Mae just over 6 months ago.
Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. First quarter revenues totaled $974 million, including transaction revenues of $653 million, the second best quarter in our company's history.
This strong performance was driven by our energy, interest rate and cash equities businesses. Importantly, open interest, which we believe is the best indicator of long-term growth is up 13% versus the end of 2020, including 5% growth in our energy open interest and 26% growth across our financial futures and options complex. Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services in NYSE listings, increased 5% year-over-year, driven by continued strong equity capital market trends and NYSE share of industry SIP revenues.
Looking to the second quarter, we expect recurring revenues in our Exchange segment to be between $315 million and $320 million.
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. First quarter revenues totaled $468 million, 6.5% growth in our recurring revenues, which account for nearly 90% of total segment revenues more than offset a year-over-year decline in transaction revenues.
Fixed Income data and analytics, which includes both our leading pricing and reference data and index businesses, increased by 7%. Other data and network services grew 6%, driven by continued customer demand for additional network capacity. Looking to the second quarter, we expect recurring revenues to improve sequentially and to be in a range of $401 million to $406 million.
This outlook is supported by ASV entering the second quarter at $1.6 billion, up over 5% year-over-year. Looking to the balance of 2021 and consistent with the guidance provided during our fourth quarter earnings call, we continue to expect recurring revenues in our Fixed Income and Data Services business to grow 5% to 6% for the full year.
Let's go next to Slide 7, where I'll discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. Mortgage Technology revenues grew 61% year-over-year in the first quarter. First quarter transaction revenues increased 84% year-over-year. Favorable financing conditions, accelerating millennial homeownership trends and demand for digital workflow tools, such as our origination technology, closing solutions and analytics, all contributed to our strong results.
Recurring revenues, once again, improved sequentially and increased 32% versus the prior year. Increased adoption in new customers of both our origination technology and analytics continued to expand our subscription base. We expect recurring revenues in the second quarter to again increase sequentially to a range between $128 million and $133 million, representing around 30% growth versus the prior year. As a note, in an effort to improve transparency and better align our reporting with our targeted addressable markets, we are now reporting closing solutions as a single business line.
These revenues will include both our eClosing initiatives and revenues from merge registrations. Our closing solutions today already represent over 20% of a $1 billion addressable market. In addition, we've moved our network revenues into our origination technology business line. This business, today, represents around 20% of the $4 billion underwriting and processing TAM that we highlighted during the Ellie Mae deal call.  
In summary, 2021 is off to a strong start. We once again grew revenues, operating income, free cash flow and adjusted earnings per share. At the same time, we continue to invest in our business to meet the needs of our customers. As a result, we've set the stage for continued top and bottom line growth and enhance shareholder returns in 2021 and beyond. Warren and the team will handle Q&A today. But before I hand it to Ben, I want to congratulate Warren on his new role and wish him great success. I also want to thank Jeff for the opportunity, he gave me 14 years ago, to help build this great business that he started. And finally, I want to thank all my ICE colleagues. It's been an honor and a privilege to work alongside you as a part of the ICE team. Ben, over to you."

Thank you, and good morning to everyone on the call. Please turn to Slide 8. As we begin to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic and the highly volatile environment we experienced in 2020, our customers continue to rely on our global energy markets to navigate uncertainty and manage risk. And importantly, it's our network expertise and investment in technology that enables us to deliver innovative customer solutions and capture the growth opportunities provided by secular trends, such as the growing complexity of energy markets alongside the energy transition.
In our oil markets, Brent Crude serves as the cornerstone of a global network that includes key benchmarks such as WTI, Gasoil, RBOB Gas and most recently, Murban crude oil. By leveraging our global network, the launch of ICE Futures Abu Dhabi, or IFAD, has enabled, for the first time, participants to come together and contribute to the price formation of Murban, an important benchmark for oil flowing through to Asia. In just its first month, Murban, along with related derivatives has traded over 150,000 contracts across 49 firms with growing open interest now over 45,000 lots making it one of the most successful Futures launches in our industry's history.
Natural gas continues to globalize, a trend we began investing in nearly a decade ago through our acquisition of Endex. Today, our European TTF and Asian JKM gas complexes continue to grow and reach important milestones, as they evolve into global gas benchmarks. In the first quarter, the number of participants in each market grew double digits year-over-year and TTF Futures reached record volumes.
In addition, open interest trends remained strong, up 18% and 14% year-over-year for TTF Futures and JKM, respectively. This strength along with growing exchange market share and new product development continues to underscore the significance of our contracts to the price formation of global natural gas. In our environmental markets, price appreciation in European emissions drove the ICE global carbon index to record levels in the first quarter.
Market-based mechanisms, such as our cap and trade offering, are critical to enabling the price transparency that is required to properly attribute a cost to pollution and ultimately help our customers reach their emissions goals in a cost-effective manner. We recognize the importance of carbon price transparency over 10 years ago, acquiring the Climate Exchange in 2010. And we have seen our environmental volumes and open interest grow nearly double digits on average every year since.
By combining the network and liquidity of our global energy complex with our leading environmental complex, we are well positioned to help our customers navigate this evolution across global energy markets.
Moving to our Fixed Income business. As fixed income markets electronify and passive investing grows, our comprehensive Fixed Income data platform continues to deliver compounding revenue growth.
Our quality end-of-day and real-time evaluated prices provide mission-critical price transparency for nearly 3 million securities per day. Additionally, our flexible delivery solutions enable customers to consume data in a variety of ways, which they are increasingly demanding as they seek more efficient workflow solutions. Our proprietary price evaluations, along with our broad suite of reference data, serve as the foundation for many innovative solutions, such as our rapidly growing index franchise, a business we built through both organic and inorganic investment, including our acquisitions of IDC and the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Index platform.  
In the first quarter, we not only saw multiple ETF sponsors switch their benchmark provider to ICE data indices, but we also saw growth in the use of our custom index solutions across the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific. This strength, once again, drove double-digit revenue growth in our Index business and is a testament to the value of our comprehensive index and broader Fixed Income data and analytics offering.
Similar to the playbook, we operate across our global energy and Fixed Income businesses, in Mortgages, we are leveraging technology, data and our network expertise to build innovative solutions that drive workflow efficiencies. With the touch point to nearly every market participant, we have connectivity to a customer base in need of the automation that our digital solutions provide. As customers increasingly seek these efficiencies across the very manual loan origination process, our leading origination technology, known as Encompass, provides valuable digital solutions that can reduce both the time and cost required to originate a loan.
Combined with our unique network of proprietary and third-party services, we are well positioned to lead the transformation of an industry that is moving analog to digital, an opportunity that we think has an addressable market of $4 billion in the origination and processing space alone. In the second quarter, we launched our Encompass eClose offering, a product we were able to rapidly bring to market by quickly integrating Simplifile's closing solutions into our leading origination platform.
Our new eClose offering is a leading-edge solution that will provide a true end-to-end electronic closing for U.S. mortgages by decreasing operational costs for lenders, creating additional efficiencies for settlement agents, streamlining the sale of loan to investors and, importantly, greatly improving the overall borrower experience. We are encouraged by the early demand and remain focused on building out our closing solutions within this $1 billion addressable market.
Another example of innovation that we are delivering to the mortgage industry is within our data and analytics business. We know from our experience across futures, equities and fixed income networks that data fuels automation. And the mortgage origination process is no different. Through our AIQ offering, customers can leverage our artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to drive significant efficiency gains. Analytics such as our credit analyzers and income analyzers, leverage automated document recognition and data extraction technology to reduce the manual staring compare work that exists across the mortgage workflow today.
And at less than $100 million in revenue, in our Mortgage Data and Analytics business, is well positioned to increasingly capture share of what we believe is a $4 billion addressable market. 
Importantly, the demand we are seeing for solutions like our eClose and our data and analytics gives us confidence that we can grow through business cycles. And as a result, grow a business that at $1.2 billion today in revenue is only a fraction of the $10 billion addressable market that is in the early days of an analog to digital conversion. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

Please turn now to Slide 9. In the first quarter, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share, delivering the best quarter in our company's history. And remarkably, we did this against last year's record-breaking volumes and volatility, which was largely driven by the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic.
Our results are a testament to the value of our data, technology and the strength of our strategic business model. The compounding growth of our subscription-based services, combined with our diverse transaction-based businesses means that our growth is not tied to one economic cycle, to one geography or to one asset class. Rather, it means growth on top of growth through all rate environments, across asset classes and around the world.
Over the past 20 years, ICE has continually evolved to meet the needs of our customers and provide value for our stockholders. And for the past 14 years, I've had the privilege of working alongside Scott Hill as our growth story has unfolded. ICE has completed dozens of deals and made thousands of strategic decisions that have been rooted in the information and the quality metrics that were ingrained in our culture by Scott.
Scott not only provided financial leadership for the company, but he's played a vital role in providing strategic vision. He championed our unique culture, and he's mentored younger generations of leaders. And so I want to thank Scott for his contribution, for his dedication and for his leadership. And I want to wish him our best as he moves on to tackle the difficult life of ranching in Texas. Scott will officially transition next month, and he'll remain an adviser and a mentor to ensure a smooth transition as Warren Gardiner assumes the duties of CFO.
Warren's has worked closely with Scott over the last 4 years and covered our sector as a senior research analyst for many years prior to this. Warren's knowledge of our business and our industry will help us to continue to build on the foundation that's been established by Scott, and continue a track record of growth. I also want to welcome MC as our new Investor Relations Head. Let me say thank you to our customers for their business and their trust in the quarter.

When you look at Q1 closed loan volume vers",493,"Thanks, Rich. This is Ben. And thanks for observing what we've seen in the marketplace in terms of a downturn in transaction volumes as I can confirm, we saw a downturn in closed loans on our Encompass platform. When you look at Q1 closed loan volume versus Q4. And as our results are testament to, we were able to grow through it. And what I'd point to is what we said when we originally announced the deal, back in September, in that we see, just like we saw in the commodities markets 2 decades ago, just like we've seen in the fixed income markets that the mortgage space is an industry that's going through a significant analog to digital transition.
And we knew by combining the closing network that we have with the unique customer originator and investor network that Ellie Mae has that we can do something really special here for our customers in providing a digital future and a lot of efficiencies. And that's how we got conviction that we can grow through long-term cycles. That's how we put out a guide, a 10-year guide of roughly doubling revenue when you look at that 8% to 10% guide over a 10-year period. That's roughly doubling revenue.
And what we've seen in the platform has done nothing but strengthen our conviction over the last 8 months in our ability to do that.
Last quarter, I mentioned that Q3 and Q4 sales expectations well exceeded our model, that we put together last summer when we did the deal. And Q1 continued this trend. And what we get -- tactically, what you get when you're increasing your penetration into new sales, you're getting new subscription revenue when you implement and then as you ramp the customers up, you're getting more loans that you're interacting with, as you were never interacting with before. Those loans then interact with services on our network. So you have a flywheel effect, you have a compounding effect.
But I think more importantly, this is what I was trying to get through in the script, is that when a customer is choosing our solution set, they're choosing to fundamentally change their business. They're fundamentally choosing to remove manual processing and adopt digital ways to automate. And when they select us, they're selecting us to be the heart and lungs there. To be their network that's interconnecting them to every player that we interact with from our front-to-back network.
And as they realize those benefits from being part of our ecosystem, it enables us to cross-sell our other services that I also mentioned in the script, such as our AIQ offering, which is that automation of the underwrite, as well as eClose.
So that's what gives us conviction on the ability to grow this business sequentially, quarter-over-quarter on subscription revenue growth and to grow through downturns or to outperform downturns in terms of volumes just as we did Q1 versus Q4."

And when you look at our Futures markets and how we've developed them versus any of our peers, we have stayed very close to the commercial customer base since our inception. And that's what's enabled us to develop literally hundreds of oil contracts around the world because it helps our customers, not only manage the risk in a benchmark contract, but also help them manage their risk at the point of consumption or the point of production of where they have real risk.
And we're the only truly global platform that enables customers with deep liquid markets and hundreds of marketplaces to be able to manage that risk. And with the backdrop of COVID going on the past year, we didn't stop moving. We continued to partner with our commercial customers around the world, and that's what led to the launch of ICE Futures Abu Dhabi, just in the last few weeks here.
And in the early days, it looks like one of the -- to be -- one of the most successful Futures launches in history. And what I'd point to with that is not only the volume growth, but also the -- importantly, the significant open interest growth and the fact that there's 49 major players that are in there utilizing the contracts, establishing positions to manage risk. And I look at that compared to other parts of our oil business, that across the board are doing very well. If you compare our overall oil open interest right now in April versus the fourth quarter, we're up in almost every major product category.
You compare April oil open interest versus April 2019, we're up in almost every category. If you look at under the covers from a year-over-year basis, while there's some tough compares, in there. We have significant product sets, such as our Asia refined product set, Gasoil and Dubai that are up year-over-year. So we believe we have a great foundation, we've already been in Asia, have a number of significant products out there that enable customers to hedge and manage risk, and we're going to stay very close to our commercial customer base to look for more opportunities to do so."

I wanted to go back to the Mortgage business for a second. So clearly, organic growth remains really strong. Ben, great to hear the sales momentum continues to be above projections in the first quarter. But the market clearly seems to be overly concerned about the refi cliff, so to speak, in the market, which would hit your transaction revenue. So can you help us maybe unpack how much of the $230 million related to transaction revenues is refi versus new purchases?
I think legacy LMA was about 50-50, but that mix probably has evolved here. And I guess, how would you frame the downside risk to this revenue bucket, assuming current industry refinance expectations come through?
And then secondly, I was hoping maybe we could head on the expense interplay here as well due to an extent that transaction revenues come down. Is there any expense offset we could see in that segment?"

I'll start, and then I'll hand it to Warren on the expense side. So when you look at the -- you had a number of different questions in there, so I'll try to unpack a couple of different things that we're seeing.
So first, the answer that I had for Rich's question is important to go back to. So we're not looking at this as a quarter-over-quarter business and really worry or afraid about volumes that are changing each quarter because we see that there's just a long-term change that's happening towards digitization, we see substantial TAMs that are out there that when you look at our presence in each of those TAMs have not only a long runway, but we have a lot of opportunity for growth in each of them.
The core being that Encompass and the network set that we have, where we have a little over 20% if you look at the trailing 12 months, roughly 20% of that TAM is a starting place that we have. And as we continue to sign new customers, as we continue to onboard those customers on. We're interacting with new loans, we're getting to more subscription revenue, we're getting more transaction volume and those loans are interacting with more services on our network. We believe we're very well positioned to go after that.
The other thing I can't emphasize enough is the other 2 TAMs are really a cross-sell opportunity. We are already touching at some point in our network from our customer acquisition and the point-of-sale systems that we have to the loan origination network that we have that's now interconnected to our closing network. We're touching just about every player in the mortgage ecosystem. So our ability to sell these new services is a cross-sell.
So we feel very, very good about our position to grow in the closing -- against the closing TAM, which we have roughly at 20% of that TAM today. But we're very uniquely positioned with the new eClose offering that we've launched to go after a significant amount more of that. And then on the AIQ, that's the automation of the actual underwrite process itself. We're seeing -- we continue to see record sales volumes of that product, which, again, is a cross-sell to core Encompass customers. When it comes to mix on our platform because if you look at just the loan origination side, there is a little bit of a tilt towards nonbank originators and nonbank originators tend to have a slight tilt towards purchase market versus refi.
A lot of people do their refis with banks that they -- large banks that they have their established banking relationships with. We tend to benefit more from a market that's moving more towards purchase. But that said, it's on the edges there. And when you look at our entire network, we're working with just about every player in the industry is utilizing one of our services around one point of our network."

What you would probably normally think about comp, marketing spend, things of that nature. But as Ben said, this isn't about second half or this isn't about a particular quarter. This is about a 10-year plan or strategy of doubling revenues from where we are today. And so we're going to continue to invest in that business.
We talked about $40 million to $45 million, I think, when we gave guidance to start the year. And I think that should still kind of increment our expense, I should say. And so that's just still be kind of what you expect, I think, as you're looking into the second, third, fourth quarter and expect that to kind of ramp as things like investments like eClose and things of that nature kind of continue to pick up some steam."

So -- and that's what I would point out to the first answer that I gave to Rich, pleased with the new sales results that we've seen as well as cross-sell results that we've seen on the platform. And the way to think about that recurring revenue, what gives us confidence in the fact that, that recurring revenue will grow sequentially quarter-over-quarter, and we're guiding to growth next quarter is that we continue to see -- and there's a mix in that recurring revenue line of customers that are expanding their footprint with us.
And expanding their footprint with us can mean that they're adding new loan officers, they have more volume on their platform. So they go ahead and expand their footprint with us. And when they do that, that falls to the subscription line item very quickly. Second thing that you see is that we have cross-sells of other products to our customer base so they expand and buy other services that we have.
It could be our AllRegs business, our Maven business, very importantly, our AIQ services. So we're seeing that as a very high cross-sell into our customer base. Some of those services require a short implementation timeframe. So after we sell it, there maybe some lag before the subscription revenue comes. But that's the other element. And then new customers, we're seeing new customer acquisition.
As I mentioned last quarter, a record Q3 and Q4 in terms of gathering new customers. And then Q1 well exceeded our expectations, both in our original model as well as our budget in terms of signing new customers onto the platform. And when we sign those new customers onto the platform, they do need to be implemented. It's a cloud-based platform, so the implementation isn't that long, but there is some lag between when we sell it, and then that drops to the subscription line.
And then once the customer is implemented, they start to ramp, and that's when we start to see the loan transaction volume and then those loans interacting with our network, then build and then we see more transaction volume building on that."

So this is an area when you look at just the raw numbers versus the TAM. We're obviously very early stages here. So we have 2% to 3% of the TAM, is what we have if you look at our current revenues versus a $4 billion opportunity here. And this we see as a near-term TAM that we are executing against. That's why we had it in the script. That's why we've highlighted in the last couple of calls that this AIQ offering is really seeing some good pickup across our customer base. We had record sales of it in the third and fourth quarter. And this is another area where we've well exceeded our expectations into Q1 of really cross-selling this service into our Encompass customer base.
And what this enables is it's really the core of where you're able to take out a ton of the manual processing. We've mentioned that our estimates are, that it cost $8,000 to manufacture a loan today. And out of that, about $5,200 of that is just manual processing. And by, first, applying our automated document recognition and extraction technology, but then also putting our mortgage expertise on top of that to say, okay, as we extract this data out of the documents, as we automate it, we are able to take that information, put it into a database and compare it to what the income qualification and credit qualifications are for a particular product set because we have that whole -- in our AllRegs business, we have the entire reference data set of, depending on the product, the customers applying for, we know exactly what the qualification criteria are of that.
So we're able to take a lot of the manual steering compare work of comparing information that came in on original customer application versus what's coming in as we're getting documents that we can verify and also cross-reference it against what the criteria are to apply for that particular product. So we feel great about it. It's early, but we're seeing this really as customers are starting to adopt it, they're getting the benefit of it.
We're seeing other customers are catching from word-of-mouth in the industry that this is providing real benefits from their peers, and we're seeing our funnel just continue to strengthen in this area. And again, for the most part, it's a cross-sell into our existing base."

One of the sort of historical roots of the commodity exchange business has been that commodity tend to be priced at their -- near the source. In other words, it was grain price at grain elevators that were located near the fields. And in the case of energy, it's oil, natural gas or electricity price somewhere locationally near where it's produced. And then from a hedging standpoint, as a hedger would buy a contract on an exchange they would then need to add to that hedge a transportation or movement hedge on top of the commodity hedge.
And so we -- and as we got into organizing these commodities on Futures exchanges that have clearing houses, the clearers price the risk, the credit risk of their customers. And so the commodity price that is determined on the exchange, if you will, doesn't have the customer credit risk in it, and it doesn't have the delivery risk in it. So in a sense, it's a pure commodity near where it's produced. And so one of the tensions that's going on in the market, particularly with the growth of Asia, China and more broadly, all of Asia is exchanges that we're forming up and pricing their product at the point of delivery.
And so that's a different paradigm, if you will, for traditional commodities. And so one of the reasons that the state oil company of Abu Dhabi, began to work with us was a recognition of the fact that they had a strong desire to continue to control pricing of the commodity or have the -- actually the market control pricing of the commodity at its point of production, and that the risk of delivery not be transferred back to the producer by having a delivery price contract.
And so that was really the motivation, along with the continued growth of the Middle East and modernization of the infrastructure in the Middle East. And so it's a really good location, if you will because of the energy footprint there and also just the growing economies of the Middle East and the interplay between the Middle East and Asia just seem like a very good place for us to have a geographic reference.
And it's not surprising. We've done a lot of work underneath this launch, as you can imagine. And really, because of our global footprint, we're able to talk to commercial users around the world. But it's not fully surprising to us that this is working because of that historical dynamic was actually playing in our favor."

I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our second quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.16, up 12% year-over-year. Net revenues totaled $1.7 billion,  and on a pro forma basis, we're up 4% versus last year. While total transaction revenues declined slightly, our recurring revenues, which now represent over half of our business, increased by 10%, with all 3 of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth. 
Adjusted operating expense totaled $744 million. Our investment in Bakkt contributed approximately $36 million to second quarter expenses and were offset by approximately $9 million of net revenues. We now anticipate that the Bakkt announced transaction with Victory Park will close in the third quarter. Looking to the second half, we expect third quarter adjusted operating expense to be in the range of $770 million to $780 million, including $55 million related to Bakkt, which we expect will be offset by $12 million of net revenue. 
Incorporating third quarter Bakkt expense into our full year guide we now expect 2021 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $2.95 billion to $2.98 billion. First half free cash flow totaled over $1.4 billion, which was used to fund a 10% increase in our dividend while also reducing our leverage, ending the quarter at just under 3.4x adjusted EBITDA. As noted last quarter, we elected to sell our stake in Coinbase in early April, generating over $1.2 billion in gross proceeds, which we then use to reduce commercial paper outstanding. 
With respect to our other minority investments, we are in the early stages of exploring a sale of our stake in Euroclear. While the timing of any potential sale remains unclear,  our strategy is consistent with our goal to reduce leverage following the acquisition of Ellie Mae and our strategic approach of continuously evaluating and optimizing the allocation of capital across our business. 
Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Second quarter net revenues totaled $909 million, including $582 million of transaction revenues. This strong performance was driven by a 6% increase in our interest rate business, an 11% increase in European natural gas revenues and a 59% increase in revenues related to global environmental products. Importantly, total open interest, which we believe is the best indicator of long-term growth is up 14% versus the end of last year, including 10% growth in energy open interest and 21% growth across our financial futures and options complex. 
Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and our NYSE listings business increased 7% year-over-year. The acceleration in growth was driven by 8% growth in our listings business as an increasing number of operating company IPOs, particularly in the technology and consumer sectors are joining the NYSE. Looking to the third quarter, we expect recurring revenues in our Exchange segment to be between $324 million and $329 million, representing approximately 5% growth year-over-year. As a sequential improvement in listings revenues is expected to be somewhat offset by lower data fees at the NYSE. 
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Second quarter revenues totaled $458 million, 6% growth in our recurring revenues, which accounted for nearly 90% of total segment revenues offset a year-over-year decline in transaction fees.  Fixed income data and analytics, which includes our leading pricing and reference data and ICE data indices increased by 5%, including another quarter of double-digit growth in our index franchise. Other data and network services grew 7%, driven by continued customer demand for additional network capacity. Looking to the third quarter, we expect our recurring revenues to improve sequentially to a range of $409 million to $414 million. And in addition, we now expect full year recurring revenue growth to be towards the higher end of the 5% to 6% guidance range we provided on our fourth quarter call. 
Let's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. Mortgage Technology revenues grew 17% year-over-year. Second quarter transaction revenues increased by 8%, while recurring revenues were up 36% and at $136 million exceeded the high end of our guidance range. These better-than-expected results were driven by a combination of new customer growth and increased adoption of digital workflow tools across origination technology, closing solutions and data and analytics. 
Shifting to the third quarter, we expect the recurring revenues will once again grow sequentially and be in the range of $137 million to $142 million, representing around 30% growth versus last year. The first half of 2021 was the strongest in our company's history. We once again grew revenues, operating income and free cash flow. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.50 were up 9% versus the prior record set in the first half of 2020 and have increased 17% on average versus the first half of 2019. In addition, less than 1 year following our strategic acquisition of Ellie Mae, we have reduced debt by nearly $3 billion while also continuing to strategically invest in future growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ben to discuss some of the highlights of our Exchange and Mortgage businesses."

Please turn to Slide 8. In the second quarter, interest rate volatility, global economic reopening and the continued evolution of energy markets once again drove customers to our deep liquid markets to manage their risk. This resulted in open interest records across the platform and through July, open interest continues to build, increasing 9% versus last year and reaching a new record for our total futures complex this week. Greenhouse gas emissions and the evolution of energy markets are becoming increasingly important to market participants around the world as evidenced by the 40% growth in the number of customers in our global environmental markets since 2016. 
Volumes in those markets also continued to grow, up 27% in the second quarter and up 22% per year on average over the past 5 years. Price transparency across the energy spectrum is critical as companies look to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner. And by combining the network and liquidity across our global oil, natural gas, power and environmental markets, we are well positioned to help our customers navigate this evolution. 
In our natural gas markets, the globalization of gas and the rise of LNG are secular trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. And today, as market participants see cleaner sources of energy, volumes and revenue in our European TTF and Asian JKM complexes have grown 46% and 37% per year on average over the past 5 years, respectively. And in our global oil markets, the breadth and depth of our offering, which includes Brent, WTI, gas oil and over 700 spread products makes us the natural home for innovative new energy products. 
In March, we launched Murban crude oil futures, which has been one of the most successful futures launches in our industry's history. And in the second quarter, we announced that we are working 2 of the industry's largest participants, Magellan and Enterprise, to launch the Midland WTI American Gulf Coast contract. This new contract will enable customers to price and hedge Midland WTI quality crude delivered into Houston without being burdened by the storage and logistics constraints of WTI at Cushing. 
Turning now to our Mortgage business on Slide 9. Customers are increasingly seeking efficiencies across a very manual loan origination process. Our end-to-end digital solutions can not only reduce the time and cost required to originate, but can also provide a fully electronic closing and improve the quality of loans moving into the secondary market. And with a touch point to nearly every market participant, we have connectivity to a customer base in need of the efficiencies that our digital solutions provide. The continued growth in our recurring revenues is a testament to the demand we're seeing for these digital solutions. As these new customers come on to our network, we benefit from new subscription revenues, and have the opportunity to expand the customer relationship over time as they adopt additional solutions. 
Just as we've seen in our other markets, this flywheel effect is what we believe will drive compounding growth in our recurring revenues and gives us confidence that we can grow a business that at $1.2 billion in revenue today is only a fraction of the $10 billion addressable market that is in the early days of an analog to digital conversion. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Lynn to discuss our fixed income and data services business."

Please turn to Slide 10. Data is a core competency at ICE, whether it's a byproduct of our exchanges, evaluated prices or fixed income securities, indices and front office tools or data and analytics use across the mortgage workflow. Data connects the different businesses across the ICE platform and connects ICE to participants across asset classes and around the world. Our comprehensive fixed income data platform continues to deliver compounding revenue growth as these markets automate and its passive investing groups. 
Our quality of value-added prices provide mission-critical transparency for nearly 3 million securities per day. Combined with our comprehensive reference data offering, these form the building blocks to index construction and product development. The accelerating growth of passive investing and the efforts we've made to increase the breadth of our offering and flexibility of our approach to index construction has contributed to the double-digit annual growth in our index business since we acquired the Bank of America Merrill Lynch franchise in 2017. 
A key driver of that growth has been an increase in the passive ETF AUM benchmark to our indices, growing to over $300 billion from less than $100 billion in 2017. Part of that growth is being driven by established ETFs transitioning their benchmark to ICE, including $60 billion of AUM that has announced the transition during 2021 to date. ICE Data indices now represents just under 20% of the growing fixed income ETF universe, including over 50% of the muni ETF universe. 
Additionally, over the last year, ICE has launched over 250 new indices across fixed income, equities and commodities, including a growing number of ESG and thematic indices as well as custom indices. Our new index customization platform gives investors direct access to the tools they need to build and quickly back test their own index rules. And through the first half of 2021, customers have created nearly as many custom indices as were created in all of 2020. 
Our index business is an important part of our broader front office toolkit, which also includes solutions like continuous evaluated pricing, best execution, liquidity indicators and real-time curves. These front office tools have grown double digits for the past 3 years and continue to be an important part of our overall fixed income strategy. So as flows continue to move into fixed income ETF, ESG and thematic investing continues to grow and fixed income markets electronify, we will remain close to our customers and continue to deliver innovative solutions to meet their evolving needs. 
I'll now turn it over to Jeff."

Please turn to Slide 11. At the heart of our strategy at ICE is our data, technology and network expertise, which connect the different businesses across ICE, enabling us to deliver innovative solutions for our customers. In our Index business, as Lynn mentioned, we've seen a fair number of exchange-traded funds transition their benchmarks to ICE. In addition to the quality of our underlying pricing and reference data, another driver of these moves is the expansion of the reference data constituents that we offer. 
Assets under management, transitioning to our indices not only benefits our fixed income and data services business, but we've seen the cross-selling benefit to our listings business with several biotech companies selecting the New York Stock Exchange as their listing venue. Additionally, by combining our expertise in index construction with our leading global environmental trading markets, we've created the ICE Global Carbon Index, a benchmark for the universal price of carbon, which is critical to employing market forces to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner. The ICE Global Carbon Index is part of a suite of environmental, social and governance-related services that ICE offers to our customers, which also include green bond indices, climate analytics and our ESG reference data. 
Earlier this week, we announced the integration of ICE Mortgage Technologies transaction-based mortgage rates into our mortgage prepayment model at ICE data. As a leading provider of price evaluations for mortgage-backed securities, this is an important new offering, and it represents the first time that we've coupled the valuable underlying content from ICE Mortgage Technology with our expertise in identifying and creating new data offerings. This enhancement will enable the market to more accurately price mortgage prepayments, which are a critical component for fixed income investors. These are only a few of the many innovative solutions that we're able to bring to our customers as a result of the synergistic relationships that exist across our platform, which makes the whole of ICE greater than the sum of its parts. 
Looking at the first half of this year amidst the backdrop of rising interest rates and rising commodity prices, yet lower equity market volatility and mortgage refinance volumes. We once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share. These results are a testament to the strategy that we've operated for the past 20 years, the business model that we've intentionally built and the value of our strategic capital allocation. We've deliberately positioned the company to have a mix of transaction and compounding subscription revenues to give investors upside exposure while hedging our downside risk. We target markets where there's an analog-to-digital conversion taking place. We diversify our global footprint because at all times, somewhere in the world, there are risks that our customers and our potential customers need to manage. We strategically deploy our capital both into and out of opportunities to maximize shareholder value. The combination of these factors is what makes ICE an all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth. 
Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to say thank you to our customers for their business and for their trust in this quarter. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to both the best second quarter and the best first half in our company's history. With that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Shaun, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time."

So we're -- as we've talked about in the prior calls, what we're doing here is we're building a business that's going to be resilient to cyclical volume trends. And at the same time, capitalizing on the secular trend of the overall analog-to-digital conversion and a long-term guide of an 8% to 10% average annual growth in the business. So what you see in our results, as you saw, if you look at our top line revenue number and you compare that to where you try to draw a consensus to where the estimates are between Fannie, Freddie [ MDA ], we beat those numbers and we beat those results of what happened sequentially quarter-over-quarter. 
And we also, as we pointed out in the script, significantly beat our subscription revenue guide. So the couple of things that are going on under the covers there is that, one, we're having incredible sales success and when we sell new customers, that leads to new subscription revenue as we implement them. And then number two, we're looking at taking this unprecedented time of volumes that the industry has seen last year and this year to purposely engage with our customers on opportunities to increase the amount of subscription revenue that we have and some of the services that we provide along our comprehensive network.  Such as our loan origination system and our data and analytics platform called AIQ. 
So we are purposely tilting relationships with new customers as well as when customers are renewing looking at shifting more of the mix towards subscription. In terms of the volume trends that we're seeing,  we're seeing a purchase market that's strong, but it's tough on inventory as is very well publicized. And we're seeing a refinance market where interest rates popped up in March, and they've come right back down. So we're still seeing a refinance market that's decent. And what's really offsetting any headwinds that refinance has seen has been a significant amount of cash out refi that is happening in the market just given the amount of home price appreciation and people taking money off the table to do home improvements or pay off other debt. 
So that's what's really happening under the covers."

And that r",546,"Thanks, Alex. This is Ben. I'll take this one. Says, as you can appreciate, and we've talked about in prior calls, we've been thinking about the environmental impacts and how to create a market-based mechanism to price carbon for over a decade. And that really came to life when we bought the Climate Exchange over a decade ago. Fast forward to today, for futures and options that are out creating a market-based mechanism to price carbon we're 95% of the futures and options marketplace that's doing that. So we have a tremendous presence around the world. It continues to be a very high-growth business for us. And as I see it will continue to be. And some of the drivers for that -- I'll just touch upon some parts of the portfolio. 
So if you look at our EU business, where the vast majority of trading that's happening there, we continue to see new participants coming in, both financial players and commercial players. Because new sectors are being captured in government mandates around who needs to pay attention to a carbon price signal. And there's the potential that areas like marine, roads and buildings, all get captured going forward into this. So that's a potential tailwind for more people needing to pay attention to our markets. 
You also have in the EU, the concept of free allowance thresholds, where if you're under a certain threshold, don't need to necessarily pay attention to carbon price signals. There's momentum behind lowering those free allowance thresholds, which thus could capture some of the major heavy industrial sectors that are currently not captured there. So that, again, leads to more commercials coming into the marketplace. In the U.S., again, we're a significant -- very significant lead in our business there. And there, the big trend is new states coming into the regional greenhouse gas initiative. So there's potential for more and more states coming into that. There's momentum behind that in some of these states, and that leads to more trading in our markets. 
You have just recently, I mentioned on the last call that we launched our new U.K. emissions trading scheme. So as a result of Brexit, one of the benefits we got is that the U.K. decided to set up their own emissions trading scheme. They selected us to do that. We launched it. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's been a very, very successful launch. And then you have new geographies around the world. So you have a trend with -- in Asia Pacific where there's the potential for more and more adoption of these. And given the significant lead we have in creating these markets on behalf of governments and market participants to create that market base pricing mechanism -- the market-based pricing mechanism we're heavily engaged in all of those conversations. 
And given that we are the most transparent way to price -- put a market-based mechanism to price carbon, we've also developed alongside our or ICE fixed income and data services business, a global carbon index, which is being able -- using the prices coming out of our marketplaces to create a very transparent way to look at both global as well as regional price trends within the carbon markets."

I think in our industry, there's a lot of mergers and acquisitions that happened, but very few of our peers really think about dispositions and we do. As you know, we've, at 1 time own the French, Dutch, Belgium, Portuguese Stock Exchange. We've owned various analytics businesses. Obviously, we own some minority stakes in businesses. And so we're constantly thinking about our return on invested capital and how to best deploy it.

Obviously, the ETFs that I meant in my prepared remarks that have selected us as their destination for transition business, selected us from a benchmarking perspective. 
But in fixed income, increasingly, firms are also looking at our high-quality underlying data, the fact that we're able to publish that data in a real-time basis, which allows them to manage the real-time risks of the fixed income ETF market.

This is Ben. I'll take this one. So when you think about our portfolio, and it was threaded through your question there, I think you appreciate the fact that we've built the most diversified platform that there is on the planet to help customers really go through this energy transition. We provide products, everything from coal to oil to natural gas to LNG and to the environmental markets. And in all those sectors, we are the lead provider of services helping customers within each of those segments, but then also as they're transitioning towards a cleaner environment, cleaner fuels, helping them along that journey, manage their exposure to price risk. 
We're seeing underneath each one of those segments, we're still seeing a lot of demand for new products. So you take, for example, just what's happened in oil. We've had a ton of innovation that's happened in oil to help the Middle East and Asia Pacific commercial customers, where we were selected to launch the Murban crude oil contract to enable users to be able to have a better price mechanism for pricing Middle Eastern oil going to Asia. You have the recent development that we announced with the Midland WTI American Gulf Coast crude contract is being launched with 2 huge commercial partners in Magellan and Enterprise, that will be launched early next year to provide a much better way to price WTI Midland crude that's at Houston and not constrained by the infrastructure constraints that are in and around Cushing. 
You also see -- you may have seen that a recent consultation came out in the industry by us and as well as our partners in S&P Platts to look at further evolution of the Brent contract in adding new sources of crude such as Johan Sverdrup and very importantly, the potential for WTI Midland basis Houston to be added into the Brent complex, further solidifying that as the global index for oil. I went through in the prior question, all the things that we're doing in the environmental complex to grow that, and we have a significant lead in our global natural gas and LNG franchise, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that continues to grow year-over-year. 
So we feel we're very, very well positioned to help customers along this journey, and we'll continue to partner very closely with them to do so."

So our strategy is definitely to move more and more in that direction. We already have moved for significant parts of the business to that. And it's an area that we're going to continue to invest. Quite frankly, it's one of the things that is leading to a lot of the success that we've had in sales that I've mentioned in the second half of last year and in the first half of this year, exceeding our models is that if you look across our entire mortgage ecosystem, we're providing a service somewhere along our network and our cloud-based network. We're providing at least a service to almost every single mortgage participant that's out there.

This is Ben again. So as I mentioned in the first question that was asked, we have -- since acquiring the business have had a very concentrated effort on how do we focus on that recurring revenue stream, how do we look at that subscription base and really start to where we can in certain parts of the business shift revenue more towards subscription, especially as you're in this high-volume environment that we've been in, it's a great time to do that to shift it towards -- more towards subscription and for some parts of the business, less towards transaction. 
That's more oriented towards the loan origination side and that AIQ business. So in those 2 parts of the business, those are areas where we have had a concentrated effort of moving customers in that direction. And to give you an example, that AIQ business on the data and analytics side, it historically was 100% transaction-oriented. And we have moved it very significantly towards subscription revenue both for every new customer that comes on the platform as well as renewals that are coming on. 
We are seeing to the answer of market share, we're seeing record sales continue. As I mentioned it multiple times that the second half of last year was a record and Q1 and Q2 has exceeded our expectations. All that is continuing to gain market share for us and for the business as we implement customers, that feeds into new subscription revenue, that feeds into the part of the beat that we had this past quarter as well as shifting more of the mix towards subscription. 
The other side of it is there are certain parts of the business that are transaction-oriented, and we are continuing to innovate new solutions and new opportunities to capture new transactional revenue that's not happened before even for us or for the industry. An example of that, as I mentioned last quarter, we'd be launching our hybrid eClose, we've gone ahead and launched that. So that's a complete digital closing room that interconnects the consumer to the lender to the settlement agent so that all documents, all collaboration, all communication and the entire closing process can be done digitally. 
We just launched this, and we already have 55 customers out of our 2,000 in the implementation process. As those get implemented, that will be new transaction revenue that will be coming through to us. So that's another example. And then another example that Jeff had mentioned in his prepared remarks is the interconnectivity between -- that we see between data on the Mortgage side of the business flowing through to our fixed income and data services business, where we're taking transactional data out of the Mortgage side of our business to help enhance and improve our mortgage-backed securities, prepayment and valuation models where we are a leader in providing that and further enhancing those models with real transactional data that hasn't happened before."

One, on the cost side, I appreciate that obviously, you're building a business for the long term and the energy shifting to more recurring, as you just mentioned. But clearly, you see the transactional side turn a little bit. So just wondering to what degree there are actually potential offsets that you're thinking about as maybe those transactional revenues come down. Is there something to do on the expense side? Or is that going to continue to grow as you invest? 
And then for Jeff, since you just -- we talked about this interconnectivity between the different businesses,  on the Mortgage side, Joe, at your Mortgage industry conference a few months ago, made this off the cough remarks that you're going to be working together closely and maybe there's room for mortgage trading down the line with your exchange business. So just wondering to what degree this is just the long-term dream or if there's actually something behind the scenes that you're already working on and what the opportunity set could be there?"

So there is a degree of variable expenses within that business. But I think the way you want to be thinking about this is, look, this isn't about a second half refi environment. This is about a 10-year growth opportunity for us. And so that where we think we can double revenues over the next 10 years or so. So we're going to invest through however that cycle plays out, if it does play out, we're going to be investing through it. That was part of the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year where we said about $45 to -- $40 million to $45 million of incremental investment. I think you'll see that start to sort of slow step up as we move through the year. And that's going as planned. That's all part of the planned investments that we've made, and we've communicated to you guys. 
But I think 1 point to just to make there on that as well is that 1 of the benefits here that Ellie Mae and ICE Mortgage Technology has as being part of the larger ICE platform is just the diversity that ICE brings to them. And so as Jeff said in his prepared remarks, it's in all weather stock. And so as maybe a mortgage cycle plays out, you've got other things in other areas of the business doing well. And so it really gives us the ability to invest through those cycles  and maybe where a stand-alone competitor or peer wouldn't be able to do that. 
So I think in that -- and ultimately, that puts us in a better place at the other end of things. So Again, it's about a 10-year opportunity against a 10-year -- a $10 billion TAM, where we're only about 10% of that today. So you should expect us to continue to invest in that business as we kind of move through the next couple of quarters."

So Joe, who you mentioned has joined our management committee, which also contains all the people that you've heard from on this call, and we run the business collaboratively so that we can work on this interconnectivity. What you've heard Ben talk about on this call is really hooking up what we would consider the cash market in a traditional market. It's the origination market of actually producing a mortgage for a consumer. And for the first time now, we've announced that we're hooking that to the secondary market through Lynn's business of taking that data to help with mortgage-backed securities. 
Our sense is that  the Mortgage market, while it is regulated, is likely to continue to get more government attention as it becomes more transparent. It's largely for many people in government, a mechanism for wealth creation in the sense of people building equity in a home. It's also interest rate sensitive as a number of the questions have alluded to here, and there are maybe opportunities for government to influence or touch interest rates for certain segments of our society. And as the data and the transparency of warehouses are being bought and refinanced and where wealth is being created as that becomes more transparent we really believe that the business is going to continue to evolve around government policy and that is going to make its way trickle its way into the secondary trading market. And we will be uniquely positioned with data and information about the changes that are going on in the cash market to help influence that secondary market. 
And doesn't mean we'll host 1 of those or use other assets potentially. That's part of why we wanted to get into this ecosystem. And it's part of our goal to build an all-weather company that will perform in every environment"

I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our second quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.16, up 12% year-over-year. Net revenues totaled $1.7 billion,  and on a pro forma basis, we're up 4% versus last year. While total transaction revenues declined slightly, our recurring revenues, which now represent over half of our business, increased by 10%, with all 3 of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth.  
Adjusted operating expense totaled $744 million. Our investment in Bakkt contributed approximately $36 million to second quarter expenses and were offset by approximately $9 million of net revenues. We now anticipate that the Bakkt announced transaction with Victory Park will close in the third quarter. 
Looking to the second half, we expect third quarter adjusted operating expense to be in the range of $770 million to $780 million, including $55 million related to back which we expect will be offset by $12 million of net revenue. Incorporating third quarter Bakkt expense into our full year guide we now expect 2021 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $2.95 billion to $2.98 billion. 
First half free cash flow totaled over $1.4 billion, which was used to fund a 10% increase in our dividend while also reducing our leverage, ending the quarter at just under 3.4x adjusted EBITDA. As noted last quarter, we elected to sell our stake in Coinbase in early April, generating over $1.2 billion in gross proceeds, which we then use to reduce commercial paper outstanding.  
With respect to our other minority investments, we are in the early stages of exploring a sale of our stake in Euroclear. While the timing of any potential sale remains unclear, -- our strategy is consistent with our goal to reduce leverage following the acquisition of Ellie Mae and our strategic approach of continuously evaluating and optimizing the allocation of capital across our business.  
Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Second quarter net revenues totaled $909 million, including $582 million of transaction revenues. This strong performance was driven by a 6% increase in our interest rate business, an 11% increase in European natural gas revenues and a 59% increase in revenues related to global environmental products. Importantly, total open interest, which we believe is the best indicator of long-term growth is up 14% versus the end of last year, including 10% growth in energy open interest and 21% growth across our financial futures and options complex.  
Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and our NYSE listings business increased 7% year-over-year. The acceleration in growth was driven by 8% growth in our listings business. It is an increasing number of operating company IPOs, particularly in the technology and consumer sectors are joining the NYSE. Looking to the third quarter, we expect recurring revenues in our Exchange segment to be between $324 million and $329 million, representing approximately 5% growth year-over-year. As a sequential improvement in listings revenues is expected to be somewhat offset by lower data fees at the NYSE.  
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Second quarter revenues totaled $458 million, 6% growth in our recurring revenues, which accounted for nearly 90% of total segment revenues offset a year-over-year decline in transaction fees.  Fixed income data and analytics, which includes our leading pricing and reference data and ICE Data indices increased by 5%, including another quarter of double-digit growth in our index franchise. Other data and network services grew 7%, driven by continued customer demand for additional network capacity. Looking to the third quarter, we expect our recurring revenues to improve sequentially to a range of $409 million to $414 million. And in addition, we now expect full year recurring revenue growth to be towards the higher end of the 5% to 6% guidance range we provided on our fourth quarter call.  
Let's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. Mortgage Technology revenues grew 17% year-over-year. Second quarter transaction revenues increased by 8%, while recurring revenues were up 36% and at a $136 million exceeded the high end of our guidance range. These better-than-expected results were driven by a combination of new customer growth and increased adoption of digital workflow tools across origination technology, closing solutions and data and analytics. Shifting to the third quarter, we expect the recurring revenues will once again grow sequentially and be in the range of $137 million to $142 million, representing around 30% growth versus last year. 
The first half of 2021 was the strongest in our company's history. We once again grew revenues, operating income and free cash flow. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.50 were up 9% versus the prior record set in the first half of 2020 and have increased 17% on average versus the first half of 2019. In addition, less than 1 year following our strategic acquisition of Ellie Mae, we have reduced debt by nearly $3 billion while also continuing to strategically invest in future growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ben to discuss some of the highlights of our Exchange and Mortgage businesses."

Please turn to Slide 8. In the second quarter, interest rate volatility, global economic reopening and the continued evolution of energy markets once again drove customers to our deep liquid markets to manage their risk. This resulted in open interest records across the platform and through July, open interest continues to build, increasing 9% versus last year and reaching a new record for our total futures complex this week. Greenhouse gas emissions and the evolution of energy markets are becoming increasingly important to market participants around the world as evidenced by the 40% growth in the number of customers in our global environmental markets since 2016.  
Volumes in those markets also continued to grow, up 27% in the second quarter and up 22% and per year on average over the past 5 years. Price transparency across the energy spectrum is critical as companies look to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner. And by combining the network and liquidity across our global oil, natural gas, power and environmental markets, we are well positioned to help our customers navigate this evolution. 
In our natural gas markets, the globalization of gas and the rise of LNG are secular trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. And today, as market participants see cleaner sources of energy, volumes and revenue in our European TTF and Asian JKM complexes have grown 46% and 37% per year on average over the past 5 years, respectively. And in our global oil markets, the breadth and depth of our offering, which includes Brent, WTI, gas oil and over 700 spread products makes us the natural home for innovative new energy products.  
In March, we launched Murban crude oil futures, which has been one of the most successful futures launches in our industry's history. And in the second quarter, we announced that we are working 2 of the industry's largest participants, Magellan and Enterprise, to launch the Midland WTI American Gulf Coast contract. This new contract will enable customers to price and hedge Midland WTI quality crude delivered into Houston without being burdened by the storage and logistics constraints of WTI at Cushing.  
Turning now to our Mortgage business on Slide 9. Customers are increasingly seeking efficiencies across a very manual loan origination process. Our end-to-end digital solutions can not only reduce the time and cost required to originate, but can also provide a fully electronic closing and improve the quality of loans moving into the secondary market. And with a touch point to nearly every market participant, we have connectivity to a customer base in need of the efficiencies that our digital solutions provide. The continued growth in our recurring revenues is a testament to the demand we're seeing for these digital solutions. As these new customers come on to our network, we benefit from new subscription revenues, and have the opportunity to expand the customer relationship over time as they adopt additional solutions.  
Just as we've seen in our other markets, this flywheel effect is what we believe will drive compounding growth in our recurring revenues and gives us confidence that we can grow a business that at $1.2 billion in revenue today is only a fraction of the $10 billion addressable market that is in the early days of an analog to digital conversion. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Lynn to discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services business."

Please turn to Slide 10. Data is a core competency at ICE, whether it's a byproduct of our Exchanges, evaluated prices or fixed income securities, indices and front office tools or data and analytics use across the mortgage workflow. Data connects the different businesses across the ICE platform and connects ICE to participants across asset classes and around the world. Our comprehensive fixed income data platform continues to deliver compounding revenue growth as these markets automate and its passive investing groups.  
Our quality of value-added prices provide mission-critical transparency for nearly 3 million securities per day. Combined with our comprehensive reference data offering, these form the building blocks to index construction and product development. The accelerating growth of passive investing and the efforts we've made to increase the breadth of our offering and flexibility of our approach to index construction has contributed to the double-digit annual growth in our index business since we acquired the Bank of America Merrill Lynch franchise in 2017. 
A key driver of that growth has been an increase in the passive ETF AUM benchmark to our indices, growing to over $300 billion from less than $100 billion in 2017. Part of that growth is being driven by established ETFs transitioning their benchmark to ICE, including $60 billion of AUM that has announced the transition during 2021 to date. ICE Data indices now represents just under 20% of the growing fixed income ETF universe, including over 50% of the muni ETF universe.  
Additionally, over the last year, ICE has launched over 250 new indices across fixed income, equities and commodities, including a growing number of ESG and thematic indices as well as custom indices. Our new index customization platform gives investors direct access to the tools they need to build and quickly back test their own index rules. And through the first half of 2021, customers have created nearly as many custom indices as were created in all of 2020. Our index business is an important part of our broader front office toolkit, which also includes solutions like continuous evaluated pricing, best execution, liquidity indicators and real-time curves. These front office tools have grown double digits for the past 3 years and continue to be an important part of our overall fixed income strategy. So as flows continue to move into fixed income ETF, ESG and thematic investing continues to grow and fixed income markets electronify, we will remain close to our customers and continue to deliver innovative solutions to meet their evolving needs.  
I'll now turn it over to Jeff."

Please turn to Slide 11. At the heart of our strategy at ICE is our data, technology and network expertise, which connect the different businesses across ICE, enabling us to deliver innovative solutions for our customers. In our Index business, as Lynn mentioned, we've seen a fair number of exchange-traded funds transition their benchmarks to ICE. In addition to the quality of our underlying pricing and reference data, another driver of these moves is the expansion of the reference data constituents that we offer.  
Assets under management, transitioning to our indices not only benefits our Fixed Income and Data Services business, but we've seen the cross-selling benefit to our Listings business with several biotech companies selecting the New York Stock Exchange as their listing venue. Additionally, by combining our expertise in index construction with our leading global environmental trading markets, we've created the ICE Global Carbon Index, a benchmark for the universal price of carbon, which is critical to employing market forces to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner. The ICE Global Carbon Index is part of a suite of environmental, social and governance-related services that ICE offers to our customers, which also include green bond indices, climate analytics and our ESG reference data.  
Earlier this week, we announced the integration of ICE Mortgage Technologies transaction-based mortgage rates into our mortgage prepayment model at ICE Data. As a leading provider of price evaluations for mortgage-backed securities, this is an important new offering, and it represents the first time that we've coupled the valuable underlying content from ICE Mortgage Technology with our expertise in identifying and creating new data offerings. This enhancement will enable the market to more accurately price mortgage prepayments, which are a critical component for fixed income investors. These are only a few of the many innovative solutions that we're able to bring to our customers as a result of the synergistic relationships that exist across our platform, which makes the whole of ICE greater than the sum of its parts.  
Looking at the first half of this year amidst the backdrop of rising interest rates and rising commodity prices, yet lower equity market volatility and mortgage refinance volumes. We once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share. These results are a testament to the strategy that we've operated for the past 20 years, the business model that we've intentionally built and the value of our strategic capital allocation. We've deliberately positioned the company to have a mix of transaction and compounding subscription revenues to give investors upside exposure while hedging our downside risk. 
We target markets where there's an analog-to-digital conversion taking place. We diversify our global footprint because at all times, somewhere in the world, there are risks that our customers and our potential customers need to manage. We strategically deploy our capital both into and out of opportunities to maximize shareholder value. The combination of these factors is what makes ICE an all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth.  
Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to say thank you to our customers for their business and for their trust in this quarter. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to both the best second quarter and the best first half in our company's history. With that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Shaun, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time."

And just trying to see if we can get some more clarification on how -- when the interest rate environment changes, how it's going to impact the Mortgage business, especially in the back half of the year.

So we're -- as we've talked about in the prior calls, what we're doing here is we're building a business that's going to be resilient to cyclical volume trends. And at the same time, capitalizing on the secular trend of the overall analog-to-digital conversion and a long-term guide of an 8% to 10% average annual growth in the business. So what you see in our results, is you saw, if you look at our top line revenue number and you compare that to where you just try to draw a consensus to where the estimates are between Fannie, Freddie, MDA, we beat those numbers and we beat those results of what happened sequentially quarter-over-quarter.  
And we also, as we pointed out in the script, significantly beat our subscription revenue guide. So the couple of things that are going on under the covers there is that, one, we're having incredible sales success and when we sell new customers, that leads to new subscription revenue as we implement them. And then number two, we're looking at taking this unprecedented time of volumes that the industry has seen last year and this year to purposely engage with our customers on opportunities to increase the amount of subscription revenue that we have and some of the services that we provide along our comprehensive network.  Such as our loan origination system and our data and analytics platform called AIQ.  
So we are purposely tilting relationships with new customers as well as when customers are renewing looking at shifting more of the mix towards subscription. In terms of the volume trends that we're seeing,  we're seeing a purchase market that's strong, but it's tough on inventory as is very well publicized. And we're seeing a refinance market where interest rates popped up in March, and they've come right back down. So we're still seeing a refinance market that's decent. And what's really offsetting any headwinds that refinance has seen has been a significant amount of cash out refi that is happening in the market just given the amount of home price appreciation and people taking money off the table to do home improvements or pay off other debt.  
So that's what's really happening under the covers."

We -- Last year, we launched a piece of technology, which united our execution protocol, but more importantly, united our data elements alongside those execution protocols. And as a result, you're starting to see more and more activity through our portfolio trading, which leverages our front office data assets.

In ICE you are seeing significant growth in the environmental products, as you mentioned in one of the slides, I guess, the emissions futures in particular.  It's a pretty high capture rate product, so I was hoping to dig in a little bit more here. So I guess, one, spend a few minutes on how this market is evolving and how do you expect the growth to sort of progress here? 
And specifically, I'm looking to get a sense of what the revenue contribution there is today to ICE? What sort of changes you're seeing at the customer composition level here. So kind of end customers versus financial players perhaps coming in. How is that evolving geographically? So right now, it's largely EU, but perhaps U.K., U.S., Asia on the come, and then ultimately, competition. Again, high capture rate product? How sustainable do you think it ultimately will be?"

So, as you can appreciate, and we've talked about in prior calls, we've been thinking about the environmental impacts and how to create a market-based mechanism to price carbon for over a decade. And that really came to life when we bought the Climate Exchange over a decade ago. Fast forward to today, for Futures & Options that are out creating a market-based mechanism to price carbon, we're 95% of the Futures & Options marketplace that's doing that. So we have a tremendous presence around the world. It continues to be a very high-growth business for us. And as I see it will continue to be. And some of the drivers for that -- I'll just touch upon some parts of the portfolio.  
So if you look at our EU business, where the vast majority of trading that's happening there, we continue to see new participants coming in, both financial players and commercial players. Because new sectors are being captured in government mandates around who needs to pay attention to a carbon price signal. And there's the potential that areas like marine, roads and buildings, all get captured going forward into this. So that's a potential tailwind for more people needing to pay attention to our markets.  
You also have in the EU, the concept of free allowance thresholds, where if you're under a certain threshold, you don't need to necessarily pay attention to carbon price signals. There's momentum behind lowering those free allowance thresholds, which thus could capture some of the major heavy industrial sectors that are currently not captured there. So that, again, leads to more commercials coming into the marketplace. In the U.S., again, we're a significant -- very significant lead in our business there. And there, the big trend is new states coming into the regional greenhouse gas initiative. So there's potential for more and more states coming into that. There's momentum behind that in some of these states, and that leads to more trading in our markets.  
You have just recently, I mentioned on the last call that we launched our new U.K. emissions trading scheme. So as a result of Brexit, one of the benefits we got is that the U.K. decided to set up their own emissions trading scheme. They selected us to do that. We launched it. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's been a very, very successful launch. And then you have new geographies around the world. So you have a trend with -- in Asia Pacific where there's the potential for more and more adoption of these. And given the significant lead we have in creating these markets on behalf of governments and market participants to create that market base pricing mechanism, that market-based pricing mechanism we're heavily engaged in all of those conversations.  
And given that we are the most transparent way to price -- put a market-based mechanism to price carbon, we've also developed alongside our or ICE Fixed Income and Data Services business, a global carbon index, which is being able -- using the prices coming out of our marketplaces to create a very transparent way to look at both global as well as regional price trends within the carbon markets."

This is Ben. I'll take this one. So when you think about our portfolio, and it was threaded through your question there, I think you appreciate the fact that we've built the most diversified platform that there is on the planet to help customers really go through this energy transition. We provide products, everything from coal to oil to natural gas to LNG and to the environmental markets. And in all those sectors, we are the lead provider of services, helping customers within each of those segments, but then also as they're transitioning towards a cleaner environment, cleaner fuels, helping them along that journey, manage their exposure to price risk we're seeing underneath each one of those segments, we're still seeing a lot of demand for new products. 
So you take, for example, just what's happened in oil. We've had a ton of innovation that's happened in oil to help the Middle East and Asia Pacific commercial customers, where we were selected to launch the Murban crude oil contract to enable users to be able to have a better price mechanism for pricing Middle Eastern oil going to Asia. You have the recent development that we announced with the Midland WTI American Gulf Coast crude contract is being launched with 2 huge commercial partners in Magellan and Enterprise, that will be launched early next year to provide a much better way to price WTI Midland crude that's at Houston and not constrained by the infrastructure constraints that are in and around Cushing.  
You also see -- you may have seen that a recent consultation came out in the industry by us and as well as our partners in S&P Platts to look at further evolution of the Brent contract in adding new sources of crude such as Johan Sverdrup and very importantly, the potential for WTI Midland basis Houston to be added into the Brent complex, further solidifying that as the global index for oil. I went through in the prior question, all the things that we're doing in the environmental complex to grow that, and we have a significant lead in our global natural gas and LNG franchise, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that continues to grow year-over-year.  
So we feel we're very, very well positioned to help customers along this journey, and we'll continue to partner very closely with them to do so."

So as I mentioned in the first question that was asked, we have -- since acquiring the business have had a very concentrated effort on how do we focus on that recurring revenue stream, how do we look at that subscription base and really start to where we can in certain parts of the business shift revenue more towards subscription, especially as you're in this high-volume environment that we've been in, it's a great time to do that to shift it towards -- more towards subscription and for some parts of the business, less towards transaction. 
That's more oriented towards the loan origination side and that AIQ business. So in those 2 parts of the business, those are areas where we have had a concentrated effort of moving customers in that direction. And to give you an example, that AIQ business on the data and analytics side, it historically was 100% transaction-oriented. And we have moved it very significantly towards subscription revenue both for every new customer that comes on the platform as well as renewals that are coming on. 
We are seeing -- to the answer of market share, we're seeing record sales continue. As I mentioned it multiple times that the second half of last year was a record and Q1 and Q2 has exceeded our expectations. All that is continuing to gain market share for us and for the business as we implement customers, that feeds into new subscription revenue, that feeds into the part of the beat that we had this past quarter as well as shifting more of the mix towards subscription. 
The other side of it is there are certain parts of the business that are transaction-oriented, and we are continuing to innovate new solutions and new opportunities to capture new transactional revenue that's not happened before even for us or for the industry. An example of that, as I mentioned last quarter, we'd be launching our hybrid eClose, we've gone ahead and launched that. So that's a complete digital closing room that interconnects the consumer to the lender to the settlement agent so that all documents, all collaboration, all communication and the entire closing process can be done digitally. 
We just launched this, and we already have 55 customers out of our 2,000 in the implementation process. As those get implemented, that will be new transaction revenue that will be coming through to us. So that's another example. And then another example that Jeff had mentioned in his prepared remarks is the interconnectivity between -- that we see between data on the Mortgage side of the business flowing through to our Fixed Income and Data Services business, where we're taking transactional data out of the Mortgage side of our business to help enhance and improve our mortgage-backed securities, prepayment and valuation models where we are a leader in providing that and further enhancing those models with real transactional data that hasn't happened before."

But clearly, you see the transactional side turn a little bit. So just wondering to what degree there are actually potential offsets that you're thinking about as maybe those transactional revenues come down. Is that something to do on the expense side? Or is that going to continue to grow as you invest? 
And then for Jeff, since you just -- we talked about this interconnectivity between the different businesses,  on the Mortgage side, Joe, at your Mortgage industry conference a few months ago, made this off the cuff remarks that you're going to be working together closely and maybe there's room for mortgage trading down the line with your exchange business. So just wondering to what degree this is just the long-term dream or if there's actually something behind the scenes that you're already working on and what the opportunity set could be there?"

So there is a degree of variable expenses within that business. But I think the way you want to be thinking about this is, look, this isn't about a second half refi environment. This is about a 10-year growth opportunity for us. And so that where we think we can double revenues over the next 10 years or so. So we're going to invest through however that cycle plays out, if it does play out, we're going to be investing through it. That was part of the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year where we said about $45 to -- $40 million to $45 million of incremental investment. I think you'll see that start to sort of slowly step up as we move through the year. And that's going as planned. That's all part of the planned investments that we've made, and we've communicated to you guys. 
But I think one point to just to make there on that as well is that one of the benefits here that Ellie Mae and ICE Mortgage Technology has as being part of the larger ICE platform is just the diversity that ICE brings to them. And so as Jeff said in his prepared remarks, it's in all weather stock. And so as maybe a mortgage cycle plays out, you've got other things in other areas of the business doing well. And so it really gives us the ability to invest through those cycles  and maybe where a stand-alone competitor or peer wouldn't be able to do that. 
So I think in that -- and ultimately, that puts us in a better place at the other end of things. So, again, it's about a 10-year opportunity against a 10-year -- a $10 billion TAM, where we're only about 10% of that today. So you should expect us to continue to invest in that business as we kind of move through the next couple of quarters."

What",310,"And regarding future ideas. So Joe, who you mentioned has joined our management committee, which also contains all the people that you've heard from on this call, and we run the business collaboratively so that we can work on this interconnectivity. What you've heard Ben talk about on this call is really hooking up what we would consider the cash market in a traditional market. It's the origination market of actually producing a mortgage for a consumer. And for the first time now, we've announced that we're hooking that to the secondary market through Lynn's business of taking that data to help with mortgage-backed securities. 
Our sense is that the Mortgage market, while it is regulated, is likely to continue to get more government attention as it becomes more transparent. It's largely for many people in government, a mechanism for wealth creation in the sense of people building equity in a home. It's also interest rate sensitive as a number of the questions have alluded to here, and there are maybe opportunities for government to influence or touch interest rates for certain segments of our society. 
And as the data and the transparency of warehouses are being bought and refinanced and where wealth is being created as that becomes more transparent we really believe that the business is going to continue to evolve around government policy and that is going to make its way, trickle its way into the secondary trading market. And we will be uniquely positioned with data and information about the changes that are going on in the cash market to help influence that secondary market. 
And doesn't mean we'll host one of those or use other assets potentially. That's part of why we wanted to get into this ecosystem. And it's part of our goal to build an all-weather company that will perform in every environment."

I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.30, up 34% year-over-year, marking the best third quarter in our company's history. Net revenues totaled a record $1.8 billion, and on a pro forma basis, increased 11% versus last year, with all 3 of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth. 
Total transaction revenues grew 13%, while total recurring revenues, which accounted for nearly half of our business, increased by 10%. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $755 million, including $35 million related to Bakkt, which after successfully completing its merger with Victory Park recently began trading on the NYSE. Adjusting for Bakkt, third quarter operating expenses would have been $720 million, in the middle of our guidance range, while our adjusted operating margin would have been 60%, up over 100 basis points year-over-year. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be between $737 million to $747 million. Relative to the full year outlook provided on our second quarter call, the fourth quarter is now expected to include approximately $10 million related to the Bakkt's [ sub ] period and $10 million to $15 million of performance-related compensation as we expect to reward our employees for their contribution to the strong results we are once again on track to achieve in 2021. 
Record year-to-date free cash flow has totaled nearly $2 billion. These strong cash flows along with the divestment of our $1.2 billion stake in Coinbase has enabled us to reduce leverage to under 3.25x at the end of September, nearly a full year ahead of schedule. As a result, we expect to resume share repurchases, including up to $250 million in this year's fourth quarter. We anticipate updating you on our 2022 capital return plans early next year. 
In addition, we announced in October that we have agreed to sell our stake in Euroclear for EUR 709 million, or approximately $820 million. We expect to determine the use of Euroclear proceeds as we approach closing, which we expect will be -- will occur in 2022. 
Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Third quarter net revenues totaled $959 million, ,an increase of 16% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by a 30% increase in our interest rate business and a 38% increase in our energy revenues, including 34% increase in our oil complex, a 73% increase in European natural gas revenues and a 72% increase in revenues related to global environmental products. Importantly, total open interest, which we believe to be the best indicator of long-term growth, is up 18% versus the end of last year, including 11% growth in energy and 28% growth across our financial futures and options complex. 
Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and NYSE listings increased 6% year-over-year, including 10% growth in our Listings business. This acceleration in growth was driven by an increasing number of operating company IPOs choosing the NYSE, particularly in the technology and consumer sectors. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect recurring revenues in our Exchange segment to be between $330 million and $335 million. 
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Third quarter revenues totaled $477 million, a 6% increase versus a year ago. Recurring revenue growth, which accounted for nearly 90% of segment revenues, also grew 6% in the quarter. Within recurring revenues, our fixed income data and analytics business increased by 5% year-over-year, including another double-digit growth in our index franchise, while other data and network services grew 9%, driven by continued customer demand for additional network capacity. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect that our recurring revenues will improve sequentially to a range of $415 million to $420 million, and that full year revenue growth will be approximately 6%, at the high end of our guidance range. 
Let's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. Despite a double-digit decline in industry origination volumes, our mortgage technology business grew 7% year-over-year and achieved record revenues of $366 million. While third quarter transaction revenues declined slightly, they were more than offset by a 33% growth in our recurring revenues, which at $143 million once again exceeded the high end of our guidance range and accounted for nearly 40% of total segment revenues. Our outperformance relative to industry trends continues to be driven by increased customer adoption of digital tools across the workflow. 
While these secular growth trends have been a clear tailwind for our recurring revenues, there is also opportunity to drive accelerating adoption across our transaction-based businesses, such as our Closing Solutions, where revenue increased by 30% in the third quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter guidance, we expect that recurring revenues will once again grow sequentially and be in a range of $147 million to $152 million. At the midpoint, this represents growth of approximately 25% year-over-year, which is on top of 20% growth achieved in last year's third quarter. 
In summary, we once again had strong contributions from each of our businesses and across the asset classes in which we operate. We delivered double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We also generated strong cash flows, reduced leverage to under 3.25x, announced the divestment of our stake in Euroclear and successfully took back public on the NYSE. As we look to the end of the year into 2022, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers, continuing to drive growth and create value for our shareholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ben."

Please turn to Slide 8. Our strong third quarter results were driven in part by interest rate volatility, global energy supply shortages and the continued adoption of our mortgage technology even amidst a decline in origination volumes. But more importantly, underpinning that performance are long-term secular tailwinds that will continue to drive growth across asset classes in macroeconomic environments. And with data and technology at our core, we have strategically positioned the business to benefit from these tailwinds across our platform. 
In energy, the globalization of natural gas and the evolution to cleaner energy are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. And today, cleaner energy sources, including global natural gas and environmentals, make up approximately 40% of our energy revenues and have grown 12% on average over the past 5 years. With the rise of LNG, natural gas markets are becoming more global in nature. In our European gas benchmark, TTF is emerging as the global gas benchmark. Revenues in our TTF markets have grown 38% on average over the last 5 years, including 84% growth in the third quarter. 
The supply shortages and price volatility that we saw in the third quarter are a peek into the future of what the energy transition could look like. Energy consumption is expected to double over the next 30 years, yet carbon emissions are expected to be reduced by half. This imbalance in supply and demand will introduce additional complexity and volatility to energy markets, which will drive greater demand for our risk management. Our global environmental markets, alongside our global oil, gas and power markets provide the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum that will enable participants to navigate this evolution. 
Complementary addition to the risk management that our technology provides is our growing suite of associated data products. Leveraging our leading environmental markets, we built a suite of carbon indices, which allow global investors to access market-based carbon prices through a single investment instrument. And today, there are a growing number of ETFs benchmarking to our carbon indices and environmental markets. 
Turning now to fixed income. The electronification of fixed income is a data-driven trend. We recognized this in 2015 when we acquired IDC and continue to invest and innovate in data and technology to further enable this trend. Our leading evaluated prices provide critical price transparency for nearly 3 million securities daily. By combining our proprietary pricing data with our comprehensive reference data, we've built innovative tools and analytics that will facilitate the continued electronification and automation of the fixed income markets. Solutions like our continuous evaluated pricing, best execution and liquidity indicators, for example, provide pre-trade transparency needed to determine fair value. 
We also see the electronification of fixed income within the ETF ecosystem. Our quality pricing and reference data, combined with [ 40 ] years of history serves as the foundation of our growing index business. We not only offer benchmark indices, but also calculation services, analytics and unique solutions like our custom indices. By servicing the entire ETF ecosystem through data and technology, we've been able to grow our index business double digits for the past 4 years. 
And finally, turning to our mortgage business. In the third quarter, we were once again able to grow our revenues even with industry volumes down double digits. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog-to-digital conversion happening in the industry. 
Part of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our origination technology and data and analytics business. While we only recently began this transition, we've already seen strong client adoption. 
Another opportunity that we're executing on today is in our closing solutions. The demand for automation in the closing of a real estate transaction is increasing. We see this evidenced by the continued onboarding of new customers to our electronic closing room, and hybrid solution that we launched in the second quarter. This month, we further advanced the automation of our [ eClose ] solution, which can save lenders hundreds of dollars per loan by leveraging additional technology and automation by adding [ eNote ] and [ eVault ]. Our comprehensive offering and the efficiencies that it delivers positions us well to execute on what we believe to be a $1 billion opportunity. 
Within Data and Analytics, our AIQ solution leverages AI, machine learning and proprietary data from our origination platform to automate the steps in the loan manufacturing process. This automation could save lenders thousands of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity. Today, only a fraction of mortgage technology customers take our AIQ solution, and we continue to have strong sales success cross-selling to existing customers even if they're not on our loan origination system, including one of the largest depositories in the U.S. And while still an early opportunity at under $100 million in revenue today, the efficiencies that our data analytics provide position us well to continue executing against what we think is a $4 billion opportunity. 
Flywheel effect that our leading technology and data provides combined with the cross-sell that our broad connectivity offers generates an array of opportunities for us to grow a business that at $1.4 billion today is only a fraction of the $10 billion opportunity. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

Please turn to Slide 9. The third quarter extends our track record of growth. We once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share with strong growth from all business segments across asset classes, and amidst a dynamic macro environment. These results are a testament to the strength of our business model, positioning the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog-to-digital conversion, and which together make ICE an all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth. 
The diversity of our platform positions us to benefit not only from near-term cyclical events, but also longer-term secular growth trends. We've expanded into new asset classes, growing our addressable market and broadened our expertise, making our network significant and providing the opportunity to unlock additional growth by collaborating across businesses. We recently announced another new product from the collaboration between ICE Data Services and ICE Mortgage Technology, called the ICE Rate Lock Indices. Leveraging anonymized and aggregated data from ICE Mortgage Technologies leading origination platform, this suite of indices provides a more comprehensive, accurate and timely reflection of residential mortgage rates. 
Building on this innovation, like we've done in other asset classes, these indices provide an opportunity to create additional products like rich analytics and better pricing tools for lenders. The opportunity to turn raw, unstructured data into actionable insights abounds across our business. By taking alternative data sets and marrying them with our proprietary data, we've built solutions that offer unique insight into the market. 
Our climate analytics, for example, leverage our strength in the fixed income market with third-party geospatial data to help market participants better manage climate risk as a part of their overall investing and risk management processes. As ESG is increasingly becoming a component of investment portfolios, our technology and data expertise positions us well to deliver solutions that meet these evolving customer needs. 
We have strategically assembled a portfolio to drive growth across asset classes and macro environments, and part of this strategy is capturing value by thoughtfully repositioning businesses. This year alone, we harvested our gain in Coinbase, announced an agreement to do the same with our stake in Euroclear, and unlocked Bakkt via our New York Stock Exchange listing. These transactions expose billions of dollars in value creation and position us well to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest for our future growth. It's collaborative efforts, innovative solutions and strategic capital allocation like this that have driven our growth for the past 20 years and which lay the foundation for continued growth well into the future. 
Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in the quarter. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to the best third quarter in our company's history, topped only by our record quarter earlier this year.

And -- in summary, when it's part of the thesis we had in doing the overall deal is that we saw a long-term secular trend here for people to want to automate and digitize the mortgage process, to continue to work on condensing the amount of time it takes to close on a real estate transaction. 
And if you look under the covers of that Closing Solutions business, this is a business that's going to be very transaction-oriented. A lot of the costs associated to it actually go on the actual closing statement of the client themselves. So you're going to see that this is one of the businesses that's going to be heavily transaction-oriented. And if you look at the components underneath it, they're really driving the growth. First part goes back to an acquisition we did a number of years ago, which is the Simplifile business. This is a business that electronic -- does the electronic recording at the county of all the closing documents associated to a real estate transaction. 
In this COVID environment we saw, a year ago, the number of documents that are being recorded in the counties moving more and more away from paper and towards digitization and using our rails to do so, and we continue to see that. So Simplifile is an input into that growth. 
The second component there is a business that we've talked about many times, which is a business called MERS. We have a new bundled service offering there that takes a number of bespoke services that we had within MERS. So the registration of the loan itself, the registration of an e-note, which we continue to see e-notes being adopted more and more through the industry, as well as lifetime servicing transfers, all being -- we bundled that all into one complete offering for our clients. 
And then the third area that we've talked about on prior calls is the launch of eClose, which was really enabled by the combination of the expertise we have with MERS, Simplifile and the Ellie Mae business. And we combined that origination network that Ellie Mae has with the settlement agent network that the Simplifile business has. We've launched our eClose offering in the second quarter. We've enhanced that offering with our own proprietary e-signing capabilities in the third quarter. And then just this month, we launched our own proprietary eNote as part of our loan origination document set, as well as eVault. And we're continuing to see customers adopt those solutions. 
I mentioned on the last call, we had 55 customers going through implementation. We now have 76 that are adopting it. And as that continues to ramp, I see that as another area that's going to continue to fuel growth in the closing line item, which is really enabling us to take a business that, 12 months ago, was a $200 million business, to now if you look at the trailing 12 months, it's a $300 million business, continuing to go after that $1 billion TAM that we outlined."

Well, first of all, and I think -- We'd like to position ourselves where there are analog to digital conversions, and there's an analog-to-digital conversion going on in the wallet. When I was a kid, I had a carried around a leather wallet in my pocket, and children today may never own a leather wallet. 
And so that analog-to-digital conversion is something that we wanted to be a part of. I think we decided to create Bakkt as a separate brand and a separate entity because a lot of our investors seem to not see the coalescence of institutional and retail coming together. As access is increased through digital tools, and you can see it in the U.S. equity markets, there's less distinction between a retail order and an institutional order, for example. 
And so that same convergence is happening across all businesses. And we were a little bit concerned that our investor base wouldn't appreciate that we could both be an institutional network provider and also a retail network provider. And so we decided to give the company a separate brand. And it was -- we just didn't feel like it was being appreciated inside of ICE and so we decided to give it a separate capital structure on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Other than that, Bakkt will be doing its own earnings calls now as a public company. I'm no longer on the board. And so I don't want to ever speak for the company, going forward. But I will tell you that we do believe there's value creation in analog-to-digital conversions, and we're trying to place value there around the business. And that's part of why I see us as being an all-weather name that can grow on top of growth. 
We're locked up in the company as part of the IPO. We actually invested additionally as part of the spin. And so we're very, very high on that company and want to give it every opportunity to demonstrate its value to the market."

I'll try to go through some of the components of what we saw that drove that growth. And as we highlighted, the business grew double digits year-over-year -- or sorry -- so the business grew 7% year-over-year, and with the backdrop of a decline in industry volumes being up double digits. We also grew the business 8% sequentially, if you look at it from second quarter to third quarter against a volume environment that industry estimates would have down double digits as well. And if you look at each of the line items of what's happening there, you'll see that we outperformed not only in the aggregate, but also in each line item, what that transaction -- what that overall transaction environment was. 
In the origination line item, what you see there that I outlined in the last quarter is that -- and it was in our prepared remarks again today, is that part of our customs doing the deal is that we could take certain parts of the revenue base here and move it more and more towards subscription and take some of the volatility out of it. And the origination line item is one in particular that we are doing that with. And we've only done that with a very small percentage of the customer base. The average client is a customer and is under contract for 4 to 5 years. And we just started this year with a small percentage of the client base. We've had a great pickup in customers being open to moving more towards subscription. So I see we have a long runway of that. 
The other thing that's going on in that origination line is we're continuing to add more customers, we're gaining more market share. And as we implement those customers, those are new loans that are running through our system that we are getting some transaction volume that we never saw before, that's offsetting some of the headwinds that you'd see in that transaction environment. 
The second line item, data and analytics, it's the exact same story. We're taking a business -- so this is the automation of the underwrite process through our AI tools. This is a business that was almost 100% transaction. Under the covers, we've been moving it more and more towards subscription. We're going to continue to do so, and we're having incredible success cross-selling this to clients. 
It does take a little bit longer to implement customers on this solution because you're automating and deeply embedding your solutions into very complicated workflow in each of these businesses as you're automating underwriting processes. But we have a number of customers that are going live on the platform that we've sold. We continue to have great sales success and we have a number continuing to go through implementation. So that's continuing to grow and offset any transaction issues you see there. 
And then on the Closing Solutions side, this is where I unpacked in the first question, a lot of the new innovation that we have, a lot of the changes that we made. Simplifile continues to gain market share really versus paper. Our eClose solutions, our brand-new innovation that the industry hasn't seen before, and each time a customer is subscribing to whether it's using our e-closing room, they're using our document set, they're using our e-note, they're using our vault, they can use either a component of those services or all of them. And each time they do that, we're getting incremental revenue on every transaction that's using that. And it's all greenfield. And there's very little competition in this space because of the unique position we've been in to build all those."

You said a small amount of those customers have migrated to subscription. Can you help quantify that? Is that sub-10% of the customers or any numbers around that? 
And can you just talk about the pricing structure? Because I thought the recurring revenues on the origination side previously were really just fee minimums on volumes. But it sounds like maybe this is a bit different in terms of fee structure. So can you just kind of go over that and what the strategy is in terms of migrating these customers?"

So it's a very small percentage of the customer base that we've been able to do this with. 
As you can imagine, now is a good time to actually be engaging with customers to make this transition towards subscription. Because you're in a high-volume environment, customers are in this high-volume environment, they want to adopt more automation. They want to be able to continue to automate and be as efficient as possible against any other competition. So they're continuing to add on more and more of our services. 
So when we go and engage in clients in this negotiation, we are willing to forgo some transaction revenue. But we're not foregoing all of it. We're just making it very open in our algorithm around, hey, if we're going to shift some to subscription, we are willing to give up some transaction, which is mostly the success fees on those transactions that we get.  
But we also remember the other transaction element that we do get is on our network. So any time a loan is coming on to our network and ordering services from third parties for the automation that we're providing there, we're collecting a fee for providing that benefit along those rails and that fee will continue as it is today."

In terms of are we taking away some of the upside, the way I see it is we're taking away some of the volatility in that line item. And where our upside is, is there's still a ton of new innovation that we're introducing to the marketplace between the e-close offerings that we have, that we've launched, between the automation of the underwrite and all the analyzers that we've been talking about on prior calls that we've been introducing to the marketplace.

And so we'll start about -- up to about $250 million this quarter. 
I think about that kind of being more of a partial buyback, because we do still need to get to 3x eventually. And I think we're well on our way there. But -- so we'll do a bit of a balance, pay down of debt alongside these repurchases over the next quarter or so. But I think once -- thinking about next year, nothing's really changed in terms of capital return philosophy. I mean, it's the same -- it's going to be the same thing as pre-Ellie Mae where it's return -- all capital to shareholders that we don't need for investment or M&A to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. 
So I think you should expect us to be thinking about it that way. And the only thing really that has changed here is that we've continued to grow free cash flow organically and then, of course, added Ellie Mae, which as you obviously heard today and in the last couple of quarters seen that it's performing very well. So those would be the things that I'd be thinking about as you're kind of thinking about next year and capital return at the moment.

So when you look at our energy business, and we've talked about this on several calls, one of the things I think that's come to light through this is that we are very different than any of the peers that are out there and that we've developed very deep liquid markets across the energy class spectrum. So whether it's coal, oil, gas, power, environmentals, we've invested heavily across that entire spectrum to give our customers the tools they need, to manage what we saw as a secular trend more than a decade ago of people moving towards cleaner fossil fuels such as natural gas, and towards environmental markets, carbon offset markets, compliance markets and the like. 
We made several acquisitions, climate exchange 10 years ago. We've been building out our global natural gas suite, and we have now a business that's substantially different than any of our peers. We continue to invest, as we talked about in prior quarters, our oil business, which is doing extraordinarily well. With investments that we made in the launch of our Murban contract, that ICE Futures Abu Dhabi. We have a new contract in the Gulf Coast that's launching in the beginning of next year in partnership with several big physical players. And we're in the middle of a Brent consultation where Midland WTI may be added into the Brent basket. 
So you have a whole bunch of dynamics going on across this, and it's because customers know they need to manage their risk through this transition. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think the environment that you've just seen, you've got to peek into what it's going to be for a long, long time. This energy transition is going to be very volatile. Everyone sees the secular trend where investments are pouring into renewable projects. and projects such as coal are not getting invested in. 
And the fact is any energy supply source, I don't care what it is, is susceptible to supply chain events, weather events, for example. If you have wind turbines and the wind is not blowing, it's not really easy to transition back to a coal-fired plant to get power back on the grid. So I foresee that we're in for a long ride of volatility. And now more than ever, the exchanges and the risk management tools that we provide are extraordinarily valuable to our clients, and it's important to us that we continue to engage with them as much as we ever have to continue to innovate."

And I think the one takeaway you should have is that, that has been an intentional evolution on behalf of the management team. We have been -- we started the company really being highly transaction-oriented, and have always wanted to have a bigger recurring growing base that we can rely on. 
Part of our thinking of becoming an all-weather name is finding these analog to digital market conversions, but also creating a portfolio of businesses that we operate that are durable in different environments. We really wanted to get into the mortgage space, and really worked for over 10 years to put ourselves in that space because it benefits from a low interest rate environment, generally speaking. 
We have other businesses like our interest rate futures and, to a certain degree, inflation-oriented products like commodities that tend to do better in high interest rate environments. And so from a transaction standpoint, we wanted to be durable. We want to grow on top of growth and not be a name where people pile in when interest rates are going up and pile out when interest rates are going down. 
And so the more that we feel like we can lock into growing and recurring revenue, it gives investors a basis to know that we're going to continue to pay a dividend, that we're going to have capital to reinvest in the business. And then if we can have transaction businesses that, regardless of macro environment, can do well. It just feels like a company that an investor should own. 
And that has been the strategy that we've deployed here for -- I mean years now. And it's finally coming to fruition. And the mortgage business, as Ben has mentioned, we've passed our colleagues with let's try to -- to really build a durable subscription underpinning to a business that also has really interesting transaction opportunities because of changes in technology. And the same thing in emissions and in liquefied natural gas. I know you and I have talked for years about our thesis that the natural gas market would globalize and that there would be global benchmarks, not regional benchmarks. 
And so a lot of these metrics that you see in your economic model have been incredibly intentional on our part over a long period of time. And it's great that in this quarter, as was mentioned earlier, everything came together at one time."

We have clients that are using us, for example, on the loan origination side and the correspondent channel, moving to add the retail channel onto that, adding services like our Maven compliance service or our AllRegs offering. All of those are heavily subscription oriented, so we have a concerted effort to cross-sell. 
And then the fourth is price. And our algorithm when we did the deal and our hypothesis is that on the subscription revenue growth, which is a big component of what we think is required to really hit that 8% to 10% long-term guide, that over that long period of time, each of those elements, the renewals, new sales, cross-selling and price, that will be pretty much an equal distribution across those 3 that you'll see over a long period of time is what's going to fuel that sustained subscription growth. 
So that's -- that's the area I'd highlight. There's -- on the transaction area, I mentioned a whole bunch of the new products that we're rolling out, which we believe has an opportunity to continue to grow transaction revenue as well and offset declines that you see in industry environments."

I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter results. 
Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.30, up 34% year-over-year, marking the best third quarter in our company's history. 
Net revenues totaled a record $1.8 billion and, on a pro forma basis, increased 11% versus last year, with all 3 of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth.  
Total transaction revenues grew 13%, while total recurring revenues, which accounted for nearly half of our business, increased by 10%. 
Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $755 million, including $35 million related to Bakkt, which, after successfully completing its merger with Victory Park, recently began trading on the NYSE. 
Adjusting for Bakkt, third quarter operating expenses would have been $720 million, in the middle of our guidance range, while operating -- or while our adjusted operating margin would have been 60%, up over 100 basis points year-over-year.  
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be between $737 million to $747 million. Relative to the full year outlook provided on our second quarter call, the fourth quarter is now expected to include approximately $10 million related to the Bakkt stub period and $10 million to $15 million of performance-related compensation as we expect to reward our employees for their contribution to the strong results we are once again on track to achieve in 2021.  
Record year-to-date free cash flow has totaled nearly $2 billion. These strong cash flows, along with the divestment of our $1.2 billion stake in Coinbase, has enabled us to reduce leverage to under 3.25x at the end of September, nearly a full year ahead of schedule. As a result, we expect to resume share repurchases, including up to $250 million in this year's fourth quarter. We anticipate updating you on our 2022 capital return plans early next year. In addition, we announced in October that we have agreed to sell our stake in Euroclear for EUR 709 million or approximately $820 million. We expect to determine the use of Euroclear proceeds as we approach closing, which we expect will be -- will occur in 2022.  
Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment.
Third quarter net revenues totaled $959 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by a 30% increase in our interest rate business and a 38% increase in our energy revenues, including 34% increase in our oil complex, a 73% increase in European natural gas revenues and a 72% increase in revenues related to global environmental products. Importantly, total open interest, which we believe to be the best indicator of long-term growth, is up 18% versus the end of last year, including 11% growth in energy and 28% growth across our financial futures and options complex.  
Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and NYSE listings, increased 6% year-over-year, including 10% growth in our listings business. This acceleration in growth was driven by an increasing number of operating company IPOs choosing the NYSE, particularly in the technology and consumer sectors. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect recurring revenues in our Exchange segment to be between $330 million and $335 million.  
Turning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. 
Third quarter revenues totaled $477 million, a 6% increase versus a year ago. Recurring revenue growth, which accounted for nearly 90% of segment revenues, also grew 6% in the quarter. Within recurring revenues, our fixed income, data and analytics business increased by 5% year-over-year, including another double-digit growth in our index franchise, while other data and network services grew 9% driven by continued customer demand for additional network capacity.  
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect that our recurring revenues will improve sequentially to a range of $415 million to $420 million and that full year revenue growth will be approximately 6%, at the high end of our guidance range.  
Let's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. 
Despite a double-digit decline in industry origination volumes, our Mortgage Technology business grew 7% year-over-year and achieved record revenues of $366 million. While third quarter transaction revenues declined slightly, they were more than offset by a 33% growth in our recurring revenues, which, at $143 million, once again exceeded the high end of our guidance range and accounted for nearly 40% of total segment revenues. 
Our outperformance relative to industry trends continues to be driven by increased customer adoption of digital tools across the workflow.  While these secular growth trends have been a clear tailwind for our recurring revenues, there is also opportunity to drive accelerating adoption across our transaction-based businesses such as our closing solutions, where revenue increased by 30% in the third quarter. 
Looking to the fourth quarter guidance, we expect that recurring revenues will once again grow sequentially and be in a range of $147 million to $152 million. At the midpoint, this represents growth of approximately 25% year-over-year, which is on top of 20% growth achieved in last year's third quarter.  
In summary, we once again had strong contributions from each of our businesses and across the asset classes in which we operate. We delivered double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We also generated strong cash flows, reduced leverage to under 3.25x, announced the divestment of our stake in Euroclear and successfully took back public on the NYSE. As we look to the end of the year into 2022, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers, continuing to drive growth and create value for our shareholders.  
I'll now turn the call over to Ben."

Please turn to Slide 8. 
Our strong third quarter results were driven in part by interest rate volatility, global energy supply shortages and the continued adoption of our mortgage technology even amidst a decline in origination volumes. But more importantly, underpinning that performance are long-term, secular tailwinds that will continue to drive growth across asset classes and macroeconomic environments. And with data and technology at our core, we have strategically positioned the business to benefit from these tailwinds across our platform.  
In energy, the globalization of natural gas and the evolution to cleaner energy are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. And today, cleaner energy sources, including global natural gas and environmentals, make up approximately 40% of our energy revenues and have grown 12% on average over the past 5 years. 
With the rise of LNG, natural gas markets are becoming more global in nature. In our European gas benchmark, TTF is emerging as the global gas benchmark. Revenues in our TTF markets have grown 38% on average over the last 5 years, including 84% growth in the third quarter.  
The supply shortages and price volatility that we saw in the third quarter are a peek into the future of what the energy transition could look like. Energy consumption is expected to double over the next 30 years, yet carbon emissions are expected to be reduced by half. This imbalance in supply and demand will introduce additional complexity and volatility to energy markets, which will drive greater demand for our risk management. Our global environmental markets, alongside our global oil, gas and power markets, provide the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum that will enable participants to navigate this evolution.  
Complementary addition to the risk management that our technology provides is our growing suite of associated data products. Leveraging our leading environmental markets, we built a suite of carbon indices which allow global investors to access market-based carbon prices through a single investment instrument. And today, there are a growing number of ETFs benchmarking to our carbon indices and environmental markets.  
Turning now to fixed income. The electronification of fixed income is a data-driven trend. We recognized this in 2015 when we acquired IDC and continue to invest and innovate in data and technology to further enable this trend. Our leading evaluated prices provide critical price transparency for nearly 3 million securities daily. By combining our proprietary pricing data with our comprehensive reference data, we've built innovative tools and analytics that will facilitate the continued electronification and automation of the fixed income markets. Solutions like our continuous evaluated pricing, best execution and liquidity indicators, for example, provide pre-trade transparency needed to determine fair value.  
We also see the electronification of fixed income within the ETF ecosystem. Our quality pricing and reference data, combined with 4 years of history, serves as the foundation of our growing index business. We not only offer benchmark indices but also calculation services, analytics and unique solutions like our custom indices. By servicing the entire ETF ecosystem through data and technology, we've been able to grow our index business double digits for the past 4 years.  
And finally, turning to our mortgage business. In the third quarter, we were once again able to grow our revenues even with industry volumes down double digits. 
This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog-to-digital conversion happening in the industry. Part of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our origination technology and data and analytics business. While we only recently began this transition, we've already seen strong client adoption.  
Another opportunity that we're executing on today is in our closing solutions. The demand for automation in the closing of a real estate transaction is increasing. We see this evidenced by the continued onboarding of new customers to our electronic closing room and hybrid solution that we launched in the second quarter. 
This month, we further advanced the automation of our eClose solution, which can save lenders hundreds of dollars per loan by leveraging additional technology and automation by adding eNote and eVault. Our comprehensive offering and the efficiencies that it delivers positions us well to execute on what we believe to be a $1 billion opportunity.  
Within data and analytics, our AIQ solution leverages AI, machine learning and proprietary data from our origination platform to automate the steps in the loan manufacturing process. This automation could save lenders thousands of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity. Today, only a fraction of Mortgage Technology customers take our AIQ solution, and we continue to have strong sales success cross-selling to existing customers even if they're not on our loan origination system, including one of the largest depositories in the U.S. And while still an early opportunity at under $100 million in revenue today, the efficiencies that our data analytics provide position us well to continue executing against what we think is a $4 billion opportunity.  
Flywheel effect that our leading technology and data provides, combined with the cross-sell that our broad connectivity offers, generates an array of opportunities for us to grow a business that at $1.4 billion today is only a fraction of the $10 billion opportunity.  
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

Please turn to Slide 9. 
The third quarter extends our track record of growth. We once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share with strong growth from all business segments, across asset classes and amidst a dynamic macro environment. These results are a testament to the strength of our business model, positioning the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog-to-digital conversion and which together make ICE an all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth.  
The diversity of our platform positions us to benefit not only from near-term cyclical events but also longer-term, secular growth trends. We've expanded into new asset classes, grown our addressable markets and broadened our expertise, making our network significant and providing the opportunity to unlock additional growth by collaborating across businesses. 
We recently announced another new product from the collaboration between ICE Data Services and ICE Mortgage Technology called the ICE rate lock indices. Leveraging anonymized and aggregated data from ICE Mortgage Technology's leading origination platform, this suite of indices provides a more comprehensive, accurate and timely reflection of residential mortgage rates. Building on this innovation, like we've done in other asset classes, these indices provide an opportunity to create additional products like rich analytics and better pricing tools for lenders. 
The opportunity to turn raw, unstructured data into actionable insights abounds across our business. By taking alternative datasets and marrying them with our proprietary data, we've built solutions that offer unique insights into the market.  
Our climate analytics, for example, leverage our strength in the fixed income market with third-party geospatial data to help market participants better manage climate risk as a part of their overall investing and risk management processes. As ESG is increasingly becoming a component of investment portfolios, our technology and data expertise positions us well to deliver solutions that meet these evolving customer needs.  
We have strategically assembled a portfolio to drive growth across asset classes and macro environments. And part of this strategy is capturing value by thoughtfully repositioning businesses. This year alone, we harvested our gain in Coinbase, announced an agreement to do the same with our stake in Euroclear and unlocked Bakkt via our New York Stock Exchange listing. These transactions expose billions of dollars in value creation and position us well to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest for our future growth. It's collaborative efforts, innovative solutions and strategic capital allocation like this that have driven our growth for the past 20 years and which lay the foundation for continued growth well into the future.  
Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in the quarter. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to the best third quarter in our company's history, topped only by our record quarter earlier this year.

And in summary, when -- it's part of the thesis we had in doing the overall deal, is that we saw a long-term, secular trend here for people to want to automate and digitize the mortgage process and continue to work on condensing the amount of time it takes to close on a real estate transaction.  
And if you look under the covers of that closing solutions business, this is a business that's going to be very transaction oriented. A lot of the costs associated to it actually go on the actual closing statement of the client themselves. So you're going to see that this is one of the businesses that's going to be heavily transaction oriented. 
And if you look at the components underneath it, they're really driving the growth. First part goes back to an acquisition we did a number of years ago, which is the Simplifile business. This is a business that electronic -- does the electronic recording at the county of all the closing documents associated to a real estate transaction.  
In this COVID environment, we saw a year ago the number of documents that were being recorded in the counties moving more and more away from paper and towards digitization and using our rails to do so, and we continue to see that. So Simplifile is an input into that growth.  
The second component there is a business that we've talked about many times, which is a business called MERS. We have a new bundled service offering there that takes a number of bespoke services that we had within MERS. So the registration of the loan itself, the registration of an eNote, which we continue to see eNotes being adopted more and more through the industry, as well as lifetime servicing transfers all being -- we bundled that all into one complete offering for our clients.  
And then the third area that we've talked about on prior calls is the launch of eClose, which was really enabled by the combination of the expertise we have with MERS, Simplifile and the Ellie Mae business. And we combined that origination network that Ellie Mae has with the settlement agent network that the Simplifile business has. 
We've launched our eClose offering in the second quarter. We've enhanced that offering with our own proprietary e-signing capabilities in the third quarter. And then just this month, we launched our own proprietary eNote as part of our loan origination document set, as well as eVault. 
And we're continuing to see customers adopt those solutions. I mentioned on the last call we had 55 customers going through implementation. We now have 76 that are adopting it. 
And as that continues to ramp, I see that as another area that's going to continue to fuel growth in the closing line item, which is really enabling us to take a business that 12 months ago was a $200 million business to now, if you look at the trailing 12 months, it's a $300 million business, continuing to go after that $1 billion TAM that we outlined."

As access has increased through digital tools, you can see it in the U.S. equity markets, there's less distinction between a retail order and an institutional order, for example. And so that same convergence is happening across all businesses. 
And we were a little bit concerned that our investor base wouldn't appreciate that we could both be an institutional network provider and also a retail network provider. And so we decided to give the company a separate brand. And it was -- we just didn't feel like it was being appreciated inside of ICE, and so we decided to give it a separate capital structure on the New York Stock Exchange.  
Other than that, Bakkt will be doing its own earnings calls now as a public company. I'm no longer on the Board, and so I don't want to ever speak for the company going forward. But I will tell you that we do believe there's value creation in analog-to-digital conversions, and we're trying to place value there around the business. And that's part of why I see us as being an all-weather name that can grow on top of growth.  
We're locked up in the company as part of the IPO. We actually invested additionally as part of the spin. And so we're very, very high on that company and want to give it every opportunity to demonstrate its value to the market."

I'll try to go through some of the components of what we saw that drove that growth. 
And as we highlighted, the business grew double digits year-over-year -- or, sorry, so the business grew 7% year-over-year and with the backdrop of a decline in industry volumes being double digits. We also grew the business 8% sequentially, if you look at it from second quarter to third quarter, against a volume environment that industry estimates would have down double digits as well. And if you look at each of the line items of what's happening there, you'll see that we outperformed not only in the aggregate but also in each line item, what that transaction -- what that overall transaction environment was.  
In the origination line item, what you see there that I outlined in the last quarter is that -- and it was in our prepared remarks again today, is that part of our hypothesis in doing the deal is that we could take certain parts of the revenue base here and move it more and more towards subscription and take some of the volatility out of it. And the origination line item is one in particular that we are doing that with. And we've only done that with a very small percentage of the customer base. The average client is a customer and one that is under contract for 4 to 5 years. And we just started this year with a small percentage of the client base. We've had a great pickup in customers being open to moving more towards subscription. So I see we have a long runway of that. 
The other thing that's going on in that origination line is we're continuing to add more customers, we're gaining more market share. And as we implement those customers, those are new loans that are running through our system, and we are getting some transaction volume that we never saw before that's offsetting some of the headwinds that you'd see in that transaction environment. 
The second line item, data and analytics, it's the exact same story. We're taking a business -- so this is the automation of the underwriting process through our AI tools. This is a business that was almost 100% transaction. Under the covers, we've been moving it more and more towards subscription. We're going to continue to do so, and we're having incredible success cross-selling this to clients. 
It does take a little bit longer to implement customers on this solution because you're automating and deeply embedding your solutions into a very complicated workflow in each of these businesses as you're automating underwriting processes. But we have a number of customers that are going live on the platform that we've sold. We continue to have great sales success, and we have a number continuing to go through implementations. So that's continuing to grow and offset any transaction issues you see there. 
And then on the closing solution side, this is where I unpacked within the first question a lot of the new innovation that we have, a lot of the changes that we made. Simplifile continues to gain market share really versus paper. Our eClose solutions, our brand-new innovation that the industry hasn't seen before, and each time a customer is subscribing -- so whether it's using our eClosing room, they're using our document set, they're using our eNote, they're using our vault, they can use either a component of those services or all of them. And each time they do that, we're getting incremental revenue on every transaction that's using that. And it's all greenfield. And there's very little competition in this space because of the unique position we've been in to build all those."

You said a small amount of those customers have migrated to subscription. Can you help quantify that? Is that sub-10% of the customers? Or any numbers around that? 
And can you just talk about the pricing structure? Because I thought the recurring revenues on the origination side previously were really just fee minimums on volumes. But it sounds like maybe this is a bit different in terms of fee structure. So can you just kind of go over that and what the strategy is in terms of migrating these customers?"

So it's a very small percentage of the customer base that we've been able to do this with. 
As you can imagine, now is a good time to actually be engaging with customers to make this transition towards subscription because we're in a high-volume environment. Customers are -- in this high-volume environment, they want to adopt more automation, they want to be able to continue to automate and be as efficient as possible against any of their competition. So they're continuing to add on more and more of our services. 
So when we go in and engage clients in this negotiation, we are willing to forgo some transaction revenue. But we're not foregoing all of it. We're just making it very open in our algorithm around, hey, if we're going to shift some to subscription, we are willing to give up some transaction, which is mostly the success fees on those transactions that we get.  
But we also remember the other transaction element that we do get is on our network. So any time a loan is coming onto our network and ordering services from third parties for the automation that we're providing there, we're collecting a fee for providing that benefit along those rails, and that fee will continue as it is today."

In terms of are we taking away some of the upside, well, the way I see it is we're taking away some of the volatility in that line item. And where our upside is, is there's still a ton of new innovation that we're introducing to the marketplace between the eClose offerings that we have that we've launched, between the automation of the underwrite and all the analyzers that we've been talking about on prior calls that we've been introducing to the marketplace.

That was kind of our target to resume share buybacks that we set when we announced the Ellie Mae deal back in August of last year. And so we'll start about -- up to about $250 million this quarter. 
I think about that kind of being more of a partial buyback because we do still need to get to 3x eventually, and I think we're well on our way there. But -- so we'll do a bit of a balance, paydown of debt alongside these repurchases over the next quarter or so. 
But I think once -- thinking about next year, nothing's really changed in terms of capital return philosophy. I mean it's the same -- it's going to be the same thing as pre-Ellie Mae where it's return all capital to shareholders that we don't need for investment or M&A to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. So I think you should expect us to be thinking about it that way. 
And the only thing really that has changed here is that we've continued to grow free cash flow organically and then, of course, added Ellie Mae, which, as you obviously heard today and in the last couple of quarters, seen that it's performing very well. So those would be the things that I'd be thinking about as you're kind of thinking about next year in capital return at the moment.

So when you look at our energy business, and we had talked about this on several calls, one of the things, I think, that's come to light through this is that we are very different than any of the peers that are out there in that we've developed very deep, liquid markets across the energy class spectrum. So whether it's coal, oil, gas, power, environmentals, we've invested heavily across that entire spectrum to give our customers the tools they need to manage what we saw as a secular trend more than a decade ago of people moving towards cleaner fossil fuels, such as natural gas, and towards environmental markets, carbon offset markets, compliance markets and the like. 
Made several acquisitions, Climate Exchange 10 years ago. We've been building out our global natural gas suite. And we have now a business that's substantially different than any of our peers'. We continue to invest, as we talked about in prior quarters, our oil business, which is doing extraordinarily well, with investments that we made in the launch of our Murban contract at ICE Futures Abu Dhabi. We have a new contract in the Gulf Coast that's launching in the beginning of next year in partnership with several big physical players. And we're in the middle of a Brent consultation where Midland WTI may be added into the Brent basket. So you have a whole bunch of dynamics going on across this, and it's because customers know they need to manage their risk through this transition. 
And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think the environment that you've just seen, you've got a peek into what it's going to be for a long, long time. This energy transition is going to be very volatile. Everyone sees the secular trend where investments are pouring into renewable projects, and projects such as coal are not getting invested in. 
And the fact is, any energy supply source, I don't care what it is, is susceptible to supply chain events, weather events, for example. If you have wind turbines and the wind is not blowing, it's not really easy to transition back to a coal-fired plant to get power back on the grid. 
So I foresee that we're in for a long ride of volatility. And now more than ever, the exchanges and the risk management tools that we provide are extraordinarily valuable to our clients, and it's important to us that we continue to engage with them as much as we ever have to continue to innovate."

And I think the one takeaway you should have is that, that has been an intentional evolution on behalf of the management team. We have been -- we started the company really being highly transaction oriented and have always wanted to have a bigger recurring, growing base that we can rely on. 
Part of our thinking of becoming an all-weather name is finding these analog-to-digital market conversions but also creating a portfolio of businesses that we operate that are durable in different environments. We really wanted to get into the mortgage space and really worked for over 10 years to put ourselves in that space because it benefits from a low interest rate environment, generally speaking. 
We have other businesses like our interest rate futures and, to a certain degree, inflation-oriented products like commodities that tend to do better in high interest rate environments. And so from a transaction standpoint, we wanted to be durable. We want to grow on top of growth and not be a name where people pile in when interest rates are going up and pile out when interest rates are going down. 
And so the more that we feel like we can lock into growing and recurring revenue, it gives investors a basis to know that we're going to continue to pay a dividend, that we're going to have capital to reinvest in the business. And then if we can have transaction businesses that, regardless of macro environment, can do well, it just feels like a company that an investor should own. 
And that has been the strategy that we've [ deployed ] here for how many years now, and it's finally coming to fruition. And the mortgage business, as Ben has mentioned, we've tasked our colleagues with let's try to really build a durable subscription underpinning to a business that also has really interesting transaction opportunities because of changes in technology. And the same thing in emissions and in liquefied natural gas. I know you and I have talked for years about our thesis that the natural gas market would globalize and that there would be global benchmarks, not regional benchmarks. 
And so a lot of these metrics that you see in your economic model have been incredibly intentional on our part over a long period of time. And it's great that in this quarter, as was mentioned earlier, everything came together at one time."

What I'll -- one area I can unpack here is when you dig into that, what's leading to our subscription growth. So that's one of the areas of our thesis, is that we could move more and more towards subscription in certain parts of the business. 
And if you look at the components of what's fueling that, one is the very deliberate, as customers are renewing, moving more and more towards subscription in the origination and the data and analytics line, That's one component. 
Second is new sales. And this is about market share gains. So we continue to have a lot of success in continuing to add new customers onto our platform or -- and cross-selling services to our existing clients is really the third. So in that cross-selling, the way to think about it, there's opportunities for us to expand the footprint with our clients, with the existing services that they have. We have clients that are using us on, for example, the loan origination side and the correspondent channel, moving to add the retail channel onto that, adding services like our Maven compliance service or our AllRegs offering. All of those are heavily subscription oriented, so we have a concerted effort to cross-sell. 
And then the fourth is price. And our algorithm when we did the deal and our hypothesis is that on the subscription revenue growth, which is a big component of what we think is required to really hit that 8% to 10% long-term guide, that over that long period of time, each of those elements, the renewals, new sales, cross-selling and price, it'll be pretty much an equal distribution across those 3 that you'll see over a long period of time is what's going to fuel that sustained subscription growth. So that's the area I'd highlight. 
So on the transaction area, I mentioned a whole bunch of the new products that we're rolling out, which we believe has an opportunity to continue to grow transaction revenue as well and offset declines that you see in industry environments."

I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter results. 
Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.30, up 34% year-over-year, marking the best third quarter in our company's history. 
Net revenues totaled a record $1.8 billion and, on a pro forma basis, increased 11% versus last year, with all 3 of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth.  
Total transaction revenues grew 13%, while total recurring revenues, which accounted for nearly half of our business, increased by 10%. 
Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $755 million, including $35 million related to Bakkt, which, after successfully completing its merger with Victory Park, recently began trading on the NYSE. 
Adjusting for Bakkt, third quarter operating expenses would have been $720 million, in the middle of our guidance range, while operating -- or while our adjusted operating margin would have been 60%, up over 100 basis points year-over-year.  
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be between $737 million to $747 million. Relative to the full year outlook provided on our second quarter call, the fourth quarter is now expected to include approximately $10 million related to the Bakkt stub period and $10 million to $15 million of performance-related compensation as we expect to reward our employees for their contribution to the strong results we are once again on track to achieve in 2021.  
Record year-to-date free cash flow has totaled nearly $2 billion. These strong cash flows, along with the divestment of our $1.2 billion stake in Coinbase, has enabled us to reduce leverage to under 3.25x at the end of September, nearly a full year ahead of schedule. As a result, we expect to resume share repurchases, including up to $250 million in this year's fourth quarter. We anticipate updating you on our 2022 capital return plans early next year. In addition, we announced in October that we have agreed to sell our stake in Euroclear for EUR 709 million or approximately $820 million. We expect to determine the use of Euroclear proceeds as we approach closing, which we expect will be -- will occur in 2022.  
Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment.
Third quarter net revenues totaled $959 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by a 30% increase in our interest rate business and a 38% increase in our energy revenues, including 34% increase in our oil complex, a 73% increase in European natural gas revenues and a 72% increase in revenues related to global environmental products. Importantly, total open interest, which we believe to be the best indicator of long-term growth, is up 18% versus the end of last year, including 11% growth in energy and 28% growth across our financial futures and options complex.  
Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and NYSE listings, increased 6% year-over-year, including 10% growth in our listings business. This acceleration in growth was driven by an increasing number of operating company IPOs choosing the NYSE, particularly in the technology and consumer sectors. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect recurring revenues in our Exchange segment to be between $330 million and $335 million.  
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. 
Third quarter revenues totaled $477 million, a 6% increase versus a year ago. Recurring revenue growth, which accounted for nearly 90% of segment revenues, also grew 6% in the quarter. Within recurring revenues, our fixed income, data and analytics business increased by 5% year-over-year, including another double-digit growth in our index franchise, while other data and network services grew 9% driven by continued customer demand for additional network capacity.  
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect that our recurring revenues will improve sequentially to a range of $415 million to $420 million and that full year revenue growth will be approximately 6%, at the high end of our guidance range.  
Let's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. 
Despite a double-digit decline in industry origination volumes, our Mortgage Technology business grew 7% year-over-year and achieved record revenues of $366 million. While third quarter transaction revenues declined slightly, they were more than offset by a 33% growth in our recurring revenues, which, at $143 million, once again exceeded the high end of our guidance range and accounted for nearly 40% of total segment revenues. 
Our outperformance relative to industry trends continues to be driven by increased customer adoption of digital tools across the workflow.  While these secular growth trends have been a clear tailwind for our recurring revenues, there is also opportunity to drive accelerating adoption across our transaction-based businesses such as our closing solutions, where revenue increased by 30% in the third quarter. 
Looking to the fourth quarter guidance, we expect that recurring revenues will once again grow sequentially and be in a range of $147 million to $152 million. At the midpoint, this represents growth of approximately 25% year-over-year, which is on top of 20% growth achieved in last year's third quarter.  
In summary, we once again had strong contributions from each of our businesses and across the asset classes in which we operate. We delivered double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We also generated strong cash flows, reduced leverage to under 3.25x, announced the divestment of our stake in Euroclear and successfully took back public on the NYSE. As we look to the end of the year into 2022, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers, continuing to drive growth and create value for our shareholders.  
I'll now turn the call over to Ben."

Please turn to Slide 8. 
Our strong third quarter results were driven in part by interest rate volatility, global energy supply shortages and the continued adoption of our mortgage technology even amidst a decline in origination volumes. But more importantly, underpinning that performance are long-term secular tailwinds that will continue to drive growth across asset classes and macroeconomic environments. And with data and technology at our core, we have strategically positioned the business to benefit from these tailwinds across our platform.  
In energy, the globalization of natural gas and the evolution to cleaner energy are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. And today, cleaner energy sources, including global natural gas and environmentals, make up approximately 40% of our energy revenues and have grown 12% on average over the past 5 years. 
With the rise of LNG, natural gas markets are becoming more global in nature. In our European gas benchmark, TTF is emerging as the global gas benchmark. Revenues in our TTF markets have grown 38% on average over the last 5 years, including 84% growth in the third quarter.  
The supply shortages and price volatility that we saw in the third quarter are a peek into the future of what the energy transition could look like. Energy consumption is expected to double over the next 30 years, yet carbon emissions are expected to be reduced by half. This imbalance in supply and demand will introduce additional complexity and volatility to energy markets, which will drive greater demand for our risk management. Our global environmental markets, alongside our global oil, gas and power markets, provide the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum that will enable participants to navigate this evolution.  
Complementary addition to the risk management that our technology provides is our growing suite of associated data products. Leveraging our leading environmental markets, we built a suite of carbon indices which allow global investors to access market-based carbon prices through a single investment instrument. And today, there are a growing number of ETFs benchmarking to our carbon indices and environmental markets.  
Turning now to fixed income. The electronification of fixed income is a data-driven trend. We recognized this in 2015 when we acquired IDC and continue to invest and innovate in data and technology to further enable this trend. Our leading evaluated prices provide critical price transparency for nearly 3 million securities daily. By combining our proprietary pricing data with our comprehensive reference data, we've built innovative tools and analytics that will facilitate the continued electronification and automation of the fixed income markets. Solutions like our continuous evaluated pricing, best execution and liquidity indicators, for example, provide pre-trade transparency needed to determine fair value.  
We also see the electronification of fixed income within the ETF ecosystem. Our quality pricing and reference data, combined with 4 years of history, serves as the foundation of our growing index business. We not only offer benchmark indices but also calculation services, analytics and unique solutions like our custom indices. By servicing the entire ETF ecosystem through data and technology, we've been able to grow our index business double digits for the past 4 years.  
And finally, turning to our mortgage business. In the third quarter, we were once again able to grow our revenues even with industry volumes down double digits. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog-to-digital conversion happening in the industry. Part of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our origination technology and data and analytics business. While we only recently began this transition, we've already seen strong client adoption.  
Another opportunity that we're executing on today is in our closing solutions. The demand for automation in the closing of a real estate transaction is increasing. We see this evidenced by the continued onboarding of new customers to our electronic closing room and hybrid solution that we launched in the second quarter. 
This month, we further advanced the automation of our eClose solution, which can save lenders hundreds of dollars per loan by leveraging additional technology and automation by adding eNote and eVault. Our comprehensive offering and the efficiencies that it delivers positions us well to execute on what we believe to be a $1 billion opportunity.  
Within data and analytics, our AIQ solution leverages AI, machine learning and proprietary data from our origination platform to automate the steps in the loan manufacturing process. This automation could save lenders thousands of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity. Today, only a fraction of Mortgage Technology customers take our AIQ solution, and we continue to have strong sales success cross-selling to existing customers even if they're not on our loan origination system, including one of the largest depositories in the U.S. And while still an early opportunity at under $100 million in revenue today, the efficiencies that our data analytics provide position us well to continue executing against what we think is a $4 billion opportunity.  
Flywheel effect that our leading technology and data provides, combined with the cross-sell that our broad connectivity offers, generates an array of opportunities for us to grow a business that at $1.4 billion today is only a fraction of the $10 billion opportunity.  
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

Please turn to Slide 9. 
The third quarter extends our track record of growth. We once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share with strong growth from all business segments, across asset classes and amidst a dynamic macro environment. These results are a testament to the strength of our business model, positioning the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog-to-digital conversion and which together make ICE an all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth.  
The diversity of our platform positions us to benefit not only from near-term cyclical events but also longer-term secular growth trends. We've expanded into new asset classes, grown our addressable markets and broadened our expertise, making our network significant and providing the opportunity to unlock additional growth by collaborating across businesses. 
We recently announced another new product from the collaboration between ICE Data Services and ICE Mortgage Technology called the ICE Rate Lock Indices. Leveraging anonymized and aggregated data from ICE Mortgage Technology's leading origination platform, this suite of indices provides a more comprehensive, accurate and timely reflection of residential mortgage rates. Building on this innovation, like we've done in other asset classes, these indices provide an opportunity to create additional products like rich analytics and better pricing tools for lenders. 
The opportunity to turn raw, unstructured data into actionable insights abounds across our business. By taking alternative datasets and marrying them with our proprietary data, we've built solutions that offer unique insights into the market.  
Our climate analytics, for example, leverage our strength in the fixed income market with third-party geospatial data to help market participants better manage climate risk as a part of their overall investing and risk management processes. As ESG is increasingly becoming a component of investment portfolios, our technology and data expertise positions us well to deliver solutions that meet these evolving customer needs.  
We have strategically assembled a portfolio to drive growth across asset classes and macro environments. And part of this strategy is capturing value by thoughtfully repositioning businesses. This year alone, we harvested our gain in Coinbase, announced an agreement to do the same with our stake in Euroclear and unlocked Bakkt via our New York Stock Exchange listing. These transactions expose billions of dollars in value creation and position us well to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest for our future growth. It's collaborative efforts, innovative solutions and strategic capital allocation like this that have driven our growth for the past 20 years and which lay the foundation for continued growth well into the future.  
Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in the quarter. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to the best third quarter in our company's history, topped only by our record quarter earlier this year.  
I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Danae, to conduct a question-and-answer session, which will run until 9:30 Eastern Time."

And in summary, when -- it's part of the thesis we had in doing the overall deal, is that we saw a long-term secular trend here for people to want to automate and digitize the mortgage process and continue to work on condensing the amount of time it takes to close on a real estate transaction.  
And if you look under the covers of that closing solutions business, this is a business that's going to be very transaction oriented. A lot of the costs associated to it actually go on the actual closing statement of the client themselves. So you're going to see that this is one of the businesses that's going to be heavily transaction oriented. 
And if you look at the components underneath it, they're really driving the growth. First part goes back to an acquisition we did a number of years ago, which is the Simplifile business. This is a business that electronic -- does the electronic recording at the county of all the closing documents associated to a real estate transaction.  
In this COVID environment, we saw a year ago the number of documents that were being recorded in the counties moving more and more away from paper and towards digitization and using our rails to do so, and we continue to see that. So Simplifile is an input into that growth.  
The second component there is a business that we've talked about many times, which is a business called MERS. We have a new bundled service offering there that takes a number of bespoke services that we had within MERS. So the registration of the loan itself, the registration of an eNote, which we continue to see eNotes being adopted more and more through the industry, as well as lifetime servicing transfers all being -- we bundled that all into one complete offering for our clients.  
And then the third area that we've talked about on prior calls is the launch of eClose, which was really enabled by the combination of the expertise we have with MERS, Simplifile and the Ellie Mae business. And we combined that origination network that Ellie Mae has with the settlement agent network that the Simplifile business has. 
We've launched our eClose offering in the second quarter. We've enhanced that offering with our own proprietary e-signing capabilities in the third quarter. And then just this month, we launched our own proprietary eNote as part of our loan origination document set, as well as eVault. And we're continuing to see customers adopt those solutions. I mentioned on the last call we had 55 customers going through implementation. We now have 76 that are adopting it. 
And as that continues to ramp, I see that as another area that's going to continue to fuel growth in the closing line item, which is really enabling us to take a business that 12 months ago was a $200 million business to now, if you look at the trailing 12 months, it's a $300 million business, continuing to go after that $1 billion TAM that we outlined."

When I was a kid, I had a -- I carried around a leather wallet in my pocket, and children today may never own a leather wallet. And so that analog-to-digital conversion is something that we wanted to be a part of. 
I think we decided to create Bakkt as a separate brand and a separate entity because a lot of our investors seem to not see the coalescence of institutional and retail coming together. As access has increased through digital tools, you can see it in the U.S. equity markets, there's less distinction between a retail order and an institutional order, for example. And so that same convergence is happening across all businesses. 
And we were a little bit concerned that our investor base wouldn't appreciate that we could both be an institutional network provider and also a retail network provider. And so we decided to give the company a separate brand. And it was -- we just didn't feel like it was being appreciated inside of ICE, and so we decided to give it a separate capital structure on the New York Stock Exchange.  
Other than that, Bakkt will be doing its own earnings calls now as a public company. I'm no longer on the Board, and so I don't want to ever speak for the company going forward. But I will tell you that we do believe there's value creation in analog-to-digital conversions, and we're trying to place value there around the business. And that's part of why I see us as being an all-weather name that can grow on top of growth.  
We're locked up in the company as part of the IPO. We actually invested additionally as part of the spin. And so we're very, very high on that company and want to give it every opportunity to demonstrate its value to the market."

In the origination line item, what you see there that I outlined in the last quarter is that -- and it was in our prepared remarks again today, is that part of our hypothesis in doing the deal is that we could take certain parts of the revenue base here and move it more and more towards subscription and take some of the volatility out of it. And the origination line item is one in particular that we are doing that with. And we've only done that with a very small percentage of the customer base. The average client is a customer and is under contract for 4 to 5 years. And we just started this year with a small percentage of the client base. We've had a great pickup in customers being open to moving more towards subscription. So I see we have a long runway of that. 
The other thing that's going on in that origination line is we're continuing to add more customers. We're gaining more market share. And as we implement those customers, those are new loans that are running through our system, and we are getting some transaction volume that we never saw before that's offsetting some of the headwinds that you'd see in that transaction environment. 
The second line item, data and analytics, it's the exact same story. We're taking a business -- so this is the automation of the underwrite process through our AI tools. This is a business that was almost 100% transaction. Under the covers, we've been moving it more and more towards subscription. We're going to continue to do so, and we're having incredible success cross-selling this to clients. 
It does take a little bit longer to implement customers on this solution because you're automating and deeply embedding your solutions into a very complicated workflow in each of these businesses as you're automating underwriting processes. But we have a number of customers that are going live on the platform that we've sold. We continue to have great sales success, and we have a number continuing to go through implementations. So that's continuing to grow and offset any transaction issues you see there. 
And then on the closing solution side, this is where I unpacked in the first question a lot of the new innovation that we have, a lot of the changes that we made. Simplifile continues to gain market share really versus paper. Our eClose solutions, our brand-new innovation that the industry hasn't seen before, and each time a customer is subscribing, so whether it's using our eClosing room, they're using our document set, they're using our eNote, they're using our vault, they can use either a component of those services or all of them. And each time they do that, we're getting incremental revenue on every transaction that's using that. And it's all greenfield. And there's very little competition in this space because of the unique position we've been in to build all this."

If I could just follow up actually on the past -- the last question just regarding the move to subscription on the origination side specifically. You said a small amount of those customers have migrated to subscription. Can you help quantify that? Is that sub-10% of the customers? Or any numbers around that? 
And can you just talk about the pricing structure? Because I thought the recurring revenues on the origination side previously were really just fee minimums on volumes. But it sounds like maybe this is a bit different in terms of fee structure. So can you just kind of go over that and what the strategy is in terms of migrating these customers?"

So it's a very small percentage of the customer base that we've been able to do this with. 
As you can imagine, now is a good time to actually be engaging with customers to make this transition towards subscription because we're in a high-volume environment. Customers are -- in this high-volume environment, they want to adopt more automation. They want to be able to continue to automate and be as efficient as possible against any other competition. So they're continuing to add on more and more of our services. 
So when we go in and engage clients in this negotiation, we are willing to forgo some transaction revenue. But we're not foregoing all of it. We're just making it very open in our algorithm around, hey, if we're going to shift some to subscription, we are willing to give up some transaction, which is mostly the success fees on those transactions that we get.  
But we also remember the other transaction element that we do get is on our network. So any time a loan is coming on to our network and ordering services from third parties for the automation that we're providing there, we're collecting a fee for providing that benefit along those rails, and that fee will continue as it is today."

So we have a long runway to do this and continue to feed more subscription revenue growth over time. 
In terms of are we taking away some of the upside, well, the way I see it is we're taking away some of the volatility in that line item. And where our upside is, is there's still a ton of new innovation that we're introducing to the marketplace between the eClose offerings that we have that we've launched, between the automation of the underwrite and all the analyzers that we've been talking about on prior calls that we've been introducing to the marketplace.

That was kind of our target to resume share buybacks that we set when we announced the Ellie Mae deal back in August of last year. And so we'll start about -- up to about $250 million this quarter. 
I think about that kind of being more of a partial buyback because we do still need to get to 3x eventually, and I think we're well on our way there. But -- so we'll do a bit of a balance paydown of debt alongside these repurchases over the next quarter or so. 
But I think once -- thinking about next year, nothing's really changed in terms of capital return philosophy. I mean it's the same -- it's going to be the same thing as pre-Ellie Mae where it's return all capital to shareholders that we don't need for investment or M&A to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. So I think you should expect us to be thinking about it that way. 
And the only thing really that has changed here is that we've continued to grow free cash flow organically and then, of course, added Ellie Mae, which, as you obviously heard today and in the last couple of quarters, seen that it's performing very well. So those would be the things that I'd be thinking about as you're kind of thinking about next year in capital return at the moment.

So when you look at our energy business, and we had talked about this on several calls, one of the things, I think, that's come to light through this is that we are very different than any of the peers that are out there in that we've developed very deep, liquid markets across the energy class spectrum. So whether it's coal, oil, gas, power, environmentals, we've invested heavily across that entire spectrum to give our customers the tools they need to manage what we saw as a secular trend more than a decade ago of people moving towards cleaner fossil fuels, such as natural gas, and towards environmental markets, carbon offset markets, compliance markets and the like. 
Made several acquisitions, Climate Exchange 10 years ago. We've been building out our global natural gas suite. And we have now a business that's substantially different than any of our peers'. We continue to invest, as we talked about in prior quarters, our oil business, which is doing extraordinarily well, with investments that we made in the launch of our Murban contract at ICE Futures Abu Dhabi. We have a new contract in the Gulf Coast that's launching in the beginning of next year in partnership with several big physical players. And we're in the middle of a Brent consultation where Midland WTI may be added into the Brent basket. So you have a whole bunch of dynamics going on across this, and it's because customers know they need to manage their risk through this transition. 
And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think the environment that you've just seen, you've got a peek into what it's going to be for a long, long time. This energy transition is going to be very volatile. Everyone sees the secular trend where investments are pouring into renewable projects, and projects such as coal are not getting invested in. 
And the fact is, any energy supply source, I don't care what it is, is susceptible to supply chain events, weather events, for example. If you have wind turbines and the wind is not blowing, it's not really easy to transition back to a coal-fired plant to get power back on the grid. 
So I foresee that we're in for a long ride of volatility. And now more than ever, the exchanges and the risk management tools that we provide are extraordinarily valuable to our clients, and it's important to us that we continue to engage with them as much as we ever have to continue to innovate."

And I think the one takeaway you should have is that, that has been an intentional evolution on behalf of the management team. We have been -- we started the company really being highly transaction oriented and have always wanted to have a bigger recurring, growing base that we can rely on. 
Part of our thinking of becoming an all-weather name is finding these analog-to-digital market conversions but also creating a portfolio of businesses that we operate that are durable in different environments. We really wanted to get into the mortgage space and really worked for over 10 years to put ourselves in that space because it benefits from a low interest rate environment, generally speaking. 
We have other businesses like our interest rate futures and, to a certain degree, inflation-oriented products like commodities that tend to do better in high interest rate environments. And so from a transaction standpoint, we wanted to be durable. We want to grow on top of growth and not be a name where people pile in when interest rates are going up and pile out when interest rates are going down. 
And so the more that we feel like we can lock into growing and recurring revenue, it gives investors a basis to know that we're going to continue to pay a dividend, that we're going to have capital to reinvest in the business. And then if we can have transaction businesses that, regardless of macro environment, can do well, it just feels like a company that an investor should own. 
And that has been the strategy that we've [ relayed ] here for how many years now, and it's finally coming to fruition. And the mortgage business, as Ben has mentioned, we've tasked our colleagues with let's try to really build a durable subscription underpinning to a business that also has really interesting transaction opportunities because of changes in technology. And the same thing in emissions and in liquefied natural gas. I know you and I have talked for years about our thesis that the natural gas market would globalize and that there would be global benchmarks, not regional benchmarks. 
And so a lot of these metrics that you see in your economic model have been incredibly intentional on our part over a long period of time. And it's great that in this quarter, as was mentioned earlier, everything came together at one time."

But in the absence of that, given that you're talking about a kind of like upsell, revenue upsell story, maybe you can at least help us how much your revenue per mortgage has been changing over the last year or 2. I mean, again, like if you're upselling, I guess, that revenue per mortgage should go up. So maybe some numbers you can put around that. 
And if you can decompose a little bit between pricing and certain new services, that would be very helpful, too. So hopefully, you can give us a little something here."

What I'll -- one area I can unpack here is when you dig into that, what's leading to our subscription growth. So that's one of the areas of our thesis, is that we could move more and more towards subscription in certain parts of the business. 
And if you look at the components of what's fueling that, one is the very deliberate, as customers are renewing, moving more and more towards subscription in the origination and the data and analytics line. That's one component. 
Second is new sales. And this is about market share gains. So we continue to have a lot of success in continuing to add new customers on to our platform or -- and cross-selling services to our existing clients is really the third. So in that cross-selling, the way to think about it, there's opportunities for us to expand the footprint with our clients, with the existing services that they have. We have clients that are using us on, for example, the loan origination side and the correspondent channel, moving to add the retail channel on to that, adding services like our Maven compliance service or our AllRegs offering. All of those are heavily subscription oriented, so we have a concerted effort to cross-sell. 
And then the fourth is price. And our algorithm when we did the deal and our hypothesis is that on the subscription revenue growth, which is a big component of what we think is required to really hit that 8% to 10% long-term guide, that over that long period of time, each of those elements, the renewals, new sales, cross-selling and price, it'll be pretty much an equal distribution across those 3 that you'll see over a long period of time is what's going to fuel that sustained subscription growth. So that's the area I'd highlight. 
On the transaction area, I mentioned a whole bunch of the new products that we're rolling out, which we believe has an opportunity to continue to grow transaction revenue as well and offset declines that you see in industry environments."

I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter results. 
Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.30, up 34% year-over-year, marking the best third quarter in our company's history. 
Net revenues totaled a record $1.8 billion and, on a pro forma basis, increased 11% versus last year, with all 3 of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth.  
Total transaction revenues grew 13%, while total recurring revenues, which accounted for nearly half of our business, increased by 10%. 
Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $755 million, including $35 million related to Bakkt, which, after successfully completing its merger with Victory Park, recently began trading on the NYSE. 
Adjusting for Bakkt, third quarter operating expenses would have been $720 million, in the middle of our guidance range, while operating -- or while our adjusted operating margin would have been 60%, up over 100 basis points year-over-year.  
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be between $737 million to $747 million. Relative to the full year outlook provided on our second quarter call, the fourth quarter is now expected to include approximately $10 million related to the Bakkt stub period and $10 million to $15 million of performance-related compensation as we expect to reward our employees for their contribution to the strong results we are once again on track to achieve in 2021.  
Record year-to-date free cash flow has totaled nearly $2 billion. These strong cash flows, along with the divestment of our $1.2 billion stake in Coinbase, has enabled us to reduce leverage to under 3.25x at the end of September, nearly a full year ahead of schedule. As a result, we expect to resume share repurchases, including up to $250 million in this year's fourth quarter. We anticipate updating you on our 2022 capital return plans early next year. In addition, we announced in October that we have agreed to sell our stake in Euroclear for EUR 709 million or approximately $820 million. We expect to determine the use of Euroclear proceeds as we approach closing, which we expect will be -- will occur in 2022.  
Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment.
Third quarter net revenues totaled $959 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by a 30% increase in our interest rate business and a 38% increase in our energy revenues, including 34% increase in our oil complex, a 73% increase in European natural gas revenues and a 72% increase in revenues related to global environmental products. Importantly, total open interest, which we believe to be the best indicator of long-term growth, is up 18% versus the end of last year, including 11% growth in energy and 28% growth across our financial futures and options complex.  
Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and NYSE listings, increased 6% year-over-year, including 10% growth in our listings business. This acceleration in growth was driven by an increasing number of operating company IPOs choosing the NYSE, particularly in the technology and consumer sectors. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect recurring revenues in our Exchange segment to be between $330 million and $335 million.  
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. 
Third quarter revenues totaled $477 million, a 6% increase versus a year ago. Recurring revenue growth, which accounted for nearly 90% of segment revenues, also grew 6% in the quarter. Within recurring revenues, our fixed income, data and analytics business increased by 5% year-over-year, including another double-digit growth in our index franchise, while other data and network services grew 9% driven by continued customer demand for additional network capacity.  
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect that our recurring revenues will improve sequentially to a range of $415 million to $420 million and that full year revenue growth will be approximately 6%, at the high end of our guidance range.  
Let's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. 
Despite a double-digit decline in industry origination volumes, our Mortgage Technology business grew 7% year-over-year and achieved record revenues of $366 million. While third quarter transaction revenues declined slightly, they were more than offset by a 33% growth in our recurring revenues, which, at $143 million, once again exceeded the high end of our guidance range and accounted for nearly 40% of total segment revenues. 
Our outperformance relative to industry trends continues to be driven by increased customer adoption of digital tools across the workflow.  While these secular growth trends have been a clear tailwind for our recurring revenues, there is also opportunity to drive accelerating adoption across our transaction-based businesses such as our closing solutions, where revenue increased by 30% in the third quarter. 
Looking to the fourth quarter guidance, we expect that recurring revenues will once again grow sequentially and be in a range of $147 million to $152 million. At the midpoint, this represents growth of approximately 25% year-over-year, which is on top of 20% growth achieved in last year's third quarter.  
In summary, we once again had strong contributions from each of our businesses and across the asset classes in which we operate. We delivered double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We also generated strong cash flows, reduced leverage to under 3.25x, announced the divestment of our stake in Euroclear and successfully took back public on the NYSE. As we look to the end of the year into 2022, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers, continuing to drive growth and create value for our shareholders.  
I'll now turn the call over to Ben."

Please turn to Slide 8. 
Our strong third quarter results were driven in part by interest rate volatility, global energy supply shortages and the continued adoption of our mortgage technology even amidst a decline in origination volumes. But more importantly, underpinning that performance are long-term secular tailwinds that will continue to drive growth across asset classes and macroeconomic environments. And with data and technology at our core, we have strategically positioned the business to benefit from these tailwinds across our platform.  
In energy, the globalization of natural gas and the evolution to cleaner energy are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. And today, cleaner energy sources, including global natural gas and environmentals, make up approximately 40% of our energy revenues and have grown 12% on average over the past 5 years. 
With the rise of LNG, natural gas markets are becoming more global in nature. In our European gas benchmark, TTF is emerging as the global gas benchmark. Revenues in our TTF markets have grown 38% on average over the last 5 years, including 84% growth in the third quarter.  
The supply shortages and price volatility that we saw in the third quarter are a peek into the future of what the energy transition could look like. Energy consumption is expected to double over the next 30 years, yet carbon emissions are expected to be reduced by half. This imbalance in supply and demand will introduce additional complexity and volatility to energy markets, which will drive greater demand for our risk management. Our global environmental markets, alongside our global oil, gas and power markets, provide the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum that will enable participants to navigate this evolution.  
Complementary addition to the risk management that our technology provides is our growing suite of associated data products. Leveraging our leading environmental markets, we built a suite of carbon indices which allow global investors to access market-based carbon prices through a single investment instrument. And today, there are a growing number of ETFs benchmarking to our carbon indices and environmental markets.  
Turning now to fixed income. The electronification of fixed income is a data-driven trend. We recognized this in 2015 when we acquired IDC and continue to invest and innovate in data and technology to further enable this trend. Our leading evaluated prices provide critical price transparency for nearly 3 million securities daily. By combining our proprietary pricing data with our comprehensive reference data, we've built innovative tools and analytics that will facilitate the continued electronification and automation of the fixed income markets. Solutions like our continuous evaluated pricing, best execution and liquidity indicators, for example, provide pre-trade transparency needed to determine fair value.  
We also see the electronification of fixed income within the ETF ecosystem. Our quality pricing and reference data, combined with 4 years of history, serves as the foundation of our growing index business. We not only offer benchmark indices but also calculation services, analytics and unique solutions like our custom indices. By servicing the entire ETF ecosystem through data and technology, we've been able to grow our index business double digits for the past 4 years.  
And finally, turning to our mortgage business. In the third quarter, we were once again able to grow our revenues even with industry volumes down double digits. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog-to-digital conversion happening in the industry. Part of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our origination technology and data and analytics business. While we only recently began this transition, we've already seen strong client adoption.  
Another opportunity that we're executing on today is in our closing solutions. The demand for automation in the closing of a real estate transaction is increasing. We see this evidenced by the continued onboarding of new customers to our electronic closing room and hybrid solution that we launched in the second quarter. 
This month, we further advanced the automation of our eClose solution, which can save lenders hundreds of dollars per loan by leveraging additional technology and automation by adding eNote and eVault. Our comprehensive offering and the efficiencies that it delivers positions us well to execute on what we believe to be a $1 billion opportunity.  
Within data and analytics, our AIQ solution leverages AI, machine learning and proprietary data from our origination platform to automate the steps in the loan manufacturing process. This automation could save lenders thousands of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity. Today, only a fraction of Mortgage Technology customers take our AIQ solution, and we continue to have strong sales success cross-selling to existing customers even if they're not on our loan origination system, including one of the largest depositories in the U.S. And while still an early opportunity at under $100 million in revenue today, the efficiencies that our data analytics provide position us well to continue executing against what we think is a $4 billion opportunity.  
Flywheel effect that our leading technology and data provides, combined with the cross-sell that our broad connectivity offers, generates an array of opportunities for us to grow a business that at $1.4 billion today is only a fraction of the $10 billion opportunity.  
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

Please turn to Slide 9. 
The third quarter extends our track record of growth. We once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share with strong growth from all business segments, across asset classes and amidst a dynamic macro environment. These results are a testament to the strength of our business model, positioning the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog-to-digital conversion and which together make ICE an all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth.  
The diversity of our platform positions us to benefit not only from near-term cyclical events but also longer-term secular growth trends. We've expanded into new asset classes, grown our addressable markets and broadened our expertise, making our network significant and providing the opportunity to unlock additional growth by collaborating across businesses. 
We recently announced another new product from the collaboration between ICE Data Services and ICE Mortgage Technology called the ICE Rate Lock Indices. Leveraging anonymized and aggregated data from ICE Mortgage Technology's leading origination platform, this suite of indices provides a more comprehensive, accurate and timely reflection of residential mortgage rates. Building on this innovation, like we've done in other asset classes, these indices provide an opportunity to create additional products like rich analytics and better pricing tools for lenders. 
The opportunity to turn raw, unstructured data into actionable insights abounds across our business. By taking alternative datasets and marrying them with our proprietary data, we've built solutions that offer unique insights into the market.  
Our climate analytics, for example, leverage our strength in the fixed income market with third-party geospatial data to help market participants better manage climate risk as a part of their overall investing and risk management processes. As ESG is increasingly becoming a component of investment portfolios, our technology and data expertise positions us well to deliver solutions that meet these evolving customer needs.  
We have strategically assembled a portfolio to drive growth across asset classes and macro environments. And part of this strategy is capturing value by thoughtfully repositioning businesses. This year alone, we harvested our gain in Coinbase, announced an agreement to do the same with our stake in Euroclear and unlocked Bakkt via our New York Stock Exchange listing. These transactions expose billions of dollars in value creation and position us well to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest for our future growth. It's collaborative efforts, innovative solutions and strategic capital allocation like this that have driven our growth for the past 20 years and which lay the foundation for continued growth well into the future.  
Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in the quarter. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to the best third quarter in our company's history, topped only by our record quarter earlier this year.  
I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Danae, to conduct a question-and-answer session, which will run until 9:30 Eastern Time."

And in summary, when -- it's part of the thesis we had in doing the overall deal, is that we saw a long-term secular trend here for people to want to automate and digitize the mortgage process and continue to work on condensing the amount of time it takes to close on a real estate transaction.  
And if you look under the covers of that closing solutions business, this is a business that's going to be very transaction oriented. A lot of the costs associated to it actually go on the actual closing statement of the client themselves. So you're going to see that this is one of the businesses that's going to be heavily transaction oriented. 
And if you look at the components underneath it, they're really driving the growth. First part goes back to an acquisition we did a number of years ago, which is the Simplifile business. This is a business that electronic -- does the electronic recording at the county of all the closing documents associated to a real estate transaction.  
In this COVID environment, we saw a year ago the number of documents that were being recorded in the counties moving more and more away from paper and towards digitization and using our rails to do so, and we continue to see that. So Simplifile is an input into that growth.  
The second component there is a business that we've talked about many times, which is a business called MERS. We have a new bundled service offering there that takes a number of bespoke services that we had within MERS. So the registration of the loan itself, the registration of an eNote, which we continue to see eNotes being adopted more and more through the industry, as well as lifetime servicing transfers all being -- we bundled that all into one complete offering for our clients.  
And then the third area that we've talked about on prior calls is the launch of eClose, which was really enabled by the combination of the expertise we have with MERS, Simplifile and the Ellie Mae business. And we combined that origination network that Ellie Mae has with the settlement agent network that the Simplifile business has. 
We've launched our eClose offering in the second quarter. We've enhanced that offering with our own proprietary e-signing capabilities in the third quarter. And then just this month, we launched our own proprietary eNote as part of our loan origination document set, as well as eVault. And we're continuing to see customers adopt those solutions. I mentioned on the last call we had 55 customers going through implementation. We now have 76 that are adopting it. 
And as that continues to ramp, I see that as another area that's going to continue to fuel growth in the closing line item, which is really enabling us to take a business that 12 months ago was a $200 million business to now, if you look at the trailing 12 months, it's a $300 million business, continuing to go after that $1 billion TAM that we outlined."

Well, first of all, and I think we'd like to position ourselves where there are analog-to-digital conversions, and there's an analog-to-digital conversion going on in the wallet. When I was a kid, I had a -- I carried around a leather wallet in my pocket, and children today may never own a leather wallet. And so that analog-to-digital conversion is something that we wanted to be a part of. 
I think we decided to create Bakkt as a separate brand and a separate entity because a lot of our investors seem to not see the coalescence of institutional and retail coming together. As access has increased through digital tools, you can see it in the U.S. equity markets, there's less distinction between a retail order and an institutional order, for example. And so that same convergence is happening across all businesses. 
And we were a little bit concerned that our investor base wouldn't appreciate that we could both be an institutional network provider and also a retail network provider. And so we decided to give the company a separate brand. And it was -- we just didn't feel like it was being appreciated inside of ICE, and so we decided to give it a separate capital structure on the New York Stock Exchange.  
Other than that, Bakkt will be doing its own earnings calls now as a public company. I'm no longer on the Board, and so I don't want to ever speak for the company going forward. But I will tell you that we do believe there's value creation in analog-to-digital conversions, and we're trying to place value there around the business. And that's part of why I see us as being an all-weather name that can grow on top of growth.  
We're locked up in the company as part of the IPO. We actually invested additionally as part of the spin. And so we're very, very high on that company and want to give it every opportunity to demonstrate its value to the market."

I'll try to go through some of the components of what we saw that drove that growth. 
And as we highlighted, the business grew double digits year-over-year -- or, sorry, so the business grew 7% year-over-year and with the backdrop of a decline in industry volumes being double digits. We also grew the business 8% sequentially, if you look at it from second quarter to third quarter, against a volume environment that industry estimates would have down double digits as well. And if you look at each of the line items of what's happening there, you'll see that we outperformed not only in the aggregate but also in each line item, what that transaction -- what that overall transaction environment was.  
In the origination line item, what you see there that I outlined in the last quarter is that -- and it was in our prepared remarks again today, is that part of our hypothesis in doing the deal is that we could take certain parts of the revenue base here and move it more and more towards subscription and take some of the volatility out of it. And the origination line item is one in particular that we are doing that with. And we've only done that with a very small percentage of the customer base. The average client is a customer and is under contract for 4 to 5 years. And we just started this year with a small percentage of the client base. We've had a great pickup in customers being open to moving more towards subscription. So I see we have a long runway of that. 
The other thing that's going on in that origination line is we're continuing to add more customers. We're gaining more market share. And as we implement those customers, those are new loans that are running through our system, and we are getting some transaction volume that we never saw before that's offsetting some of the headwinds that you'd see in that transaction environment. 
The second line item, data and analytics, it's the exact same story. We're taking a business -- so this is the automation of the underwrite process through our AI tools. This is a business that was almost 100% transaction. Under the covers, we've been moving it more and more towards subscription. We're going to continue to do so, and we're having incredible success cross-selling this to clients. 
It does take a little bit longer to implement customers on this solution because you're automating and deeply embedding your solutions into a very complicated workflow in each of these businesses as you're automating underwriting processes. But we have a number of customers that are going live on the platform that we've sold. We continue to have great sales success, and we have a number continuing to go through implementations. So that's continuing to grow and offset any transaction issues you see there. 
And then on the closing solution side, this is where I unpacked in the first question a lot of the new innovation that we have, a lot of the changes that we made. Simplifile continues to gain market share really versus paper. Our eClose solutions, our brand-new innovation that the industry hasn't seen before, and each time a customer is subscribing, so whether it's using our eClosing room, they're using our document set, they're using our eNote, they're using our vault, they can use either a component of those services or all of them. And each time they do that, we're getting incremental revenue on every transaction that's using that. And it's all greenfield. And there's very little competition in this space because of the unique position we've been in to build all this."

And can you just talk about the pricing structure? Because I thought the recurring revenues on the origination side previously were really just fee minimums on volumes. But it sounds like maybe this is a bit different in terms of fee structure. So can you just kind of go over that and what the strategy is in terms of migrating these customers?"

So it's a very small percentage of the customer base that we've been able to do this with. 
As you can imagine, now is a good time to actually be engaging with customers to make this transition towards subscription because we're in a high-volume environment. Customers are -- in this high-volume environment, they want to adopt more automation. They want to be able to continue to automate and be as efficient as possible against any other competition. So they're continuing to add on more and more of our services. 
So when we go in and engage clients in this negotiation, we are willing to forgo some transaction revenue. But we're not foregoing all of it. We're just making it very open in our algorithm around, hey, if we're going to shift some to subscription, we are willing to give up some transaction, which is mostly the success fees on those transactions that we get.  
But we also remember the other transaction element that we do get is on our network. So any time a loan is coming on to our network and ordering services from third parties for the automation that we're providing there, we're collecting a fee for providing that benefit along those rails, and that fee will continue as it is today."

So we have a long runway to do this and continue to feed more subscription revenue growth over time. 
In terms of are we taking away some of the upside, well, the way I see it is we're taking away some of the volatility in that line item. And where our upside is, is there's still a ton of new innovation that we're introducing to the marketplace between the eClose offerings that we have that we've launched, between the automation of the underwrite and all the analyzers that we've been talking about on prior calls that we've been introducing to the marketplace. This is all brand-new innovation that is going to continue to drive transaction revenue growth in parallel to reducing the volatility and risk in some of the line items that we have like origination and data analytics."

I think about that kind of being more of a partial buyback because we do still need to get to 3x eventually, and I think we're well on our way there. But -- so we'll do a bit of a balance paydown of debt alongside these repurchases over the next quarter or so. 
But I think once -- thinking about next year, nothing's really changed in terms of capital return philosophy. I mean it's the same -- it's going to be the same thing as pre-Ellie Mae where it's return all capital to shareholders that we don't need for investment or M&A to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. So I think you should expect us to be thinking about it that way. 
And the only thing really that has changed here is that we've continued to grow free cash flow organically and then, of course, added Ellie Mae, which, as you obviously heard today and in the last couple of quarters, seen that it's performing very well. So those would be the things that I'd be thinking about as you're kind of thinking about next year in capital return at the moment.

So when you look at our energy business, and we had talked about this on several calls, one of the things, I think, that's come to light through this is that we are very different than any of the peers that are out there in that we've developed very deep, liquid markets across the energy class spectrum. So whether it's coal, oil, gas, power, environmentals, we've invested heavily across that entire spectrum to give our customers the tools they need to manage what we saw as a secular trend more than a decade ago of people moving towards cleaner fossil fuels, such as natural gas, and towards environmental markets, carbon offset markets, compliance markets and the like. 
Made several acquisitions, Climate Exchange 10 years ago. We've been building out our global natural gas suite. And we have now a business that's substantially different than any of our peers'. We continue to invest, as we talked about in prior quarters, our oil business, which is doing extraordinarily well, with investments that we made in the launch of our Murban contract at ICE Futures Abu Dhabi. We have a new contract in the Gulf Coast that's launching in the beginning of next year in partnership with several big physical players. And we're in the middle of a Brent consultation where Midland WTI may be added into the Brent basket. So you have a whole bunch of dynamics going on across this, and it's because customers know they need to manage their risk through this transition. 
And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think the environment that you've just seen, you've got a peek into what it's going to be for a long, long time. This energy transition is going to be very volatile. Everyone sees the secular trend where investments are pouring into renewable projects, and projects such as coal are not getting invested in. 
And the fact is, any energy supply source, I don't care what it is, is susceptible to supply chain events, weather events, for example. If you have wind turbines and the wind is not blowing, it's not really easy to transition back to a coal-fired plant to get power back on the grid. 
So I foresee that we're in for a long ride of volatility. And now more than ever, the exchanges and the risk management tools that we provide are extraordinarily valuable to our clients, and it's important to us that we continue to engage with them as much as we ever have to continue to innovate."

And I think the one takeaway you should have is that, that has been an intentional evolution on behalf of the management team. We have been -- we started the company really being highly transaction oriented and have always wanted to have a bigger recurring, growing base that we can rely on. 
Part of our thinking of becoming an all-weather name is finding these analog-to-digital market conversions but also creating a portfolio of businesses that we operate that are durable in different environments. We really wanted to get into the mortgage space and really worked for over 10 years to put ourselves in that space because it benefits from a low interest rate environment, generally speaking. 
We have other businesses like our interest rate futures and, to a certain degree, inflation-oriented products like commodities that tend to do better in high interest rate environments. And so from a transaction standpoint, we wanted to be durable. We want to grow on top of growth and not be a name where people pile in when interest rates are going up and pile out when interest rates are going down. 
And so the more that we feel like we can lock into growing and recurring revenue, it gives investors a basis to know that we're going to continue to pay a dividend, that we're going to have capital to reinvest in the business. And then if we can have transaction businesses that, regardless of macro environment, can do well, it just feels like a company that an investor should own. 
And that has been the strategy that we've [ relayed ] here for how many years now, and it's finally coming to fruition. And the mortgage business, as Ben has mentioned, we've tasked our colleagues with let's try to really build a durable subscription underpinning to a business that also has really interesting transaction opportunities because of changes in technology. And the same thing in emissions and in liquefied natural gas. I know you and I have talked for years about our thesis that the natural gas market would globalize and that there would be global benchmarks, not regional benchmarks. 
And so a lot of these metrics that you see in your economic model have been incredibly intentional on our part over a long period of time. And it's great that in this quarter, as was mentioned earlier, everything came together at one time."

What I'll -- one area I can unpack here is when you dig into that, what's leading to our subscription growth. So that's one of the areas of our thesis, is that we could move more and more towards subscription in certain parts of the business. 
And if you look at the components of what's fueling that, one is the very deliberate, as customers are renewing, moving more and more towards subscription in the origination and the data and analytics line. That's one component. 
Second is new sales. And this is about market share gains. So we continue to have a lot of success in continuing to add new customers on to our platform or -- and cross-selling services to our existing clients is really the third. So in that cross-selling, the way to think about it, there's opportunities for us to expand the footprint with our clients, with the existing services that they have. We have clients that are using us on, for example, the loan origination side and the correspondent channel, moving to add the retail channel on to that, adding services like our Maven compliance service or our AllRegs offering. All of those are heavily subscription oriented, so we have a concerted effort to cross-sell. 
And then the fourth is price. And our algorithm when we did the deal and our hypothesis is that on the subscription revenue growth, which is a big component of what we think is required to really hit that 8% to 10% long-term guide, that over that long period of time, each of those elements, the renewals, new sales, cross-selling and price, it'll be pretty much an equal distribution across those 3 that you'll see over a long period of time is what's going to fuel that sustained subscription growth. So that's the area I'd highlight. 
On the transaction area, I mentioned a whole bunch of the new products that we're rolling out, which we believe has an opportunity to continue to grow transaction revenue as well and offset declines that you see in industry environments."

I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter results. 
Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.30, up 34% year-over-year, marking the best third quarter in our company's history. 
Net revenues totaled a record $1.8 billion and, on a pro forma basis, increased 11% versus last year, with all 3 of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth.  
Total transaction revenues grew 13%, while total recurring revenues, which accounted for nearly half of our business, increased by 10%. 
Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $755 million, including $35 million related to Bakkt, which, after successfully completing its merger with Victory Park, recently began trading on the NYSE. 
Adjusting for Bakkt, third quarter operating expenses would have been $720 million, in the middle of our guidance range, while operating -- or while our adjusted operating margin would have been 60%, up over 100 basis points year-over-year.  
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be between $737 million to $747 million. Relative to the full year outlook provided on our second quarter call, the fourth quarter is now expected to include approximately $10 million related to the Bakkt stub period and $10 million to $15 million of performance-related compensation as we expect to reward our employees for their contribution to the strong results we are once again on track to achieve in 2021.  
Record year-to-date free cash flow has totaled nearly $2 billion. These strong cash flows, along with the divestment of our $1.2 billion stake in Coinbase, has enabled us to reduce leverage to under 3.25x at the end of September, nearly a full year ahead of schedule. As a result, we expect to resume share repurchases, including up to $250 million in this year's fourth quarter. We anticipate updating you on our 2022 capital return plans early next year. In addition, we announced in October that we have agreed to sell our stake in Euroclear for EUR 709 million or approximately $820 million. We expect to determine the use of Euroclear proceeds as we approach closing, which we expect will be -- will occur in 2022.  
Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment.
Third quarter net revenues totaled $959 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by a 30% increase in our interest rate business and a 38% increase in our energy revenues, including 34% increase in our oil complex, a 73% increase in European natural gas revenues and a 72% increase in revenues related to global environmental products. Importantly, total open interest, which we believe to be the best indicator of long-term growth, is up 18% versus the end of last year, including 11% growth in energy and 28% growth across our financial futures and options complex.  
Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and NYSE listings, increased 6% year-over-year, including 10% growth in our listings business. This acceleration in growth was driven by an increasing number of operating company IPOs choosing the NYSE, particularly in the technology and consumer sectors. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect recurring revenues in our Exchange segment to be between $330 million and $335 million.  
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. 
Third quarter revenues totaled $477 million, a 6% increase versus a year ago. Recurring revenue growth, which accounted for nearly 90% of segment revenues, also grew 6% in the quarter. Within recurring revenues, our fixed income, data and analytics business increased by 5% year-over-year, including another double-digit growth in our index franchise, while other data and network services grew 9% driven by continued customer demand for additional network capacity.  
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect that our recurring revenues will improve sequentially to a range of $415 million to $420 million and that full year revenue growth will be approximately 6%, at the high end of our guidance range.  
Let's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. 
Despite a double-digit decline in industry origination volumes, our Mortgage Technology business grew 7% year-over-year and achieved record revenues of $366 million. While third quarter transaction revenues declined slightly, they were more than offset by a 33% growth in our recurring revenues, which, at $143 million, once again exceeded the high end of our guidance range and accounted for nearly 40% of total segment revenues. 
Our outperformance relative to industry trends continues to be driven by increased customer adoption of digital tools across the workflow.  While these secular growth trends have been a clear tailwind for our recurring revenues, there is also opportunity to drive accelerating adoption across our transaction-based businesses such as our closing solutions, where revenue increased by 30% in the third quarter. 
Looking to the fourth quarter guidance, we expect that recurring revenues will once again grow sequentially and be in a range of $147 million to $152 million. At the midpoint, this represents growth of approximately 25% year-over-year, which is on top of 20% growth achieved in last year's third quarter.  
In summary, we once again had strong contributions from each of our businesses and across the asset classes in which we operate. We delivered double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We also generated strong cash flows, reduced leverage to under 3.25x, announced the divestment of our stake in Euroclear and successfully took back public on the NYSE. As we look to the end of the year into 2022, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers, continuing to drive growth and create value for our shareholders.  
I'll now turn the call over to Ben."

Please turn to Slide 8. 
Our strong third quarter results were driven in part by interest rate volatility, global energy supply shortages and the continued adoption of our mortgage technology even amidst a decline in origination volumes. But more importantly, underpinning that performance are long-term secular tailwinds that will continue to drive growth across asset classes and macroeconomic environments. And with data and technology at our core, we have strategically positioned the business to benefit from these tailwinds across our platform.  
In energy, the globalization of natural gas and the evolution to cleaner energy are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. And today, cleaner energy sources, including global natural gas and environmentals, make up approximately 40% of our energy revenues and have grown 12% on average over the past 5 years. 
With the rise of LNG, natural gas markets are becoming more global in nature. In our European gas benchmark, TTF is emerging as the global gas benchmark. Revenues in our TTF markets have grown 38% on average over the last 5 years, including 84% growth in the third quarter.  
The supply shortages and price volatility that we saw in the third quarter are a peek into the future of what the energy transition could look like. Energy consumption is expected to double over the next 30 years, yet carbon emissions are expected to be reduced by half. This imbalance in supply and demand will introduce additional complexity and volatility to energy markets, which will drive greater demand for our risk management. Our global environmental markets, alongside our global oil, gas and power markets, provide the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum that will enable participants to navigate this evolution.  
Complementary addition to the risk management that our technology provides is our growing suite of associated data products. Leveraging our leading environmental markets, we built a suite of carbon indices which allow global investors to access market-based carbon prices through a single investment instrument. And today, there are a growing number of ETFs benchmarking to our carbon indices and environmental markets.  
Turning now to fixed income. The electronification of fixed income is a data-driven trend. We recognized this in 2015 when we acquired IDC and continue to invest and innovate in data and technology to further enable this trend. Our leading evaluated prices provide critical price transparency for nearly 3 million securities daily. By combining our proprietary pricing data with our comprehensive reference data, we've built innovative tools and analytics that will facilitate the continued electronification and automation of the fixed income markets. Solutions like our continuous evaluated pricing, best execution and liquidity indicators, for example, provide pre-trade transparency needed to determine fair value.  
We also see the electronification of fixed income within the ETF ecosystem. Our quality pricing and reference data, combined with 4 years of history, serves as the foundation of our growing index business. We not only offer benchmark indices but also calculation services, analytics and unique solutions like our custom indices. By servicing the entire ETF ecosystem through data and technology, we've been able to grow our index business double digits for the past 4 years.  
And finally, turning to our mortgage business. In the third quarter, we were once again able to grow our revenues even with industry volumes down double digits. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog-to-digital conversion happening in the industry. Part of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our origination technology and data and analytics business. While we only recently began this transition, we've already seen strong client adoption.  
Another opportunity that we're executing on today is in our closing solutions. The demand for automation in the closing of a real estate transaction is increasing. We see this evidenced by the continued onboarding of new customers to our electronic closing room and hybrid solution that we launched in the second quarter. 
This month, we further advanced the automation of our eClose solution, which can save lenders hundreds of dollars per loan by leveraging additional technology and automation by adding eNote and eVault. Our comprehensive offering and the efficiencies that it delivers positions us well to execute on what we believe to be a $1 billion opportunity.  
Within data and analytics, our AIQ solution leverages AI, machine learning and proprietary data from our origination platform to automate the steps in the loan manufacturing process. This automation could save lenders thousands of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity. Today, only a fraction of Mortgage Technology customers take our AIQ solution, and we continue to have strong sales success cross-selling to existing customers even if they're not on our loan origination system, including one of the largest depositories in the U.S. And while still an early opportunity at under $100 million in revenue today, the efficiencies that our data analytics provide position us well to continue executing against what we think is a $4 billion opportunity.  
Flywheel effect that our leading technology and data provides, combined with the cross-sell that our broad connectivity offers, generates an array of opportunities for us to grow a business that at $1.4 billion today is only a fraction of the $10 billion opportunity.  
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

Please turn to Slide 9. 
The third quarter extends our track record of growth. We once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share with strong growth from all business segments, across asset classes and amidst a dynamic macro environment. These results are a testament to the strength of our business model, positioning the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog-to-digital conversion and which together make ICE an all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth.  
The diversity of our platform positions us to benefit not only from near-term cyclical events but also longer-term secular growth trends. We've expanded into new asset classes, grown our addressable markets and broadened our expertise, making our network significant and providing the opportunity to unlock additional growth by collaborating across businesses. 
We recently announced another new product from the collaboration between ICE Data Services and ICE Mortgage Technology called the ICE Rate Lock Indices. Leveraging anonymized and aggregated data from ICE Mortgage Technology's leading origination platform, this suite of indices provides a more comprehensive, accurate and timely reflection of residential mortgage rates. Building on this innovation, like we've done in other asset classes, these indices provide an opportunity to create additional products like rich analytics and better pricing tools for lenders. 
The opportunity to turn raw, unstructured data into actionable insights abounds across our business. By taking alternative datasets and marrying them with our proprietary data, we've built solutions that offer unique insights into the market.  
Our climate analytics, for example, leverage our strength in the fixed income market with third-party geospatial data to help market participants better manage climate risk as a part of their overall investing and risk management processes. As ESG is increasingly becoming a component of investment portfolios, our technology and data expertise positions us well to deliver solutions that meet these evolving customer needs.  
We have strategically assembled a portfolio to drive growth across asset classes and macro environments. And part of this strategy is capturing value by thoughtfully repositioning businesses. This year alone, we harvested our gain in Coinbase, announced an agreement to do the same with our stake in Euroclear and unlocked Bakkt via our New York Stock Exchange listing. These transactions expose billions of dollars in value creation and position us well to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest for our future growth. It's collaborative efforts, innovative solutions and strategic capital allocation like this that have driven our growth for the past 20 years and which lay the foundation for continued growth well into the future.  
Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in the quarter. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to the best third quarter in our company's history, topped only by our record quarter earlier this year.  
I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Danae, to conduct a question-and-answer session, which will run until 9:30 Eastern Time."

And in summary, when -- it's part of the thesis we had in doing the overall deal, is that we saw a long-term secular trend here for people to want to automate and digitize the mortgage process and continue to work on condensing the amount of time it takes to close on a real estate transaction.  
And if you look under the covers of that closing solutions business, this is a business that's going to be very transaction oriented. A lot of the costs associated to it actually go on the actual closing statement of the client themselves. So you're going to see that this is one of the businesses that's going to be heavily transaction oriented. 
And if you look at the components underneath it, they're really driving the growth. First part goes back to an acquisition we did a number of years ago, which is the Simplifile business. This is a business that electronic -- does the electronic recording at the county of all the closing documents associated to a real estate transaction.  
In this COVID environment, we saw a year ago the number of documents that were being recorded in the counties moving more and more away from paper and towards digitization and using our rails to do so, and we continue to see that. So Simplifile is an input into that growth.  
The second component there is a business that we've talked about many times, which is a business called MERS. We have a new bundled service offering there that takes a number of bespoke services that we had within MERS. So the registration of the loan itself, the registration of an eNote, which we continue to see eNotes being adopted more and more through the industry, as well as lifetime servicing transfers all being -- we bundled that all into one complete offering for our clients.  
And then the third area that we've talked about on prior calls is the launch of eClose, which was really enabled by the combination of the expertise we have with MERS, Simplifile and the Ellie Mae business. And we combined that origination network that Ellie Mae has with the settlement agent network that the Simplifile business has. 
We've launched our eClose offering in the second quarter. We've enhanced that offering with our own proprietary e-signing capabilities in the third quarter. And then just this month, we launched our own proprietary eNote as part of our loan origination document set, as well as eVault. And we're continuing to see customers adopt those solutions. I mentioned on the last call we had 55 customers going through implementation. We now have 76 that are adopting it. 
And as that continues to ramp, I see that as another area that's going to continue to fuel growth in the closing line item, which is really enabling us to take a business that 12 months ago was a $200 million business to now, if you look at the trailing 12 months, it's a $300 million business, continuing to go after that $1 billion TAM that we outlined."

When I was a kid, I had a -- I carried around a leather wallet in my pocket, and children today may never own a leather wallet. And so that analog-to-digital conversion is something that we wanted to be a part of. 
I think we decided to create Bakkt as a separate brand and a separate entity because a lot of our investors seem to not see the coalescence of institutional and retail coming together. As access has increased through digital tools, you can see it in the U.S. equity markets, there's less distinction between a retail order and an institutional order, for example. And so that same convergence is happening across all businesses. 
And we were a little bit concerned that our investor base wouldn't appreciate that we could both be an institutional network provider and also a retail network provider. And so we decided to give the company a separate brand. And it was -- we just didn't feel like it was being appreciated inside of ICE, and so we decided to give it a separate capital structure on the New York Stock Exchange.  
Other than that, Bakkt will be doing its own earnings calls now as a public company. I'm no longer on the Board, and so I don't want to ever speak for the company going forward. But I will tell you that we do believe there's value creation in analog-to-digital conversions, and we're trying to place value there around the business. And that's part of why I see us as being an all-weather name that can grow on top of growth.  
We're locked up in the company as part of the IPO. We actually invested additionally as part of the spin. And so we're very, very high on that company and want to give it every opportunity to demonstrate its value to the market."

I'll try to go through some of the components of what we saw that drove that growth. 
And as we highlighted, the business grew double digits year-over-year -- or, sorry, so the business grew 7% year-over-year and with the backdrop of a decline in industry volumes being double digits. We also grew the business 8% sequentially, if you look at it from second quarter to third quarter, against a volume environment that industry estimates would have down double digits as well. And if you look at each of the line items of what's happening there, you'll see that we outperformed not only in the aggregate but also in each line item, what that transaction -- what that overall transaction environment was.  
In the origination line item, what you see there that I outlined in the last quarter is that -- and it was in our prepared remarks again today, is that part of our hypothesis in doing the deal is that we could take certain parts of the revenue base here and move it more and more towards subscription and take some of the volatility out of it. And the origination line item is one in particular that we are doing that with. And we've only done that with a very small percentage of the customer base. The average client is a customer and is under contract for 4 to 5 years. And we just started this year with a small percentage of the client base. We've had a great pickup in customers being open to moving more towards subscription. So I see we have a long runway of that. 
The other thing that's going on in that origination line is we're continuing to add more customers. We're gaining more market share. And as we implement those customers, those are new loans that are running through our system, and we are getting some transaction volume that we never saw before that's offsetting some of the headwinds that you'd see in that transaction environment. 
The second line item, data and analytics, it's the exact same story. We're taking a business -- so this is the automation of the underwrite process through our AI tools. This is a business that was almost 100% transaction. Under the covers, we've been moving it more and more towards subscription. We're going to continue to do so, and we're having incredible success cross-selling this to clients. 
It does take a little bit longer to implement customers on this solution because you're automating and deeply embedding your solutions into a very complicated workflow in each of these businesses as you're automating underwriting processes. But we have a number of customers that are going live on the platform that we've sold. We continue to have great sales success, and we have a number continuing to go through implementations. So that's continuing to grow and offset any transaction issues you see there. 
And then on the closing solution side, this is where I unpacked in the first question a lot of the new innovation that we have, a lot of the changes that we made. Simplifile continues to gain market share really versus paper. Our eClose solutions, our brand-new innovation that the industry hasn't seen before, and each time a customer is subscribing, so whether it's using our eClosing room, they're using our document set, they're using our eNote, they're using our vault, they can use either a component of those services or all of them. And each time they do that, we're getting incremental revenue on every transaction that's using that. And it's all greenfield. And there's very little competition in this space because of the unique position we've been in to build all this."

You said a small amount of those customers have migrated to subscription. Can you help quantify that? Is that sub-10% of the customers? Or any numbers around that? 
And can you just talk about the pricing structure? Because I thought the recurring revenues on the origination side previously were really just fee minimums on volumes.

So it's a very small percentage of the customer base that we've been able to do this with. 
As you can imagine, now is a good time to actually be engaging with customers to make this transition towards subscription because we're in a high-volume environment. Customers are -- in this high-volume environment, they want to adopt more automation. They want to be able to continue to automate and be as efficient as possible against any other competition. So they're continuing to add on more and more of our services. 
So when we go in and engage clients in this negotiation, we are willing to forgo some transaction revenue. But we're not foregoing all of it. We're just making it very open in our algorithm around, hey, if we're going to shift some to subscription, we are willing to give up some transaction, which is mostly the success fees on those transactions that we get.  
But we also remember the other transaction element that we do get is on our network. So any time a loan is coming on to our network and ordering services from third parties for the automation that we're providing there, we're collecting a fee for providing that benefit along those rails, and that fee will continue as it is today."

So we have a long runway to do this and continue to feed more subscription revenue growth over time. 
In terms of are we taking away some of the upside, well, the way I see it is we're taking away some of the volatility in that line item. And where our upside is, is there's still a ton of new innovation that we're introducing to the marketplace between the eClose offerings that we have that we've launched, between the automation of the underwrite and all the analyzers that we've been talking about on prior calls that we've been introducing to the marketplace. This is all brand-new innovation that is going to continue to drive transaction revenue growth in parallel to reducing the volatility and risk in some of the line items that we have like origination and data analytics."

That was kind of our target to resume share buybacks that we set when we announced the Ellie Mae deal back in August of last year. And so we'll start about -- up to about $250 million this quarter. 
I think about that kind of being more of a partial buyback because we do still need to get to 3x eventually, and I think we're well on our way there. But -- so we'll do a bit of a balance paydown of debt alongside these repurchases over the next quarter or so. 
But I think once -- thinking about next year, nothing's really changed in terms of capital return philosophy. I mean it's the same -- it's going to be the same thing as pre-Ellie Mae where it's return all capital to shareholders that we don't need for investment or M&A to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. So I think you should expect us to be thinking about it that way. 
And the only thing really that has changed here is that we've continued to grow free cash flow organically and then, of course, added Ellie Mae, which, as you obviously heard today and in the last couple of quarters, seen that it's performing very well. So those would be the things that I'd be thinking about as you're kind of thinking about next year in capital return at the moment. 
Right now, we're kind of going through the 2022 budget process. So as we start to refine that, we'll be able to kind of give you guys a bit of an update in the next couple of quarters. So..."

So when you look at our energy business, and we had talked about this on several calls, one of the things, I think, that's come to light through this is that we are very different than any of the peers that are out there in that we've developed very deep, liquid markets across the energy class spectrum. So whether it's coal, oil, gas, power, environmentals, we've invested heavily across that entire spectrum to give our customers the tools they need to manage what we saw as a secular trend more than a decade ago of people moving towards cleaner fossil fuels, such as natural gas, and towards environmental markets, carbon offset markets, compliance markets and the like. 
Made several acquisitions, Climate Exchange 10 years ago. We've been building out our global natural gas suite. And we have now a business that's substantially different than any of our peers'. We continue to invest, as we talked about in prior quarters, our oil business, which is doing extraordinarily well, with investments that we made in the launch of our Murban contract at ICE Futures Abu Dhabi. We have a new contract in the Gulf Coast that's launching in the beginning of next year in partnership with several big physical players. And we're in the middle of a Brent consultation where Midland WTI may be added into the Brent basket. So you have a whole bunch of dynamics going on across this, and it's because customers know they need to manage their risk through this transition. 
And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think the environment that you've just seen, you've got a peek into what it's going to be for a long, long time. This energy transition is going to be very volatile. Everyone sees the secular trend where investments are pouring into renewable projects, and projects such as coal are not getting invested in. 
And the fact is, any energy supply source, I don't care what it is, is susceptible to supply chain events, weather events, for example. If you have wind turbines and the wind is not blowing, it's not really easy to transition back to a coal-fired plant to get power back on the grid. 
So I foresee that we're in for a long ride of volatility. And now more than ever, the exchanges and the risk management tools that we provide are extraordinarily valuable to our clients, and it's important to us that we continue to engage with them as much as we ever have to continue to innovate."

And I think the one takeaway you should have is that, that has been an intentional evolution on behalf of the management team. We have been -- we started the company really being highly transaction oriented and have always wanted to have a bigger recurring, growing base that we can rely on. 
Part of our thinking of becoming an all-weather name is finding these analog-to-digital market conversions but also creating a portfolio of businesses that we operate that are durable in different environments. We really wanted to get into the mortgage space and really worked for over 10 years to put ourselves in that space because it benefits from a low interest rate environment, generally speaking. 
We have other businesses like our interest rate futures and, to a certain degree, inflation-oriented products like commodities that tend to do better in high interest rate environments. And so from a transaction standpoint, we wanted to be durable. We want to grow on top of growth and not be a name where people pile in when interest rates are going up and pile out when interest rates are going down. 
And so the more that we feel like we can lock into growing and recurring revenue, it gives investors a basis to know that we're going to continue to pay a dividend, that we're going to have capital to reinvest in the business. And then if we can have transaction businesses that, regardless of macro environment, can do well, it just feels like a company that an investor should own. 
And that has been the strategy that we've [ relayed ] here for how many years now, and it's finally coming to fruition. And the mortgage business, as Ben has mentioned, we've tasked our colleagues with let's try to really build a durable subscription underpinning to a business that also has really interesting transaction opportunities because of changes in technology. And the same thing in emissions and in liquefied natural gas. I know you and I have talked for years about our thesis that the natural gas market would globalize and that there would be global benchmarks, not regional benchmarks. 
And so a lot of these metrics that you see in your economic model have been incredibly intentional on our part over a long period of time. And it's great that in this quarter, as was mentioned earlier, everything came together at one time."

I mean, again, like if you're upselling, I guess, that revenue per mortgage should go up. So maybe some numbers you can put around that.

What I'll -- one area I can unpack here is when you dig into that, what's leading to our subscription growth. So that's one of the areas of our thesis, is that we could move more and more towards subscription in certain parts of the business. 
And if you look at the components of what's fueling that, one is the very deliberate, as customers are renewing, moving more and more towards subscription in the origination and the data and analytics line. That's one component. 
Second is new sales. And this is about market share gains. So we continue to have a lot of success in continuing to add new customers on to our platform or -- and cross-selling services to our existing clients is really the third. So in that cross-selling, the way to think about it, there's opportunities for us to expand the footprint with our clients, with the existing services that they have. We have clients that are using us on, for example, the loan origination side and the correspondent channel, moving to add the retail channel on to that, adding services like our Maven compliance service or our AllRegs offering. All of those are heavily subscription oriented, so we have a concerted effort to cross-sell. 
And then the fourth is price. And our algorithm when we did the deal and our hypothesis is that on the subscription revenue growth, which is a big component of what we think is required to really hit that 8% to 10% long-term guide, that over that long period of time, each of those elements, the renewals, new sales, cross-selling and price, it'll be pretty much an equal distribution across those 3 that you'll see over a long period of time is what's going to fuel that sustained subscription growth. So that's the area I'd highlight. 
On the transaction area, I mentioned a whole bunch of the new products that we're rolling out, which we believe has an opportunity to continue to grow transaction revenue as well and offset declines that you see in industry environments."

I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter results. 
Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.30, up 34% year-over-year, marking the best third quarter in our company's history. 
Net revenues totaled a record $1.8 billion and, on a pro forma basis, increased 11% versus last year, with all 3 of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth.  
Total transaction revenues grew 13%, while total recurring revenues, which accounted for nearly half of our business, increased by 10%. 
Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $755 million, including $35 million related to Bakkt, which, after successfully completing its merger with Victory Park, recently began trading on the NYSE. 
Adjusting for Bakkt, third quarter operating expenses would have been $720 million, in the middle of our guidance range, while operating -- or while our adjusted operating margin would have been 60%, up over 100 basis points year-over-year.  
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be between $737 million to $747 million. Relative to the full year outlook provided on our second quarter call, the fourth quarter is now expected to include approximately $10 million related to the Bakkt stub period and $10 million to $15 million of performance-related compensation as we expect to reward our employees for their contribution to the strong results we are once again on track to achieve in 2021.  
Record year-to-date free cash flow has totaled nearly $2 billion. These strong cash flows, along with the divestment of our $1.2 billion stake in Coinbase, has enabled us to reduce leverage to under 3.25x at the end of September, nearly a full year ahead of schedule. As a result, we expect to resume share repurchases, including up to $250 million in this year's fourth quarter. We anticipate updating you on our 2022 capital return plans early next year. In addition, we announced in October that we have agreed to sell our stake in Euroclear for EUR 709 million or approximately $820 million. We expect to determine the use of Euroclear proceeds as we approach closing, which we expect will be -- will occur in 2022.  
Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment.
Third quarter net revenues totaled $959 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by a 30% increase in our interest rate business and a 38% increase in our energy revenues, including 34% increase in our oil complex, a 73% increase in European natural gas revenues and a 72% increase in revenues related to global environmental products. Importantly, total open interest, which we believe to be the best indicator of long-term growth, is up 18% versus the end of last year, including 11% growth in energy and 28% growth across our financial futures and options complex.  
Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and NYSE listings, increased 6% year-over-year, including 10% growth in our listings business. This acceleration in growth was driven by an increasing number of operating company IPOs choosing the NYSE, particularly in the technology and consumer sectors. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect recurring revenues in our Exchange segment to be between $330 million and $335 million.  
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. 
Third quarter revenues totaled $477 million, a 6% increase versus a year ago. Recurring revenue growth, which accounted for nearly 90% of segment revenues, also grew 6% in the quarter. Within recurring revenues, our fixed income, data and analytics business increased by 5% year-over-year, including another double-digit growth in our index franchise, while other data and network services grew 9% driven by continued customer demand for additional network capacity.  
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect that our recurring revenues will improve sequentially to a range of $415 million to $420 million and that full year revenue growth will be approximately 6%, at the high end of our guidance range.  
Let's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. 
Despite a double-digit decline in industry origination volumes, our Mortgage Technology business grew 7% year-over-year and achieved record revenues of $366 million. While third quarter transaction revenues declined slightly, they were more than offset by a 33% growth in our recurring revenues, which, at $143 million, once again exceeded the high end of our guidance range and accounted for nearly 40% of total segment revenues. 
Our outperformance relative to industry trends continues to be driven by increased customer adoption of digital tools across the workflow.  While these secular growth trends have been a clear tailwind for our recurring revenues, there is also opportunity to drive accelerating adoption across our transaction-based businesses such as our closing solutions, where revenue increased by 30% in the third quarter. 
Looking to the fourth quarter guidance, we expect that recurring revenues will once again grow sequentially and be in a range of $147 million to $152 million. At the midpoint, this represents growth of approximately 25% year-over-year, which is on top of 20% growth achieved in last year's third quarter.  
In summary, we once again had strong contributions from each of our businesses and across the asset classes in which we operate. We delivered double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We also generated strong cash flows, reduced leverage to under 3.25x, announced the divestment of our stake in Euroclear and successfully took back public on the NYSE. As we look to the end of the year into 2022, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers, continuing to drive growth and create value for our shareholders.  
I'll now turn the call over to Ben."

Please turn to Slide 8. 
Our strong third quarter results were driven in part by interest rate volatility, global energy supply shortages and the continued adoption of our mortgage technology even amidst a decline in origination volumes. But more importantly, underpinning that performance are long-term secular tailwinds that will continue to drive growth across asset classes and macroeconomic environments. And with data and technology at our core, we have strategically positioned the business to benefit from these tailwinds across our platform.  
In energy, the globalization of natural gas and the evolution to cleaner energy are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. And today, cleaner energy sources, including global natural gas and environmentals, make up approximately 40% of our energy revenues and have grown 12% on average over the past 5 years. 
With the rise of LNG, natural gas markets are becoming more global in nature. In our European gas benchmark, TTF is emerging as the global gas benchmark. Revenues in our TTF markets have grown 38% on average over the last 5 years, including 84% growth in the third quarter.  
The supply shortages and price volatility that we saw in the third quarter are a peek into the future of what the energy transition could look like. Energy consumption is expected to double over the next 30 years, yet carbon emissions are expected to be reduced by half. This imbalance in supply and demand will introduce additional complexity and volatility to energy markets, which will drive greater demand for our risk management. Our global environmental markets, alongside our global oil, gas and power markets, provide the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum that will enable participants to navigate this evolution.  
Complementary addition to the risk management that our technology provides is our growing suite of associated data products. Leveraging our leading environmental markets, we built a suite of carbon indices which allow global investors to access market-based carbon prices through a single investment instrument. And today, there are a growing number of ETFs benchmarking to our carbon indices and environmental markets.  
Turning now to fixed income. The electronification of fixed income is a data-driven trend. We recognized this in 2015 when we acquired IDC and continue to invest and innovate in data and technology to further enable this trend. Our leading evaluated prices provide critical price transparency for nearly 3 million securities daily. By combining our proprietary pricing data with our comprehensive reference data, we've built innovative tools and analytics that will facilitate the continued electronification and automation of the fixed income markets. Solutions like our continuous evaluated pricing, best execution and liquidity indicators, for example, provide pre-trade transparency needed to determine fair value.  
We also see the electronification of fixed income within the ETF ecosystem. Our quality pricing and reference data, combined with 4 years of history, serves as the foundation of our growing index business. We not only offer benchmark indices but also calculation services, analytics and unique solutions like our custom indices. By servicing the entire ETF ecosystem through data and technology, we've been able to grow our index business double digits for the past 4 years.  
And finally, turning to our mortgage business. In the third quarter, we were once again able to grow our revenues even with industry volumes down double digits. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog-to-digital conversion happening in the industry. Part of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our origination technology and data and analytics business. While we only recently began this transition, we've already seen strong client adoption.  
Another opportunity that we're executing on today is in our closing solutions. The demand for automation in the closing of a real estate transaction is increasing. We see this evidenced by the continued onboarding of new customers to our electronic closing room and hybrid solution that we launched in the second quarter. 
This month, we further advanced the automation of our eClose solution, which can save lenders hundreds of dollars per loan by leveraging additional technology and automation by adding eNote and eVault. Our comprehensive offering and the efficiencies that it delivers positions us well to execute on what we believe to be a $1 billion opportunity.  
Within data and analytics, our AIQ solution leverages AI, machine learning and proprietary data from our origination platform to automate the steps in the loan manufacturing process. This automation could save lenders thousands of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity. Today, only a fraction of Mortgage Technology customers take our AIQ solution, and we continue to have strong sales success cross-selling to existing customers even if they're not on our loan origination system, including one of the largest depositories in the U.S. And while still an early opportunity at under $100 million in revenue today, the efficiencies that our data analytics provide position us well to continue executing against what we think is a $4 billion opportunity.  
Flywheel effect that our leading technology and data provides, combined with the cross-sell that our broad connectivity offers, generates an array of opportunities for us to grow a business that at $1.4 billion today is only a fraction of the $10 billion opportunity.  
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

Please turn to Slide 9. 
The third quarter extends our track record of growth. We once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share with strong growth from all business segments, across asset classes and amidst a dynamic macro environment. These results are a testament to the strength of our business model, positioning the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog-to-digital conversion and which together make ICE an all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth.  
The diversity of our platform positions us to benefit not only from near-term cyclical events but also longer-term secular growth trends. We've expanded into new asset classes, grown our addressable markets and broadened our expertise, making our network significant and providing the opportunity to unlock additional growth by collaborating across businesses. 
We recently announced another new product from the collaboration between ICE Data Services and ICE Mortgage Technology called the ICE Rate Lock Indices. Leveraging anonymized and aggregated data from ICE Mortgage Technology's leading origination platform, this suite of indices provides a more comprehensive, accurate and timely reflection of residential mortgage rates. Building on this innovation, like we've done in other asset classes, these indices provide an opportunity to create additional products like rich analytics and better pricing tools for lenders. 
The opportunity to turn raw, unstructured data into actionable insights abounds across our business. By taking alternative datasets and marrying them with our proprietary data, we've built solutions that offer unique insights into the market.  
Our climate analytics, for example, leverage our strength in the fixed income market with third-party geospatial data to help market participants better manage climate risk as a part of their overall investing and risk management processes. As ESG is increasingly becoming a component of investment portfolios, our technology and data expertise positions us well to deliver solutions that meet these evolving customer needs.  
We have strategically assembled a portfolio to drive growth across asset classes and macro environments. And part of this strategy is capturing value by thoughtfully repositioning businesses. This year alone, we harvested our gain in Coinbase, announced an agreement to do the same with our stake in Euroclear and unlocked Bakkt via our New York Stock Exchange listing. These transactions expose billions of dollars in value creation and position us well to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest for our future growth. It's collaborative efforts, innovative solutions and strategic capital allocation like this that have driven our growth for the past 20 years and which lay the foundation for continued growth well into the future.  
Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in the quarter. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to the best third quarter in our company's history, topped only by our record quarter earlier this year.  
I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Danae, to conduct a question-and-answer session, which will run until 9:30 Eastern Time."

And in summary, when -- it's part of the thesis we had in doing the overall deal, is that we saw a long-term secular trend here for people to want to automate and digitize the mortgage process and continue to work on condensing the amount of time it takes to close on a real estate transaction.  
And if you look under the covers of that closing solutions business, this is a business that's going to be very transaction oriented. A lot of the costs associated to it actually go on the actual closing statement of the client themselves. So you're going to see that this is one of the businesses that's going to be heavily transaction oriented. 
And if you look at the components underneath it, they're really driving the growth. First part goes back to an acquisition we did a number of years ago, which is the Simplifile business. This is a business that electronic -- does the electronic recording at the county of all the closing documents associated to a real estate transaction.  
In this COVID environment, we saw a year ago the number of documents that were being recorded in the counties moving more and more away from paper and towards digitization and using our rails to do so, and we continue to see that. So Simplifile is an input into that growth.  
The second component there is a business that we've talked about many times, which is a business called MERS. We have a new bundled service offering there that takes a number of bespoke services that we had within MERS. So the registration of the loan itself, the registration of an eNote, which we continue to see eNotes being adopted more and more through the industry, as well as lifetime servicing transfers all being -- we bundled that all into one complete offering for our clients.  
And then the third area that we've talked about on prior calls is the launch of eClose, which was really enabled by the combination of the expertise we have with MERS, Simplifile and the Ellie Mae business. And we combined that origination network that Ellie Mae has with the settlement agent network that the Simplifile business has. 
We've launched our eClose offering in the second quarter. We've enhanced that offering with our own proprietary e-signing capabilities in the third quarter. And then just this month, we launched our own proprietary eNote as part of our loan origination document set, as well as eVault. And we're continuing to see customers adopt those solutions. I mentioned on the last call we had 55 customers going through implementation. We now have 76 that are adopting it. 
And as that continues to ramp, I see that as another area that's going to continue to fuel growth in the closing line item, which is really enabling us to take a business that 12 months ago was a $200 million business to now, if you look at the trailing 12 months, it's a $300 million business, continuing to go after that $1 billion TAM that we outlined."

Well, first of all, and I think we'd like to position ourselves where there are analog-to-digital conversions, and there's an analog-to-digital conversion going on in the wallet. When I was a kid, I had a -- I carried around a leather wallet in my pocket, and children today may never own a leather wallet. And so that analog-to-digital conversion is something that we wanted to be a part of. 
I think we decided to create Bakkt as a separate brand and a separate entity because a lot of our investors seem to not see the coalescence of institutional and retail coming together. As access has increased through digital tools, you can see it in the U.S. equity markets, there's less distinction between a retail order and an institutional order, for example. And so that same convergence is happening across all businesses. 
And we were a little bit concerned that our investor base wouldn't appreciate that we could both be an institutional network provider and also a retail network provider. And so we decided to give the company a separate brand. And it was -- we just didn't feel like it was being appreciated inside of ICE, and so we decided to give it a separate capital structure on the New York Stock Exchange.  
Other than that, Bakkt will be doing its own earnings calls now as a public company. I'm no longer on the Board, and so I don't want to ever speak for the company going forward. But I will tell you that we do believe there's value creation in analog-to-digital conversions, and we're trying to place value there around the business. And that's part of why I see us as being an all-weather name that can grow on top of growth.  
We're locked up in the company as part of the IPO. We actually invested additionally as part of the spin. And so we're very, very high on that company and want to give it every opportunity to demonstrate its value to the market."

But if you -- if, Ben, you can talk about maybe parsing a little bit of the strong results between what you think are market share gains versus a lot of the initial traction of the products that you mentioned and the take-up of those products in the third quarter.  
And I guess what I'm getting at is obviously, there's headwinds on origination and repurchase and in refinance volumes. But should we be thinking of this third quarter as a pretty good base, especially in closing solutions, to forecast from on the transactional side?"

I'll try to go through some of the components of what we saw that drove that growth. 
And as we highlighted, the business grew double digits year-over-year -- or, sorry, so the business grew 7% year-over-year and with the backdrop of a decline in industry volumes being double digits. We also grew the business 8% sequentially, if you look at it from second quarter to third quarter, against a volume environment that industry estimates would have down double digits as well. And if you look at each of the line items of what's happening there, you'll see that we outperformed not only in the aggregate but also in each line item, what that transaction -- what that overall transaction environment was.  
In the origination line item, what you see there that I outlined in the last quarter is that -- and it was in our prepared remarks again today, is that part of our hypothesis in doing the deal is that we could take certain parts of the revenue base here and move it more and more towards subscription and take some of the volatility out of it. And the origination line item is one in particular that we are doing that with. And we've only done that with a very small percentage of the customer base. The average client is a customer and is under contract for 4 to 5 years. And we just started this year with a small percentage of the client base. We've had a great pickup in customers being open to moving more towards subscription. So I see we have a long runway of that. 
The other thing that's going on in that origination line is we're continuing to add more customers. We're gaining more market share. And as we implement those customers, those are new loans that are running through our system, and we are getting some transaction volume that we never saw before that's offsetting some of the headwinds that you'd see in that transaction environment. 
The second line item, data and analytics, it's the exact same story. We're taking a business -- so this is the automation of the underwrite process through our AI tools. This is a business that was almost 100% transaction. Under the covers, we've been moving it more and more towards subscription. We're going to continue to do so, and we're having incredible success cross-selling this to clients. 
It does take a little bit longer to implement customers on this solution because you're automating and deeply embedding your solutions into a very complicated workflow in each of these businesses as you're automating underwriting processes. But we have a number of customers that are going live on the platform that we've sold. We continue to have great sales success, and we have a number continuing to go through implementations. So that's continuing to grow and offset any transaction issues you see there. 
And then on the closing solution side, this is where I unpacked in the first question a lot of the new innovation that we have, a lot of the changes that we made. Simplifile continues to gain market share really versus paper. Our eClose solutions, our brand-new innovation that the industry hasn't seen before, and each time a customer is subscribing, so whether it's using our eClosing room, they're using our document set, they're using our eNote, they're using our vault, they can use either a component of those services or all of them. And each time they do that, we're getting incremental revenue on every transaction that's using that. And it's all greenfield. And there's very little competition in this space because of the unique position we've been in to build all this."

You said a small amount of those customers have migrated to subscription. Can you help quantify that? Is that sub-10% of the customers? Or any numbers around that? 
And can you just talk about the pricing structure? Because I thought the recurring revenues on the origination side previously were really just fee minimums on volumes. But it sounds like maybe this is a bit different in terms of fee structure. So can you just kind of go over that and what the strategy is in terms of migrating these customers?"

So it's a very small percentage of the customer base that we've been able to do this with. 
As you can imagine, now is a good time to actually be engaging with customers to make this transition towards subscription because we're in a high-volume environment. Customers are -- in this high-volume environment, they want to adopt more automation. They want to be able to continue to automate and be as efficient as possible against any other competition. So they're continuing to add on more and more of our services. 
So when we go in and engage clients in this negotiation, we are willing to forgo some transaction revenue. But we're not foregoing all of it. We're just making it very open in our algorithm around, hey, if we're going to shift some to subscription, we are willing to give up some transaction, which is mostly the success fees on those transactions that we get.  
But we also remember the other transaction element that we do get is on our network. So any time a loan is coming on to our network and ordering services from third parties for the automation that we're providing there, we're collecting a fee for providing that benefit along those rails, and that fee will continue as it is today."

In terms of are we taking away some of the upside, well, the way I see it is we're taking away some of the volatility in that line item.

That was kind of our target to resume share buybacks that we set when we announced the Ellie Mae deal back in August of last year. And so we'll start about -- up to about $250 million this quarter. 
I think about that kind of being more of a partial buyback because we do still need to get to 3x eventually, and I think we're well on our way there. But -- so we'll do a bit of a balance paydown of debt alongside these repurchases over the next quarter or so. 
But I think once -- thinking about next year, nothing's really changed in terms of capital return philosophy. I mean it's the same -- it's going to be the same thing as pre-Ellie Mae where it's return all capital to shareholders that we don't need for investment or M&A to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. So I think you should expect us to be thinking about it that way. 
And the only thing really that has changed here is that we've continued to grow free cash flow organically and then, of course, added Ellie Mae, which, as you obviously heard today and in the last couple of quarters, seen that it's performing very well. So those would be the things that I'd be thinking about as you're kind of thinking about next year in capital return at the moment. 
Right now, we're kind of going through the 2022 budget process. So as we start to refine that, we'll be able to kind of give you guys a bit of an update in the next couple of quarters. So..."

So when you look at our energy business, and we had talked about this on several calls, one of the things, I think, that's come to light through this is that we are very different than any of the peers that are out there in that we've developed very deep, liquid markets across the energy class spectrum. So whether it's coal, oil, gas, power, environmentals, we've invested heavily across that entire spectrum to give our customers the tools they need to manage what we saw as a secular trend more than a decade ago of people moving towards cleaner fossil fuels, such as natural gas, and towards environmental markets, carbon offset markets, compliance markets and the like. 
Made several acquisitions, Climate Exchange 10 years ago. We've been building out our global natural gas suite. And we have now a business that's substantially different than any of our peers'. We continue to invest, as we talked about in prior quarters, our oil business, which is doing extraordinarily well, with investments that we made in the launch of our Murban contract at ICE Futures Abu Dhabi. We have a new contract in the Gulf Coast that's launching in the beginning of next year in partnership with several big physical players. And we're in the middle of a Brent consultation where Midland WTI may be added into the Brent basket. So you have a whole bunch of dynamics going on across this, and it's because customers know they need to manage their risk through this transition. 
And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think the environment that you've just seen, you've got a peek into what it's going to be for a long, long time. This energy transition is going to be very volatile. Everyone sees the secular trend where investments are pouring into renewable projects, and projects such as coal are not getting invested in. 
And the fact is, any energy supply source, I don't care what it is, is susceptible to supply chain events, weather events, for example. If you have wind turbines and the wind is not blowing, it's not really easy to transition back to a coal-fired plant to get power back on the grid. 
So I foresee that we're in for a long ride of volatility. And now more than ever, the exchanges and the risk management tools that we provide are extraordinarily valuable to our clients, and it's important to us that we continue to engage with them as much as we ever have to continue to innovate."

But if you look at ICE today, 50% of revenues comes from sort of recurring sustainable business. It's grown at 10% for the last couple of quarters organically, and your guidance for Q4 implies about a 10% growth as well. So maybe just walk us through how you think about sustainability of that recurring revenue base and the growth algorithm that we could think about here on a multiyear basis."

And I think the one takeaway you should have is that, that has been an intentional evolution on behalf of the management team. We have been -- we started the company really being highly transaction oriented and have always wanted to have a bigger recurring, growing base that we can rely on. 
Part of our thinking of becoming an all-weather name is finding these analog-to-digital market conversions but also creating a portfolio of businesses that we operate that are durable in different environments. We really wanted to get into the mortgage space and really worked for over 10 years to put ourselves in that space because it benefits from a low interest rate environment, generally speaking. 
We have other businesses like our interest rate futures and, to a certain degree, inflation-oriented products like commodities that tend to do better in high interest rate environments. And so from a transaction standpoint, we wanted to be durable. We want to grow on top of growth and not be a name where people pile in when interest rates are going up and pile out when interest rates are going down. 
And so the more that we feel like we can lock into growing and recurring revenue, it gives investors a basis to know that we're going to continue to pay a dividend, that we're going to have capital to reinvest in the business. And then if we can have transaction businesses that, regardless of macro environment, can do well, it just feels like a company that an investor should own. 
And that has been the strategy that we've [ relayed ] here for how many years now, and it's finally coming to fruition. And the mortgage business, as Ben has mentioned, we've tasked our colleagues with let's try to really build a durable subscription underpinning to a business that also has really interesting transaction opportunities because of changes in technology. And the same thing in emissions and in liquefied natural gas. I know you and I have talked for years about our thesis that the natural gas market would globalize and that there would be global benchmarks, not regional benchmarks. 
And so a lot of these metrics that you see in your economic model have been incredibly intentional on our part over a long period of time. And it's great that in this quarter, as was mentioned earlier, everything came together at one time."

A lot of good qualitative detail, but I think what's missing a little bit is some more quantitative updates here. And I guess -- I know you don't give us any sort of numbers of mortgages that go in through your system a quarter. I know a lot of investors are asking for that. But in the absence of that, given that you're talking about a kind of like upsell, revenue upsell story, maybe you can at least help us how much your revenue per mortgage has been changing over the last year or 2. I mean, again, like if you're upselling, I guess, that revenue per mortgage should go up. So maybe some numbers you can put around that. 
And if you can decompose a little bit between pricing and certain new services, that would be very helpful, too. So hopefully, you can give us a little something here."

What I'll -- one area I can unpack here is when you dig into that, what's leading to our subscription growth. So that's one of the areas of our thesis, is that we could move more and more towards subscription in certain parts of the business. 
And if you look at the components of what's fueling that, one is the very deliberate, as customers are renewing, moving more and more towards subscription in the origination and the data and analytics line. That's one component. 
Second is new sales. And this is about market share gains. So we continue to have a lot of success in continuing to add new customers on to our platform or -- and cross-selling services to our existing clients is really the third. So in that cross-selling, the way to think about it, there's opportunities for us to expand the footprint with our clients, with the existing services that they have. We have clients that are using us on, for example, the loan origination side and the correspondent channel, moving to add the retail channel on to that, adding services like our Maven compliance service or our AllRegs offering. All of those are heavily subscription oriented, so we have a concerted effort to cross-sell. 
And then the fourth is price. And our algorithm when we did the deal and our hypothesis is that on the subscription revenue growth, which is a big component of what we think is required to really hit that 8% to 10% long-term guide, that over that long period of time, each of those elements, the renewals, new sales, cross-selling and price, it'll be pretty much an equal distribution across those 3 that you'll see over a long period of time is what's going to fuel that sustained subscription growth. So that's the area I'd highlight. 
On the transaction area, I mentioned a whole bunch of the new products that we're rolling out, which we believe has an opportunity to continue to grow transaction revenue as well and offset declines that you see in industry environments."
