Good morning, and thank you all for joining our call. 2020 was a year of unprecedented challenges. But through it all, we remain focused on continuing to differentiate ourselves as the clear industry leader. And I'm proud to say that we have",1465,"Thanks, Eric. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our call. 2020 was a year of unprecedented challenges. But through it all, we remain focused on continuing to differentiate ourselves as the clear industry leader. And I'm proud to say that we have delivered record-breaking results as a consequence. 
Turning to Slide 4 for a recap of our major achievements. The safety and well-being of our employees and local communities remains a fundamental principle of our company. Unfortunately, the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, and we remain disciplined in the application of the key health and safety protocols across our business.
Despite the challenges of managing through an unprecedented pandemic, we achieved the best safety performance in our company's history. This was a result of having a clear focus on managing the fatality risks across our company and ensuring that we have a consistent and rigorous approach to the application of critical controls required to manage these risks.
We continue to lead the industry with our ESG practices, setting targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 30% by 2030 and achieved net zero carbon by 2050. We met full year guidance, delivering more than 5.9 million ounces (sic) of [ 6.9 million ounces ] of attributable gold production and all-in sustaining costs of $1,045 per ounce. In addition to this, we produced a further 1 million gold equivalent ounces for copper, silver, lead and zinc at all-in sustaining costs of $858 per gold equivalent ounce.
Last year, our 12 managed operations, supported by an integrated operating model and a culture of continuous improvement, delivered $790 million in cost and productivity improvements through our Full Potential program. We continue to maintain our discipline of improving margins at $1,200 per ounce, allowing us to capitalize on our significant leverage to higher gold prices and delivering record financial results.
In 2020, we generated $3.6 billion in free cash flow, the highest in the industry, and ended the year with $5.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The strength and stability of our business supports our industry-leading dividend framework. This framework provides our shareholders with the stability of a base annualized dividend of $1 per share calibrated at a $1,200 gold price assumption and the potential to receive 40% to 60% of the incremental free cash flow generated at gold prices above $1,200.
Newmont continues to set the standard as the clear industry leader in shareholder returns, which we further differentiated with a 38% increase in our quarterly dividend that we announced yesterday, bringing our quarterly dividend to $0.55 per share and our annualized dividend rate to $2.20 per share. With this increase, our current dividend yield places us in the top 25 dividend payers of a large-cap S&P 500.
We also recently announced a new $1 billion share buyback program. This follows the $1 billion program we completed in the fourth quarter, which reduced our total share count by 22 million at an average price of $45 per share. Our industry-leading dividend and share repurchase program are a reflection of our commitment to deliver industry-leading shareholders' returns whilst remaining focused on the financial strength and flexibility needed to create value throughout the price cycle.
Shifting now to safety. I'd like to expand a bit more on our 2020 safety performance on Slide 5. 12 months ago, I outlined a key change that we were making at Newmont around our safety measures, stepping away from the mining industry's traditional use of lagging personal injury rates in our bonus programs to measures that are focused on managing the critical controls that must be in place at all times to prevent mortalities. At the time, I also challenged management teams and boards in our industry to follow our lead and shift the focus away from personal injury rates to measures that will lead to the creation of a fatality-, injury- and illness-free environment.
So how did it go? During 2020, we completed over 70,000 interactions by leaders in the field that were focused on ensuring that the critical controls required to prevent a fatality are understood and being effectively managed by our team members exposed to these risks. As a consequence, I'm proud to report we reduced our significant potential events by 63% and achieved the lowest personal injury rates in our company's history, with a total recordable injury frequency rate of 0.33 per 200,000 hours worked. It is no coincidence that visible thought leadership focused on fatality prevention is driving a significant improvement in all of our safety metrics.
Turning now to our portfolio on Slide 6. Among our 12 operating mines and 2 joint ventures, we have 9 world-class assets, each of which delivers more than 500,000 gold equivalent ounces per year at all-in sustaining costs of less than $900 per ounce and with a mine life that exceeds 10 years. Importantly, all are located in top key jurisdictions that we define as countries classified in the A and B ratings ranges by each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch. We firmly believe that we have the right-sized portfolio to generate sustainable returns from our world-class, responsibly-managed assets located in the best gold mining jurisdictions.
As we described in some detail on our exploration webcast last week, our portfolio is enhanced by the gold industry's best exploration pipeline of greenfield and brownfield opportunities. This exploration portfolio is managed through our proven integrated operating model, which ensures our exploration teams work hand in hand with our projects and operations teams. One of the key benefits of this integration is that we do not reinvent the wheel and duplicate effort. With the majority of our exploration activities occurring near existing operations, we have familiarity, not only with geology and terrain, but also the permitting, regulatory and community relationships surrounding each of our operations.
Turning now to the reserve and resources underpinning our asset base on Slide 7. All reserves are the lifeblood of a mining company, and replacing our reserves is critical to sustaining production. As we reported last week, we ended the year with 94 million ounces of gold reserves. Our team's ability to convert reserves and replace 80% of depletion in such a challenging year was truly remarkable. In addition to our reserves, we also offer substantial future upside to our resource base of over 101 million ounces of gold. And we are in the very fortunate position of also having significant exposure to other metals, including copper, silver, lead and zinc. These other metals are contributing substantial value to our portfolio today, generating solid cash flows each and every quarter from Peñasquito and Boddington.
Turning now to our stable long-term production profile on Slide 8. Underpinned by our leading reserve base and exploration program, our portfolio will produce better gold production of more than 6 million ounces through into at least 2030, balanced across each of our 4 regions. This profile is further enhanced by the production of more than 1 million gold equivalent ounces from silver, lead and zinc at Peñasquito and copper at Boddington and Yanacocha. Combined, we will deliver nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces per year for the next decade, the most of any company in our industry.
Then moving to Slide 9 for a look at our 5-year guidance. As we shared in December, our 5-year outlook shows that we will steadily increase attributable gold production to nearly 7 million ounces over the next 5 years, and our all-in sustaining costs will improve in 2021 to $970 per ounce and further improve to between $800 to $900 per ounce by 2024 as we get the benefit from our investments in Autonomous Haulage at Boddington, improved underground mining methods at Ahafo, the expansion at Tanami, the development of the Yanacocha Sulfides and a new mine at Ahafo North as well as continuing to deliver sustainable value from Full Potential improvements across our portfolio of 12 managed operations.
Turning now to our free cash flow generation potential on Slide 10. Our balanced portfolio, combined with our disciplined and integrated operating model, provide significant leverage to higher gold prices from the largest production and reserve base in the world. For every $100 increase in gold price above our base assumption, Newmont delivers $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year. Using our conservative $1,200 gold price assumption, our base free cash flow is still totaled $3.5 billion over the next 5 years. And at current gold prices, our portfolio would generate more than $15 billion of free cash flow over that same time frame. To be clear, this is free cash flow that is entirely attributable to Newmont's account, enabling us to provide industry-leading returns.
With that, I'll hand it over to Rob to discuss our operational performance on Slide 11."

Before jumping into the regions, I'd like to start by saying how very proud I am of our entire team and what they have safely accomplished while navigating such a tough and unprecedented year in 2020.
Heading into 2021, we remain very diligent in our application of our wide range and controls and safety protocols to place the health, safety and well-being of our teams and our communities above all else.
Turning to Slide 12. I'll give an update on Australia's performance. In 2020, Australia produced approximately 1.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $964 per ounce. At Boddington, we've produced approximately 670,000 gold ounces and 56 million pounds of copper in 2020. The site delivered a single year record for mill performance, reaching 40.5 million tonnes processed against a nameplate capacity of 35 million tonnes per annum. Achieving this level of performance is a testament to the successful implementation and consistent delivery of our proven Full Potential program, which is a direct result of the continuous improvement mindset of our dedicated site leadership personnel.
We have completed 3 full potential refreshes at Boddington since 2013 and continue to identify opportunities to take performance to the next level. During the fourth quarter, higher throughput and consistent grades drove strong production. Sustaining capital was higher than normal as we took early receipt of Cat trucks as part of the Autonomous Haulage system, which drove higher all-in sustaining costs. We're well on our way to operating the world's first open pit gold mine with an autonomous truck fleet, improving the safety of our employees and extending life at one of Newmont's cornerstone assets.
10 of the 29 new Cat trucks have already arrived on site, with 4 of those trucks fully commissioned and being put through their paces on the test circuit. We'll soon begin full deployment of these impressive autonomous vehicles that will increase productivity and improve mining rates. These improved mining rates, coupled with higher grade expected later in the year from the south pit position of Boddington, to deliver a stronger second half and over 1 million equivalent gold ounces for 2021.
I'd also like to highlight something we talked about last week at our exploration webcast. The area between the North and South pits in the picture has had limited drilling to date. But from the knowledge that we do have, we do believe there is a potential to combine the pits into one larger super pit to further extend the mine life.
At Tanami, we produced nearly 500,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $745 per ounce, one of our best-performing assets in the entire Newmont portfolio. Tanami continues to deliver productivity improvements, setting new records for underground development and mining rates for the year. The team continues to progress our second Tanami expansion, which I will now discuss on Slide 13.
We remain very excited about the second expansion project at Tanami and the site's future as a long-life and low-cost producer. Through the development of a 1.6 kilometer deep production shaft and supporting infrastructure, the project will improve production by around 150,000 to 200,000 ounces per year while reducing operating costs by approximately 10%. In addition, Tanami Expansion 2 will provide a platform for us to further explore a prolific mineral endowment in the district, which has the potential to grow annual production to more than 700,000 ounces per year.
As we mentioned during our exploration update, we have added significant reserves and resources at Tanami, and we are especially excited about the potential to advance near-mine exploration and Oberon. The Tanami expansion project is approximately 25% complete, and we've invested around $130 million so far. We have achieved a significant milestone, finalizing the major construction contracts required to complete the project. However, the pandemic has had an impact on construction contractors in Australia, which has resulted in higher-than-anticipated contracting rates. In addition, we encountered unanticipated geological structures during the completion of the pilot hole and the raise board drilling process. As a result, due to vertical deviation from our plan, we've had to increase the shaft diameter from 5.7 meters to 6.3 meters. The vertical deviation was only 300 millimeters, less than 1 foot over the length of a shaft that is nearly 1 mile deep. This is less than 0.2%, but it's very important to ensure a controlled development and a final shaft that will operate in a safe and optimal manner for decades to come.
Taking into account the impact of COVID, higher contracting costs and work resulting from the increased shaft diameter, we have revised our projected total capital cost to between $850 million and $950 million. The project is expected to reach commercial production in the first half of 2024, and we continue to work closely with our EPCM Worley to safely deliver this important project. It is important to note that this increase does not impact our long-term outlook announced in December. I'm proud of the team at Tanami and the persistence we've shown in executing such a complex project during a challenging year.
Turning to Africa on Slide 14. Our assets in Africa had another year of solid performance in 2020, producing over 850,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $890 per ounce. Akyem delivered a solid quarter, supported by higher grades and improved mill throughput by partnering with the process control team and our operations support hub in pair. This is how Newmont is leveraging its operating model to consistently drive improved performance and productivity right across our portfolio of operations and projects. As we progress through 2021, the site is well positioned to deliver higher production and improved costs as it benefits from higher grades ahead of a new layback.
Ahafo continued its steady performance in the fourth quarter as Subika underground delivered higher tonnes mined and grade. We continue to progress the development of our changed mining method at Subika sublevel shrinkage, which will have safely increase tonnage, reduce mining costs and capture higher efficiencies. We expect to continue the ramp-up to full-scale production of the sublevel shrinkage method by bringing on first full stoping area in quarter 2 this year, and we expect to complete the full-scale ramp-up by mid-2022.
In 2021, we expect to see higher grades at Subika and Awonsu open pits towards the second half of this year, which will drive higher second half production at the Ahafo site. Finally, at Ahafo North, the best unmined deposit in West Africa, we are finalizing the permitting process, and we remain firmly on track for a full funds decision in the coming months.
Turning to South America on Slide 15. South America, the region most impacted by the virus, had a strong finish to 2020, producing nearly 1.1 million attributable gold ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,100 per ounce. At Merian, we exceeded our outlook with nearly 350,000 attributable ounces for the year, and we surpassed 2 million ounces of gold produced since starting operations in October 2016. During the fourth quarter, the site delivered very solid performance based on higher throughput and recovery and utilizing an ore blending strategy that resulted in a single-day record for mill performance of 54,000 tonnes processed. In 2021, Merian transitions from softer saprolite to harder ore, which supports higher production through improved recoveries and grades, but is partially offset by lower mill throughput. At Cerro Negro, we continue to manage government restrictions related to COVID. Our disciplined safety protocols have allowed for more than 20 shift changes since the pandemic began, and we've performed over 14,000 tests through the company's owned and operated on-site PCR testing lab. While challenges remain with reduced levels of personnel during the quarter, production rates returned to pre-COVID levels, and focus remains on improving these rates through a number of Full Potential initiatives.
In 2021, our focus is on increasing development rates and the development at the Merian complex, which we expect will increase ore tonnes mined and sustain consistent levels of production. At the end of quarter, we managed through significant COVID challenges in 2020, delivering a steady end-of-year performance. Our focus on higher grades for leaching helped to offset the impact of lower tonnes mined and higher-than-usual rainfall during the fourth quarter.
We have also begun our transition to leach-only operations with a ramp-down of the oxide mill ahead of the development of Yanacocha Sulfides and expect production for 2021 to be weighted to the second half of the year as we reach higher grades. Study work on the Sulfides project is progressing well, is nearing completion, and we expect to apply for full funds approval to move the project into execution during the second half of 2021.
Turning to North America on Slide 16. North America delivered solid fourth quarter results, ending the year with approximately 1.5 million ounces of gold production and nearly 900,000 gold equivalent ounces. At Peñasquito, we delivered a very strong fourth quarter after overcoming a challenging year. The site topped new efforts for mill throughput since the acquisition, averaging throughput of approximately 105,000 tonnes per day. And we saw record performance from the pyrite leach plant for gold and concentrate production.
At Musselwhite, we completed 2 important projects that are critical to ensuring the site's future, the new conveyor and the materials handling system. Musselwhite ramped up mining in the fourth quarter and reached its highest ore tonnes mined for a single quarter since the acquisition. With underground development progressing ahead of plan and the utilization of the new conveyor and materials handling system, Musselwhite is positioned to produce 200,000 ounces in 2021 with a stronger second half and ore tonnes mined continue to improve. 
Éléonore delivered its strongest quarter of the year for both production and costs. 2020 was a transformational year for Éléonore as our site leadership team focused on resetting the operation and improving efficiency and productivity, resulting in higher margins. Completing the lower mine materials handling system earlier in October has also enabled the team at Éléonore to achieve higher underground development rates from deeper in the mine.
Porcupine delivered solid results for the year with nearly 320,000 ounces of gold production, meeting our full year guidance. Fourth quarter results remain steady on increased underground development rates at Borden and a higher grade mined oil. In 2021, Porcupine will produce 360,000 ounces of gold production with higher grades and improved mining rates being achieved in the second half of 2021. 
At CC&V, we remain focused on safely delivering on our plan with over 250,000 ounces of production in 2021, with higher mill grades being achieved also in the second half of the year.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Nancy on Slide 17."

Turning to Slide 18 for the financial highlights. As you can see on this slide, we had an exceptional year and delivered our best quarterly performance of 2020 in the fourth quarter, including $3.4 billion in revenue, an increase of over $400",663,"Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 18 for the financial highlights. As you can see on this slide, we had an exceptional year and delivered our best quarterly performance of 2020 in the fourth quarter, including $3.4 billion in revenue, an increase of over $400 million from the prior year quarter, driven by higher prices; adjusted net income of $856 million or $1.06 per diluted share; adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.8 billion, an increase of 37% from the prior year quarter; and nearly $1.3 billion in free cash flow for the quarter and an amount entirely attributable to Newmont's account.
This strong financial performance allows us to raise our dividend for a third time since the beginning of 2020, with the fourth quarter dividend declared of $0.55 per share, which is almost 4x larger than the fourth quarter dividend from 2019.
Turning to Slide 19 for review of our adjusted earnings per share in more detail. Fourth quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $806 million or $1 per share. Adjustments included $0.18 primarily related to the sale of royalty interest and changes in the fair value of our investments; $0.03 related to incremental COVID-specific costs, such as additional screening protocols, transportation costs and community fund disbursements; $0.20 related to reclamation and remediation adjustments, primarily at Yanacocha; $0.06 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance; and $0.07 of other charges taking these adjustments into account, we reported fourth quarter adjusted net income of $1.06 per diluted share, an increase of $0.56 over the prior year quarter.
Turning now to Slide 20. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities, which include maintaining our financial strength and flexibility, reinvesting in our business through disciplined investments in exploration and organic growth projects and returning cash to shareholders. During the year, Newmont reinforced its position as the clear industry leader for shareholder returns and financial performance. We maintain over $8.5 billion in liquidity with $5.5 billion of available cash. $550 million of that cash will be used to repay our 2021 senior notes that are due in June of this year. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is now at 0.2x. And in the fourth quarter, we were placed on positive outlook by Standard & Poor's, and we were upgraded by Moody's to Baa1 credit rating, further demonstrating our balance sheet strength.
We returned over $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in 2019 and 2020. Newmont has a unique ability to lead in shareholder returns, maintain strength and financial flexibility and develop profitable projects, such as the expansion of Tanami, Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides.
Looking ahead in 2021, we will continue executing on our proven track record of superior shareholder returns with a new $1 billion share repurchase program and an industry-leading dividend framework. Turning to Slide 21 for more details about the dividend. In October, Newmont established a dividend framework that provides shareholders with a stable base annualized dividend of $1 per share at a $1,200 gold price, along with the potential to receive 40% to 60% of the incremental free cash flow generated at gold prices above our base plan. The fourth quarter dividend declared yesterday was calibrated at an $1,800 gold price assumption and a 40% distribution of incremental free cash flow, resulting in a 38% increase over the prior quarter.
As Tom mentioned earlier, at the current share price, our current dividend translates to a yield over 3.5% and places us in the top 25 dividend payers of the large-cap S&P 500. The increase to our quarterly dividend reflects the strength and stability of our business, a recognition of the current gold price environment and our ability to maintain capital discipline. We will continue to assess our dividend on a quarterly basis and are confident that our framework will provide shareholders with an attractive dividend yield and participation in our cash flow generation at these higher gold prices.
With that, I'll hand it back to Tom on Slide 22."

Before we move on to Q&A, I'd like to pause and acknowledge Randy Engel, who has made the decision to retire in the second quarter after dedicating 27 years of service to our company. For the past 15 years, Randy has led our strategy and corporate development groups, serving on the senior and executive leadership teams of 3 CEOs. Over his career, Randy and his team have completed more than $35 billion in transactions, including the purchase of Cripple Creek and Victor, the sale of Batu Hijau and, most importantly, the acquisition of Goldcorp and the establishment of the Nevada Goldmines joint venture in 2019. I am enormously grateful to Randy for the contributions he has made to our company over his distinguished career and for the friendship and support that he has provided to me during my time at Newmont. I wish him all the very best in his well-earned retirement and with whatever he chooses to embark on in the next chapter of his life, which will no doubt include lots of time in the outdoors with his family and friends.
With Randy's retirement, Blake Rhoades, currently, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Development, will assume responsibility for Strategy and Corporate Development, reporting directly to me. Blake has been with Newmont for 25 years, serving in a variety of positions, including General Counsel and Senior Vice President for our Indonesian business. Blake has played a central role in all of the major transactions we have completed since 2014 and is well prepared to succeed Randy.
As I've discussed many times, at Newmont, we believe consistent operational, environmental and social performance starts with good governance, which includes thoughtful succession planning. This transition is another example of our commitment to sound governance practices and reflects our deep bench strength of capable leaders.
As we near our 100th birthday, I am more confident than ever that we are positioned to generate significant free cash flow and do so for decades to come.

I'll kick off. And Nancy, you might want to chime in as well. When we sit down with our Board each quarter and look at our dividend through that framework, Jackie, we look back on a significant period of time in this discussion we had this week with the Board was looking at the second half of 2020 where gold was averaging a bit above $1,800 through that 6-month period. So we talked through lifting from the $1,500 zone to the $1,800 zone because of that gold performance. We would continue to have those discussions every quarter. Certainly, as we talked about in our -- we introduced our framework in October, it's more likely to be a semiannual move with conversations taking place each quarter. But we'd be looking at what gold has been doing over at least that lagging 6-month period, and we'd look into the future, and we're looking at what the macroeconomics may be indicating in terms of gold as we think about that 40% to 60% range. But we certainly saw in the discussion that there was good gold price performance that had us lift from the $1,500 to the $1,800. And then we still got upside in front of us if gold maintains its current levels or higher so that we thought that was a prudent decision within the context of our framework. And we will have that conversation every quarter with our Board.
In terms of the share repurchase program, it's up to $1 billion over 18 months. So the previous program is very much linked to our divestments of KCGM, Red Lake and Continental. We brought in $1.4 billion, and we returned $1 billion from those divestments in 2019 to shareholders through that buyback through the course of last year. With this program, over an 18-month period, up to $1 billion, we've been looking to opportunistically go into the market where we saw a disconnect between market value and our assessment of our intrinsic value of the business. So for us, it's a dynamic we will be looking for, for that disconnect, and then you should expect to see Newmont buying. I'd also say that the dividend framework in our capital allocation strategy takes primacy over the share buyback as we move forward. Nancy, is there anything you'd add to that?"

Just to reiterate, Jackie, that the repurchase program doesn't impact our ability to continue to offer those higher dividends. So we are very flexible in that way. I think that's a key differentiator is our ability to offer both the dividend with full transparency and also the share buyback programs. And then really, it is a discretionary program, and we will consider a number of factors when we decide to repurchase, but the fundamental underlying thesis is that it will be an accretive purchase. So lots of things to think about, but our view is to provide more value to shareholders in an accretive way."

And when you actually look at last year, that is about 15 records that we broke. And the reason I just say that is that those are based around the augmented feed. And not only have we increased it on average, but we've still got some room to go. And if we compare what we did at Boddington at 40.5 million tonnes through the mill on a nameplate capacity of 36 million, we've still got a long way to go at Peñasquito to really make sure that we're sustaining those. But we're working very, very positively. I think in the mine as well, the basics, such as payload, and for example, we've been able to increase payload there by nearly 13 tonnes per truck, which may not seem a lot. But given the size of the fleet, that's 25,000 tonnes a day that we're able to do. And when you couple that with the drill and blast improvements, the supply chain improvements, the pyrite leach performance, where we also saw a record performance in the last 4 months of last year, that it's a site which is showing that it really can perform across a whole number of things. So in short, we're very pleased with it. I think the potential upside is still very significant, just doing the basics and the full potential process that Newmont has used over many, many years as a fundamental part of that."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining our call. 2020 was a year of unprecedented challenges. But through it all, we remain focused on continuing to differentiate ourselves as the clear industry leader. And I'm proud to say that we have",1462,"Thanks, Eric. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our call. 2020 was a year of unprecedented challenges. But through it all, we remain focused on continuing to differentiate ourselves as the clear industry leader. And I'm proud to say that we have delivered record-breaking results as a consequence. 
Turning to Slide 4 for a recap of our major achievements. The safety and well-being of our employees and local communities remains a fundamental principle of our company. Unfortunately, the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, and we remain disciplined in the application of the key health and safety protocols across our business. Despite the challenges of managing through an unprecedented pandemic, we achieved the best safety performance in our company's history. This was a result of having a clear focus on managing the fatality risks across our company and ensuring that we have a consistent and rigorous approach to the application of critical controls required to manage these risks.
We continue to lead the industry with our ESG practices, setting targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 30% by 2030 and achieve net zero carbon by 2050. We met full year guidance, delivering more than 5.9 million ounces (sic) [ 6.9 million ounces ] of attributable gold production at all-in sustaining costs of $1,045 per ounce. In addition to this, we produced a further 1 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc at all-in sustaining costs of $858 per gold equivalent ounce.
Last year, our 12 managed operations, supported by an integrated operating model and a culture of continuous improvement, delivered $790 million in cost and productivity improvements through our Full Potential program. We continue to maintain our discipline of improving margins at $1,200 per ounce, allowing us to capitalize on our significant leverage to higher gold prices and delivering record financial results.
In 2020, we generated $3.6 billion in free cash flow, the highest in the industry, and ended the year with $5.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The strength and stability of our business supports our industry-leading dividend framework. This framework provides our shareholders with the stability of a base annualized dividend of $1 per share calibrated at a $1,200 gold price assumption and the potential to receive 40% to 60% of the incremental free cash flow generated at gold prices above $1,200.
Newmont continues to set the standard as the clear industry leader in shareholder returns, which we further differentiated with a 38% increase in our quarterly dividend that we announced yesterday, bringing our quarterly dividend to $0.55 per share and our annualized dividend rate to $2.20 per share. With this increase, our current dividend yield places us in the top 25 dividend payers of a large-cap S&P 500.
We also recently announced a new $1 billion share buyback program. This follows the $1 billion program we completed in the fourth quarter, which reduced our total share count by 22 million at an average price of $45 per share. Our industry-leading dividend and share repurchase program are a reflection of our commitment to deliver industry-leading shareholders returns whilst remaining focused on the financial strength and flexibility needed to create value throughout the price cycle.
Shifting now to safety. I'd like to expand a bit more on our 2020 safety performance on Slide 5. 12 months ago, I outlined a key change that we were making at Newmont around our safety measures, stepping away from the mining industry's traditional use of lagging personal injury rates in our bonus programs to measures that are focused on managing the critical controls that must be in place at all times to prevent mortalities. At the time, I also challenged management teams and boards in our industry to follow our lead and shift the focus away from personal injury rates to measures that will lead to the creation of fatality-, injury- and illness-free environment.
So how did we go? During 2020, we completed over 70,000 interactions by leaders in the field that were focused on ensuring that the critical controls required to prevent a fatality are understood and being effectively managed by our team members exposed to these risks. As a consequence, I'm proud to report we reduced our significant potential events by 63% and achieved the lowest personal injury rates in our company's history, with a total recordable injury frequency rate of 0.33 per 200,000 hours worked. It is no coincidence that visible thought leadership focused on fatality prevention is driving a significant improvement in all of our safety metrics.
Turning now to our portfolio on Slide 6. Among our 12 operating mines and 2 joint ventures, we have 9 world-class assets, each of which delivers more than 500,000 gold equivalent ounces per year at all-in sustaining costs of less than $900 per ounce and with a mine life that exceeds 10 years. Importantly, all are located in top key jurisdictions that we define as countries classified in the A and B ratings ranges by each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch. We firmly believe that we have the right-sized portfolio to generate sustainable returns from our world-class, responsibly-managed assets located in the best gold mining jurisdictions.
As we described in some detail on our exploration webcast last week, our portfolio is enhanced by the gold industry's best exploration pipeline of greenfield and brownfield opportunities. This exploration portfolio is managed through our proven integrated operating model, which ensures our exploration teams work hand in hand with our projects and operations teams. One of the key benefits of this integration is that we do not reinvent the wheel and duplicate effort. With the majority of our exploration activities occurring near existing operations, we have familiarity, not only with geology and terrain, but also the permitting, regulatory and community relationships surrounding each of our operations.
Turning now to the reserve and resources underpinning our asset base on Slide 7. All reserves are the lifeblood of a mining company, and replacing our reserves is critical to sustaining production. As we reported last week, we ended the year with 94 million ounces of gold reserves. Our team's ability to convert reserves and replace 80% of depletion in such a challenging year was truly remarkable. In addition to our reserves, we also offer substantial future upside through our resource base of over 101 million ounces of gold. And we are in the very fortunate position of also having significant exposure to other metals, including copper, silver, lead and zinc. These other metals are contributing substantial value to our portfolio today, generating solid cash flows each and every quarter from Peñasquito and Boddington.
Turning now to our stable long-term production profile on Slide 8. Underpinned by our leading reserve base and exploration program, our portfolio will produce steady gold production of more than 6 million ounces through into at least 2030, balanced across each of our 4 regions. This profile is further enhanced by the production of more than 1 million gold equivalent ounces from silver, lead and zinc at Peñasquito and copper at Boddington and Yanacocha. Combined, we will deliver nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces per year for the next decade, the most of any company in our industry.
Then moving to Slide 9 for a look at our 5-year guidance. As we shared in December, our 5-year outlook shows that we will steadily increase attributable gold production to nearly 7 million ounces over the next 5 years, and our all-in sustaining costs will improve in 2021 to $970 per ounce and further improve to between $800 to $900 per ounce by 2024 as we get the benefit from our investments in Autonomous Haulage at Boddington, improved underground mining methods at Ahafo, the expansion at Tanami, the development of Yanacocha Sulfides and a new mine at Ahafo North as well as continuing to deliver sustainable value from Full Potential improvements across our portfolio of 12 managed operations.
Turning now to our free cash flow generation potential on Slide 10. Our balanced portfolio, combined with our disciplined and integrated operating model, provides significant leverage to high gold prices from the largest production and reserve base in the world. For every $100 increase in gold price above our base assumption, Newmont delivers $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year. Using our conservative $1,200 gold price assumption, our base free cash flow is still totaled $3.5 billion over the next 5 years. And at current gold prices, our portfolio would generate more than $15 billion of free cash flow over that same time frame. To be clear, this is free cash flow that is entirely attributable to Newmont's account, enabling us to provide industry-leading returns.
With that, I'll hand it over to Rob to discuss our operational performance on Slide 11."

Before jumping into the regions, I'd like to start by saying how very proud I am of our entire team and what they have safely accomplished, while navigating such a tough and unprecedented year in 2020. Heading into 2021, we remain very diligent in our application of our wide ranging controls and safety protocols to place the health, safety and well-being of our teams and our communities above all else.
Turning to Slide 12, I'll give an update on Australia's performance. In 2020, Australia produced approximately 1.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $964 per ounce. At Boddington, we've produced approximately 670,000 gold ounces and 56 million pounds of copper in 2020. The site delivered a single year record for mill performance, reaching 40.5 million tonnes processed against a nameplate capacity of 35 million tonnes per annum. Achieving this level of performance is a testament to the successful implementation and consistent delivery of our proven Full Potential program, which is a direct result of the continuous improvement mindset of our dedicated site leadership personnel.
We have completed 3 Full Potential refreshes at Boddington since 2013 and continue to identify opportunities to take performance to the next level. During the fourth quarter, higher throughput and consistent grades drove strong production. Sustaining capital was higher than normal as we took early receipt of Cat trucks as part of the Autonomous Haulage system, which drove higher all-in sustaining costs. We're well on our way to operating the world's first open pit gold mine with an autonomous truck fleet, improving the safety of our employees and extending life at one of Newmont's cornerstone assets.
10 of the 29 new Cat trucks have already arrived on site, with 4 of those trucks fully commissioned and being put through their paces on the test circuit. We'll soon begin full deployment of these impressive autonomous vehicles that will increase productivity and improve mining rates. These improved mining rates, coupled with higher grade expected later in the year from the South Pit, positions Boddington to deliver a stronger second half and over 1 million equivalent gold ounces for 2021.
I'd also like to highlight something we talked about last week at our exploration webcast. The area between the North and South Pits in the picture has had limited drilling to date. But from the knowledge that we do have, we do believe there is a potential to combine the pits into one larger super pit to further extend the mine life. At Tanami, we produced nearly 500,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $745 per ounce, one of our best-performing assets in the entire Newmont portfolio. Tanami continues to deliver productivity improvements, setting new records for underground development and mining rates for the year. The team continues to progress our second Tanami expansion, which I will now discuss on Slide 13.
We remain very excited about the second expansion project at Tanami and the site's future as a long-life and low-cost producer. Through the development of a 1.6 kilometer deep production shaft and supporting infrastructure, the project will improve production by around 150,000 to 200,000 ounces per year, while reducing operating costs by approximately 10%. In addition, Tanami Expansion 2 will provide a platform for us to further explore a prolific mineral endowment in the district, which has the potential to grow annual production to more than 700,000 ounces per year.
As we mentioned during our exploration update, we have added significant reserves and resources at Tanami, and we are especially excited about the potential to advance near-mine exploration at Oberon. The Tanami expansion project is approximately 25% complete, and we've invested around $130 million so far. We have achieved a significant milestone, finalizing the major construction contracts required to complete the project. However, the pandemic has had an impact on construction contractors in Australia, which has resulted in higher-than-anticipated contracting rates. 
In addition, we encountered unanticipated geological structures during the completion of the pilot hole and the raise bore drilling process. As a result, due to vertical deviation from our plan, we've had to increase the shaft diameter from 5.7 meters to 6.3 meters. The vertical deviation was only 300 millimeters, less than 1 foot over the length of a shaft that is nearly 1 mile deep. This is less than 0.2%, but it's very important to ensure a controlled development and a final shaft that will operate in a safe and optimal manner for decades to come.
Taking into account the impact of COVID, higher contracting costs and work resulting from the increased shaft diameter, we have revised our projected total capital cost to between $850 million and $950 million. The project is expected to reach commercial production in the first half of 2024, and we continue to work closely with our EPCM, Worley, to safely deliver this important project. It is important to note that this increase does not impact our long-term outlook announced in December. I'm proud of the team at Tanami and the persistence they've shown in executing such a complex project during a challenging year.
Turning to Africa on Slide 14. Our assets in Africa had another year of solid performance in 2020, producing over 850,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $890 per ounce. Akyem delivered a solid quarter, supported by higher grades and improved mill throughput by partnering with the process control team and our operations support hub in Perth. This is how Newmont is leveraging its operating model to consistently drive improved performance and productivity right across our portfolio of operations and projects. As we progress through 2021, the site is well positioned to deliver higher production and improved costs as it benefits from higher grades ahead of a new layback.
Ahafo continued its steady performance in the fourth quarter as Subika Underground delivered higher tonnes mined and grade. We continue to progress the development of our changed mining method at Subika, sublevel shrinkage, which will have safely increased tonnage, reduce mining costs and capture higher efficiencies. We expect to continue the ramp-up to full-scale production of the sublevel shrinkage method by bringing on first full stoping area in quarter 2 this year, and we expect to complete the full-scale ramp-up by mid-2022.
In 2021, we expect to see higher grades at Subika and Awonsu open pits towards the second half of this year, which will drive higher second half production at the Ahafo site. Finally, at Ahafo North, the best unmined deposit in West Africa, we are finalizing the permitting process, and we remain firmly on track for a full funds decision in the coming months.
Turning to South America on Slide 15. South America, the region most impacted by the virus, had a strong finish to 2020, producing nearly 1.1 million attributable gold ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,100 per ounce. At Merian, we exceeded our outlook with nearly 350,000 attributable ounces for the year, and we surpassed 2 million ounces of gold produced since starting operations in October 2016. During the fourth quarter, the site delivered very solid performance based on higher throughput and recovery and utilizing an ore blending strategy that resulted in a single-day record for mill performance of 54,000 tonnes processed. 
In 2021, Merian transitions from softer saprolite to harder ore, which supports higher production through improved recoveries and grades, but is partially offset by lower mill throughput. At Cerro Negro, we continue to manage government restrictions related to COVID. Our disciplined safety protocols have allowed for more than 20 shift changes since the pandemic began, and we've performed over 14,000 tests through the company's owned and operated on-site PCR testing lab. While challenges remain with reduced levels of personnel during the quarter, production rates returned to pre-COVID levels, and focus remains on improving these rates through a number of Full Potential initiatives. In 2021, our focus is on increasing development rates and the development at the Merian's complex, which we expect will increase ore tonnes mined and sustain consistent levels of production. 
At Yanacocha, we managed through significant COVID challenges in 2020, delivering a steady end-of-year performance. Our focus on higher grades for leaching helped to offset the impact of lower tonnes mined and higher-than-usual rainfall during the fourth quarter. We have also begun our transition to leach-only operations with a ramp-down of the oxide mill ahead of the development of Yanacocha Sulfides and expect production for 2021 to be weighted to the second half of the year as we reach higher grades. Study work on the Sulfides project is progressing well, is nearing completion, and we expect to apply for full funds approval to move the project into execution during the second half of 2021.
Turning to North America on Slide 16. North America delivered solid fourth quarter results, ending the year with approximately 1.5 million ounces of gold production and nearly 900,000 gold equivalent ounces. At Peñasquito, we delivered a very strong fourth quarter after overcoming a challenging year. The site topped new records for mill throughput since the acquisition, averaging throughput of approximately 105,000 tonnes per day. And we saw record performance from the Pyrite Leach plant for gold and concentrate production.
At Musselwhite, we completed 2 important projects that are critical to ensuring the site's future, the new conveyor and the materials handling system. Musselwhite ramped up mining in the fourth quarter and reached its highest ore tonnes mined for a single quarter since the acquisition. With underground development progressing ahead of plan and the utilization of the new conveyor and materials handling system, Musselwhite is positioned to produce 200,000 ounces in 2021 with a stronger second half as ore tonnes mined continue to improve. 
Éléonore delivered its strongest quarter of the year for both production and costs. 2020 was a transformational year for Éléonore as our site leadership team focused on resetting the operation and improving efficiency and productivity, resulting in higher margins. Completing the lower mine materials handling system earlier in October has also enabled the team at Éléonore to achieve higher underground development rates from deeper in the mine.
Porcupine delivered solid results for the year with nearly 320,000 ounces of gold production, meeting our full year guidance. Fourth quarter results remain steady on increased underground development rates at Borden and a higher grade mined at [ Turquoise ]. In 2021, Porcupine will produce 360,000 ounces of gold production with higher grades and improved mining rates being achieved in the second half of 2021. And at CC&V, we remain focused on safely delivering on our plan with over 250,000 ounces of production in 2021, with higher mill grades being achieved also in the second half of the year.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Nancy on Slide 17."

As you can see on this slide, we had an exceptional year and delivered our best quarterly performance of 2020 in the fourth quarter, including $3.4 billion in revenue, an increase of over $400 million from the prior year quarter, driven by higher prices; adjusted net income of $856 million or $1.06 per diluted share; adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.8 billion, an increase of 37% from the prior year quarter; and nearly $1.3 billion in free cash flow for the quarter and an amount entirely attributable to Newmont's account. This strong financial performance allows us to raise our dividend for a third time since the beginning of 2020, with the fourth quarter dividend declared of $0.55 per share, which is almost 4x larger than the fourth quarter dividend from 2019.
Turning to Slide 19 for a review of our adjusted earnings per share in more detail. Fourth quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $806 million or $1 per share. Adjustments included $0.18 primarily related to the sale of royalty interest and changes in the fair value of our investments; $0.03 related to incremental COVID-specific costs, such as additional screening protocols, transportation costs and community fund disbursements; $0.20 related to reclamation and remediation adjustments, primarily at Yanacocha; $0.06 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance; and $0.07 of other charges. Taking these adjustments into account, we reported fourth quarter adjusted net income of $1.06 per diluted share, an increase of $0.56 over the prior year quarter.
Turning now to Slide 20. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities, which include maintaining our financial strength and flexibility, reinvesting in our business through disciplined investments in exploration and organic growth projects and returning cash to shareholders. During the year, Newmont reinforced its position as the clear industry leader for shareholder returns and financial performance. We maintain over $8.5 billion in liquidity with $5.5 billion of available cash. $550 million of that cash will be used to repay our 2021 senior notes that are due in June of this year. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is now at 0.2x. 
And in the fourth quarter, we were placed on positive outlook by Standard & Poor's, and we were upgraded by Moody's to Baa1 credit rating, further demonstrating our balance sheet strength. We returned over $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in 2019 and 2020. Newmont has a unique ability to lead in shareholder returns, maintain strength and financial flexibility and develop profitable projects, such as the expansion of Tanami, Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides. Looking ahead in 2021, we will continue executing on our proven track record of superior shareholder returns with a new $1 billion share repurchase program and an industry-leading dividend framework. 
Turning to Slide 21 for more details about the dividend. In October, Newmont established a dividend framework that provides shareholders with a stable base annualized dividend of $1 per share at a $1,200 gold price, along with the potential to receive 40% to 60% of the incremental free cash flow generated at gold prices above our base plan. The fourth quarter dividend declared yesterday was calibrated at an $1,800 gold price assumption and a 40% distribution of incremental free cash flow, resulting in a 38% increase over the prior quarter.
As Tom mentioned earlier, at the current share price, our current dividend translates to a yield over 3.5% and places us in the top 25 dividend payers of the large-cap S&P 500. The increase to our quarterly dividend reflects the strength and stability of our business, a recognition of the current gold price environment and our ability to maintain capital discipline. We will continue to assess our dividend on a quarterly basis and are confident that our framework will provide shareholders with an attractive dividend yield and participation in our cash flow generation at these higher gold prices.
With that, I'll hand it back to Tom on Slide 22."

Before we move on to Q&A, I'd like to pause and acknowledge Randy Engel, who has made the decision to retire in the second quarter after dedicating 27 years of service to our company. For the past 15 years, Randy has led our Strategy and Corporate Development groups, serving on the senior and executive leadership teams of 3 CEOs. Over his career, Randy and his team have completed more than $35 billion in transactions, including the purchase of Cripple Creek & Victor, the sale of Batu Hijau and, most importantly, the acquisition of Goldcorp and the establishment of the Nevada Gold Mines joint venture in 2019. I am enormously grateful to Randy for the contributions he has made to our company over his distinguished career and for the friendship and support that he has provided to me during my time at Newmont. 
I wish him all the very best in his well-earned retirement and with whatever he chooses to embark on in the next chapter of his life, which will no doubt include lots of time in the outdoors with his family and friends. With Randy's retirement, Blake Rhodes, currently, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Development, will assume responsibility for Strategy and Corporate Development, reporting directly to me. Blake has been with Newmont for 25 years, serving in a variety of positions, including General Counsel and Senior Vice President for our Indonesian business. Blake has played a central role in all of the major transactions we have completed since 2014 and is well prepared to succeed Randy.
As I've discussed many times, at Newmont, we believe consistent operational, environmental and social performance starts with good governance, which includes thoughtful succession planning. This transition is another example of our commitment to sound governance practices and reflects our deep bench strength of capable leaders. As we near our 100th birthday, I am more confident than ever that we are positioned to generate significant free cash flow and do so for decades to come. Our clear strategy lays the groundwork to clearly differentiate Newmont as the world's leading gold company as we work to continue to demonstrate our commitment to our purpose of creating value and improving lives through sustainable and responsible mining.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions."

And Nancy, you might want to chime in as well. When we sit down with our Board each quarter and look at our dividend through that framework, Jackie, we look back on a significant period of time in this discussion we had this",390,"Thanks, Jackie. I'll kick off. And Nancy, you might want to chime in as well. When we sit down with our Board each quarter and look at our dividend through that framework, Jackie, we look back on a significant period of time in this discussion we had this week with the Board was looking at the second half of 2020 where gold was averaging a bit above $1,800 through that 6-month period. So we talked through lifting from the $1,500 zone to the $1,800 zone because of that gold performance. 
We would continue to have those discussions every quarter. Certainly, as we talked about in our -- we introduced our framework in October, it's more likely to be a semiannual move with conversations taking place each quarter. But we'd be looking at what gold has been doing over at least that lagging 6-month period, and we'd look into the future, and we're looking at what the macroeconomics may be indicating in terms of gold as we think about that 40% to 60% range. But we certainly saw in the discussion that there was good gold price performance that had us lift from the $1,500 to the $1,800. And then we still got upside in front of us if gold maintains its current levels or higher, so that we thought that was a prudent decision within the context of our framework. And we will have that conversation every quarter with our Board.
In terms of the share repurchase program, it's up to $1 billion over 18 months. So the previous program is very much linked to our divestments of KCGM, Red Lake and Continental. We brought in $1.4 billion, and we returned $1 billion from those divestments in 2019 to shareholders through that buyback through the course of last year. With this program, over an 18-month period, up to $1 billion, we've been looking to opportunistically go into the market where we saw a disconnect between market value and our assessments of our intrinsic value of the business. So for us, it's a dynamic we will be looking for, for that disconnect, and then you should expect to see Newmont buying. I'd also say that the dividend framework in our capital allocation strategy takes primacy over the share buyback as we move forward. Nancy, is there anything you'd add to that?"

Just to reiterate, Jackie, that the repurchase program doesn't impact our ability to continue to offer those higher dividends. So we are very flexible in that way. I think that's a key differentiator is our ability to offer both the dividend with full transparency and also the share buyback programs. And then really, it is a discretionary program, and we will consider a number of factors when we decide to repurchase, but the fundamental underlying thesis is that it will be an accretive purchase. So lots of things to think about, but our view is to provide more value to shareholders in an accretive way."

And when you actually look at last year, that is about 13 records that we broke. And the reason I just say that is that those are based around the augmented feed. And not only have we increased it on average, but we've still got some room to go. And if we compare what we did at Boddington at 40.5 million tonnes through the mill on a nameplate capacity of 36 million, we've still got a long ways to go at Peñasquito to really make sure that we're sustaining those. But we're working very, very positively. 
I think in the mine as well, the basics, such as payload, and, for example, we've been able to increase payload there by nearly 13 tonnes per truck, which may not seem a lot. But given the size of the fleet, that's 25,000 tonnes a day that we're able to do. And when you couple that with the drill and blast improvements, the supply chain improvements, the Pyrite Leach performance, where we also saw a record performance in the last 4 months of last year, that it's a site which is showing that it really can perform across a whole number of things. So in short, very pleased with it. I think the potential upside is still very significant, just doing the basics and the full potential process that Newmont has used over many, many years as a fundamental part of that."

Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the 12 colleagues we have lost to the COVID pandemic over this last year. Instead, we have mobilized test fatality investigation team and utilize the same methodology we do for other employee or contractor fatalities. The intent of each investigation was to understand if any of our COVID critical controls require change, and ensuring that we learn and share our findings globally. These losses have had a profound impact on the entire Newmont family. And it is with great humility that we are reminded that the safety and well-being of our workforce and host communities must come above all else. 
Turning to Slide 4 for a summary of our quarterly performance. Our safety and sustainability framework is at the core of how we manage our business. And I'm proud that Newmont continues to lead the industry with our ESG practices. In March, we delivered a first for the gold industry, with production coming from an autonomous haul fleet. Our investment in autonomous haul trucks not only improve safety and productivity at Boddington, but also serves as a base case for replication at other operations and projects across the Newmont portfolio. We also entered into a $3 billion sustainability linked revolving credit facility, one of the first in the mining industry. 
By aligning our financial strategies and ESG performance, we are holding ourselves accountable in demonstrating Newmont's unwavering commitment to leading ESG practices. 
During the first quarter, our world-class portfolio produced 1.5 million ounces of gold and 317,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc, in line with our full year outlook and positioning Newmont to deliver a stronger performance as expected in the second half of the year. We generated significant operating cash flow of $841 million, and free cash flow of $442 million, of which $438 million is attributable to Newmont. And in March, we announced the acquisition of JT Gold, expanding our industry-leading project pipeline to include the Jatoba project, located in the highly sought-after golden District of British Columbia. 
We continue to apply a disciplined approach to our capital allocation priorities and deliver on our commitments. Yesterday, we declared a first quarter dividend of $0.55 per share, set within our established dividend framework and consistent with our fourth quarter dividend. Our first quarter dividend demonstrates our confidence in the strength of our business and continued commitment to predictable, stable and sustainable shareholder returns. We maintained a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2x and completed the redemption of our 2021 senior notes in April, reducing our debt outstanding by $550 million, with available cash. 
We also continue to invest in and develop our most profitable near-term projects, including Tanami Expansion 2, Ahafo North, the mining method change at Subika Underground and Yanacocha Sulfides. 
Shifting now to safety and our continued focus on fatality prevention on Slide 5. More than a year ago, Newmont made a symbolic change, stepping away from our industry's traditional use of a lagging personal injury rate in our bonus programs to measures that are focused on managing the critical controls that must be in place at all times to prevent fatalities. During the first quarter, we completed 65,000 conversations by leaders in the field that were focused on these critical controls, proactively identifying and managing potential risks that could lead to a fatality. This is an increase of nearly 60% since last quarter and demonstrates our commitment to the preventive measures we are implementing at Newmont. As another example, fatigue has been identified as a critical risk and is frequently a factor in our investigations into potentially fatal events. Fatigue has not been a traditional focus in our industry. Typically, it has been managed through administrative controls such as training and checklists. All companies have looked to technology as a silver bullet to address the issue. 
At an organizational level, we knew we needed to do more. We needed to make fundamental changes to our rosters, start times and accommodation to reduce this significant risk exposure. We have recently completed the construction of new care facilities as part of our Tanami 2 expansion. These facilities were designed to provide the opportunity for quality sleep, and have greatly reduced new times for our team members. We have also completed upgrades to care facilities at Yanacocha, Adesto, Cerner and Merian, ensuring our team members have the appropriate privacy and accommodation to get proper sleep. 
As a result of these investments in our care facilities, along with our well-being programs around our global portfolio, we have seen an 80% reduction in fatigue-related incidents at Newmont since 2019. We will continue to make these changes to ensure that our team members can return home safely to their families at the end of their shift at work. 
Turning now to our portfolio on Slide 6. Among our 12 operating mines and 2 joint ventures, we have 9 world-class assets, each of which delivers more than 500,000 gold equivalent ounces per year at all-in sustaining costs of less than $900 per ounce and with a mine life exceeding 10 years. Importantly, all are located in top-tier jurisdictions that we define as countries classified in the A and B ratings ranges by each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch. Underpinning our asset base are the industry's largest gold reserves, including 94 million ounces of gold and 65 million gold equivalent ounces from other metals. Our portfolio is also enhanced by the gold industry's best exploration pipeline of both greenfield and brownfield opportunities, managed through our proven integrated operating model. 
One of the benefits of this integration is that we do not reinvent the wheel and duplicate effort. For example, with the majority of our exploration activities occurring near existing operations, we have familiarity not only with the geology and terrain, but also the permitting, regulatory and community relationships surrounding each of our operations. We firmly believe that we have the best portfolio to generate sustainable returns from our world-class responsibly managed assets located in the best gold mining jurisdictions. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our portfolio will produce steady gold production of more than 6 million ounces per year through at least 2030, balanced across each of our 4 regions. This profile is then further enhanced by the production of more than 1 million gold equivalent ounces from silver, lead and zinc at Penasquito and copper at Boddington and Yanacocha. Combined, we will deliver nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces per year for the next decade, the most of any company in our industry. 
Moving to Slide 8 for a look at our project pipeline. Our project pipeline is unmatched in the gold industry and is one of the best in the mining industry. There is significant value to unlock as we optimize and advance our longer-term projects and lay the pathway to steady production and cash flow well into the 2040s. As you can see, in addition to our highly prospective gold projects, we have significant organic exposure to gold copper porphyries, including North Aviato, Medeon and Galore Creek. In fact, If you assume that just one of these 3 mega projects come into our production profile at the back end of this decade, Newmont's total production would be around 15% to 20% copper, providing us a natural exposure to a metal of growing importance for reducing carbon emissions and facilitating the ongoing transition to a new energy economy. It's also important to note that this pipeline does not include the various paybacks that will also extend mine life at our current open pit operations, including CCMV and Porcupine. You will also see that we have added to our project pipeline, another exciting gold copper asset that I'll cover in more detail on Slide 9. 
In March, we announced the acquisition of GT Gold. The consolidation of this asset is a demonstration of Newmont's clear focus on our long-term strategy to build a portfolio of world-class assets located in the world's best mining jurisdictions. Our initial equity investment in GT Gold in 2019 was a stepping start that enabled us to perform due diligence to the area and gain considerable insight into the potential of the Saddle North deposit and to Togo property. We are committed to continue building a constructive and respectful relationship with the Tow Town Nation, including the community at Miski. We understand and acknowledge that Tata ascent is necessary for advancing the Togo project, and we will partner with the Towson Nation at all levels and with the government of British Columbia to ensure a shared path forward. The deposit will be developed as an underground mine with a block cave mining method. And in addition, access from the valley floor that you can see in this picture, will also enable us to reach the ore body relatively quickly. A very important feature of this project is that the combination of an underground mine and an ability to leverage the hydropower infrastructure that's in place today will result in a low carbon intensity operation, supporting our industry-leading greenhouse gas reduction targets. The Tioga project, including the primary saddle North deposit, has the potential to contribute significant gold and copper annual production at attractive all-in sustaining costs over a long mine life. In addition to the known deposits of Saddle North, there are further exploration opportunities throughout the land package. The acquisition of Totoga adds to Newmont's existing interest in this area and builds on our 50% ownership in the Galore Creek project. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter, and we look forward to providing updates on this highly prospective project in the future. With that, I'll hand it over to Rob to discuss our operational performance on Slide 10."

Our assets in Africa delivered another strong performance in the first quarter. Achim maintained its momentum from quarter 4, delivering a strong first quarter from higher grade and improvements to the mill. We increased mill efficiency and overall plant performance during the first quarter, improving throughput by 3%, whilst also reducing energy consumption by 4%. These improvements are driven by full potential projects and are an example of how we continue to find innovative solutions even in our mature operations. The site is well positioned to deliver solid production throughout the year, expecting to reach its highest production and lowest cost during the fourth quarter. apo delivered higher surface tonnes mined due to mine sequencing improvements that resulted in an extra bench being mined at Awonsu, helping to offset lower grade during the first quarter. We continue to progress the development of our new mining method at Subika, sublevel shrinkage, which will increase tonnage, improve productivities and reduce mining costs. The team has commenced stoping ahead of schedule, and we completed our first 2 ore this month, a major milestone for the project. As the sublevel shrinkage project progresses during 2021, we expect to see improvements in grade throughout the year and a 50% increase in ore tons mined by the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect to reach higher ore grades from the open pit operations in the second half of the year, positioning to deliver a very strong for  2021. 
Finally, at apart, we continue to advance the permitting process with the Guinean EPA. I'm pleased to announce that we have completed the environmental tax study and paid the invoice for the main permit this month, putting us on track for a full funds decision in July of this year after the receipt of the tailings permit. All other aspects of this project are proceeding well. 
Turning to South America on Slide 12. South America has been the region most impacted by the virus, and we continue to see the most significant impacts in Argentina and Peru. We remain focused on our safety protocols to protect the health and well-being of our workforce and communities, as we continue to mitigate the impacts of travel restrictions caused by the virus. We do expect impact due to COVID to continue for some time until vaccinations are available and being administered in large quantities. Varian was the best-performing assets in South America despite heavy rainfall during the first quarter, which impacted product on the mine. The team continued to utilize an ore blending strategy to optimize mill performance, resulting in the increased tonnes process whilst maintaining stable base. As the year progresses, Teri will transition from softer separate line to harder ore, which will result in higher production through improved grades, but will be partially offset by lower mill throughput. In Senegal, we have continued to work closely with government representatives and other key stakeholders as we manage our operations through the evolving pandemic. As we reviewed the number of COVID cases in the country, and the increasing case numbers at our own site, we made the decision to temporarily sustain operations for 5 days in January and 7 days in March to reduce the spread of the virus. While these decisions impact first quarter production, the health and safety of our workforce remains our first priority. And despite stoppages during the quarter, we've been able to resume development at San Marcos and made good progress on the tailing storage facilities expansion. 
Dara ego continues to focus on safely ramping up site activities, increasing can capacity and appointing a new dedicated team to optimize the important and complex shift changes. Yanacocha has also experienced significant challenges due to core And due to the pandemic, productivity will likely be impacted throughout the year. Despite the challenges from the virus, Yanacocha delivered higher-grade material line from the Catcher Main and pits. These tonnes were placed on the leach pads during quarter 1, which we expect to result in higher production in future quarters. In February, we decommissioned the oxide mill and completed our transition to leach only operations as planned ahead of the development of Yanacocha sulfide, which will extend operations well beyond 2040. We continue to advance the sulfide project and are currently working through our internal peer review process in preparation for full funds approval later in the second half of 2021. Yanacocha is a world-class asset in Newmont's portfolio with significant further prospectivity, and we look forward to bringing you this next chapter in Yanacocha's long history of profitable production. 
Turning to North America, Slide 13. Penasquito delivered another strong performance and achieved record core product sales of nearly 300,000 gold equivalent ounces in the first quarter due to higher grades and recoveries. The site also set a new monthly record for concentrate transport and shipping, loading and selling over 125,000 tonnes in March. Bill potential continues to deliver improvements to our mining and mill performance at Penasquito. And as an example, we've increased the average payload for our haul trucks by 17 tonnes per load. This translates to an additional 12 million tonnes moved per year for next to zero cost, an increase of over 6%. The site is well positioned to remain a strong performer throughout 2021 and is also currently exploring our extensive land package for future development opportunities. CCMV delivered low grade and experienced geochemistry challenges during the first quarter. And as a result, all that was planned to be milled was redirect to the leach pad. Great improvements are expected during the second half of the year, helping to offset the challenges experienced this quarter. At Musselwhite, we continue to closely monitor the impacts from COVID in Ontario and have made the decision to temporarily suspend operations for 5 days in April to reduce the spread of the virus. Despite the impacts from COVID, with strong changes to the planned mining sequence, grade and ore tonnes mined continued to improve over the prior quarter. We are also continuing our full potential work at Muscat, with the largest focus on increasing development rates and driving productivity as the year-end progresses. 
At Porcupine, ongoing ground control rehabilitation in the oil on the underground mine, coupled with mill and equipment maintenance has resulted in more tonnes mined and processed during the quarter. We have begun the implementation of our full potential program in port time, which will deliver efficiency improvements in the second half of the year. NR continues to make strong improvements to performance and productivity, increasing underground development rates to an average of over 40 meters per day by the end of the first quarter. This is an improvement of 25% from 2020. In addition, the site has deployed teleremote marking equipment for the first time, increasing tonnes mined, efficiencies and the safety of our workforce. AR will continue to be a stable contributor during 2021 as we expect it to deliver steady production increases from higher tonnes mined and processed throughout the year. 
It's also important to note that the site is making good progress in the fight against COVID, and I'm pleased to report that 70% of Elior's workforce has been vaccinated so far. 
Turning to Australia on Slide 14. NMI delivered a consistent performance despite heavy rainfall, increasing ore tonnes mined during the quarter. For the rest of 2021, we will continue to monitor impacts of COVID on the Norman territory due to the potential closure of state and territory models but we expect that production will steadily increase its grade improves throughout the year. In addition, the team continues to advance Tanami Expansion 2, supporting the site's futures a long life low-cost and very efficient producer. We recently completed construction of the can facilities and the excavation of the upper section of the production shaft, putting us on track to deliver significant house cost and efficiency improvements in the first half of 2024. At Boddington, we delivered a solid quarter, in line with our expectations and full year guidance. Bin maintenance was completed during the first quarter, ensuring the plan continues to perform at high levels. As we head into the second half of the year, as highlighted in our previous guidance, we expect to achieve higher grades, improved throughput and increased ore tonnes mined due to efficiencies from autonomous outage and improved mill processing. As you can see in the picture, we are well on our way to operating the world's first open pit gold mine with an autonomous truck fleet, and I will provide more details of the project on Slide 15. I'm pleased to announce that the first Boddington AHS haul trucks went live in March of this year, and we have successfully started the first phase of our transition to a fully autonomous haulage group, which will improve safety and extend mine life at one of our core assets. Today, we are operating 4 trucks, all in ore from stockpiles to the crusher and then 4 additional trucks completed in the final testing. We expect to expand the use of autonomous units in the picture in the second quarter, deploying the entire fleet of 36 trucks by the end of September. 
As a reminder, the AHS project was approved in February of 2020, meaning the project was planned, constructed and able to achieve first production in just over a year. Being on track to deliver this project on time and on budget will be a huge accomplishment, especially during a global pandemic. And I'd like to thank our team at Boddington and our partners at Caterpillar, including their dealership waste track for their ongoing dedication and drive during such an unprecedented time. We have received very strong support from Caterpillar throughout the project, and we look forward to working together on future endeavors. In addition to the exceptional delivery of this project, we have already seen strong performance over the last month from these machines and the operating team. The fleet has been running nonstop since going live in March, eliminating stoppages from shop changes, mill and toil brakes, fatigue rigs, which increases its productivity. And already, the new vehicles have reached a first major milestone, moving over 1 million tonnes in license 6 weeks. It's also worth noting the significant productivity improvements that we will achieve with this fleet will also translate to lower fuel costs and consumption, reducing our carbon emissions at Boddington and supporting Newmont's climate initiatives. But most importantly, the use of these autonomous trucks reduces the exposure that our workforce has to potential vehicle interactions. helping us to further reduce fatality risks and to ensure that our team members return home safely at the end of their shift at work. The implementation of the industry's first autonomous haulage fleet will be a major milestone for Newmont and the gold industry as a whole. We will look to replicate this technology, training and experience at other sites around the globe, leveraging our team of experts and the lessons at Boart origin. And we will also look to integrate further autonomous solutions, both at future opening and undergrowing money. as we plan and develop the assets in our project pipeline, ensuring that these important improvements to safety and productivity are applied across the global business. And with that, I'll hand it over to Nancy on Slide 16. 
Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 17 for the financial highlights. During the first quarter, Newmont delivered solid results with $2.9 billion in revenue, an increase of nearly $300 million from the prior year quarter, driven by higher metal prices. Adjusted net income of $594 million or $0.74 per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.5 billion, an increase of 30% from the prior year quarter, and strong free cash flow of $442 million, which includes unfavorable working capital changes of over $325 million in the first quarter, primarily driven by nearly $400 million of tax payments attributable to 2020. We declared a first quarter dividend of $0.55 per share or $2.20 per share on an annualized basis, demonstrating our continued commitment to sustainable returns and consistent with our fourth quarter dividend. Our dividend puts Newmont in the top quartile of the S&P large-cap dividend payers and provides a yield of approximately 3.5% on our current share price. Turning to Slide 18 for a review of our adjusted earnings per share in more detail. First quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $538 million or $0.67 per share. Adjustments included $0.14 related to the unrealized mark-to-market losses on equity investments measured as of March 31. $0.05 primarily related to our sale of our interest in Cmax, which closed in January of this year, $0.01 related to reclamation and remediation adjustments at historical mining sites.and $0.03 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance. 
Taking these adjustments into account, we reported first quarter adjusted net income of $0.74 per diluted share an increase of $0.34 over the prior year quarter. One difference from 2020 that we would like to point out is that adjustments to net income do not include $21 million of incremental COVID costs. Adjusting for these costs would have resulted in $0.02 of additional net income in the first quarter, and we expect these costs to continue throughout the year as we protect against the impacts of the pandemic at our operational sites. 
Turning now to Slide 19. Using our conservative $1,200 gold price assumption, Newmont expects to generate $3.5 billion of free cash flow over a 5-year period. In addition, for every $100 increase in gold prices above our base assumption, Newmont delivers $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year. Newmont is the only company in the gold mining industry with the ability to generate these levels of attributable free cash flow, enabling us to maintain flexibility in our balance sheet for debt repayments and opportunistic M&A, in addition to providing industry-leading shareholder returns. 
Turning to Slide 20 for more details about our dividend. Our dividend framework provides shareholders with a stable base annualized dividend of $1 per share at a $1,200 gold price, along with the potential to receive 40% to 60% of the incremental attributable free cash flow generated at gold prices above our plan. This range provides Newmont with the flexibility to maintain a stable and consistent dividend payout, even when there are fluctuations in gold price. We will continue to review our dividend each quarter with management and our Board, evaluating gold prices and Newmont's projected performance semiannually to give us maximum flexibility in determining our dividend within the framework. The first quarter dividend declared yesterday was consistent with our fourth quarter dividend, calibrated at an $1,800 gold price assumption and a conservative 40% distribution of incremental free cash flow. Our dividend framework continues to be our primary vehicle for returning cash to our investors, and Newmont continues to lead the industry in shareholder returns, delivering $4.50 per share through dividends and share buybacks since 2019. 
Turning to Slide 21. We continue to drive the business with our clear capital allocation priorities, which include reinvesting in our business through disciplined investments in exploration and organic growth projects, returning cash to shareholders and maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. During the first quarter, we delivered on each of these priorities with our investments in the first autonomous haulage fleet in the gold mining industry, improving saving and productivity at Boddington, progressing our profitable reinvestment in the business at the Tanami expansion and advancing Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides, announcing the acquisition of GT Gold, maintaining our industry-leading dividend of $2.20 per share on an annualized basis and announcing a new $1 million share buyback program. We chose not to repurchase shares during the first quarter and continue to monitor for opportunities, maintaining a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2x and completing the redemption of our 2021 senior notes in April. reducing our debt outstanding by $550 million with available cash and maintaining financial flexibility with the completion of a $3 billion sustainability-linked revolving credit facility, one of the first in our industry and a demonstration of our commitment to leading ESG practices. 
Under the new facility, the company will incur pricing adjustments on drawn balances based on sustainability performance criteria, measured through ratings published by MSCI and S&P Global, aligning our financial strategies and our ESG performance. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results and free cash flow to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation. With that, I'll hand it back to Tom on Slide 22."

The areas that I'd be monitoring more closely on  labor -- risk of labor escalation is Australia, pretty iron ore market, as you see iron ore prices hit an all-time high, a West Australian government that is locking borders and encouraging the workforce to come from within that state, which puts pressure on the supply of labor. We're very fortunate. We've got very robust workplaces at both Boddingotn and Tanami, leadership, building levels of attrition and projects like autonomous haulage just mitigate that very significantly where we attract fleet and our labor force for frac traders wanted to greater source of the labor.

The intent of each investigation was to understand if any of our COVID critical controls require change and ensuring that we learn and share our findings globally. 
These losses have had a profound impact on the entire Newmont family. And it is with great humility that we are reminded that the safety and well-being of our workforce and host communities must come above all else.  
Turning to Slide 4 for a summary of our quarterly performance. Our safety and sustainability framework is at the core of how we manage our business. And I'm proud that Newmont continues to lead the industry with our ESG practices. 
In March, we delivered a first for the gold industry, with production coming from an autonomous haul fleet. Our investment in autonomous haul trucks not only improves safety and productivity at Boddington but also serves as a base case for replication at other operations and projects across the Newmont portfolio. 
We also entered into a $3 billion sustainability-linked revolving credit facility, one of the first in the mining industry.  
By aligning our financial strategy and ESG performance, we are holding ourselves accountable in demonstrating Newmont's unwavering commitment to leading ESG practices.  
During the first quarter, our world-class portfolio produced 1.5 million ounces of gold and 317,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc, in line with our full year outlook and positioning Newmont to deliver a stronger performance, as expected, in the second half of the year. 
We generated significant operating cash flow of $841 million, and free cash flow of $442 million, of which $438 million is attributable to Newmont. And in March, we announced the acquisition of GT Gold, expanding our industry-leading project pipeline to include the Tatogga project located in the highly sought-after Golden Triangle district of British Columbia.  
We continue to apply a disciplined approach to our capital allocation priorities and deliver on our commitments. Yesterday, we declared a first quarter dividend of $0.55 per share, set within our established dividend framework and consistent with our fourth quarter dividend. Our first quarter dividend demonstrates our confidence in the strength of our business and continued commitment to predictable, stable and sustainable shareholder returns. 
We maintained a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2x and completed the redemption of our 2021 senior notes in April, reducing our debt outstanding by $550 million with available cash.  
We also continue to invest in and develop our most profitable near-term projects, including Tanami Expansion 2, Ahafo North, the mining method change at Subika Underground and Yanacocha Sulfides.  
Shifting now to safety and our continued focus on fatality prevention on Slide 5. 
More than a year ago, Newmont made a symbolic change, stepping away from our industry's traditional use of a lagging personal injury rate in our bonus programs to measures that are focused on managing the critical controls that must be in place at all times to prevent fatalities. 
During the first quarter, we completed 65,000 conversations by leaders in the field that were focused on these critical controls, proactively identifying and managing potential risks that could lead to a fatality. This is an increase of nearly 60% since last quarter and demonstrates our commitment to the preventative measures we are implementing at Newmont. 
As another example, fatigue has been identified as a critical risk and is frequently a factor in our investigations into potentially fatal events. Fatigue has not been a traditional focus in our industry. Typically, it has been managed through administrative controls such as training and checklists. Well, companies have looked to technology as a silver bullet to address the issue.  
At an organizational level, we knew we needed to do more. We needed to make fundamental changes to our rosters, start times and accommodation to reduce this significant risk exposure. We have recently completed the construction of new care facilities as part of our Tanami 2 expansion. These facilities were designed to provide the opportunity for quality sleep and have greatly reduced commute times for our team members. We have also completed upgrades to care facilities at Yanacocha, Peñasquito, Cerro Negro and Merian, ensuring our team members have the appropriate privacy and accommodation to get proper sleep.  
As a result of these investments in our care facilities, along with our well-being programs around our global portfolio, we have seen an 80% reduction in fatigue-related incidents at Newmont since 2019. We will continue to make these changes to ensure that our team members can return home safely to their families at the end of their shift at work.  
Turning now to our portfolio on Slide 6. Among our 12 operating mines and 2 joint ventures, we have 9 world-class assets, each of which delivers more than 500,000 gold equivalent ounces per year at all-in sustaining costs of less than $900 per ounce and with a mine life exceeding 10 years. Importantly, all are located in top-tier jurisdictions that we define as countries classified in the A and B ratings ranges by each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch. Underpinning our asset base are the industry's largest gold reserves, including 94 million ounces of gold and 65 million gold equivalent ounces from other metals. 
Our portfolio is also enhanced by the gold industry's best exploration pipeline of both greenfield and brownfield opportunities managed through our proven integrated operating model. One of the benefits of this integration is that we do not reinvent the wheel and duplicate effort. For example, with the majority of our exploration activities occurring near existing operations, we have familiarity not only with the geology and terrain but also the permitting, regulatory and community relationships surrounding each of our operations. We firmly believe that we have the best portfolio to generate sustainable returns from our world-class, responsibly managed assets located in the best gold mining jurisdictions.  
Turning to Slide 7. Our portfolio will produce steady gold production of more than 6 million ounces per year through at least 2030, balanced across each of our 4 regions. This profile is then further enhanced by the production of more than 1 million gold equivalent ounces from silver, lead and zinc at Peñasquito and copper at Boddington and Yanacocha. Combined, we will deliver nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces per year for the next decade, the most of any company in our industry.  
Moving to Slide 8 for a look at our project pipeline. Our project pipeline is unmatched in the gold industry and is one of the best in the mining industry. There is significant value to unlock as we optimize and advance our longer-term projects and lay the pathway to steady production and cash flow well into the 2040s. 
As you can see, in addition to our highly prospective gold projects, we have significant organic exposure to gold-copper porphyries, including Norte Abierto, Nueva Unión and Galore Creek. In fact, if you assume that just one of these 3 mega projects come into our production profile at the back end of this decade, Newmont's total production would be around 15% to 20% copper, providing us a natural exposure to a metal of growing importance for reducing carbon emissions and facilitating the ongoing transition to a new energy economy. 
It's also important to note that this pipeline does not include the various laybacks that will also extend mine life at our current open pit operations, including Akyem, CC&V and Porcupine. 
You'll also see that we have added Tatogga to our project pipeline, another exciting gold/copper asset that I'll cover in more detail on Slide 9.  
In March, we announced the acquisition of GT Gold. The consolidation of this asset is a demonstration of Newmont's clear focus on our long-term strategy to build a portfolio of world-class assets located in the world's best mining jurisdictions. Our initial equity investment in GT Gold in 2019 was a stepping stone that enabled us to perform due diligence in the area and gain considerable insight into the potential of the Saddle North deposit in Tatogga property. 
We are committed to continue building a constructive and respectful relationship with the Tahltan Nation, including the community of Iskut. We understand and acknowledge that Tahltan consent is necessary for advancing the Tatogga project, and we will partner with the Tahltan Nation at all levels and with the government of British Columbia to ensure a shared path forward. 
The deposit will be developed as an underground mine with a block cave mining method. And in addition, access from the valley floor that you can see in this picture will also enable us to reach the ore body relatively quickly. 
A very important feature of this project is that the combination of an underground mine and an ability to leverage the hydropower infrastructure that's in place today will result in a low-carbon-intensity operation, supporting our industry-leading greenhouse gas reduction targets. 
The Tatogga project, including the primary Saddle North deposit, has the potential to contribute significant gold and copper annual production at attractive all-in sustaining costs over a long mine life. In addition to the known deposits of Saddle North, there are further exploration opportunities throughout the land package. 
The acquisition of Tatogga adds to Newmont's existing interest in this area and builds on our 50% ownership in the Galore Creek project. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter, and we look forward to providing updates on this highly prospective project in the future. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Rob to discuss our operational performance on Slide 10."

Before I start, I'd like to recognize that there is significant efforts that continue to be applied at all of our operations in order to manage COVID and to keep our teams safe and healthy. It is important to realize that this pandemic has some ways to run, and these efforts will need to continue for many months to come. 
Turning to Slide 11, I'll give an update on Africa's performance. 
Our assets in Africa delivered another strong performance in the first quarter. Akyem maintained its momentum from quarter 4, delivering a strong first quarter from higher grades and improvements to the mill. We increased mill efficiency and overall plant performance during the first quarter, improving throughput by 3% whilst also reducing energy consumption by 4%. These improvements are driven by full-potential projects and are an example of how we continue to find innovative solutions even at our mature operations. The site is well positioned to deliver solid production throughout the year, expecting to reach its highest production and lowest costs during the fourth quarter. 
Ahafo delivered higher surface tonnes mined due to mine sequencing improvements that resulted in an extra bench being mined at Awonsu, helping to offset lower grades during the first quarter. 
We continue to progress the development of our new mining method at Subika, sublevel shrinkage, which will increase tonnage, improve productivity and reduce mining costs. The team has commenced stoping ahead of schedule, and we completed our first 2 ore blasts this month, a major milestone for the project. 
As the sublevel shrinkage project progresses during 2021, we expect to see improvements in grades throughout the year and a 50% increase in ore tonnes mined by the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect to reach higher ore grades from the open pit operations in the second half of the year, positioning Ahafo to deliver a very strong finish in  2021.  
Finally, at Ahafo North, we continue to advance the permitting process with the Guinean EPA. I'm pleased to announce that we have completed the environmental impact study and paid the invoice for the main permit this month, putting us on track for a full funding decision in July of this year after the receipt of the tailings permit. All other aspects of this project are proceeding well.  
Turning to South America on Slide 12. South America has been the region most impacted by the virus, and we continue to see the most significant impacts in Argentina and Peru. We remain focused on our safety protocols to protect the health and well-being of our workforce and communities as we continue to mitigate the impacts of travel restrictions caused by the virus. We do expect the impacts due to COVID to continue for some time until vaccinations are available and be administered in large quantities. 
Merian was the best-performing asset in South America despite heavy rainfall during the first quarter, which impacted production within the mine. The team continued to utilize an ore blending strategy to optimize mill performance, resulting in increased tonnes processed whilst maintaining stable grades. As the year progresses, Merian will transition from softer saprolite to harder ore, which will result in higher production through improved grades but will be partially offset by lower mill throughput. 
In Cerro Negro, we have continued to work closely with government representatives and other key stakeholders as we manage our operations through the evolving pandemic. As we reviewed the number of COVID cases in the country and the increasing case numbers at our own site, we made the decision to temporarily suspend operations for 5 days in January and 7 days in March to reduce the spread of the virus. While these decisions impact first quarter production, the health and safety of our workforce remains our first priority. And despite stoppages during the quarter, we've been able to resume developments at San Marcos and made good progress on the tailing storage facilities expansion.  
Cerro Negro continues to focus on safely ramping up site activities, increasing camp capacity and appointing a new dedicated team to optimize the important and complex shift changes. 
Yanacocha has also experienced significant challenges due to COVID. And due to the pandemic, productivity will likely be impacted throughout the year. Despite the challenges from the virus, Yanacocha delivered higher-grade material mined from the Quecher Main and Carachugo pits. These tonnes were placed on the leach pads during quarter 1, which we expect to result in higher production in future quarters. 
In February, we decommissioned the oxide mill and completed our transition to leach-only operations as planned, ahead of the development of Yanacocha Sulfides, which will extend Yanacocha's operations well beyond 2040. We continue to advance the Sulfides project and are currently working through our internal peer review process in preparation for full funds approval later in the second half of 2021. 
Yanacocha is a world-class asset in Newmont's portfolio with significant further prospectivity, and we look forward to bringing you this next chapter in Yanacocha's long history of profitable production.  
Turning to North America, Slide 13. Peñasquito delivered another strong performance and achieved record co-product sales of nearly 300,000 gold equivalent ounces in the first quarter due to higher grades and recoveries. The site also set a new monthly record for concentrate transport and shipping, loading and selling over 125,000 tonnes in March. 
Full Potential continues to deliver improvements to our mining and mill performance at Peñasquito. And as an example, we've increased the average payload for our haul trucks by 17 tonnes per load. This translates to an additional 12 million tonnes moved per year for next to 0 cost, an increase of over 6%. The site is well positioned to remain a strong performer throughout 2021 and is also currently exploring our extensive land package for future development opportunities. 
CC&V delivered lower grades and experienced geochemistry challenges during the first quarter. And as a result, ore that was planned to be milled was redirected to the leach pads. Grade improvements are expected during the second half of the year, helping to offset the challenges experienced this quarter. 
At Musselwhite, we continue to closely monitor the impacts from COVID in Ontario and have made the decision to temporarily suspend operations for 5 days in April to reduce the spread of the virus. Despite the impacts from COVID, which drove changes to the planned mining sequence, grade and ore tonnes mined continued to improve over the prior quarter. We are also continuing our Full Potential work in Musselwhite, with the largest focus on increasing development rates and driving productivity as the year progresses.  
At Porcupine, ongoing ground control rehabilitation to the Hoyle Pond underground mine, coupled with mill and equipment maintenance, has resulted in more tonnes mined and processed during the quarter. We have begun the implementation of our Full Potential program in Porcupine, which will deliver efficiency improvements in the second half of the year. 
Éléonore continues to make strong improvements to performance and productivity, increasing underground development rates to an average of over 40 meters per day by the end of the first quarter. This is an improvement of 25% from 2020. In addition, the site has deployed teleremote marking equipment for the first time, increasing tonnes mined, efficiencies and the safety of our workforce. Éléonore will continue to be a stable contributor during 2021 as we expect it to deliver steady production increases from higher tonnes mined and processed throughout the year. 
It's also important to note that the site is making good progress in the fight against COVID, and I'm pleased to report that 70% of Éléonore workforce has been vaccinated so far.  
Turning to Australia on Slide 14. Tanami delivered a consistent performance despite heavy rainfall, increasing ore tonnes mined during the quarter. For the rest of 2021, we will continue to monitor impacts of COVID on the Northern Territory due to the potential closure of state and territory borders. But we expect their production will steadily increase as grade improves throughout the year. In addition, the team continues to advance Tanami Expansion 2, supporting the site's future as a long-life, low-cost and very efficient producer. 
We recently completed construction of the camp facilities and the excavation of the upper section of the production shaft, putting us on track to deliver significant ounce, cost and efficiency improvements in the first half of 2024. 
At Boddington, we delivered a solid quarter, in line with our expectations and full year guidance. Planned maintenance was completed during the first quarter, ensuring that the plan continues to perform at high levels. 
As we head into the second half of the year, as highlighted in our previous guidance, we expect to achieve higher grades, improved throughput and increased ore tonnes mined due to efficiencies from Autonomous Haulage and improved mill processing. As you can see in the picture, we are well on our way to operating the world's first open pit gold mine with an autonomous truck fleet, and I will provide more details on the project on Slide 15. 
I'm pleased to announce that the first Boddington AHS haul trucks went live in March of this year, and we have successfully started the first phase of our transition to a fully autonomous haulage fleet, which will improve safety and extend mine life at one of our core assets. Today, we are operating 4 trucks hauling ore from stockpiles to the crusher, and then 4 additional trucks completed the final testing. We expect to expand the use of autonomous units in the picture in the second quarter, deploying the entire fleet of 36 trucks by the end of September.  
As a reminder, the AHS project was approved in February of 2020, meaning the project was planned, constructed and able to achieve first production in just over a year. Being on track to deliver this project on time and on budget will be a huge accomplishment, especially during a global pandemic. And I'd like to thank our team at Boddington and our partners at Caterpillar, including their dealership, WesTrac, for their ongoing dedication and drive during such an unprecedented time. We have received very strong support from Caterpillar throughout the project, and we look forward to working together on future endeavors. 
In addition to the exceptional delivery of this project, we have already seen strong performance over the last month from these machines and the operating team. The fleet has been running nonstop since going live in March, eliminating stoppages from shift changes, mill and toil breaks, fatigue breaks, which increased its productivity. And already, the new vehicles have reached the first major milestone, moving over 1 million tonnes in less than 6 weeks. 
It's also worth noting the significant productivity improvements that we will achieve with this fleet will also translate to lower fuel costs and consumption, reducing our carbon emissions at Boddington and supporting Newmont's climate initiatives. 
But most importantly, the use of these autonomous trucks reduces the exposure that our workforce has to potential vehicle interactions, helping us to further reduce fatality risks and to ensure that our team members return home safely at the end of their shift at work. 
The implementation of the industry's first Autonomous Haulage fleet will be a major milestone for Newmont and the gold industry as a whole. We will look to replicate this technology, training and experience at other sites around the globe, leveraging our team of experts and the lessons that were learned at Boddington. And we will also look to integrate further autonomous solutions both at future open pits and on the [ newer mines ] as we plan and develop the assets in our project pipeline, ensuring that these important improvements to safety and productivity are applied across the global business. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Nancy on Slide 16."
291795,710008986,2263194,"Newmont Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 17 for the financial highlights. During the first quarter, Newmont delivered solid results with $2.9 billion in revenue, an increase of nearly $300 million from the prior year quarter, driven by higher metal prices; adjuste",878,"Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 17 for the financial highlights. 
During the first quarter, Newmont delivered solid results with $2.9 billion in revenue, an increase of nearly $300 million from the prior year quarter, driven by higher metal prices; adjusted net income of $594 million or $0.74 per diluted share; adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.5 billion, an increase of 30% from the prior year quarter; and strong free cash flow of $442 million, which includes unfavorable working capital changes of over $325 million in the first quarter primarily driven by nearly $400 million of tax payments attributable to 2020. 
We declared a first quarter dividend of $0.55 per share or $2.20 per share on an annualized basis, demonstrating our continued commitment to sustainable returns and consistent with our fourth quarter dividend. Our dividend puts Newmont in the top quartile of the S&P large-cap dividend payers and provides a yield of approximately 3.5% on our current share price. 
Turning to Slide 18 for a review of our adjusted earnings per share in more detail. First quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $538 million or $0.67 per share. Adjustments included $0.14 related to the unrealized mark-to-market losses on equity investments measured as of March 31; $0.05 primarily related to our sale of our interest in TMAC, which closed in January of this year; $0.01 related to reclamation and remediation adjustments at historical mining sites; and $0.03 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance.  
Taking these adjustments into account, we reported first quarter adjusted net income of $0.74 per diluted share an increase of $0.34 over the prior year quarter. 
One difference from 2020 that we would like to point out is that adjustments to net income do not include $21 million of incremental COVID costs. Adjusting for these costs would have resulted in $0.02 of additional net income in the first quarter, and we expect these costs to continue throughout the year as we protect against the impacts of the pandemic at our operational sites.  
Turning now to Slide 19. Using our conservative $1,200 gold price assumption, Newmont expects to generate $3.5 billion of free cash flow over a 5-year period. In addition, for every $100 increase in gold prices above our base assumption, Newmont delivers $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year. 
Newmont is the only company in the gold mining industry with the ability to generate these levels of attributable free cash flow, enabling us to maintain flexibility in our balance sheet for debt repayments and opportunistic M&A, in addition to providing industry-leading shareholder returns.  
Turning to Slide 20 for more details about our dividend. Our dividend framework provides shareholders with a stable base annualized dividend of $1 per share at a $1,200 gold price, along with the potential to receive 40% to 60% of the incremental attributable free cash flow generated at gold prices above our plan. This range provides Newmont with the flexibility to maintain a stable and consistent dividend payout even when there are fluctuations in gold price. 
We will continue to review our dividend each quarter with management and our Board, evaluating gold prices and Newmont's projected performance semiannually to give us maximum flexibility in determining our dividend within the framework. 
The first quarter dividend declared yesterday was consistent with our fourth quarter dividend calibrated at an $1,800 gold price assumption and a conservative 40% distribution of incremental free cash flow. Our dividend framework continues to be our primary vehicle for returning cash to our investors, and Newmont continues to lead the industry in shareholder returns, delivering $4.50 per share through dividends and share buybacks since 2019.  
Turning to Slide 21. We continue to drive the business with our clear capital allocation priorities, which include reinvesting in our business through disciplined investments in exploration and organic growth projects, returning cash to shareholders and maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. 
During the first quarter, we delivered on each of these priorities with our investments in the first Autonomous Haulage fleet in the gold mining industry, improving safety and productivity at Boddington; progressing our profitable reinvestment in the business at the Tanami expansion and advancing Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides; announcing the acquisition of GT Gold; maintaining our industry-leading dividend of $2.20 per share on an annualized basis and announcing a new $1 billion share buyback program -- we chose not to repurchase shares during the first quarter and continue to monitor for opportunities; maintaining a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2x and completing the redemption of our 2021 senior notes in April; reducing our debt outstanding by $550 million with available cash; and maintaining financial flexibility with the completion of a $3 billion sustainability-linked revolving credit facility, one of the first in our industry and a demonstration of our commitment to leading ESG practices. 
Under the new facility, the company will incur pricing adjustments on drawn balances based on sustainability performance criteria measured through ratings published by MSCI and S&P Global, aligning our financial strategies and our ESG performance. 
As we look ahead to the second quarter, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results and free cash flow to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Tom on Slide 22."

When we think about making investments like Yanacocha Sulfides, we think about making investments which were, for a project by sulphides, literally for decades with the quality of the sulphide deposit in and around the Yanacocha property. 
So we'll look and understand these events coming up in the next month or 2 that will factor into our process of internal discussions with our Board and our joint venture partners.

And Rob mentioned in Cerro Negro now they're dedicated to managing shift changes, which is a very, very complex process in Argentina, and how you're doing all your screening and monitoring and ensuring that they're bringing up the workforce in for their shift, but that they're clear of the virus and quarantine if we do have a case. So it's really monitoring those 2 operations. Mexico as a country is still struggling with the virus, but we've got very, very good protocols in place throughout that country. 
The United States, fortunately, is starting to really turn the tide. We've seen the recent events in Ontario. I'm confident that the Canadian government will address those. Through Australia and Ghana, we're seeing the pandemic managed very, very well. 
So I think we're still going to need to be -- have a chronic unease and be continuing to maintain the discipline around our protocols. As vaccines become available, encouraging our workforce to take the vaccines, supporting the governments where we can with COVID out so that we can have an improving trend over time.

We include an assumption for labor escalation in our budgets, and then we flow that through to our guidance. So we've got some provision for that. 
The key indicator -- leading indicator I look for in seeing whether we may be seeing some wage pressure is voluntary attrition. It's pretty healthy across our business. Some way, our response to the pandemic and the fact that we chose and we continue to choose to manage the health and safety of our workforce and local communities above everything else has served us well in terms of the support that we have from our workforce. 
But the areas that I'd be monitoring more closely on  labor -- risk of labor escalation is Australia. Pretty hot iron ore market as you see iron ore prices hit an all-time high, a West Australian government that is locking borders and encouraging the workforce to come from within that state, which puts pressures on the supply of labor. 
We're very fortunate we've got very robust workplaces at both Boddington and Tanami, good leadership. Healthy levels of attrition and projects like Autonomous Haulage just mitigate that very significantly where your truck fleet and a labor force of truck fleet is one of the greatest source of the labor. 
So I'm monitoring intently, but the voluntary attrition numbers and leading indicators are still pretty healthy across our business."

So it's accommodated within our $1 billion a year of sustaining capital and the $600 million to $800 million on average on development capital. So that's -- it's not big money in the overall scheme of things. it's about having the intent and the will to do something in this space. 
In terms of productivity improvements around staff finish times and ensuring that fatigue breaks, the length of shifts, number of consecutive shifts, the length of time that somebody can work, in my experience, you have that payback in dividends many times over by getting the right level of rest amongst your workforce so that they are working productively when they, in fact, work. So the things we're doing around roster staff times and the like will improve their productivity over time is my expectation rather than be a cost to the business."

In May, Newmont celebrated its 100th birthday, marking a major milestone in our company's long history of creating value and improving lives through sustainable and responsible mining. An",1704,"Thanks, Eric. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our call. In May, Newmont celebrated its 100th birthday, marking a major milestone in our company's long history of creating value and improving lives through sustainable and responsible mining. And while our organization has certainly evolved, our strategy remains clear. We are focused on delivering value to all of our stakeholders from our world-class portfolio of long-life, responsibly managed assets located in the best gold mining jurisdictions. 
Turning to Slide 4 for a summary of our quarterly performance. During the second quarter, Newmont produced 1.45 million ounces of gold and over 300,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc, as we build momentum for a strong second half of the year. 
We generated operating cash flow of nearly $1 billion and free cash flow of $578 million, of which 97% is attributable to Newmont. 
In May, we completed the acquisition of GT Gold, consolidating our position in the highly prospective Golden Triangle district of British Columbia. 
And last week, we announced the approval of our Ahafo North project, expanding our existing footprint in Ghana and adding more than 3 million ounces of gold production over a 13-year mine life. This project is expected to deliver an internal rate of return of over 30% at current gold prices and offers exciting exploration opportunities throughout the land package. 
Supported by our leading portfolio of operations and projects, we continue to apply a disciplined approach to our capital allocation priorities. Even after the redemption of our 2021 senior notes in April and the completion of the GT Gold acquisition, we have $7.6 billion in total liquidity. We have sustained a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2x, maintaining our financial flexibility whilst we continue to reinvest in our business and return cash to our shareholders. 
Yesterday, we declared a second quarter dividend of $0.55, maintaining an industry-leading dividend yield of over 3.5%. Set within our established framework, our second quarter dividend demonstrates our confidence in the strength of both our portfolio and our operating model to generate sustainable, long-term value. 
In June, we published 2 important ESG-focused reports that touch every part of our business and our operations. The first was our 17th Annual Sustainability Report, which continues to provide a transparent and detailed look at our ESG performance, focusing on the issues and metrics that matter most to our stakeholders. 
The second was our first Climate Strategy Report, which focuses on our approach to achieving our science-based climate targets and aligns with the reporting guidelines from the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. 
These reports outline the key sustainability strategies that are embedded in our business and our culture at Newmont. 
Turning to Slide 5. Newmont is broadly recognized for our robust and disciplined practices when it comes to sustainability reporting, both within our sector and among all corporate reporters. And our long history of taking a leading approach to environmental, social and governance practices has positioned us as the gold sector's recognized sustainability leader. 
Newmont's strong ESG performance creates long-term value for our stakeholders and drive superior business results through delivering safer, more efficient and reliable operations, greater productivity from well managed resources, the ability to operate effectively in a broad range of jurisdictions, a proactive approach to managing risks and emerging issues and, most importantly, a reputation built on trust-based relationships and a track record of delivering on our commitments. 
Earlier this month, we hosted a webcast to provide an overview of our ESG journey, what we have done well, where we have learned lessons and our plans for continued improvement. If you weren't able to join us, I would invite you to listen to the replay, which is posted on our website. 
Turning now to Slide 6. Newmont is the world's leading gold producer with an unmatched portfolio of world-class, long-life operations. Among our 12 operating mines and 2 joint ventures, we have 9 world-class assets, each of which delivers more than 500,000 gold equivalent ounces per year, at all-in sustaining costs of less than $900 per ounce and with a mine life exceeding 10 years. 
And we believe that where we choose to operate matters. It is important to note that all of our world-class assets are located in top-tier jurisdictions, that we define as countries classified in the A and B ratings ranges by each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch. 
Newmont has the best portfolio of assets located in the most favorable gold mine in jurisdictions that when coupled with the quality of our people and our integrated operating model positions us to generate sustainable returns for decades to come. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our portfolio will produce steady gold production of more than 6 million ounces per year through until at least 2030, balanced across each of our 4 regions. This profile is further enhanced by the production of more than 1 million gold equivalent ounces from silver, lead and zinc at Peñasquito and copper at Boddington and Yanacocha. Combined, we will deliver nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces per year for the next decade, the most of any company in our industry. 
Moving to Slide 8. Our project pipeline is unmatched in the gold industry and is one of the best in the mining industry. There is significant value to unlock as we optimize and advance our longer-term projects and lay the pathway to steady production and cash flow well into the 2040s. 
We continue to advance our midterm projects, including Yanacocha Sulfides, where we are preparing for full funds approval in December of this year. With a multi-decade mine life that provides exposure to gold, copper and silver, the sulfide project generates profitable production and offers additional upside to extend mine life at this cornerstone asset. 
We are also executing the second expansion project at Tanami. Through the development of a 1.6 kilometer deep production shaft and supporting infrastructure, this project supports the site's future as a long-life and low-cost producer, and it also provides a platform for us to further explore a prolific mineral endowment in the Tanami district. 
And as mentioned previously, we are pleased to announce the funding for the development of Ahafo North has been approved, and this project has now advanced into the execution phase. 
Turning to the next slide for some more details. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved full funding for the Ahafo North project, expanding our existing footprint in Ghana and adding more than 3 million ounces of gold production over an initial 13-year mine life. 
Located approximately 30 kilometers north of our existing Ahafo South operations, the Ahafo North project will include 4 open pit mines and the construction of a stand-alone mill to produce approximately 300,000 ounces per year at very attractive forward-sustaining costs. The project is expected to deliver an internal rate of return of over 30% at current gold prices. 
Ahafo North is a significant gold mine by any measure. We have conducted extensive regulatory and community engagements, including meetings with traditional leaders and local government agencies and public forums to ensure that we earn and maintain social acceptance throughout Ahafo North life cycle. We will work to create lasting value for host communities through enhanced local sourcing and hiring. 
One key aspect of Ahafo North is our workforce planning, which includes a target to achieve gender parity in the workforce when operations begin. We are very excited about progressing Ahafo North and look forward to bringing you updates as we develop this new mine over the next 2 years. 
Turning to Slide 10. The global pandemic has and will continue to challenge all of us for some time to come. And our commitment to protect the health and safety of our workforce and host communities remains our top priority. We believe that the COVID-19 vaccine is critical in combating the spread of the virus. We are encouraging our workforce to get vaccinated as soon as they become eligible, and we are working with our local communities and host governments to improve availability and deployment at all of our managed operations. These efforts are supported by our global community support fund, which is seeking to help the vaccine rollout, vaccine education and awareness campaigns. 
We are seeing some of the highest vaccination rates in the United States and Canada, largely due to the widespread and early availability in these countries. But until the vaccine is available to everyone around the world, our people and operations will continue to be affected by this virus. And recent outbreaks have shown just how difficult this pandemic continues to be, testing our protocols and the resilience of our people and systems. 
The impacts of the pandemic are also driving cost inflation around the globe. We are now expecting cost escalation of around 3% to 5% for materials, energy and labor. And we expect these pressures to continue through at least the end of next year. We are currently working on our 2022 business plan, ensuring that the higher cost [indiscernible] or and the application of our wide-ranging controls and [indiscernible] are built into our assumptions going forward. 
However, despite the impacts of COVID, we remain in line with our guidance ranges. As a reminder, our guidance ranges are plus or minus 5% from the midpoint we published in December 2020. We are on track to achieve the midpoint to low end of production and the midpoint to high end for costs. Production remains back-half weighted for the year, with approximately 53% expected in the second half of the year. 
As a reminder, our cost guidance assumes a $1,200 gold price. At today's gold prices, you can expect an additional $20 to $30 per ounce for production taxes and royalties. 
As we look ahead towards the second half of this year, we will remain diligent and supportive of vaccination efforts that are urgently needed around the world. And we encourage everyone to get their vaccine as soon as they are eligible, ensuring that we are all doing our part to end this global pandemic. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob Atkinson for a more detailed look at our global projects and operations. Over to you, Rob."

Turning to Slide 12, I'll give an update on our regional performance, starting with Africa. Our team delivered another strong performance during the second quarter as higher ore grades from changes in sequencing largely offset more tons mined due to challenges with shovel availability. The site is well positioned to deliver solid production throughout the year, expecting to reach its highest production during the fourth quarter. 
Ahafo continues to be a solid contributor, delivering higher grade material from our underground operations to offset unplanned mill maintenance and power outages. 
At Subika, we continue to progress the development of our new underground mining method, sublevel shrinkage, and we expect to see steady increases in grade and underground ore tons mined in the second half of the year. 
In addition, we expect to reach higher ore grades from the open pit operations in quarter 3 and 4, positioning Ahafo to deliver a strong finish to 2021. 
And after finalizing the permitting process with the Guinean EPA, our Board of Directors approved full funding of the Ahafo North project earlier this month. Spending will ramp up in the second half of the year and all critical path equipment orders have been placed in support of initial construction activities to ensure timely execution of the project. The development of this prolific ore body will leverage our proven operating model, with the project and resulting mine receiving functional and technical support from our existing world-class Ahafo South operation as we create the next generation of mining in Ghana. 
Turning to Slide 13. Tanami delivered solid results in the second quarter as higher ore grades more than offset unplanned mill maintenance and longer-haul distances from the bottom of the mine. 
In late June, we detected our first positive COVID case at Tanami. Working closely with government representatives and other key stakeholders, we rapidly made the decision to place the site on care and maintenance beginning on June 26 to reduce the spread of the virus and protect the health of our workforce and communities right across Australia. I'd like to thank our team in Australia for the rapid response and courageous decisions during such an extraordinary and dynamic set of circumstances. And I'm proud of the resilience and strength of our workforce as we continue to learn from and manage the impacts and consequences of this virus. 
Although our second quarter was largely unaffected, we are forecasting a 40,000 to 50,000 ounce impact for the remainder of the year as a result of the care and maintenance [indiscernible]. 
We began ramping up out of care maintenance on July 13. And today, Tanami is now operating at 90%. And despite the impacts from COVID, we continue to advance Tanami Expansion 2. During the second quarter, we progressed the hoist structure and our work on the mine shaft, remaining on track to deliver significant ounce, cost and efficiency improvements in the first half of 2024. 
Boddington achieved near-record quarterly mill performance, reaching nearly 11 million tons processed during the second quarter. And we continue to expand the use of the gold industry's first autonomous haul fleet. And today, we are operating 20 trucks in the south pit. And we remain on track to deploy the entire fleet of 36 trucks by the end of quarter 3. The efficiencies from autonomous haulage, coupled with improved performance from the mill, will continue to drive performance at Boddington. 
The improved mill performance helped to offset lower tons mined from ongoing shovel reliability and geotechnical challenges in the south pit which has the potential to impact our ability to reach as much of the higher grades as we have planned in the second half of the year. 
Turning to Slide 14. Peñasquito delivered another consistent quarter as we continue to execute on our planned full potential enhancements, and the most recent improvements in metal recovery rates will continue to support planned delivery into the future. The work we've done to optimize Peñasquito since we acquired the site in 2019 demonstrates our ability to successfully operate and enhance value at large, complex, open pit mine. The site is well positioned to remain a strong performer throughout 2021 as we continue to realize higher-than-planned tons mined and improved recoveries in the [ FireEye reach ] plant. 
CC&V delivered lower tons mined due to unplanned fleet maintenance. And the site continued to experience geochemistry challenges during the second quarter, resulting in lower grades and recovery. Mill performance was offset by higher leach pad recoveries, and grade improvements are expected during the second half of the year, helping to partially overcome some of the challenges experienced in the first and second quarter. 
At Porcupine, mill and ongoing equipment maintenance has resulted in lower tons mined and processed during the quarter. As we look towards the second half of the year, we expect underground development and grades will improve. 
And last month, our full potential program identified 20 initiatives at Porcupine, which will deliver efficiency improvements in the coming months. 
As mentioned previously, we continue to closely monitor the impacts from COVID at Musselwhite. In April, we made the decision to temporarily suspend operations for 5 days to reduce the spread of the virus, resulting in mill stoppages, reduced underground development and more personnel at site in late April and early May. We expect that these challenges will persist in the second half of the year, and we are continuing our full potential work at Musselwhite, focused on increasing development rates and driving productivity. 
Eleonore delivered another strong quarter as development rates and mill throughput continued to improve over the prior quarter and prior year, offsetting the impact of lower personnel in site due to COVID. In addition, the site continues to increase the use of tele-remote mucking equipment, which have helped to increase tons mined and drive important improvements to safety and efficiency. Eleonore will continue to be a solid contributor during 2021 as we expect to sustain consistent production from stable tons mined and processed throughout the year. 
Turning to Slide 15. Despite heavy rainfall in the second quarter, Merian remains a strong performer in the South American region. The site continues to utilize an ore blending strategy to optimize mill performance. And during the second quarter, Merian delivered lower throughput as the site focused on processing harder, higher-grade ore. 
In the second half of the year, Merian will continue to transition from softer saprolite to harder ore, resulting in higher production from improved grades and steady throughput. 
Cerro Negro continues to improve productivity and performance as the site continues to manage through the evolving pandemic. During the second quarter, Cerro Negro delivered higher ore grades. And despite reduced personnel from COVID, the site continues to increase ore tons mined and processed each quarter. 
Due to the pandemic, Cerro Negro has delivered low development rates over the past year, limiting access to high-grade ore in the late 2021 and into 2022. However, the site is progressing future growth projects such as the development of San Marcos and exploration in the Eastern District. 
Yanacocha has also experienced significant challenges due to the pandemic, impacting productivity through the year. Yet, despite the challenges from the virus, Yanacocha delivered higher grades and recovery from the leach pad in addition to an increase in grade and ore tons mined from the Carachugo open pit. 
As we look towards the second half of the year, the Yanacocha will focus on optimal ore placement and leach pads as the site has transitioned to leach-only operations ahead of the development of Yanacocha Sulfides. 
The Yanacocha Sulfides project has the potential to extend Yanacocha's world-class operations well beyond 2040, adding profitable production from one of the largest and most prolific gold districts in South America for decades to come. And despite potential impacts from the elections in Peru and the impacts of COVID, the project is progressing well. The team is focused on critical path activities such, as advanced engineering and procurement, as we prepare for full funds approval in December of this year. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Nancy on Slide 16."

Turning to Slide 17 for the financial highlights. Newmont delivered strong performance in the second quarter with over $3 billion in revenue, an increase of $700 million from the prior year quarter, driven by higher sales volumes and metal",794,"Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 17 for the financial highlights. 
Newmont delivered strong performance in the second quarter with over $3 billion in revenue, an increase of $700 million from the prior year quarter, driven by higher sales volumes and metal prices; adjusted net income of $670 million or $0.83 per diluted share; adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.6 billion, an increase of over 60% in the prior year quarter; and strong free cash flow of $578 million, also an increase of about 50% from Q2 of 2020. 
Yesterday, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, an increase of $0.30 or 120% over the prior year quarter. 
With a yield of over 3.5% at our current share price, Newmont is among the top 10% of the S&P's large-cap dividend payers. 
Turning to Slide 18 for a review of our adjusted earnings per share in more detail. Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $640 million or $0.80 per share. Adjustments included $0.03 related to the unrealized mark-to-market gains on equity investments, $0.02 related to reclamation and remediation adjustments at historical mining sites, $0.02 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance and $0.02 of other charges. Taking these adjustments into account, we reported second quarter adjusted net income of $0.83 per diluted share, an increase of almost 160% or $0.51 over the prior year quarter. 
As a reminder, due to our status as a U.S. GAAP filer, our adjustments to net income do not include $19 million of incremental costs incurred this quarter as a result of the COVID pandemic. Adjusting for these costs would have resulted in approximately $0.02 of additional net income per share in the second quarter, and we expect these costs to continue throughout the year as we prioritize the health and safety of our workforce and local communities. 
Turning now to Slide 19. Under our conservative $1,200 gold price assumption, Newmont expects to generate $3.5 billion of attributable free cash flow over a 5-year period. In addition, for every $100 increase in gold prices above our base assumption, Newmont delivers $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year. Newmont is the only company in the gold mining industry with the ability to generate these levels of attributable free cash flow, allowing us to balance steady reinvestment in the business, continue to strengthen our balance sheet and also provide superior shareholder returns to our industry-leading dividend framework and opportunistic share buybacks. 
Turning to Slide 20 for more about our dividend. Our dividend framework provides shareholders with a stable base annualized dividend of $1 per share at a $1,200 gold price, along with the potential to receive 40% to 60% of the incremental attributable free cash flow generated at gold prices above our plan. We will continue to review our dividend each quarter with management and our Board evaluating our operational and financial performance and outlook semiannually to give us maximum flexibility in determining our dividend within the framework. 
The dividend declared yesterday was consistent with our first quarter dividend, calibrated at an $1,800 gold price assumption and a 40% distribution of incremental free cash flow. Our second quarter dividend demonstrates our confidence in our future outlook and our ability to maintain capital discipline. 
Turning to Slide 21. We continue to drive the business with our clear capital allocation priorities, which include reinvesting in our business through disciplined investments in exploration and organic growth projects, maintaining our financial strength and flexibility and returning cash to shareholders. During the second quarter, we delivered on each of these priorities by progressing our profitable reinvestment in the business, particularly with the execution of the Tanami expansion, the approval of Ahafo North and the advancement of Yanacocha Sulfides; investing in exploration with 55 drill rigs working around the globe; completing the GT Gold transaction in May of this year; maintaining our industry-leading dividend established within our framework to provide stable and predictable returns; repurchasing 2.4 million shares, translating to approximately $150 million of our $1 billion share buyback program; and maintaining a strong balance sheet with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2x, giving us the flexibility to reduce our debt outstanding by $550 million with available cash and still maintain cash balances of $4.6 billion at the end of the quarter. 
We are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results and free cash flow to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation. The progress we made in the first and second quarter enabled Newmont to return over $1 billion to shareholders in the first half of this year while we continue to reinvest in our business and support our operations with a strong and flexible balance sheet. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Tom on Slide 22."

And Tanami is now back up at about 90%. So it's 2 weeks plus a few days. 
But the biggest worry we've got in Australia is that each one of the states and territories have got different rules and regulations. And they're not necessarily allowing free travel between the states and the quarantine and we've obviously got people that work at the different states. So that's a risk moving forward that we're carefully watching and carefully managing in Australia. 
But really, in terms of the biggest area which we're still worried about is South America. It's that, by far and away, that's where we've had the biggest impact. Certainly, in Cerro Negro, we've had several key outbreaks and we've had to shut down several times in the second quarter. But vaccines are starting to get through there. And building up in similar in Yanacocha, the vaccines are coming through. 
But it's the absenteeism, Tyler, which is the biggest unpredictable thing that you can sometimes have shovel operators away, you can have mill operators away and that causes the biggest challenge. But certainly with the vaccines in that part of the world, that's certainly very positive for us. 
In terms of Canada, I mentioned about Musselwhite that we had that week in April and May where we had to go into care and maintenance. So that had a significant impact. But again, in each one of the Canadian sites, the level of absenteeism has sometimes been 3 or 4x higher than what we've typically had, and that really impacts the development, et cetera. 
And the key thing that I want to get across is that the sites are actually managing the situation very, very well, but it is the unpredictability of the virus. And that's the challenge we've got. But with the vaccines coming on, we're certainly very hopeful that, that will reduce. But it's a very difficult question to actually put your finger on."

So we're very excited about the potential of the Yanacocha. We see Yanacocha as a cornerstone asset in the a key district that we want to be in for a very long time. And it's gold and copper, which we're excited about. 
So if the opportunity -- when we think about M&A activity, we look at where we can consolidate in districts like we did with GT Gold in the Golden Triangle over the earlier part of this year.

Certainly, as we look to 2022 and now and update our long-term guidance in December, we're certainly seeing that cost pressure that I was just talking with Greg about. 
And on the development capital side, we have built into the Tanami and we've built into the Ahafo North our understanding of where cost is, and that's accommodated within the outlook we've given for both those projects. 
We are continuing to derisk Yanacocha Sulfides, where we are on a critical path. We are getting -- ensuring we get factory slots and process for some different critical path items, for instance, oxygen plants and the like. So we're making sure we're managing that process ahead of the full funds decision so that when we come out with, hopefully, a full funds decision in December that the -- what we guided to is accommodating some of those capital cost inflationary pressures. 
And then the on the development capital side as the guide, I'd say less the inflationary pressures, more the sequence of those projects, as you've got a different COVID impact.

Next step for us will be to see how he assembles his cabinet. And then when we know who we can engage with and understand that we're about to embark upon a couple of billion dollar investment in their country. I think -- I think it's clear that they acknowledge the importance of mining to Peru's economy and a country that's probably the worst hit from the pandemic around the world. And so the opportunity to have an investment into the mining industry, that's going to help the Peruvian economy. I'm optimistic that, that discussion will be well received as we can start engaging with the new cabinet. 
We've been in Peru for 30 years. Yanacocha Sulfides will position us to be in Peru for at least another 30 or 40 years. So we are taking a very long-term view on this decision. But pleased to see that we've got a decision in the election, which will allow us then to start engaging over the next 6 months with some of those key leaders in government."

And we're seeing that impact in terms of operators and main part for the mine, again, in particularly, you've got the [indiscernible] operations that is being able to switch from one plan to another. So we are -- we are seeing those pressures heating up market in Canada. 
And very similar in Western Australia where you've got a very significant boom happening on the back of record iron ore prices. So very high demand, both in the construction of the expansions to -- the expansion of those iron mines to maintain throughput. There are high demand for operators maintainers and technical people, so professionals. 
in an environment that Rob was talking about earlier where the state governments, the provincial governments in Australia are constantly opening and closing borders. And so there's a real push on to the pulling out of the state so that you've got that reliability of your start being within state. 
And we're likely to have in Australia those interstate pressures or still some time to come given their slow take-up of the vaccination, which is certainly they're paying the price for now with the Delta strain of the virus. 
One of the things that we are doing which is going to significantly offset the pressure on operators in particular is the implementation of autonomous haulage at Boddington. If you think about a fleet of 36 [ trucks ] across 4 shifts and then the additional number of people you have to cover shift breaks and annual leave and those sorts of things, you're talking of the order of 180 people that are no longer needed to drive trucks because they're running autonomously. And that takes some pressure out of the system in terms of that labor pressure for operators and maintaining it. 
There's lots of projects in both those countries and limited supply on both professionals and operators and maintenance. Rob, do you have anything you want to add?"

Obviously, the young [indiscernible] huge presence in [indiscernible] market and our community has grown substantially over time. There have been challenges for sure with regard to delivery of value coming from the central government in the form of taxes as to where that money gets distributed. And over time, they've -- with different administrations, you've seen more or less tons come back into the region. Obviously, we value through extensive employment, local hiring, local content. 
And I would say, honestly, that as hard hit as Peru and Cajamarca have been in this COVID pandemic environment, our relationship has really strengthened during this period of time. In fact, we just had a vaccination clinic open out our offices in Cajamarca, and I believe it's the only mining company that's been able to do that in Peru to date. 
So our intention certainly is and has been to focus on the value provided to our stakeholders in Cajamarca, our relationship, not only with the many communities throughout our operation, but also with the regional government continues to strengthen. Our intention would be, throughout this process, to continue to work with them to find ways, especially as we look at moving forward with sulfides, in maximizing that value. Certainly, we want to partner with the central government on determining how to best provide a return of those dollars back into the community.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining our call. In May, Newmont celebrated its 100th birthday, marking a major milestone in our company's long history of creating value and improving lives through sustainable and responsible mining. An",1704,"Thanks, Eric. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our call. In May, Newmont celebrated its 100th birthday, marking a major milestone in our company's long history of creating value and improving lives through sustainable and responsible mining. And while our organization has certainly evolved, our strategy remains clear. We are focused on delivering value to all of our stakeholders from our world-class portfolio of long-life, responsibly managed assets located in the best gold mining jurisdictions.  
Turning to Slide 4 for a summary of our quarterly performance. During the second quarter, Newmont produced 1.45 million ounces of gold and over 300,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc, as we build momentum for a strong second half of the year. We generated operating cash flow of nearly $1 billion and free cash flow of $578 million, of which 97% is attributable to Newmont.  
In May, we completed the acquisition of GT Gold, consolidating our position in the highly prospective Golden Triangle district of British Columbia. And last week, we announced the approval of our Ahafo North project, expanding our existing footprint in Ghana and adding more than 3 million ounces of gold production over a 13-year mine life. This project is expected to deliver an internal rate of return of over 30% at current gold prices and offers exciting exploration opportunities throughout the land package.  
Supported by our leading portfolio of operations and projects, we continue to apply a disciplined approach to our capital allocation priorities. Even after the redemption of our 2021 senior notes in April and the completion of the GT Gold acquisition, we have $7.6 billion in total liquidity. We have sustained a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2x, maintaining our financial flexibility whilst we continue to reinvest in our business and return cash to our shareholders.  
Yesterday, we declared a second quarter dividend of $0.55, maintaining an industry-leading dividend yield of over 3.5%. Set within our established framework, our second quarter dividend demonstrates our confidence in the strength of both our portfolio and our operating model to generate sustainable, long-term value.  
In June, we published 2 important ESG-focused reports that touched every part of our business and our operations. The first was our 17th Annual Sustainability Report, which continues to provide a transparent and detailed look at our ESG performance, focusing on the issues and metrics that matter most to our stakeholders.  
The second was our first Climate Strategy Report, which focuses on our approach to achieving our science-based climate targets and aligns with the reporting guidelines from the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. These reports outline the key sustainability strategies that are embedded in our business and our culture at Newmont.  
Turning to Slide 5. Newmont is broadly recognized for our robust and disciplined practices when it comes to sustainability reporting, both within our sector and among all corporate reporters. And our long history of taking a leading approach to environmental, social and governance practices has positioned us as the gold sector's recognized sustainability leader.  
Newmont's strong ESG performance creates long-term value for our stakeholders and drive superior business results through delivering safer, more efficient and reliable operations, greater productivity from well-managed resources, the ability to operate effectively in a broad range of jurisdictions, a proactive approach to managing risks and emerging issues and, most importantly, a reputation built on trust-based relationships and a track record of delivering on our commitments.  
Earlier this month, we hosted a webcast to provide an overview of our ESG journey, what we have done well, where we have learned lessons and our plans for continued improvement. If you weren't able to join us, I would invite you to listen to the replay, which is posted on our website.  
Turning now to Slide 6. Newmont is the world's leading gold producer, with an unmatched portfolio of world-class, long-life operations. Among our 12 operating mines and 2 joint ventures, we have 9 world-class assets, each of which delivers more than 500,000 gold equivalent ounces per year, an all-in sustaining costs of less than $900 per ounce and with a mine life exceeding 10 years.  
And we believe that where we choose to operate matters. It's important to note that all of our world-class assets are located in top-tier jurisdictions that we define as countries classified in the A and B ratings ranges by each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch. Newmont has the best portfolio of assets located in the most favorable gold mining jurisdictions that when coupled with the quality of our people and our integrated operating model positions us to generate sustainable returns for decades to come.  
Turning to Slide 7. Our portfolio will produce steady gold production of more than 6 million ounces per year through until at least 2030, balanced across each of our 4 regions. This profile is further enhanced by the production of more than 1 million gold equivalent ounces from silver, lead and zinc at Peñasquito and copper at Boddington and Yanacocha. Combined, we will deliver nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces per year for the next decade, the most of any company in our industry.  
Moving to Slide 8. Our project pipeline is unmatched in the gold industry and is one of the best in the mining industry. There is significant value to unlock as we optimize and advance our longer-term projects and lay the pathway to steady production and cash flow well into the 2040s.  
We continue to advance our midterm projects, including Yanacocha Sulfides, where we are preparing for full funds approval in December of this year. With a multi-decade mine life that provides exposure to gold, copper and silver, the sulfide project generates profitable production and offers additional upside to extend mine life at this cornerstone asset.  
We are also executing the second expansion project at Tanami. Through the development of a 1.6 kilometer deep production shaft and supporting infrastructure, this project supports the site's future as a long-life and low-cost producer, and it also provides a platform for us to further explore a prolific mineral endowment in the Tanami district.  
And as mentioned previously, we are pleased to announce the funding for the development of Ahafo North has been approved, and this project has now advanced into the execution phase.  
Turning to the next slide for some more details. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved full funding for the Ahafo North project, expanding our existing footprint in Ghana and adding more than 3 million ounces of gold production over an initial 13-year mine life.  
Located approximately 30 kilometers north of our existing Ahafo South operations, the Ahafo North project will include 4 open pit mines and the construction of a stand-alone mill to produce approximately 300,000 ounces per year at very attractive forward-sustaining costs. The project is expected to deliver an internal rate of return of over 30% at current gold prices.  
Ahafo North is a significant gold mine by any measure. We have conducted extensive regulatory and community engagements, including meetings with traditional leaders and local government agencies and public forums to ensure that we earn and maintain social acceptance throughout Ahafo North's life cycle. We will work to create lasting value for host communities through enhanced local sourcing and hiring.  
One key aspect of Ahafo North is our workforce planning, which includes a target to achieve gender parity in the workforce when operations begin. We are very excited about progressing Ahafo North and look forward to bringing you updates as we develop this new mine over the next 2 years.  
Turning to Slide 10. The global pandemic has and will continue to challenge all of us for some time to come. And our commitment to protect the health and safety of our workforce and host communities remains our top priority. We believe that the COVID-19 vaccine is critical in combating the spread of the virus. We are encouraging our workforce to get vaccinated as soon as they become eligible, and we are working with our local communities and host governments to improve availability and deployment at all of our managed operations. 
These efforts are supported by our global community support fund, which is seeking to help with vaccine rollout, vaccine education and awareness campaigns. We are seeing some of the highest vaccination rates in the United States and Canada, largely due to the widespread and early availability in these countries. But until the vaccine is available to everyone around the world, our people and operations will continue to be affected by this virus. And recent outbreaks have shown just how difficult this pandemic continues to be, testing our protocols and the resilience of our people and systems.  
The impacts of the pandemic are also driving cost inflation around the globe. We are now expecting cost escalation of around 3% to 5% for materials, energy and labor. And we expect these pressures to continue through to at least the end of next year. We are currently working on our 2022 business plan, ensuring that the higher cost of inflation and the application of our wide-ranging controls and safety protocols are built into our assumptions going forward.  
However, despite the impacts of COVID, we remain in line with our guidance ranges. As a reminder, our guidance ranges are plus or minus 5% from the midpoint we published in December 2020. We are on track to achieve the midpoint to low end for production and the midpoint to high end for costs. Production remains back-half weighted for the year, with approximately 53% expected in the second half of the year.  
As a reminder, our cost guidance assumes a $1,200 gold price. At today's gold prices, you can expect an additional $20 to $30 per ounce for production taxes and royalties.  
As we look ahead towards the second half of this year, we will remain diligent and supportive of vaccination efforts that are so urgently needed around the world. And we encourage everyone to get their vaccine as soon as they are eligible, ensuring that we are all doing our part to end this global pandemic.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob Atkinson for a more detailed look at our global projects and operations. Over to you, Rob."

Turning to Slide 12, I'll give an update on our regional performance, starting with Africa. Our team delivered another strong performance during the second quarter, as higher ore grades from changes in sequencing largely offset more tons mined due to challenges with shovel availability. The site is well positioned to deliver solid production throughout the year, expecting to reach its highest production during the fourth quarter. 
Ahafo continues to be a solid contributor, delivering higher-grade material from our underground operations to offset unplanned mill maintenance and power outages. 
At Subika, we continue to progress the development of our new underground mining method, sublevel shrinkage, and we expect to see steady increases in grade and underground ore tons mined in the second half of the year. 
In addition, we expect to reach higher ore grades from the open pit operations in quarter 3 and 4, positioning Ahafo to deliver a strong finish to 2021. 
And after finalizing the permitting process with the Guinean EPA, our Board of Directors approved full funding of the Ahafo North project earlier this month. Spending will ramp up in the second half of the year and all critical path equipment orders have been placed in support of initial construction activities to ensure timely execution of the project. The development of this prolific ore body will leverage our proven operating model, with the project and resulting mine receiving functional and technical support from our existing world-class Ahafo South operation as we create the next generation of mining in Ghana. 
Turning to Slide 13. Tanami delivered solid results in the second quarter as higher ore grades more than offset unplanned mill maintenance and longer-haul distances from the bottom of the mine. 
In late June, we detected our first positive COVID case at Tanami. Working closely with government representatives and other key stakeholders, we rapidly made the decision to place the site on care and maintenance beginning on June 26 to reduce the spread of the virus and protect the health of our workforce and communities right across Australia. I'd like to thank our team in Australia for the rapid response and courageous decisions during such an extraordinary and dynamic set of circumstances. And I'm proud of the resilience and strength of our workforce as we continue to learn from and manage the impacts and consequences of this virus. 
Although our second quarter was largely unaffected, we are forecasting a 40,000 to 50,000 ounce impact for the remainder of the year as a result of the care and maintenance period.
We began ramping up out of care and maintenance on July 13. And today, Tanami is now operating at 90%. And despite the impacts from COVID, we continue to advance Tanami Expansion 2. During the second quarter, we progressed the hoist structure and our work on the mine shaft, remaining on track to deliver significant ounce, cost and efficiency improvements in the first half of 2024. 
Boddington achieved near-record quarterly mill performance, reaching nearly 11 million tons processed during the second quarter. And we continue to expand the use of the gold industry's first autonomous haul fleet. And today, we are operating 20 trucks in the south pit. And we remain on track to deploy the entire fleet of 36 trucks by the end of quarter 3. The efficiencies from autonomous haulage, coupled with improved performance from the mill, will continue to drive performance at Boddington. 
The improved mill performance helped to offset lower tons mined from ongoing shovel reliability and geotechnical challenges in the south pit, which has the potential to impact our ability to reach as much of the higher grades as we have planned in the second half of the year. 
Turning to Slide 14. Peñasquito delivered another consistent quarter as we continue to execute on our planned full potential enhancements. And the most recent improvements in metal recovery rates will continue to support planned delivery into the future. The work we've done to optimize Peñasquito since we acquired the site in 2019 demonstrates our ability to successfully operate and enhance value at large, complex, open pit mines. The site is well positioned to remain a strong performer throughout 2021 as we continue to realize higher-than-planned tons mined and improved recoveries in the far, out-of-reach plant. 
CC&V delivered lower tons mined due to unplanned fleet maintenance. And the site continued to experience geochemistry challenges during the second quarter, resulting in lower grades and recovery. Mill performance was offset by higher leach pad recoveries, and grade improvements are expected during the second half of the year, helping to partially overcome some of the challenges experienced in the first and second quarter. 
At Porcupine, mill and ongoing equipment maintenance has resulted in lower tons mined and processed during the quarter. As we look towards the second half of the year, we expect underground development and grades will improve. 
And last month, our full potential program identified 20 initiatives at Porcupine, which will deliver efficiency improvements in the coming months. 
As mentioned previously, we continue to closely monitor the impacts from COVID at Musselwhite. In April, we made the decision to temporarily suspend operations for 5 days to reduce the spread of the virus, resulting in mill stoppages, reduced underground development and more personnel at site in late April and early May. We expect that these challenges will persist in the second half of the year, and we are continuing our full potential work at Musselwhite, focused on increasing development rates and driving productivity. 
Eleonore delivered another strong quarter as development rates and mill throughput continued to improve over the prior quarter and prior year, offsetting the impact of lower personnel in site due to COVID. In addition, the site continues to increase the use of tele-remote mucking equipment, which have helped to increase tons mined and drive important improvements to safety and efficiency. Eleonore will continue to be a solid contributor during 2021 as we expect to sustain consistent production from stable tons mined and processed throughout the year. 
Turning to Slide 15. Despite heavy rainfall in the second quarter, Merian remains a strong performer in the South American region. The site continues to utilize an ore blending strategy to optimize mill performance. And during the second quarter, Merian delivered lower throughput as the site focused on processing harder, higher-grade ore. In the second half of the year, Merian will continue to transition from softer saprolite to harder ore, resulting in higher production from improved grades and steady throughput. 
Cerro Negro continues to improve productivity and performance as the site continues to manage through the evolving pandemic. During the second quarter, Cerro Negro delivered higher ore grades. And despite reduced personnel from COVID, the site continues to increase ore tons mined and processed each quarter. Due to the pandemic, Cerro Negro has delivered low development rates over the past year, limiting access to high-grade ore in the late 2021 and into 2022. However, the site is progressing future growth projects such as the development of San Marcos and exploration in the Eastern District. 
Yanacocha has also experienced significant challenges due to the pandemic, impacting productivity through the year. Yet, despite the challenges from the virus, Yanacocha delivered higher grades and recovery from the leach pad in addition to an increase in grade and ore tons mined from the Carachugo open pit. As we look towards the second half of the year, Yanacocha will focus on optimal ore placement and leach pads as the site has transitioned to leach-only operations ahead of the development of Yanacocha Sulfides. 
The Yanacocha Sulfides project has the potential to extend Yanacocha's world-class operations well beyond 2040, adding profitable production from one of the largest and most prolific gold districts in South America for decades to come. And despite potential impacts from the elections in Peru and the impacts of COVID, the project is progressing well. The team is focused on critical path activities, such as advanced engineering and procurement, as we prepare for full funds approval in December of this year. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Nancy on Slide 16."

Turning to Slide 17 for the financial highlights. Newmont delivered strong performance in the second quarter with over $3 billion in revenue, an increase of $700 million from the prior year quarter, driven by higher sales volumes and metal",794,"Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 17 for the financial highlights. 
Newmont delivered strong performance in the second quarter with over $3 billion in revenue, an increase of $700 million from the prior year quarter, driven by higher sales volumes and metal prices; adjusted net income of $670 million or $0.83 per diluted share; adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.6 billion, an increase of over 60% in the prior year quarter; and strong free cash flow of $578 million, also an increase of about 50% from Q2 of 2020. 
Yesterday, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, an increase of $0.30 or 120% over the prior year quarter. With a yield of over 3.5% at our current share price, Newmont is among the top 10% of the S&P's large-cap dividend payers. 
Turning to Slide 18 for a review of our adjusted earnings per share in more detail. Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $640 million or $0.80 per share. Adjustments included $0.03 related to the unrealized mark-to-market gains on equity investments, $0.02 related to reclamation and remediation adjustments at historical mining sites, $0.02 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance and $0.02 of other charges. Taking these adjustments into account, we reported second quarter adjusted net income of $0.83 per diluted share, an increase of almost 160% or $0.51 over the prior year quarter. 
As a reminder, due to our status as a U.S. GAAP filer, our adjustments to net income do not include $19 million of incremental costs incurred this quarter as a result of the COVID pandemic. Adjusting for these costs would have resulted in approximately $0.02 of additional net income per share in the second quarter, and we expect these costs to continue throughout the year as we prioritize the health and safety of our workforce and local communities. 
Turning now to Slide 19. Under our conservative $1,200 gold price assumption, Newmont expects to generate $3.5 billion of attributable free cash flow over a 5-year period. In addition, for every $100 increase in gold prices above our base assumption, Newmont delivers $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year. Newmont is the only company in the gold mining industry with the ability to generate these levels of attributable free cash flow, allowing us to balance steady reinvestment in the business, continue to strengthen our balance sheet and also provide superior shareholder returns to our industry-leading dividend framework and opportunistic share buybacks. 
Turning to Slide 20 for more about our dividend. Our dividend framework provides shareholders with a stable base annualized dividend of $1 per share at a $1,200 gold price, along with the potential to receive 40% to 60% of the incremental attributable free cash flow generated at gold prices above our plan. We will continue to review our dividend each quarter with management and our Board, evaluating our operational and financial performance and outlook semiannually to give us maximum flexibility in determining our dividend within the framework. 
The dividend declared yesterday was consistent with our first quarter dividend, calibrated at an $1,800 gold price assumption and a 40% distribution of incremental free cash flow. Our second quarter dividend demonstrates our confidence in our future outlook and our ability to maintain capital discipline. 
Turning to Slide 21. We continue to drive the business with our clear capital allocation priorities, which include reinvesting in our business through disciplined investments in exploration and organic growth projects, maintaining our financial strength and flexibility and returning cash to shareholders. During the second quarter, we delivered on each of these priorities by progressing our profitable reinvestment in the business, particularly with the execution of the Tanami expansion, the approval of Ahafo North and the advancement of Yanacocha Sulfides; investing in exploration with 55 drill rigs working around the globe; completing the GT Gold transaction in May of this year; maintaining our industry-leading dividend established within our framework to provide stable and predictable returns; repurchasing 2.4 million shares, translating to approximately $150 million of our $1 billion share buyback program; and maintaining a strong balance sheet with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2x, giving us the flexibility to reduce our debt outstanding by $550 million with available cash and still maintain cash balances of $4.6 billion at the end of the quarter. 
We are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results and free cash flow to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation. The progress we made in the first and second quarter enabled Newmont to return over $1 billion to shareholders in the first half of this year while we continue to reinvest in our business and support our operations with a strong and flexible balance sheet. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Tom on Slide 22."

Obviously, the Tanami, that we had that first positive case and you get 2 weeks completely shut down. And it takes a little while to ramp up. And Tanami is now back up at about 90%. So it's 2 weeks plus a few days. 
But the biggest worry we've got in Australia is that each one of the states and territories have got different rules and regulations. And they're not necessarily allowing free travel between the states and the quarantine, and we've obviously got people that work at the different states. So that's a risk, moving forward, that we're carefully watching and carefully managing in Australia. 
But really, in terms of the biggest area which we're still worried about is South America. It's that, by far and away, that's where we've had the biggest impact. Certainly, in Cerro Negro, we've had several key outbreaks and we've had to shut down several times in the second quarter. But vaccines are starting to get through there. And building up in similar, Yanacocha, the vaccines are coming through. 
But it's the absenteeism, Tyler, which is the biggest unpredictable thing that you can sometimes have shovel operators away, you can have mill operators away, and that causes the biggest challenge. But, certainly, with the vaccines in that part of the world, that's certainly very positive for us. 
In terms of Canada, I mentioned about Musselwhite that we had that week in April and May where we had to go into care and maintenance. So that had a significant impact. But again, in each one of the Canadian sites, the level of absenteeism has sometimes been 3 or 4x higher than what we've typically had, and that really impacts the development, et cetera. 
And the key thing that I want to get across is that the sites are actually managing the situation very, very well, but it is the unpredictability of the virus. And that's the challenge we've got. But with the vaccines coming on, we're certainly very hopeful that, that will reduce. But it's a very difficult question to actually put your finger on."

And we will continue to make those decisions and courageous decisions to ensure health and safety above all those.

So it takes into account, on a capital cost, the considerations around current inflation pressures and COVID.

So we are moving into the high-grade ore in the latter part of this year. And Rob talked a bit about the importance of managing some of the geotechnical challenges and some of the equipment reliability challenges. So really important we have that discipline and focus to get to that high-grade ore. So Boddington is a key contributor.

Certainly, as we look to 2022 and update our long-term guidance in December, we're certainly seeing that cost pressure that I was just talking with Greg about. 
And on the development capital side, we have built into the Tanami and we've built into the Ahafo North our understanding of where cost is, and that's accommodated within the outlook we've given for both those projects. 
We are continuing to derisk Yanacocha Sulfides, where we are on a critical path. We are getting -- ensuring we get factory slots and process for some different critical path items, for instance, oxygen plants and the like. So we're making sure we're managing that process ahead of the full funds decision so that when we come out with, hopefully, a full funds decision in December that the -- what we guided to is accommodating some of those capital cost inflationary pressures. 
And then the on the development capital side as we guide, I'd say less the inflationary pressures, more the sequence of those projects as you've got a different COVID impact. So how is the spend profile looking for Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides and at Tanami is more going to be the influence of our development capital number in 2022 versus '23 versus '24."

So we are seeing those pressures heating up market in Canada. 
And very similar in Western Australia, where you've got a very significant boom happening on the back of record iron ore prices. So very high demand, both in the construction of the expansions to -- the expansion of those iron mines to maintain throughput, high demand for operators, maintainers and technical people, so professionals. 
In an environment that Rob was talking about earlier where the state governments, the provincial governments in Australia are constantly opening and closing borders. And so there's a real push on to be employing out of the state, so that you've got that reliability of your staff being within state. And we're likely to have, in Australia, those interstate pressures or still some time to come given their slow take-up of the vaccination, which is certainly they're paying the price for now, with the Delta strain of the virus. 
One of the things that we are doing, which is going to significantly offset the pressure on operators in particular, is the implementation of autonomous haulage at Boddington. And if you think about a fleet of 36 trucks across 4 shifts and then the additional number of people you have to cover shift breaks and annual leave and those sorts of things, you're talking of the order of 180 people that are no longer needed to drive trucks because they're running autonomously, and that takes some pressure out of the system in terms of that labor pressure for operating and maintaining.

I think as you know, mining is a pillar and core -- really a cornerstone for the Peruvian economy. And we've been there for well over 3 decades now. And our relationship with Cajamarca has really improved over the years. Obviously, Yanacocha has a huge presence in Cajamarca, and our community has grown substantially over time. 
There have been challenges, for sure, with regard to delivery of value coming from the central government in the form of taxes as to where that money gets distributed. And over time, they've -- with different administrations, you've seen more or less tons come back into the region. Obviously, we value through extensive employment, local hiring, local content. 
And I would say, honestly, that as hard hit as Peru and Cajamarca have been in this COVID pandemic environment, our relationship has really strengthened during this period of time. In fact, we just had a vaccination clinic opened up in our offices in Cajamarca, and I believe it's the only mining company that's been able to do that in Peru to date. 
So our intention, certainly, is and has been to focus on the value provided to our stakeholders in Cajamarca. Our relationship, not only with the many communities throughout our operation, but also with the regional government continues to strengthen. Our intention would be, throughout this process, to continue to work with them to find ways, especially as we look at moving forward with Sulfides, in maximizing that value. 
Certainly, we want to partner with the central government on determining how to best provide a return of those dollars back into the community. And I'd also encourage you to take a look at our sustainability report on the programs that we have, more broadly in Cajamarca and the efforts we've made and the economic contribution that's occurring."

Before I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. 
Newmont delivered on a challenging third quarter, generating strong free cash flow, continuing to provide industry-leading shareholder returns and investing in profitable projects including our latest, Ahafo North, which was approved by our board in July. This quarterly performance was achieved even as we continue to manage through the evolving complexities of the global pandemic and we remain committed to protecting the health and well-being of our workforce and local communities. 
Throughout the mining sector, we are continuing to see the non-health-related challenges caused by the pandemic including labor shortages, rising input costs and supply chain disruptions. As an industry leader, Newmont is well positioned to respond to these challenges by leveraging our proven operating model and balanced global portfolio to deliver long-term value from our responsibly managed assets. 
Turning to our quarterly results, let's take a look at the highlights. During the third quarter, Newmont produced 1.4 million ounces of gold and 315,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. We generated operating cash flow of $1.1 billion and strong free cash flow of $735 million, of which $715 million is attributable to Newmont. Supported by our clear strategic focus, we continue to apply a disciplined and balanced approach to our capital allocation priorities. With $7.6 billion in total liquidity, we have sustained a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2x, maintaining our financial flexibility whilst we continue to reinvest in our business and return cash to our shareholders. 
Earlier this month, we announced the transition to a fully autonomous haulage fleet at Boddington, an important milestone for both Newmont and the gold industry as a whole. Our fleet of 36 trucks, with improved safety and productivity at this cornerstone asset. We also continue to invest in and develop our most profitable near-term projects, including Tanami Expansion 2, Ahafo North, the change to a more productive underground mining method at Ahafo South and Yanacocha Sulfides. This quarter, we completed nearly $100 million of opportunistic share repurchases at an average price under $56 per share. And we declared a third quarter dividend of $0.55 per share, resulting in a dividend yield of over 4%. 
12 months ago, we announced our industry-leading dividend framework, establishing a clear pathway for stable and predictable returns. Over the last 4 quarters, Newmont has returned more than $2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, demonstrating our confidence in the long-term value of our business and our ability to maintain financial flexibility while steadily reinvesting in our operations. 
At Newmont, we have created a robust and diverse portfolio of operations and projects around the globe. And we believe that we choose to operate matters. Among our 12 operating mines and 2 joint ventures, over 90% of our attributable gold production is from top-tier jurisdictions, which we define as countries classified in the A and B ratings ranges by each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch. Underpinning our asset base is the gold industry's best organic project pipeline of both greenfield and brownfield opportunities, managed through our integrated operating model with a proven track record of delivering value to all of our stakeholders. 
Newmont has maintained an unmatched and industry-leading project pipeline, laying the pathway to steady production and cash flow well into the 2040s. Every one of our operations has near mine exploration opportunities that can leverage our existing infrastructure and extend mine life. With the stability and depth of our brownfield portfolio, we are able to explore in some of the most prospective greenfield districts in the world in a disciplined and deliberate way. 
This quarter, we continued to advance our near-term projects, including the second expansion at Tanami in Australia's Northern Territory. Through the development of a 1.6-kilometer deep production shaft and supporting infrastructure, this project supports the site's future as a long-life and low-cost producer while providing a platform to further explore a prolific mineral endowment in the Tanami district. 
The development of Ahafo North, approved in July, this project expands our existing footprint in Ghana, adding more than 3 million ounces of gold production over an initial 13-year mine life. And the Yanacocha Sulfides project, which will extend mine life at this cornerstone asset for decades to come. Newmont remains committed to the 
Yanacocha Sulfides project, and we'll be investing at least $0.5 billion through 2022 to advance critical path activities, including detailed engineering, long lead procurement, birthworks and the installation of accommodation facilities for the construction workforce. 
As previously announced, given the current status of the pandemic in Peru and the potential for more contagious variants, we have extended our full funds decision for the sulfides project to the second half of 2022 and will progress the project as the pandemic allows. 2 weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit Peru and engage with government leaders and other key stakeholders to talk about a safe and mutually beneficial path forward. I'm encouraged by these interactions and look forward to this next chapter in late Yanacocha's long and profitable history. 
The global pandemic has and will continue to challenge all of us for some time to come. I'd like to take this opportunity to recognize the very significant efforts that are being applied at all of our operations to keep our workforce and local communities safe and healthy. As you can see in this photo, Rob had the opportunity to be at Ghana last quarter and experience firsthand the important work our team is doing to manage through the COVID pandemic with agility and resolve. 
In 2020 and 2021, we have invested more than $2.7 million for COVID relief and local support in Ghana and $1.4 million in health screening and security measures to protect our people and their families. Through our partnership with Ghana Health and Education Services, these investments help to: establish wide-ranging protocols and controls at both Ahafo and Akyem; distribute medical equipment and PPE -- health and safety messages through the local radio programs; and fund radio programs that provide essential lesson plans for students during school closures. We are also focused on supporting the vaccination effort in Ghana and are working with the American Chamber of Commerce in Ghana and Ghana Health Services to secure and deploying nearly 100,000 vaccines in the area. 
At Newmont, we firmly believe that the COVID-19 vaccines are critical in combating the spread of a virus. And until global vaccination rates substantially improves, our people and operations will continue to be effective. We are now deliberately moving towards a position where ultimately, all of our global workforce will be fully vaccinated. -- and we are closely monitoring and -- because we fundamentally believe that the vaccine is a critical part of supporting the recovery from a pandemic around --
Approximately 6 million ounces of gold just below our original guidance range. And we are reaffirming our original guidance of 1.3 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. Combined, the 7.3 million gold equivalent ounces, the most of in company in our industry and an improvement of almost 400,000 ounces compared to last year. 
Updates from our original gold production outlook are largely due to challenges at Boddington, including unusually severe weather and heavy rainfall, shale reliability and operational delays associated with managing bench hygiene as mining moves into deeper sections of the pit. This was combined with the continued ramp-up of the autonomous haulage fleet as the site fine tunes this technology for operation in a deep open pit mine for the first time in the mining industry. As a result, Boddington delivered low expect tonnes than expected, impacting our ability to reach high grades and reducing Boddington's full year gold production estimate by approximately 140,000 ounces. As Rob will discuss later, we remain very confident that the overall efficiencies delivered by autonomous haulage will more than offset any short-term impacts on production at Boddington this year. 
Also at Nevada Gold Mines, we are experiencing the consequences of the challenges noted by our operating partners in their release last week. Carlin and Cortes are expected to be at the low end of their annual guidance ranges, largely due to the impact of the breakdown and repairs to the mill at Carlin Goldstrike roaster, and Turquoise Ridge is now expected to be below its annual guidance range. As a consequence, annual gold production from Nevada Gold Mines is expected to be at the low end of our annual guidance range. 
In addition to this, as I commented earlier, the global pandemic continues to evolve and impact all of our operations. Tanami was placed into care and maintenance in late June and early July, and we are continuing to experience lower productivity as a result of COVID-related absenteeism and the tightening of the labor market in Canada. 
The impact from lower production volumes, coupled with higher mill prices, has also increased costs for the year. For 2021, gold cost applicable to sales are expected to be $790 per ounce. And all-in sustaining costs are expected to be $1,050 per ounce. It's important to note that our original guidance was established using a $1,200 gold price assumption. And we continue to use this assumption for our long-term mine planning and reserve modeling to ensure that we have maintained discipline across all of our operations. 
However, due to the sustained high gold prices throughout this year and in response to feedback from the investor community, we are providing our updated full year cost outlook using an $1,800 gold price assumption. We expect these gold prices to continue through the fourth quarter, adding approximately $50 per ounce to our all-in sustaining costs from inflation, higher royalties and production taxes. 
Finally, we are decreasing our development capital estimate from $850 million to $700 million, with a portion of our spending associated with the second expansion at Tanami moving into 2022 but not impacting project schedule. We are currently working to finalize our business plan for 2022. And today, we have a much better understanding of the impacts from the global pandemic than we did at this time last year. 
Looking ahead to 2022, we anticipate the production of costs at an $1,800 gold price assumption will be similar to this year. Gold production is expected to improve by around 5% compared to 2021 as we continue to manage the impacts from pandemic-related labor shortages on productivity across our operations. CAS and AISC per ounce are expected to be largely in line with 2021 as we're building increased cost from inflation, high metal prices and ongoing COVID-related safety protocols into our assumptions going forward. 
Capital in 2022 remains unchanged from our original outlook as we enter a period of significant reinvestment an important component in growing production, improving margins and extending mine life. These reinvestments back into our business will enable Newmont to steadily increase production and improve costs over time from our portfolio of world-class long-life operations. We look forward to providing you additional detail on our long-term outlook in our annual guidance webcast in early December. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a more detailed look at our global projects and operations. Over to you, Rob."

As Tom mentioned, the pandemic continues to present challenges across our operations and joint ventures, and I am proud of our people who continue to safely deliver day in, day out. While COVID infection rates are declining and vaccination rates are improving near our operations, the knock-on effect from supply chain disruptions and tightening labor markets is creating new complexities to manage. There is increased pressure on input commodity prices such as steel and diesel in addition to unpredictable freight costs and timing of deliveries. 
As an example, diesel costs have increased significantly in recent months, adding $7 per ounce to our all-in sustaining costs compared to the previous quarter and over $15 per ounce compared to the previous year. We are also keeping a close eye and working hard to reduce voluntary attrition rates across our global business. And hard labor markets, particularly in Canada and Australia, are creating an unprecedented labor shortage impacting productivity. These inflation trends may show up in future contract renewals, and we expect that we could start seeing additional impacts as early as the fourth quarter. And while it is difficult to predict whether these trends will persist for the long term, I am confident that our scale, strong partnerships and proven operating model positions Newmont to secure the most competitive supply contracts and limit the impacts on productivity and costs. 
Turning to our regional updates, starting with South America. Merian remains a strong performer in the South American region and is celebrating the fifth anniversary since declaring commercial production in October 2016. The site continues to utilize an ore blending strategy to optimize mill performance, helping to offset unplanned mill maintenance and minor delays from heavy rain at the start of the quarter. Additionally, Merian delivered higher tonnes mined and grade processed and we expect this trend to continue for the remainder of the year and into 2022. 
Cerro Negro continues to improve productivity and performance, significantly increasing tonnes mined and processed in each quarter. The site team is managing the impacts from the pandemic as well as possible. And I am proud of the mitigation efforts, shift change optimization and overall efficiency improvements delivered to help offset disruptions from earlier in the year. Given the effects of the pandemic, the site has delivered lower development rates in 2021, limiting access to higher grade ore and reducing production in the fourth quarter and into 2022. And yet, despite challenges from the virus, the site continues to progress future organic growth projects, including the development of Sanmark cost and the expansion in the Eastern District, which have the potential to extend mine life beyond 2030. 
Yanacocha has also experienced continued challenges from the pandemic impacting productivity mainly due to reduced labor availability. To offset these challenges, the sites implemented mine sequencing changes focusing on higher grades, efficient haul truck routes and optimal ore placement on the leach pads. As a result, Yanacocha should deliver higher grade ore and improved recovery from the leach pads. As discussed in our third quarter 10-Q, we continue to progress detailed study work to further define water management requirements, along with other closure activities, and we will provide an update on this with the fourth quarter results. And as Tom mentioned, we are progressing the Yanacocha sulfides, a project with the potential to extend mine life and this cornerstone asset well beyond 2040. 
Turning to our North American region. At our Canadian operations, Musselwhite, Éléonore and Porcupine, we continue to be impacted by COVID absenteeism and a tightening of the Canadian labor market, and we expect these sites to be at the low end or below our annual production guidance ranges. We expect these labor trends to continue into 2022, with the effects having been particularly impactful at Musselwhite and Éléonore as labor shortages and access to specialized services has resulted in lower tonnes mined and processed than planned. 
Porcupine delivered higher tonnes mined from the Hollinger open pit, helping to balance the impact of higher-than-expected levels of graphite in the oil plant underground, which resulted in drilling delays -- and as a consequence, resulted in less high-grade ore being mined from the underground. I visited our Canadian operations last month, and I'm pleased to report that we are making a lot of positive inroads at Musselwhite, Éléonore and Porcupine to increase development rates through the use of jumbos and [indiscernible] loaders and driving productivity hard through the execution of the suite of our full potential initiatives. With the full support of our subject matter experts deployed to these sites, these initiatives will improve efficiency and production. 
Moving to CC&V. The mine experienced lower grades and recovery in the third quarter. However, higher tonnes mined and changes to mine sequencing during the third quarter are expected to increase leach pad production in the fourth quarter and into 2022. 
And finally, Peñasquito delivered another strong performance in the third quarter due to higher tonnes mined and processed, in addition to strong recovery rates from a number of full potential improvements. Since acquisition, Peñasquito has delivered over $375 million in free cash flow improvements, with more than 80% of this value delivered from mining and processing improvements, which continued to generate value today and will do so well into the future. 
Shifting to Australia. Tanami delivered solid performance in the third quarter as higher grades helped to offset lower tonnes mined and processed as a consequence of the COVID-related care maintenance period in late June and early July. Although this period has reduced the site's full year production by approximately 40,000 ounces, Tanami is fully operational, performing very well and is fully expected to deliver a strong finish to the year. 
In addition, the team further advanced Tanami Expansion II. And during the third quarter, we progressed the construction of the head frame and have now completed nearly 70% of the reaming of the nearly 1-mile deep shaft, remaining on track -- movement in the first half of 2024. 
As Tom mentioned, Boddington experienced heavy rainfall in the third quarter, impacting the ramp-up of autonomous haulage and reducing tonnes mined. I'm pleased to share that Boddington continues to achieve superior mill performance, reaching nearly 11 million tonnes processed during the third quarter. We are also proud to deliver the gold industry's first autonomous haul truck fleet, the first of its kind in our sector. 
I'd like to thank our team and our partners at Caterpillar for their ongoing partnership, dedication and drive as Boddington continues to ramp up the truck fleet to full productivity and to fine-tune the technology for a very productive operation in a deep open pit mine. Delivering this project on time and on budget during a global pandemic is an enormous accomplishment, leveraging Newmont's scale, technical expertise and partnerships to manufacture, deliver, assemble, commission and operate a fleet of 36 autonomous trucks in less than 18 months. As we look ahead, we expect to reach improved grades and achieve higher tonnes mined, due in part to the efficiencies from autonomous haulage, increasing production in the fourth quarter and into 2022. 
And finally, turning to Africa. A team delivered another consistent performance despite very heavy rainfall in the third quarter, as higher throughput and strong recoveries helped to offset unplanned mill and equipment maintenance. The site is well positioned condition to reach higher grades and ever a very strong third quarter. This higher tonne is mined for the Subika open pit and improved mill performance helped to offset challenges with haul truck availability at our underground operation. 
At Subika, we continue to progress the development of our new underground mining method, sublevel shrinkage, and we expect to reach full production by year-end as planned, improving grade and underground tonnes mined. In addition, the team continues to advance the Ahafo North. We have begun mobilizing key personnel, and I am pleased to say that engineering is approximately 80% complete. We continue to engage with local communities and regulators to ensure a mutually beneficial path forward as we develop this prolific orebody and create the next generation of mining and Ghana. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on the next slide."
291795,1683348364,2415871,"Newmont Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rob.

Through the strength of our assets and integrated operating model, Newmont is in the best financial position in its 100-year history -- building long-term value with the most disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation in the industry. Newmont delivered $2.9 billion in revenue at an average realized gold price of $778 per ounce -- diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA of over of $1.3 billion, a decrease from the prior year's quarter due to lower gold prices, lower sales volumes and cost pressures stemming from the global pandemic; and strong free cash flow of $735 million, of which 97% is attributable to Newmont. 
Although quarterly free cash flow is lower than our record performance last year, we achieved a 27% improvement compared to the second quarter. Our unmatched cash flow generation allows Newmont to provide superior shareholder returns, largely through our industry-leading dividend framework. This week, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, an increase of 38% over the prior year and consistent with our last 3 quarters. 
With the yield of approximately 4%, our regular dividend is the highest in the gold industry, placing Newmont among the top 10% of the S&P's large-cap dividend payers. Third quarter GAAP net loss from continuing operations was $8 million or $0.01 per share. Adjustments included $0.46 related to a loss recognized on the pending sale of the Conga mill asset -- currently in care and maintenance in Peru. The sale of these assets reduce the storage costs while we maintain long-term optionality around the future development of the project. Adjustments also include $0.12 -- $0.10 on related to reclamation and remediation and adjustments at historical mining sites, $0.08 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance and $0.01 of other charges. Taking these adjustments into account, we reported a third -- As a reminder, our status as a U.S. GAAP filer, our adjustments to net income do not include $23 million -- pandemic. Adjusting for these costs would have resulted in approximately $0.03 of additional --here as we prioritize the health and safety of our workforce and local community. 
Newmont's dividend framework is based on our unmatched ability to generate attributable free cash flow. For every $100 increase in gold prices above our base assumption of $1,200, Newmont delivers $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year. 
And Newmont is the only company in the gold mining industry with the ability to generate these levels, providing shareholders with a stable base annualized dividend of $1 per share and the potential to receive between 40% and 60% of of the incremental attributable free cash flow generated by a $1,200 gold price. This framework provides stable and predictable industry-leading returns for our shareholders and demonstrates our confidence in our long-term outlook and our ability to maintain capital discipline. 
The third quarter dividend declared was consistent with our second quarter, calibrated at an $1,800 gold price assumption and 40% distribution that incremental free cash flow. And we continue to review our dividend on a quarterly basis with our Board, evaluating our operational and financial performance and outlook over a long period of time. 
Our capital allocation priorities remain clear, to reinvest in our business through exploration in our organic growth projects; to maintain financial strength and optionality on our balance sheet; and to provide industry-leading returns to shareholders. Throughout the year, we delivered on each of these priorities. By progressing our profitable reinvestment in the business, particularly with the advancement of the Tanami Expansion, Ahafo North and -- Yanacocha purchase Sulfide, delivering the first autonomous haulage fleet in the gold mining industry, improving safety and productivity at Boddington; completing the GC Gold transaction in May of this year; returning more than $1.3 billion to shareholders for dividends and nearly $250 million through opportunistic share buybacks; and maintaining a strong balance sheet with $7.6 billion in liquidity and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of [ 0.5 ] to sustain the business across price -- with one of the industry's lowest weighted average cost of debt at 4.3%. 
Our ability to deliver on our disciplined capital allocation priorities, creating long-term value for the business and maintaining our position as the world's leading gold company. And with that, I'll hand it back to Tom to wrap up."

I think -- I don't believe that it will be necessarily some of this near to medium-term cost escalation that will drive consolidation. I think the -- and I believe that the issue around the work that needs to take place for all mining companies to achieve 2030 carbon reduction targets, greenhouse gas reduction targets and ambitions to achieve net zero by 2050, which we're clearly seeing many governments around the world sign up to in order to achieve those targets, you will need scale and you will need life. And over the course of this decade, we will see consolidation driven by that imperative. So I predict climate change will be the driver rather than some near-term COVID-related escalation."

The key challenge behind commissioning the autonomous fleet, and I'll get Rob to provide some more color, was associated with the significant weather that you had in that mine at the time you're trying to commission the trucks. We're through and now got the trust commission and some of those tuning issues in place. And as I said, I'll pass across to Rob to give you some color on how that fleet is performing now that we've had about a month under our belt of fully autonomous operation in that mine, which is one of the factors when you can actually move to fully autonomous and you're not managing the interaction with vehicles that have people inside of them. And as Rob provides you some of -- some detail, it's in the context of the weather has continued in Southwestern Australia. In fact, October was the -- already, and even the end of the month, is already the wettest month since records began in that part of the world. So in that context, I'll get Rob to give you some color on how autonomous haulage is performing."

And just to tell a little bit of the story is that since we initiated 0 injuries, we've now done over 600,000 kilometers. We're up about 21 million tonnes, and we've connected all the machines. So there's an awful lot of good work which is going on. At the start of September, we were around about 53% EU, which is one of the critical metrics of making sure that trucks are utilized as much as possible. We're now up above the 61% over the last week. And we've actually hit shift by shift up around the 68%, 69% EU. We've got to achieve that on a consistent basis. But one of the critical things particularly important for next year is that next year's tonnage is roughly averaging about 135,000 tonnes out of the pit. We've already achieved 160,000 [indiscernible] days. So whilst we've still got things just a hand out and to fine tune, as Tom said, whether it be some road with, whether it's the road conditions as a result of the wet weather, et cetera. We are very pleased about how things are progressing. We've got terrific support from Caterpillar. We've got a number of people from Caterpillar dedicated on the site. So certainly, we think things are progressing well. But the rain played havoc, I'll be honest.

And of course, we had a mine there once upon a time. So we know the ore body, we're going to build a mine there once a kind of time to another ore body very well. The -- it's really the mill that we sold. We've been spending $2.5 million or thereabouts every year for care and maintenance to keep the mill and all its bits and pieces in good condition. It's a very large mill. In fact, at the time, it was the largest mill in the world. And so it's quite unique in terms of who could buy that piece of equipment and use it. So when we had an approach from somebody to buy that equipment because they had a place to sell it, then you take the opportunity to fill that mill. So the timing really came from someone coming to knock on our door to say, we're interested in taking that mill off your hands. We save the care and maintenance cost. And in any future development of Congo, which is still some time off, the flow sheet will be very, very different. It wouldn't involve a flow sheet with a very large mill.

Australia is just about through the worst of all the constraints they've had around COVID restrictions, hot labor market. So it's more a cost issue, an autonomous haulage system running at Boddington, which is the largest area for labor at Boddington.  If you didn't have autonomous old trucks, we've just mitigated that area with that fleet. So that production number underpinned by those 2 big assets in Australia, very confident. The half to South in Ghana, underground mining method coming on stream as we speak. It's set up for a very solid year, very  much rolling out the vaccines now. In Ghana, as I mentioned in my comments, 100,000 vaccines that we're looking to distribute not only to our workforce, but their families and the communities in mice work. Peñasquito, as I just mentioned into Danielle's question, it is really hitting its straps and running well. That is the engine room of Newmont. And then Nevada Gold Mines. Carlin, Cortez and Turquoise Ridge fully expect that those 3 big world-class assets, along with Pueblo Viejo will continue to deliver on their commitments. 
A little color on Pueblo Viejo. We had a few of our team down there in the last couple of weeks. Their vaccination rates are essentially 100%. So the ability for that operation in the Dominican Republic to continue to run and run well. So Newmont will deliver on its production outlook if those assets that I mentioned, deliver on their commitments, and I'm confident that those assets work. In terms of -- sorry, in terms of 2023, you will have an impact in -- over is going to be with us for a while. So you will have an impact where we had a couple of years, we haven't been able to do the development rates that you would have ideally liked to as you're managing health and safety and all the other controls. So that will have a flow on throughput loan impact through 2022 and 2023 as well as some of the delays on our development capital spend and we can get some of the ounces flowing through from those projects. So I think you'll see a COVID-related impact on '22 and '23. So fairly flat. And then you'll get some benefits coming more in the '24 and '25. So a little bit of delay as a result of both COVID impacts both operating and what you're doing to develop in your minds as well as your development growth capital spend."

Before I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. 
Newmont delivered on a challenging third quarter, generating strong free cash flow, continuing to provide industry-leading shareholder returns and investing in profitable projects including our latest, Ahafo North, which was approved by our board in July. This quarterly performance was achieved even as we continue to manage through the evolving complexities of the global pandemic and we remain committed to protecting the health and well-being of our workforce and local communities. 
Throughout the mining sector, we are continuing to see the non-health-related challenges caused by the pandemic including labor shortages, rising input costs and supply chain disruptions. As an industry leader, Newmont is well positioned to respond to these challenges by leveraging our proven operating model and balanced global portfolio to deliver long-term value from our responsibly managed assets. 
Turning to our quarterly results, let's take a look at the highlights. During the third quarter, Newmont produced 1.4 million ounces of gold and 315,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. We generated operating cash flow of $1.1 billion and strong free cash flow of $735 million, of which $715 million is attributable to Newmont. 
Supported by our clear strategic focus, we continue to apply a disciplined and balanced approach to our capital allocation priorities. With $7.6 billion in total liquidity, we have sustained a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2x, maintaining our financial flexibility whilst we continue to reinvest in our business and return cash to our shareholders. 
Earlier this month, we announced the transition to a fully autonomous haulage fleet at Boddington, an important milestone for both Newmont and the gold industry as a whole. Our fleet of 36 trucks, with improved safety and productivity at this cornerstone asset. We also continue to invest in and develop our most profitable near-term projects, including Tanami Expansion 2, Ahafo North, the change to a more productive underground mining method at Ahafo South and Yanacocha Sulfides. This quarter, we completed nearly $100 million of opportunistic share repurchases at an average price under $56 per share. And we declared a third quarter dividend of $0.55 per share, resulting in a dividend yield of over 4%. 
12 months ago, we announced our industry-leading dividend framework, establishing a clear pathway for stable and predictable returns. Over the last 4 quarters, Newmont has returned more than $2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, demonstrating our confidence in the long-term value of our business and our ability to maintain financial flexibility while steadily reinvesting in our operations. 
At Newmont, we have created a robust and diverse portfolio of operations and projects around the globe, and we believe that we [ rechoose ] to operate matters. Among our 12 operating mines and 2 joint ventures, over 90% of our attributable gold production is from top-tier jurisdictions, which we define as countries classified in the A and B ratings ranges by each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch. 
Underpinning our asset base is the gold industry's best organic project pipeline of both greenfield and brownfield opportunities, managed through our integrated operating model with a proven track record of delivering value to all of our stakeholders. 
Newmont has maintained an unmatched and industry-leading project pipeline, laying the pathway to steady production and cash flow well into the 2040s. Every one of our operations has near mine exploration opportunities that can leverage our existing infrastructure and extend mine life. With the stability and depth of our brownfield portfolio, we are able to explore in some of the most prospective greenfield districts in the world in a disciplined and deliberate way. 
This quarter, we've continued to advance our near-term projects, including the second expansion at Tanami in Australia's Northern Territory. Through the development of a 1.6-kilometer deep production shaft and supporting infrastructure, this project supports the site's future as a long-life and low-cost producer while providing a platform to further explore a prolific mineral endowment in the Tanami district. 
The development of Ahafo North, approved in July, this project expands our existing footprint in Ghana, adding more than 3 million ounces of gold production over an initial 13-year mine life. And the Yanacocha Sulfides project, which will extend mine life at this cornerstone asset for decades to come. 
Newmont remains committed to the Yanacocha Sulfides project, and we'll be investing at least $0.5 billion through 2022 to advance critical path activities, including detailed engineering, long lead procurement, earthworks and the installation of accommodation facilities for the construction workforce. 
As previously announced, given the current status of the pandemic in Peru and the potential for more contagious variants, we have extended our full funds decision for the sulfides project to the second half of 2022 and will progress the project as the pandemic allows. 
2 weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit Peru and engage with government leaders and other key stakeholders to talk about a safe and mutually beneficial path forward. I'm encouraged by these interactions and look forward to this next chapter, [ and let ] Yanacocha's long and profitable history. 
The global pandemic has and will continue to challenge all of us for some time to come. I'd like to take this opportunity to recognize the very significant efforts that are being applied at all of our operations to keep our workforce and local communities safe and healthy. 
As you can see in this photo, Rob had the opportunity to be at Ghana last quarter and experience firsthand the important work our team is doing to manage through the COVID pandemic with agility and resolve. 
In 2020 and 2021, Newmont has invested more than $2.7 million for COVID relief and local support in Ghana and $1.4 million in health screening and security measures to protect our people and their families. Through our partnership with Ghana Health and Education Services, these investments helped to: establish wide-ranging protocols and controls at both Ahafo and Akyem; distribute medical equipment and PPE at our mines, nearby health facilities and other regional institutions. 
To purchase PCR machines for effective safety and in research, to donate cold storage units, for temperature monitoring and vaccine storage. To raise awareness and share important health and safety messages through the local radio programs; and fundraiser programs that provide essential lesson plans for students during school closures. 
We are also focused on supporting the vaccination effort in Ghana and are working with the American Chamber of Commerce in Ghana and Ghana Health Services to secure and deploy nearly 100,000 vaccines in the area. 
At Newmont, we firmly believe that the COVID-19 vaccines are critical in combating the spread of a virus. And until global vaccination rates substantially improve, our people and operations will continue to be effective. We are now deliberately moving towards a position where ultimately, all of our global workforce will be fully vaccinated and we are closely monitoring and adhering the national vaccination mandates already in places. We are taking this important step because we fundamentally believe that the vaccine is a critical part of supporting the recovery from a pandemic around the world. 
Since March of last year our focus has been on operating responsibly and efficiently, while protecting the health of safety of our workforce and local communities from these boroughs. Since the government imposed restrictions on movement and the ongoing application of COVID-related protocols, in addition to competitive labor markets in Canada and Australia, we continue to experience productivity impacts at many of our sites. 
Due to these impacts and some unexpected equipment reliability and weather related challenges, we have decided to update our full year 2021 guidance. We now expect to produce approximately 6 million ounces of gold just below our original guidance range. And we are reaffirming our original guidance of 1.3 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. Combined, the 7.3 million gold equivalent ounces, the most of in company in our industry and an improvement of almost 400,000 ounces compared to last year. 
Updates from our original gold production outlook are largely due to challenges at Boddington, including unusually severe weather and heavy rainfall, shovel reliability and operational delays associated with managing bench hygiene as mining moves into deeper sections of the pit. This was combined with the continued ramp-up of the autonomous haulage fleet as the site fine tunes this technology for operation in a deep open pit mine for the first time in the mining industry. 
As a result, Boddington delivered lower tonnes than expected, impacting our ability to reach high grades and reducing Boddington's full year gold production estimate by approximately 140,000 ounces. As Rob will discuss later, we remain very confident that the overall efficiencies delivered by autonomous haulage will more than offset any short-term impacts on production at Boddington this year. 
Also at Nevada Gold Mines, we are experiencing the consequences of the challenges noted by our operating partners in their release last week. Carlin and Cortez are expected to be at the low end of their annual guidance ranges, largely due to the impact of the breakdown and repairs to the mill at Carlin's Goldstrike roaster, and Turquoise Ridge is now expected to be below its annual guidance range. As a consequence, annual gold production from Nevada Gold Mines is expected to be at the low end of our annual guidance range. 
In addition to this, as I commented earlier, the global pandemic continues to evolve and impact all of our operations. Tanami was placed into care and maintenance in late June and early July, and we are continuing to experience lower productivity as a result of COVID-related absenteeism and the tightening of the labor market in Canada. 
The impact from lower production volumes, coupled with higher mill prices, has also increased costs for the year. For 2021, gold cost applicable to sales are expected to be $790 per ounce. And all-in sustaining costs are expected to be $1,050 per ounce. It's important to note that our original guidance was established using a $1,200 gold price assumption. And we continue to use this assumption for our long-term mine planning and reserve modeling to ensure that we would maintain discipline across all of our operations. 
However, due to the sustained higher gold prices throughout this year and in response to feedback from the investor community, we are providing our updated full year cost outlook using an $1,800 gold price assumption. We expect these gold prices to continue through the fourth quarter, adding approximately $50 per ounce to our all-in sustaining costs from inflation, higher royalties and production taxes. 
Finally, we are decreasing our development capital estimate from $850 million to $700 million, with a portion of our spending associated with the second expansion at Tanami moving into 2022 but not impacting project schedule. We are currently working to finalize our business plan for 2022. And today, we have a much better understanding of the impacts from the global pandemic than we did at this time last year. 
Looking ahead to 2022, we anticipate the production of costs at an $1,800 gold price assumption will be similar to this year. Gold production is expected to improve by around 5% compared to 2021 as we continue to manage the impacts from pandemic-related labor shortages on productivity across our operations. 
CAS and AISC per ounce are expected to be largely in line with 2021 as we're building increased cost from inflation, high metal prices and ongoing COVID-related safety protocols into our assumptions going forward. 
Capital in 2022 remains unchanged from our original outlook as we enter a period of significant reinvestment an important component in growing production, improving margins and extending mine life. These reinvestments back into our business will enable Newmont to steadily increase production and improve costs over time from our portfolio of world-class long-life operations. 
We look forward to providing you additional detail on our long-term outlook in our annual guidance webcast in early December. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a more detailed look at our global projects and operations. Over to you, Rob."

As Tom mentioned, the pandemic continues to present challenges across our operations and joint ventures, and I am proud of our people who continue to safely deliver day in, day out. While COVID infection rates are declining and vaccination rates are improving near our operations, the knock-on effect from supply chain disruptions and tightening labor markets is creating new complexities to manage. There is increased pressure on input commodity prices such as steel and diesel in addition to unpredictable freight costs and timing of deliveries. 
As an example, diesel costs have increased significantly in recent months, adding $7 per ounce to our all-in sustaining costs compared to the previous quarter and over $15 per ounce compared to the previous year. We are also keeping a close eye and working hard to reduce voluntary attrition rates across our global business. And hard labor markets, particularly in Canada and Australia, are creating an unprecedented labor shortage impacting productivity. 
These inflation trends may show up in future contract renewals, and we expect that we could start seeing additional impacts as early as the fourth quarter. And while it is difficult to predict whether these trends will persist for the long term, I am confident that our scale, strong partnerships and proven operating model positions Newmont to secure the most competitive supply contracts and limit the impacts on productivity and costs. 
Turning to our regional updates, starting with South America. Merian remains a strong performer in the South American region and is celebrating the fifth anniversary since declaring commercial production in October 2016. The site continues to utilize an ore blending strategy to optimize mill performance, helping to offset unplanned mill maintenance and minor delays from heavy rain at the start of the quarter. Additionally, Merian delivered higher tonnes mined and grade processed and we expect this trend to continue for the remainder of the year and into 2022. 
Cerro Negro continues to improve productivity and performance, significantly increasing tonnes mined and processed in each quarter. The site team is managing the impacts from the pandemic as well as possible. And I am proud of the mitigation efforts, shift change optimization and overall efficiency improvements delivered to help offset disruptions from earlier in the year. 
Given the effects of the pandemic, the site has delivered lower development rates in 2021, limiting access to higher grade ore and reducing production in the fourth quarter and into 2022. And yet, despite challenges from the virus, the site continues to progress future organic growth projects, including the development of San Marcos and the expansion in the Eastern District, which have the potential to extend mine life beyond 2030. 
Yanacocha has also experienced continued challenges from the pandemic impacting productivity mainly due to reduced labor availability. To offset these challenges, the sites implemented mine sequencing changes focusing on higher grades, efficient haul truck routes and optimal ore placement on the leach pads. As a result, Yanacocha should delivered higher grade ore and improved recovery from the leach pads. 
As discussed in our third quarter 2Q, we continue to progress detailed study work to further define water management requirements, along with other closure activities, and we will provide an update on this with the fourth quarter results. And as Tom mentioned, we are progressing the Yanacocha Sulfides, a project with the potential to extend mine life at this cornerstone asset well beyond 2040. 
Turning to our North American region. At our Canadian operations, Musselwhite and Éléonore and Porcupine, we continue to be impacted by COVID absenteeism and a tightening of the Canadian labor market, and we expect these sites to be at the low end or below our annual production guidance ranges. We expect these labor trends to continue into 2022, with the effects having been particularly impactful at Musselwhite and Éléonore as labor shortages and access to specialized services has resulted in lower tonnes mined and processed and planned. 
Porcupine delivered higher tonnes mined from the Hollinger open pit, helping to balance the impact of higher-than-expected levels of graphite in the oil plant underground, which resulted in drilling delays -- and as a consequence, resulted in less high-grade ore being mined from the underground. 
I visited our Canadian operations last month, and I'm pleased to report that we are making a lot of positive inroads at Musselwhite, Éléonore and Porcupine to increase development rates through the use of jumbos and telly remote loaders and driving productivity hard through the execution of the suite of our full potential initiatives.  With the full support of our subject matter experts deployed to these sites, these initiatives will improve efficiency and production. 
Moving to CC&V. The mine experienced lower grades and recovery in the third quarter. However, higher tonnes mined and changes to mine sequencing during the third quarter are expected to increase leach pad production in the fourth quarter and into 2022. 
And finally, Peñasquito delivered another strong performance in the third quarter due to higher tonnes mined and processed, in addition to strong recovery rates from a number of full potential improvements. Since acquisition, Peñasquito has delivered over $375 million in free cash flow improvements, with more than 80% of this value delivered from mining and processing improvements, which continued to generate value today and will do so well into the future. 
Shifting to Australia. Tanami delivered solid performance in the third quarter as higher grades helped to offset lower tonnes mined and processed as a consequence of the COVID-related care maintenance period in late June and early July. Although this period has reduced the site's full year production by approximately 40,000 ounces, Tanami is fully operational, performing very well and is fully expected to deliver a strong finish to the year. 
In addition, the team further advanced Tanami Expansion II. And during the third quarter, we progressed the construction of the head frame and have now completed nearly 70% of the reaming of the nearly 1-mile deep shaft, remaining on track to deliver significant ounce, cost and efficiency improvements in the first half of 2024. 
As Tom mentioned, Boddington experienced heavy rainfall in the third quarter, impacting the ramp-up of autonomous haulage and reducing tonnes mined. I'm pleased to share that Boddington continues to achieve superior mill performance, reaching nearly 11 million tonnes processed during the third quarter. We are also proud to deliver the gold industry's first autonomous haul truck fleet, the first of its kind in our sector. 
I'd like to thank our team and our partners at Caterpillar for their ongoing partnership, dedication and drive as Boddington continues to ramp up the truck fleet to full productivity and to fine-tune the technology for a very productive operation in a deep open pit mine. 
Delivering this project on time and on budget during a global pandemic is an enormous accomplishment, leveraging Newmont's scale, technical expertise and partnerships to manufacture, deliver, assemble, commission and operate a fleet of 36 autonomous trucks in less than 18 months. As we look ahead, we expect to reach improved grades and achieve higher tonnes mined, due in part to the efficiencies from autonomous haulage, increasing production in the fourth quarter and into 2022. 
And finally, turning to Africa. A team delivered another consistent performance despite very heavy rainfall in the third quarter, as higher throughput and strong recoveries helped to offset unplanned mill and equipment maintenance. The site is well positioned to reach higher grades and deliver its highest production of the year during the fourth quarter. 
Ahafo delivered a very strong third quarter. This higher tonnage mined for the Subika open pit and improved mill performance helped to offset challenges with haul truck availability at our underground operation. At Subika, we continue to progress the development of our new underground mining method, sublevel shrinkage, and we expect to reach full production by year-end as planned, improving grade and underground tonnes mined. 
In addition, the team continues to advance the Ahafo North. We have begun mobilizing key personnel, and I am pleased to say that engineering is approximately 80% complete. We continue to engage with local communities and regulators to ensure a mutually beneficial path forward as we develop this prolific orebody and create the next generation of mining and Ghana. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on the next slide."
291795,1683348364,2416975,"Newmont Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rob. Through the strength of our assets and integrated operating model, Newmont is in the best financial position in its 100-year history, building long-term value with the most disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation in the indust",781,"Thanks, Rob. Through the strength of our assets and integrated operating model, Newmont is in the best financial position in its 100-year history, building long-term value with the most disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation in the industry. 
Let's take a lot to financial highlights. In the third quarter, Newmont delivered $2.9 billion in revenue at an average realized gold price of $778 per ounce -- diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA of over of $1.3 billion, a decrease from the prior year's quarter due to lower gold prices, lower sales volumes and cost pressures stemming from the global pandemic; and strong free cash flow of $735 million, of which 97% is attributable to Newmont. 
Although quarterly free cash flow is lower than our record performance last year, we achieved a 27% improvement compared to the second quarter. Our unmatched cash flow generation allows Newmont to provide superior shareholder returns, largely through our industry-leading dividend framework. This week, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, an increase of 38% over the prior year and consistent with our last 3 quarters. 
With the yield of approximately 4%, our regular dividend is the highest in the gold industry, placing Newmont among the top 10% of the S&P's large-cap dividend payers. Third quarter GAAP net loss from continuing operations was $8 million or $0.01 per share. Adjustments included $0.46 related to a loss recognized on the pending sale of the Conga mill assets, currently in care and maintenance in Peru. 
The sale of these assets reduce the storage costs while we maintain long-term optionality around the future development of the project. Adjustments also include $0.12, unrealized mark-to-market losses on equity investments, $0.10 related to reclamation and remediation adjustments at historical mining sites, $0.08 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance and $0.01 of other charges. 
Taking these adjustments into account, we reported a third quarter adjusted net income of $0.60 per diluted share. As a reminder, Newmont's status as a U.S. GAAP filer, our adjustments to net income do not include $23 million of incremental costs incurred this quarter as a result of the cause of pandemic. 
Adjusting for these costs would have resulted in approximately $0.03 of additional net income per share and we expect these costs to continue throughout the year as we prioritize the health and safety of our workforce and local community. 
Newmont's dividend framework is based on our unmatched ability to generate attributable free cash flow. For every $100 increase in gold prices above our base assumption of $1,200, Newmont delivers $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year. 
And Newmont is the only company in the gold mining industry with the ability to generate these levels of attributable free cash flow. As Tom mentioned, we announced our dividend framework 1 year ago, providing shareholders with a stable base annualized dividend of $1 per share and the potential to receive between 40% and 60% of the incremental attributable free cash flow generated above $1,200 gold price. 
This framework provides stable and predictable industry-leading returns for our shareholders and demonstrates our confidence in our long-term outlook and our ability to maintain capital discipline. The third quarter dividend declared was consistent with our second quarter, calibrated at an $1,800 gold price assumption and 40% distribution and incremental free cash flow. 
And we continue to review our dividend on a quarterly basis with our Board, evaluating our operational and financial performance and outlook over a long period of time. Our capital allocation priorities remain clear: to reinvest in our business through exploration and organic growth projects to maintain financial strength and optionality on our balance sheet and to provide industry-leading returns to shareholders. Throughout the year, we delivered on each of these priorities. 
By progressing our profitable reinvestment in the business, particularly with the advancement of the Tanami expansion, Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides. Delivering the first autonomous haulage fleet in the gold mining industry, improving safety and productivity at Boddington, completing the GT Gold transaction in May of this year, returning more than $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and nearly $250 million through opportunistic share buybacks, and maintaining a strong balance sheet with $7.6 billion in liquidity and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2x, preserving Newmont's financial strength and flexibility to sustain the business across price [indiscernible] with one of the industry's lowest weighted average cost of debt at 4.3%. 
As we look ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our disciplined capital allocation priorities, creating long-term value for the business and maintaining our position as the world's leading gold company. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Tom to wrap up."

So 2022 is, I think, going to be for the mining industry, a cost escalation story. We've got pretty consistent, little, an improvement on production. So there's certainly a cost escalation story. 
We're seeing it still upwards of around 5% when you aggregate it all together across materials, energy and labor, but we are seeing some pretty significant movements within that aggregated number. In fact, in some instances, we're seeing some improved costs, adversely in Australia, cat parts, Caterpillar parts are coming in cheaper as a consequence of exchange rates and the like. 
But we are seeing some significant trends, as I say, at this stage, aggregated at around the 5% mark. I might get, Rob -- if you want to add any color to that? And then, Dean, if you can build on them."

Each -- they've got a suite of projects, which not only assist productivity, but it's also about cost reduction. And the big movers that we're focused on is things at Peñasquito, including the recovery, which we're seeing significant benefits as a result of that. 
In the Canadian sites, we've moved across to jumbo rigs instead McClean bolters and telly remote loaders, which is improving our productivity significantly. And even doing more of the basics at Cerro Negro, where we've reduced further equipment, we took a further 15 pieces of HME [indiscernible] in the third quarter to make sure that we're running that fleet as efficiently as possible and as such, just managing the consumables that we do need. 
But the full potential is the way in which we're managing. But Dean, do you want to stop that inflation?"

And -- but we do unpack that a bit, freight makes up about 2.5% to 5% of all of our landed costs for major consumables. So you need to keep that in perspective. But one of the things we're doing to mitigate that is we're looking for opportunities, using the ability of our global supply chain, looking at our operations in a global sense, seeing what we can do to maximize the amount of freight we put on either ships or containers, so we get the best pricing possible. 
The other thing that we do along the lines of mitigation is we actually put in place pricing mechanism that are transparent, and they're really based on -- largely on the input pricing of a lot of the commodities that we have. And so that helps to actually soften the impact of inflation that we see."

The elevated gold prices, I think, probably hold off a lot of that consolidation. I think I don't believe that it will be necessarily some of this near to medium-term cost escalation that will drive consolidation. I think the -- and I believe that the issue around the work that needs to take place for all mining companies to achieve 2030 carbon reduction targets, greenhouse gas reduction targets and ambitions to achieve net 0 by 2050, which we're clearly seeing many governments around the world sign up to in order to achieve those targets, you will need scale and you need [ life ]. 
And over the course of this decade, we will see consolidation driven by that imperative. So I predict climate change will be the driver rather than some near-term COVID related escalation."

And as I said, I'll pass across to Rob, to give you some color on how that fleet is performing now that we've had about a month under our belt of fully autonomous operation in that mine, which is one of the factors when you can actually move to fully autonomous, and you're not managing the interaction with vehicles that have people inside of them.

And just to tell a little bit of the story is that since we initiated 0 injuries, we've now done over 600,000 kilometers. We're up about 21 million tonnes, and we've connected all the machines. So there's an awful lot of good work, which is going on. 
At the start of September, we were round about 53% EU, which is one of the critical metrics of making sure that trucks are utilized as much as possible. We're now up above the 61% over the last week, and we've actually hit shift by shift up around the 60%, 69% TEU. Now we've got to achieve that on a consistent basis. 
But one of the critical things, particularly important for next year is that next year's tonnage is roughly averaging about 135,000 tonnes out of the pit. We've already achieved 160,000 [indiscernible]. So whilst we've still got things just a high note and to fine tune, as Tom said, whether it be some road widths, whether it's the road conditions as a result of the wet weather, et cetera. We are very pleased about how things are progressing. 
We've got terrific support from Caterpillar. We've got a number of people from Caterpillar dedicated on the site. So certainly, we think things are progressing well, but the rain plays havoc, I'll be honest. But in terms of the commissioning, we've still got to remember, it's been the quickest commission of any EHS system that's being achieved to date.

But the cost improvement is still coming at Newmont because it's associated with the reinvestment we're making back in our business. So we'll continue to see improvements out of Boddington with autonomous haulage as it's now being commissioned, as Rob was just talking about how you can tune a very predictable autonomous system because of the automation now of the fleet. 
We'll see improvements from the commissioning of the shaft at Tanami. We can bring ore at surface much more efficiently. The underground mining method at Subika, the near-mine Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides, all investments that we're making that will deliver improved costs over the guidance to 5 plus year period. 
What we're seeing, so those investments being made, so improvement in costs will come to those investments because we'll be delivering and producing ounces at much better margins. What we're seeing as a consequence of COVID, is those key -- those 3 key development projects, Tanami 2, Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides have been delayed and sitting on top of each other, some more. 
So we will see through '22 significant development capital spend. In fact, it will be development capital spend that we haven't executed at Newmont in a generation. So it's a significant reinvestment in our business, and we really start to see the benefit from that investment later part of '23, into '24, '25, '26 and '27 with some of those projects.

And the second question is, as we are seeing these inflationary pressures come through the cost structures, are we looking at you adjusting gold prices for your reserves and resources next year? 
And also given the higher gold price, can we see you have a higher gold price for guidance for cost for next year?"

So we -- strategic mine planning and our conversion of reserves to resources not change to the $1,200. 
And yes, we will provide you cost guidance next year at the $1,800 gold price assumption. And as I commented in my -- in the script, our all-in sustaining costs next year, assuming gold is at $1,800 is going to be pretty much the same number that you're seeing for this year as we start to pull together our plan. There's still a few moving parts. 
Nevada Gold line is still to come in, but everything is direction according to similar levels to this year at $1,800 gold price. Drivers become more cost than production drivers as they have been for this year. And our gold production is sitting up around 5% more than this year. So if you want to put a pin at a number, it's probably going to be around 6.2 million ounces for next year. 
We will continue to provide a view of all-in sustaining cost at $1,200 gold revenue price. So we'll continue to provide that as a reference point in our guidance, but we will give you the $1,800 -- we'll assume $1,800 flat for the 5 years that we guide to and show you that cost profile.

Australia is just about through the worst of all the constraints they've had around COVID restrictions, hot label market, so it's more a cost issue, a autonomous haul had just in running at Boddington, which is the largest area for labor at Boddington.
If you didn't have autonomous all trucks, we've just mitigated that area with that fleet. So that production number underpinned by those 2 big assets in Australia, very confident. Ahafo South in Ghana, underground mining method coming on stream as we speak. It's set up for a very solid year, very much rolling out the vaccines now in Ghana, as I mentioned in my comments, 100,000 vaccines that we're looking to distribute not only to our workforce, but their families and the communities in which we live and work. 
Peñasquito, as I just mentioned to Danielle's question, it is really hitting its straps and running well. That is the engine room of Newmont. And then Nevada gold mines. Carlin, Cortez and Turquoise Ridge, fully expect that those 3 big world-class assets, along with Pueblo Viejo, will continue to deliver on their commitments. 
A little color on Pueblo Viejo, we had a few of our team down there in the last couple of weeks. Their vaccination rates are essentially 100%. So the ability for that operation, the Dominican Republic to continue to run and run well. So Newmont will deliver on its production outlook. If those assets that I mentioned deliver on their commitments, and I'm confident that those assets will.
 In terms of 2023 -- sorry, in term to 2023, you will have an impact in -- COVID is going to be with us for a while. So you will have an impact where we've had a couple of years where you haven't been able to do the development rates that you would have ideally liked to as you're managing health and safety and all the other controls. So that will have a flow on throughput -- flow on impact through 2022 and 2023, as well as some of the delays on our development capital spend, and we need get some of the ounces flowing through from those projects. 
So I think you'll see a COVID related impact on '22 and '23. So fairly flat, and then you'll get some benefits coming more in the 24 and 25. So a little bit of delay as a result of both COVID and COVID impacts both operating and what you're doing to develop in your mines as well as your development key growth capital spend."

And on the inflation topic, you said, I think on the last call that you expected that the inflation of the 5-ish percent to run through at least the end of next year. I'm just wondering, based on your experience in previous cycles, how long have these inflation cycles typically lasted? 
And what do you expect -- I mean, at what point consequently would you expect this inflation to start to abate? Is it just a situation of high prices of a cure for high prices and eventually, these high prices are going to choke off some economic growth? Or how are you thinking along those lines?"

I think the world is in uncharted territory in terms of this inflation. So I see -- I don't believe it's structural. I believe it will be cyclical, but I think it will be a longer cycle than normal, and COVID is going to dictate that cycle. 
So certainly seeing all the indicators or so we're going to have elevated pricing, and that's going to be with us through 2022. And I'd say too early to predict to see whether that cycle then comes down again in 23 or stays there. We'll -- we'll put a lot of attention into our 2022 cost guidance to include inflation. 
And then typically, we don't tend to try and predict that far out into the future with our cost numbers. So we would talk to our 23 and beyond numbers and not fully having accommodated inflation we just built in the next year, but very hard to predict that."
